                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DAVID FLEMING</hi>. I am a marble mason, and live at 19, New Church Court, Strand—on the night of 24th November, about 9. 15, I was in White Horse Yard, and the two prisoners came up to me; Kelly, when he got within arm's reach of me, hit me a violent blow under the right eye, and knocked me down, and while I was lying down they kicked me on my chest and arms, and took my chain from me—I seized my watch, and McAuliffe caught hold of me, took my chain away, and tore my coat right up to the elbow—they both got up and ran away—I followed, and caught Kelly at the top of White Horse Yard, the entrance to Drury Lane—my wife was at the corner, but I did not know she was there until I was down and heard a voice—I held Kelly, and he threw me in the gutter and punched me right and left—I held him till the police came up—I gave him in charge for assaulting me, and robbing me of my chain—I went to the station, and McAuliffe followed—I asked the inspector if he would search McAuliffe, he said he could not do that as he was not in custody—I was bleeding then from the eye, and was bruised about my body, and not altogether in my right senses, or I should certainly have stated a charge against McAuliffe—the value of the chain was 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have my watch still—I am quite sure I had the watch that night—I produced it at the station—I was perfectly sober—I did not walk up White Horse Yard arm-in-arm with Kelly—I was present when my wife was examined at the Police Court—I never heard her state that—she stated that she was at the corner of White Horse Yard, speaking to a man, when she saw me holding Kelly by the neck, and crying out I had lost my watch and chain—there was no fight at all, Kelly struggled to get away, and I kept hold of him—we were on the ground together when the police<lb></lb>man came up—I did not hear it stated to the policeman that it was a drunken fight—I first charged Kelly with assaulting me and robbing me of my chain—I had made the charge about three minutes when McAuliffe came in—I said to the inspector "That man could tell you the way I have been abused as well as I can myself," and I pointed to McAuliffe—I said "He ought to be where the other man is"—I don't remember Mc. Aucliffe saying that I had got what I deserved—I did not hear him make any reply at all—McAuliffe said "They ought both of them to be locked up for fighting," and I said "After a man has been knocked down and robbed, do,</p>

               <p>you want to make a fight of it?"—when I called upon the inspector to have him searched the inspector said "No, you first of all call upon him as a witness, and because he does not bear out what you say you accuse him of being concerned in the robbery," or words to that effect—I have passed by another name—in my boyhood days I was locked up—it was felony, of course, but it was a very simple affair I was convicted for—I should only have got a month, but my father prosecuted me, and wished I should be sent away—I was sentenced to three years; that was in 1859—a gentleman dropped a ring and some half-pence, and I was taken amongst them—McAuliffe came up before the Police Magistrate the next day, of his own free will—the policeman asked him whether he would come up before the Magistrate, and he was there the next day—I was giving my evidence, and the Magistrate said "Pick the man out," and I did so, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—on the night of 24th November, about 9. 15, I was standing talking to a young man at the corner of White Horse Yard—Kelly came up, and he up with his fist and hit the young man I was talking to in the stomach for nothing at all, and walked away down White Horse Yard—about three or four minutes after I saw my husband and him tangled into one another—my husband had bold of him and said "He has robbed me of my watch and chain"—I screamed "Police!" and "Murder!" and there was such a mob I could not see what was done, but my husband had Kelly by the collar, and he was punching my husband right and left in the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband did not punch him—I had a paraffin bottle in my hand, and that got broken—I did not say to my husband "Take hold of this bottle and smash his brains out"—I saw my husband and Kelly coming up White Horse Yard together; my husband had hold of him, and he had hold of my husband—my husband was not there when Kelly struck the young man—his name is David Thompson—he was up at Bow Street three remands, but I don't know whether he gave evidence—my husband had not stripped to fight—he had not got his jacket and waist-coat off—I said at the Police Court that McAuliffe carried Kelly's clothes, not my husband's—I did not see when Kelly took them off—there was some thousands of people there—I did not see Kelly knock my husband down—I did not get in the crowd at all—my husband did not lose his watch, he has it now; he lost his chain—McAucliffe went to the station, carrying the clothes—my husband did not hit right and left at Kelly—they were struggling about five or ten minutes—Kelly was very tipsy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 250). About 9. 15 on this night I was on duty in Drury Lane, and saw a crowd surge across Drury Lane from White Horse Yard—I went up and found the prosecutor lying on his back in the gutter, and Kelly on the top of him—they were struggling very violently together—I took hold of Kelly and pulled him off the prosecutor, who then got up and charged the prisoner with striking him—he had a large bruise on his face, and blood running from it—on the way to the station, the prosecutor said "He has taken my chain also"—I told Kelly the charge, he said "It is only a drunken fight"—the prosecutor showed his watch to the inspector.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi> 19). I was acting inspector on the night in question, and took the charge; first it was a charge of assault,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187312150035"></xptr>
               <p>and then it resolved itself into a felony, stealing a chain—that was only against Kelly—the prosecutor said he charged Kelly with assaulting him, and he had a mark of a blow under his eye, and he told me Kelly did that in knocking him down—I hesitated about taking the charge, it seemed to me that it was a fight, from what was said, and then he charged him with stealing the chain—the watch was produced—there was nothing to show that any chain had been attached to it.</p>

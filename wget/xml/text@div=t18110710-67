The knife came towards my neck, I threw out my left arm, and kept it off my body as well as I could; the knife entered my neck, went through my coat, waistcoat, shirt, and through my neckcloth, into my, flesh. I struggled with the prisoner, I held his arm away from my body as well as I could; the prisoner Antonio got me down into a ditch. King, I believe he was behind the other, the young woman that was with me can declare to him. I struggled with him in the ditch I got the knife from his hand, and when the knife was in my possession, during that time King let go of the young woman, during the time I was struggling with

I having the knife in my left hand, he could not get it out of my hand shut the knife down on my hand, which wounded my hand, and which wound is not well yet. I let go the knife, the prisoner Antonio took the knife with him I believe, to the best of my recollection, he ran to the young woman, took from her my hat, leaving his hat behind in the ditch. I took the hat that was left behind, I did not discover but what it was my own until I got to the Rose and Crown public-house, I followed them with the cries of murder, nobody came to my assistance.

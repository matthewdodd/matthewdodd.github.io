About eleven o'clock , on the 11th of December, I shut up my house as I generally do, and went to bed; in the morning the watchman knocked at my door, so I opened my window, he said your house is open, then I came down with my gown loose before me, the drinking room was open, but I could not get in without taking down the sash door; the watchman said, don't go into that room till I come in, so I opened the street door and let him in ; we went into the drinking room, and there I saw the print of a foot on the long table and the window shutter open, which was keyed within side when I went to bed, I put in the pin, and a woman within keyed it, but whether the key went home I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing?</p>
               <p>Ridley. No, I missed nothing: the watchman searched about, and at last found the prisoner in the stable-yard, who can give an account of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman; In Great Wild Street, on the 10th of last December, calling the hour One, by the light of my lanthorn I saw the prosecutrix's window open; on which I knocked at the door, and she looked out at the window, I told her the drinking room was open. So she came down and lighted a candle, we went into the drinking room, there lay the key of the window, and there was a pane of glass out of the casement.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Was that pane out before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can't say whether it was or not</p>
               <p>Taylor. I saw the print of a foot and felt with my finger, and found it to be kennel-dirt wet ; I went and searched about, and at last found the prisoner lying on the tiles at the bottom of the yard on his belly without his shoes; a brother watchman came to my assistance; we found the pin of the window in his right hand pocket, so we brought him to the constable, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Ellice, the other watchman, confirmed that of seeing him on the tiles, and securing him.</p>

            . I put the key in the pin of the window within side over night, but whether it went through so as to spring I don't know, but I know the casement must be shut before the shutter would go to, to pin, which was at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went there thinking to lie along with a youn g man that I had lay with before, and the door was shut, but about five yards from the window I found this pin of a window and saw the window open, so I went through the window; this was about eleven at night, I put the pin in my pocket, and thought to go up stairs, but found the door was locked, so I went backwards, where I lay and fell asleep till the watchman came, and took me away.</p>

On 3rd January, about 5.30, I saw the prisoners in Bishopsgate Street—I had known Carpenter six years—I followed them up Sun Street—a cart of Messrs. Barren's was standing there, opposite Mr. Lyon's house—the prisoners passed the cart several times, backwards and forwards, and when the carman had gone in with a parcel, Brown took this roll of canvas out of the cart—I followed and stopped him—he said, "Don't take me, sir, a man only gave it to me to carry"—I said, "I saw you take it, and I shall take you in custody"—I had a severe struggle with him, and we both fell on the pavement, and while I was down Carpenter kicked me in the side several times—when I got to my feet Carpenter had escaped—I kept Brown in custody—I took Carpenter two days afterwards.</p>

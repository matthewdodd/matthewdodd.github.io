I am the wife of John Bellamy, of 115, Union-street, Borough—about a quarter to 12 o'clock on the evening of 21st April I was with a Mrs. Mauler at the Red Lion public-house, very nearly opposite to where I live—I had not been in there more than while I got served with my supper beer, which I had gone for—I gave the barman a sovereign—the prisoners were there when I went in—there were a great many people there—I had known the prisoners before, by living in the neighbourhood—I received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change from the barman—the prisoners saw me receive it—having received it I left the Red Lion with Mrs. Mauler—the prisoners followed us out instantly—I was crossing the road to go to my house, with my beer in my hand—the male prisoner came up to me, and asked me what I meant by calling his father <hi rend="italic">moucher</hi>—I had not called his father <hi rend="italic">moucher</hi>—he said if I had made use of such an expression my husband was to come out and show what he could do—my husband came up out of his shop—he is a boot and shoe maker—we have been residing in that house three years—when he came up the male prisoner instantly attacked him, struck him, and they both fell—the prisoner got up off the ground, turned round, and struck me—I was about two yards from where the scuffle took place between him and my husband—I tried to help my husband off the ground—I did not strike the prisoner in doing that—I had not struck him at all before he came and struck me in the face—I had a black eye, and my forehead was all scratched—I fell on the ground—at this time I had the change of the money in my right hand—having struck me, he made a grasp at my hand, and all the money was taken from me but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he held my hand, wrenched it open, and took the money out, but some of the silver fell on the ground—he picked some of it up, ran away, and I pursued him—the female prisoner did not do anything to me, before she stole my shawl—nobody else did anything to me whilst I was on the ground—I ran after the male prisoner, and came up to him at Princes-street, which is in Union-street—he then struck me again a violent blow in the face—I fell, and he ran away—I got up and pursued him—I called out "Thief," and "Police"—when I was down the second time the female prisoner came up, and assisted</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Mauler, of 20, Pepper-street, Union-street, Borough, a bellhanger and gasfitter—he is employed by his father—on Saturday night, 21st April, I was with the last witness in the Red Lion; only while she was being served with a pot of half-and-half—I saw the sovereign changed, and the change handed to her—the prisoners were both in the public-house at the time—I knew them by sight—they</p>

I have got none"—I am positive I saw him take the money, and pick it up from the ground—no one interfered with Mrs. Bellamy while she was on the ground—she got up and ran after the male prisoner, whose brothers I know by sight—two of them were there while Mm Bellamy was on the ground—I think they are older than he—they interfered, and tried to get him away from Mrs. Bellamy while she was on the ground—she had not got hold of him—they only said, "Come away," they did not do anything—while Mrs. Bellamy was on the ground the first time the female prisoner struck her on the face—I can't say whether Mrs. Bellamy saw her do so—there was a crowd of people—it is a very bad neighbourhoodz—the male prisoner ran on, and then turned round and struck Mrs. Bellamy, who was pursuing him—she got up to him near Princes-street, which is five or six yards from the place where she was first knocked down—he struck her and knocked her down a second time—while she was on the ground, I saw the female prisoner tear her shawl off and give it to one of her sons who had been present at the first transaction—it was a silk shawl, with large flowers on—the female prisoner then ran up the court—the prisoners do not live very far from where Mrs. Bellamy was knocked down the second time—I saw the male prisoner stopped by a gentleman—after he knocked Mrs. Bellamy down the second time, he continued his flight till the gentleman stopped him—he had got about four or five yards from where he knocked her down the second time—Mrs. Bellamy cried out, "Stop thief!" and I saw him stopped and given in charge to a policeman.</p>

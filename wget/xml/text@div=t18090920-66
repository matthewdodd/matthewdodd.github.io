On Tuesday the 12th of September, about five in the afternoon, hearing that there was a man in my sister's room I immediately run down stairs to see if my sister was in the kitchen, I asked her if there was any man in her room; she said no; I replied there is, come along; I immediately run up stairs; I met the man near to my sister's room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that man, the prisoner - A. Yes; he had this bag with him; I asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property, that he had been up to the top of the house, to a shoemaker there; wishing to be satisfied I sprang a few stairs and threw open my sister's room door, to be convinced; my sister said in the mean time, he is run away; he dropped the bag in the presence of my sister, on the outside of the street door against the rails in the street; I pursued him and never lost sight of him till I apprehended him. I brought him to the watchhouse, he was searched by the watchhouse keeper, a watch and two spoons were found on him; the bag was taken back to my house, I have kept it ever since in the same state it is now; it contains seven sheets; it is the prisoner's bag, and a sleeves belonging to some body else; the sheets were property entrusted to my sister to wash</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the door to see how the door was broken open - A. When we searched the prisoner at the watchhouse he had picklock keys and an iron crow; one of the drawers in my sisters room appeared to have been broken open by an iron crow.</p>

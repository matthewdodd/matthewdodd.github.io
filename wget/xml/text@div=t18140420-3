               <p>Q. Were you present at any time in September Sessions, 1810, when she was convicted - A. I was; she was convicted of uttering counterfeit money, she was ordered to be confined in the house of correction one year, and to find sureties for her good behaviour, and she then was informed by the chairman that if she was guilty of a like offence she would be liable to a capital conviction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time that you saw her in that court - A. No.</p>

               <p>KEMP GODFREY. I live at No. 14, Henrietta-street, Manchester-square, with my uncle; he is a baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the girl at the bar - A. Yes, I have no doubt of her person; she came to our shop on the 15th of March, she asked for a threepenny loaf; I gave it her. She gave me in payment a shilling; I gave her nine-pence, deducting threepence for the loaf; she went away. I put the shilling on the lidge of the counter with some halfpence; there was no other shilling there.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200005"></xptr>Johnson, the officer, came in as soon as she went out; he enquired what had happened. I told him, and shewed him the shilling the girl had given me. He marked it, and I marked it. He sealed it up. He went out into the street. That is all that I know of it. After the shilling was sealed up in paper I put it in a drawer by itself. On the next day, Johnson came; I gave him the shilling that I had received of the prisoner.</p>

            ; I saw the girl go by herself into the shop; (the shop in Henrietta-street, about two hundred yards from Oxford-street); the mother had been left by the prisoner in Oxford-street while the girl went into the baker's shop. Upon her coming out, I went in; I asked the boy; he produced a shilling; I saw it was a counterfeit shilling. I marked it. I told the boy to mark it; he did so. I followed the girl. She joined the mother in Oxford-street. She gave her mother the three-penny loaf; the mother put the loaf in her apron along with other articles that they had purchased. I looked at the shilling the boy gave me, the next day; I saw it was the same shilling that I had marked the day before. I have had it ever since. I see now it is the same shilling that I marked.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. It is the same shilling that I marked.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. It is a counterfeit shilling; it is the same manufactory as the others.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I pursued the mother to the place where I searched them, to Mr. Bird's house; I heard something drop; I picked it up. As soon as she dropped her hand, the four shillings were laying at her foot. I observed the motion of her hand. I went and picked it up; it was in a direction as if it came from her hand. There were four shillings. It was as if it came out of a paper. These are the four shillings; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. These are the same I saw before; they are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I searched the mother again; I found on her fifteen counterfeit shillings, two good shillings, two good sixpences, and two counterfeit sixpences, and one shilling and ten pennyworth of halfpence in her pocket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

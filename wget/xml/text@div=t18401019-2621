               <p>the prisoner came over with his wife and three other women, who had been to the Court as witnesses, and knocked at my door—I opened it—he said, "I want my money"—I said, "What money?"—he said, "I want my money, you have been receiving blood-money in the Court, and I will have it"—I said, "I have not been receiving blood-money, it was for the breaking of my arm"—he said, if I would not give it him he would tear me in pieces—I said my arm had been broken, and I would keep it—he said he would have it, otherwise he would have my life, and he made a great disturbance round the door—I sent for the police to protect me, and when they came I showed them the money I had received—the prisoner did not strike me then—his wife struck me in the passage on the forehead, but nothing to speak of—he said, "Give it her—I am your bail, and I will forfeit your bail if you give her a d——d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>"—I then went out—the prisoner, his wife, and the three other women followed me, and said, "Are you going to give us the blood-money?"—I said, "I will not give it you—it is not blood-money"—he said, "Mind, you shall retract my money, and if not I will give you in charge for robbery"—he then gave me a blow in my mouth, and made it bleed—I was afraid, and put ray hand into my pocket, and gave him the money—I then went home crying—I got a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and went back to Hicks's Hall, and stated what had passed to the Chairman—it was five or ten minutes to four o'clock when I got there—he said he was very sorry, and told me to go to the Thames Police, and I should have a little recompense made—I asked him if he would be kind enough to give me a note—he said, if my word was doubted he would not only give me a note, but he would go himself, for he saw the money given to me—I went to the Thames Police at ten o'clock next morning—I was too ill to go that day—I believe the prisoner was in liquor at the time—I gave him the money after he had given me one blow—having been laid up some weeks with a broken arm, I was really afraid of being torn to pieces—the words he used to me are not fit for a woman to mention.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the Magistrate desire Mrs. Combes to remain in Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not in the Court—the prisoner went to a friend of his to borrow part of the money, and it was when he was going in to pay it that I saw it—he counted it—there was a sovereign, half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—I understood he was to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece for the females—I saw no flag with the hackney coach—we did not arrive at home at the time the women did—I did not lodge at his house.</p>

               <p>o'clock on Friday night—he was then in his own house going to bed—I did not see him again till Monday, at the Thames police-office—the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife's sister, Mr. and Mrs. Newman, and a young man named Scott, an engineer, were at the prisoner's on Friday—none of them are here—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> go away from the prosecutrix's—I heard she had gone to Clerkenwell to take a warrant out against the women, and I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come back again—two women took the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and rode up and down the street—they were at it quite late in the evening—the boys were running about with little bits of bonfire, hooting and hallooing about the place—the prisoner was not out of my company from three to nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Upper Grove-street. On Friday afternoon, the 9th of this month, about a quarter before three o'clock, I heard a noise in the street—I went down, and saw Mrs. Combes at her door—she beckoned me into her house, and I went—she stood in the door-way—I asked her if the business was settled—she said, "Yes," and she had received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained with her about ten minutes—nothing occurred to her during that time—I asked how long she had been home—she said, Some time—that she had some pork-chops, and a little gin, and some porter with a woman who was sitting in the room—she said she had shown the people favours, and see how she was served for it—I suppose she meant by showing favours, settling the matter—she said she would have a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and go to the Magistrate, who sat till six o'clock—her mouth was not bleeding at all then—she said nothing about the prisoner—she did not tell me what she was going to the Magistrate for—on the Monday following she came to my house with a policeman, and said, "I want you to go to<lb></lb>day with me, and say you saw me give the man the money"—I told her I could not say what I knew nothing about—the policeman said, "We can do without you"—I said, "I hope you will, for I know nothing of the business, or any thing of the parties"—she then put her hand up to the policeman, and said, "There is a little boy fourteen years old that I sent the jacket round with, and he will do"—that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with Mrs. Combes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only know her by going to inquire after apartments at her house once, nothing more—I do not know Mrs. Newman, and never knew the pri<lb></lb>soner before last Monday—he wished me to come here to-day—I think I mentioned to a Mrs. Govey, who lives in the same street, about the prosecu<lb></lb>trix and the officer calling on me—I do not know what officer it was—I did not tike his number, or notice him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I went with Mrs. Combes on Monday morning to this woman to inquire whether I could get any proof as to the prisoner's being seen in the disturbance—I asked this woman if she knew any thing about it—she said she saw a mob of people there; that she went over to Mrs. Combes, returned, and saw no more than a mob of people—she said she saw the prisoner, his wife, and other women in the street there, but did not see the money—I asked why she did not come down to the Thames police—she said she could not—there was a little boy who lived in the house, but the Magistrate did not think him old enough to be a witness, and would not take his evidence.</p>

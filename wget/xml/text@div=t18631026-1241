In consequence of directions from Mr. Phillips, of the Three Tons, Billingsgate, I went into his inner cellar, under the bar, at half-past I in the day—the outer cellar is divided from the inner by a door with lattice-work at the side of it—the door was fastened—I was locked in by the foreman—I placed myself behind one of the bins, at the further side of the cellar, where I could see the door—about 3 o'clock I heard voices, and a candle was lit in the outer cellar, where the gas was burning—the door was then taken off the hinges, lifted up, and taken away, and I saw Williams enter with a candle on a stick which is used in the cellar, while Carlick held the door to prevent it from straining on the lock—Williams came to the first wine bin on the left, took up a bottle, and put it down again, apparently on the wine bin again—he then took up another, and came towards me with a bottle in his hand, I could see a red seal on the cork—he came to the bin where I was concealed—I then laid down on my side, but the light fell on me—he momentarily turned round, and the light went out—he went back to Carlick and said, "There is some one here"—I came out just as they were placing the door on its hinges, and said, "What are you doing here?"—Williams said, "For God's sake, forgive me; I will never do it again; I never did it before"—I said, "It is not for me to forgive you; I must call Mr. Phillips"—Carlick said, "I know nothing about it; I came down to make water"—as I went up the steps to call Mr. Phillips, Williams took hold of me, and said, "For God's sake, do not say anything about it; think of my mother and nine children"—I searched them, but found nothing on them—I got these two bottles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the wine bin—they had been removed from their original position—Williams had passed that bin, and he passed it again in coming out—after they were committed, Carlick called me to the cell, and said, "How do you think we shall get on?"—I said, "I am sure I cannot say"—he said, "I wish you would speak to Mr. Phillips for me, and get him to recommend me to mercy"—I said, "If it is your wish, I will do so"—he said, "It is the first time that ever I did it; I was drawn into it, and you might have knocked me down with a feather when you came out of the cellar"—Williams then said, "And I was drawn into it, and I am very sorry; if Mr. Phillips will recommend me to mercy, wherever I go I will never do it again; I was drawn into it by <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Smith."</p>

I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Three Tons, near Billingsgate-market—Williams has been in my service about seven months, as night porter—his duties were to clean the knives and run on errands—Carlick was with me a fortnight and three days—his duties were to carry tea and coffee, and to wait on gentlemen and the salesmen in the market—he had no duties connected with the cellar at that hour of the day—one had eight shillings and the other seven shillings wages, and board and lodging at my expense, with as much as they required to eat and drink—since they have been, in my service I have missed property to a very</p>

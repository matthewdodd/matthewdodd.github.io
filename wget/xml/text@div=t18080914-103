            . Q. You are a labourer in the East India company's warehouse - A. Yes; the prisoner was in the same employ, he was a <rs id="t18080914-103-deflabel606" type="occupation">watchman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18080914-103-defend908 t18080914-103-deflabel606"></join>, and I was a watchman. On the 11th of September the box I was stationed at that night was inside of the gate Jewry street warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a lanthorn and a great coat - A. Yes, that was in my box inside of the gate; we usually hang them there. On the 11th of September the prisoner came soon after nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. After the coat had been taken away, did you make any observation - A. No, we stood talking together till between ten and eleven o'clock, then I went inside; I found some loose tea scattered on the step going into the box; I went and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of it, he said no, he did not; I asked him to come and look at it, he came in, he said he knew nothing of it. After that I made an excuse to go to the outside box belonging to him; I put my hand in at the bottom of the box, there I found a bag containing six pounds four ounces of tea; I kept the bag in my possession till the morning; the first person I shewed it to was Mr. Barber, the elder. When I found the bag he desired I would say nothing about it; I asked him how he came by it, he said he got it out of the cellar: he still begged very hard for his family's sake that I would say nothing about it, and wished to throw it away; I said I would do no such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. How long have you worked there - A. For fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked for them the last year - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been out of their service at all - A. I was, for a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days do you call a few days - A. I was absent for five days.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask leave of absence - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you suspended for your misconduct - A. I was suspended.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you hang back - I know you was suspended, and I know what you are after - when was you restored last - A. I cannot say the exact day.</p>
               <p>Q. You petitioned the company, and you was restored - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your duty is to watch at the gate, and to see that no man takes any thing away - A. I only am to watch a particular set of men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that if you see a man take any thing away that belongs to the company, you are not to stop that man - A. If I see him, to be sure I am to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been in your warehouse - A. Twelve or thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you can tell me that he has not been suspended - you know you have been - A. I have been, I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the men leave the warehouse - A. At three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on Sunday evening it was discovered - your box is inside, his outside - did you ever hear of any man taking tea of the Saturday night, and letting it be till eleven o'clock on Sunday night before he took it away - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any man convey any thing out of the warehouse without being the subject of examination - does it not require great dexterity to escape detection, as they are rubbed down when they come out - A. Yes; one would think it impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. And still carrying out six pounds four ounces, which is a large quantity, must not a man be discovered if he had that quantity - A. I suppose he must.</p>
               <p>Q. You had this notable confession, that he took it out of the cellar - A. He confessed it to me himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else heard it but you - what have you been suspended for - A. A person passed unnoticed by me, who had a little coffee and tea.</p>

            . Q. You are an assistant elder belonging to the East India company - A. Yes, and watch inspector. On Monday morning about six o'clock I rung at the bell of Jewry street warehouse, I asked Dothie if all was well; he shewed me a bag containing tea, it was in a basket; I saw the bag opened afterwards, I saw there was tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dothie. Had the prisoner any thing with him when he came on duty - A. I saw him throw a basket down by the gate inside.</p>
               <p>Barber. I saw a chest that was brought up from the cellar, it appeared to be plundered, the lead was torn; I compared the tea in the chest with the tea in the bag, it corresponded with some of the tea, it is not all of the same sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had this chest the appearance of a broken chest, or of a plundered chest - A. It had all the appearance of a plundered chest, it had not the appearance of being damaged by a tall.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this quantity of tea - A. One guinea; the major part of the tea in the bag appears to be of the same quality as that in the chest. I have a sample of each.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is it possible for any human being without connivance with the man at the gate, that it could be carried out - A. It is possible that it might be carried in the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Suppose a man got it out of the warehouse in his great coat, and got it into the yard, could not he take it into his watch box - A. Certainly.</p>

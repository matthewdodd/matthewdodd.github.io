In consequence of information I received I went to 20, Waterman's Fields, Woolwich—the prisoner Brady had left there, so I sent to where she was living; told her I was a police-constable and had come to make enquiries about a child she had in her possession—she said "I have a child and got it from a woman"—she did lot know where she lived—I accompanied her to where she had lived for <hi rend="italic">some</hi> time, and on going upstairs I saw a child that answered the descrip<lb></lb>ion I had received—on the way to the station she said "He took it, I did lot take it, he carried it all the way home"—I said who is "he"—she said 'I will not tell you his name, if I am to suffer, I will suffer alone."</p>

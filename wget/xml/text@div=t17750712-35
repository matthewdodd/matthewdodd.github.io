After they had been there about ten minutes, my husband came in, and Emanuel followed him immediately into the shop the other remained then before the glass, my child took notice of the shew glass, she went out and found the glass broke; when Emanuel came into the shop, he asked for two mourning rings, after my little girl had gone out and perceived that the shew-glass was broke, my husband shut the door and said no one should go out, upon that Emanuel said d - n your, blood why don't you pay for the buttons and let us be gone; upon which Hunt produced two guineas, my husband took the two guineas and said he would keep them till they produced the man that had stole the buckles; Cox was committed, and he, as I was informed gave information with respect to Ward; for next morning, Ward was taken up upon the parade; I saw Ward and knew him, though he was then in his regimentals: when at the shew glass he was dressed in a different manner.</p>

               <p>Salmon. Destruction to the soul. (she is sworn) I was in the church yard, the maid came for me; I went into the shop; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120017"></xptr> came in, the two men were then in the shop, and two at the shew glass. I saw Hunt go from the shew glass, sometime before he returned again; and in a quarter of an hour after, he came into the shop, with Cox. I went behind the counter; and then my mamma shewed them some buttons; there were two more then at the glasses: the Jew was there, and Ward; my pappa, came soon after; Emanuel came into the shop directly after him, and asked for two mourning rings. I saw a man leaning, with one hand over the shew glass; and I am positive, I saw him put some buckles into his handkerchief; but I did not see him take those buckles out of the shew glass, and then he went away: I could see enough of the buckles. Upon this I beckoned my pappa out of the shop, and told him, a man had run away with the buckles: then my mamma went out for a constable, and I was sent out to call in a neighbour; we were there a considerable time: as to Cox, I know him very well, he had been at the shop before, and had bought some buttons. Cox was committed.</p>
               <p>Hunt's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to the shop, and asked the prosecutrix, if she had any buttons; she asked seventeen shillings a dozen. She took them off the paper; I bargained with her for some waistcoat buttons; I took out two guineas to pay for the buttons: he took the two guineas, and said, he had been robbed, and he would keep the money: I insisted upon it, they should send for a constable; they fetched over a green grocer; he said, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Emanuel's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in the shop before the gentleman came home, asking the gentlewoman, if she had a ring to suit me? he came and said, he believed he had. He took out a drawer, and shewed me some; I said, the mourning was wore off, and they would not do; he said, he had no other. The gentlewoman was rubbing the buttons upon a piece of leather; he said, are your two guineas weight? I said, yes: he snatched up the two guineas, and ran out, and saw the glass broke; and then said, he would stop the two guineas, for he imagined, some of our gang had taken the buckles out: we knew nothing about it. He went out for a constable; he was gone half an hour; then he sent his wife out for an officer. A gentleman came in to buy something, who knew me; and he said, he would insure me; when the constable came, I insisted they should search me; he would not; we were in the cellar an hour and half; the green grocer was sent for, he did not know either of us.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is as false as God is true: one Marks, a Jew, came in, and said to him, I know your father, to be a hard working man, but you are a great villain.</p>
               <p>Ward. I would beg to ask the prosecutrix, whether she saw me?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, I saw him at the Glasses.</p>

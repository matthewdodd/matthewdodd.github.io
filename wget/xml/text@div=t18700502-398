I am manager at the North Pole public-house—on Wednesday, 9th March, the prisoner called at the house—I had seen him before—he said he had a nice diamond ring that would suit me—I said I did not want such a thing—he said "We will call to-morrow night with it"—he left, and his other two friends who came to my place with him—they brought the ring the next night, and told me they wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I told them I did not want it—they said "Come to the pawnbroker's, and you can see the value of it"—the prisoner said "It won't do for all of us to go"—we went to the pawnbroker's, and asked him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ring—the pawnbroker said he would lend us 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if we brought it to-morrow—they said "Will you lend us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till to-morrow"—I told them I would give them 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I found I had only got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave them that—I went back to the public-house, and the prisoner asked if I had bought the ring—I said "I have lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the ring"—he said "Well, where are they; are they coming back?"—I said "No, they are gone on"—he took up his hat, and ran off, and I saw no more of him till he was in custody for house-breaking, or something of that sort—the prisoner said "What are you going to give me?"—I said "Wait till the morning," and then he took his hat and ran off—I did not give him anything—it was about 7 o'clock when we went to the pawnbroker's—I examined the ring and should know it again—I gave the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the man the prisoner introduced to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is exactly like the ring—it was another one they showed me at first.</p>

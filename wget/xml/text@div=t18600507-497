                  </hi>. I am a widow, residing at 2, Frederick-terrace, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, Peckham—on the evening of 5th April last, about half-past 5, I was coming out of my house—I had to go round the corner to Camden-grove, and as I turned, about twenty or thirty yards off, I saw the prisoner and another at the opposite side; they came up to me and asked me the way to the Kent road—I had to turn round to tell them—I pointed with my hand; they said a gentleman had directed them wrong the other day and asked me to show them right, and asked if they had to cross a field—I said, "Yes"—they then asked if they should be able to get an omnibus—I should say our conversation lasted about four minutest—during that time I had sufficient opportunity of seeing them, they were very near to me—the moment I turned round I missed my watch—they were then both in sight—I just looked down and saw that my chain was hanging—I turned round and said, "I have lost my watch, that woman has got it"—when I called out, the prisoner and her companion ran away; they were near enough to hear me—when I left my house I had my watch safe—I had not spoken to any one from the time I left my house till I saw these women—after I called out and saw the women running, a man came directly to me and said, "What have you lost?" and put his hands on each of my shoulders—I think it was to stop me, but I would not let him—I got away and followed after the prisoner and her companion as fast as I could—I never saw the man afterwards—I was at the corner that leads into the Commercial-road—I followed them and called out, "Stop the women, they have robbed me of my watch"—the prisoner was stopped almost directly afterwards, at the Rosemary Branch public-house—I got up at the time she was stopped—she had a muff in her hand; she was taken into the parlour and was kept there till Sergeant Castleman came—the other woman ran up a very quiet street, there was no one to stop her.</p>

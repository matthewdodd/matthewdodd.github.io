On the evening of the 3rd of March I was serving in the shop, between seven and eight o'clock - there was a roll of thirty-two yards of flannel there, and seven handkerchiefs were pinned to it, in one piece; there was a mark on the flannel - while I was serving the customer I saw the handkerchiefs flying, as if the wind had taken them - I went to the door, and missed the flannel and handkerchiefs; I gave an alarm, and Nation, who is a neighbour, came to me - I soon after heard that a man was taken - I went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner, the flannel, and the handkerchiefs; Bow-lane is about five yards from the shop - I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

            . In consequence of Miss Hunter calling my attention to this circumstance - I went in the direction of Bow-lane, and saw the prisoner in Cotton-street, which joins to it; he had this flannel under his arm - this was about ten minutes after the witness had spoken to me; the flannel had these handkerchiefs pinned to it - I stopped him, and asked where he got it; he said he found it - I took him to the station-house; there was no dirt on the flannel, except just at one end - it was very dirty weather, and was raining at the time - he was about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's when I took him.</p>

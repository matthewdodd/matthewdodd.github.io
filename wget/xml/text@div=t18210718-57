            . I was a soldier at that time, and know the prisoner; he was in the public-house, and sat on the left, next to Mr. Moseley - I saw nothing done. I was in the back parlour, came out and said, eyes right, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do keep eyes right, I am waiting for a chance, and shall have it presently" - I did not know what he meant. I returned to the parlour, there might be about a dozen people in the room, but nobody so near the prosecutor as the prisoner. When I came out of the room again, he was gone, and about half an hour after the pocket-book was missed - several people were then gone besides the prisoner. I then told what I had heard, he was taken that night, he was quartered at the Castle public-house; he said he was willing to be stripped and searched.</p>

            . I was serjeant of the Militia, and was quartered at the Jolly Hostlers, public-house. I saw the prisoner sitting on the left of Mr. Moseley - I was in the parlour after that, and went out about a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the prosecutor sitting there, and the prisoner by him; there might be ten or twelve people in the house. I remained in the room five or six minutes, then left the house, and told Moseley to take care of his property, and give it to the landlord, as he was in bad company - he felt, and found his pocket-book safe then.</p>
               <p>MR. MOSELEY. When I got up, my pocket-book was gone, the bottom of my pocket was cut out. The militia were being trained.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house with me, but in a different room; he is a married man; it is Mr. John West's house; West also lives in the house - about eight o'clock on Tuesday evening, the 6th of August, there was a disturbance in the house; the prisoner was making a disturbance in his own room - I went up stairs and went into West's room and spoke to him, and then went towards the prisoner's room, and told him it was Mr. West's desire that he should be quiet or leave the house; he was then standing in his own room doorway - I was in the passage and he in the doorway - after telling him that, he said, "What do you say?" and stepped back into his room; I followed him in about a yard into his own room, and repeated the same words as I did in the passage - he had a knife in his hand; at first he seemed to be eating - when I went into the room, he changed the position of the knife; he had it at first in this manner (holding it as usual) - he then changed the position so (turning the blade downwards), and plunged it into my left breast; I had not touched him, nor said anything more than I have stated - on feeling myself wounded, I went down stairs, and asked the landlady to send for a surgeon, and we sent for Mr. Farrell; I bled a good deal; the wound was rather more than an inch deep; I had never had any quarrel with him at any time - before he gave me the stab, he said something about that he would put me out, that was at the time he was striking; he had not desired me to leave the room before that, nor said anything to me except at the time he was striking - he said he would put me out - I had my coat and waistcoat on; it cut through the coat, but it was outside the waistcoat; it went through the coat and shirt at the armhole of the waistcoat; it was a knife similar to this (a dinner knife) - my coat was taken off; the officer has had it since - my face was towards him the whole time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you anything to Mr. West? A. No, I do not know that West and the prisoner had had any disagreement that morning; they might have had; I was not a joint lodger with the prisoner; I thought it was my duty and an act of kindness towards the old man, the landlord, to remonstrate with the prisoner to be quiet - he was using abusive language towards the landlord; he was in his own room, the landlord was not in his room - the prisoner seemed angry, and as if he had drank a little; he had given me no offence - I was inside his room, when he said he would put me out; I never had the least quarrel with him at any time; he was not sitting down at the table - I did not notice whether any food was on the table; his mouth was in motion as if he was eating; the knife he had was one which he might use to cut his food - I had known him about three months; he had no ill feeling towards me - I told him the landlord desired him to be quiet; he said in the passage,"What did you say?" I stepped in after him, and repeated the same words - I think the landlord was afraid to go in and speak to him; I do not know that it was because the prisoner was so much excited, that he was afraid to go in; West is not here, he is very unwell; he wished me to advise the prisoner to be quiet - the prisoner has one child; his wife was in the room at the time, and the child.</p>

             (Policeman). I apprehended the prisoner the same evening - I asked him if he had got any sharp instrument about him - he told me he had not got it about him - I then asked if there was any person to give him in charge, they said not - I searched him and found no knife on him - I took him to the station-house and then returned to the room and found five knives there and two or three forks with them - the one I picked out was stained with blood; this is it - the stain was plain at that time, it was dry; this was about an hour after I apprehended him - the stain appeared quite fresh, but it was dry - I have the prosecutor's coat, I found the cut and the knife correspond.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not undertake to say the blood might not have been two or three days there? A. I cannot positively swear that; this knife is larger than the rest; it is a common table knife - I searched him and found no instrument on him.</p>

I was called in to see the prosecutor - I examined his wound, which was on the left breast; it was rather more than an inch deep, and an inch in breadth, it bled a good deal; a small artery was wounded but not a large one - I dressed the wound; I did not apprehend any danger from it - he was ill about three weeks - the wound was not healed before that time.</p>

The prosecutor came in my room- he was not in my passage - he came into my room and caught hold of my collar, and said, he would kick my a-s out of the door, and said he had power from the landlord to do it, and in the scuffle I had the knife in my hand, eating my meat, and do not know how it happened.</p>

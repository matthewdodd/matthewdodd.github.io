               <p>Q. Did you secure him? - A. Yes; he was with me till he came near the Office; we went to the Public-Office, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, and when we came near the Office, he turned round and gave me a violent blow on the temple, and knocked me down, and ran off; there was a cry of stop thief, and he was soon brought back, and I took him to the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure this is one of the men? - A. Yes; I never took my eyes off him; I never lost sight of him; I took and put him in the butcher's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is one that hustled Mr. Mansfield? - A. Yes; and immediately I heard Mr. Mansfield say he had lost his watch I ran across the road and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they hustling him? - A. They were shoving round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Using violence against him? - A. Yes; he was quite out of wind when I came up, and he said in a low tone of voice that he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the butcher's shop, what was done with him? - A. When we came back he was gone; there was a mob assembled about the door; they said they had no right to keep him, so they let him go; he was found about ten or eleven days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. That is the man; the butcher's sister is here; she will swear to him, as well as myself; and I will swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Ellison? - A. I had not time to recognize that man; Mr. Mansfield took him; I saw this man and Mr. Mansfield at the Office; Mr. Mansfield had his eye cut; it was bleeding; that man, if he was there, he must be in the front of him; this Jackson and the man in the flannel jacket were behind Mr. Mansfield at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the robbery, could you observe who was in the front? - A. I could not; I did not turn my head that way; I run across the way when he said he was robbed, after Jackson, and while I took the prisoner, Jackson, I lost sight of the prosecutor and Ellison, and never saw him till I saw him at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not walking along with Mr. Mansfield? - A. No, I was passing by; a stranger at the time.</p>

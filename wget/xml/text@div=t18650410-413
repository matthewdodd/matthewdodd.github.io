                  </hi>. I am a leather-maker—on 3d March about 4 o'clock, I was in the Mile End-road on the north side, coming towards the city; that would be on my right-hand side—as I was walking I saw the prisoner with a van and horses—I heard him come at a most rapid pace; it induced me to turn—he was nearly a hundred yards in my rear—he had two horse load of coals—I believe it was two tons—I continued looking at him till he came nearly abreast of me, then I turned my head again hearing a great shouting—I saw a man in the road who appeared in the act of rising—the van knocked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100048"></xptr>
               <p>him down and both wheels passed over him—I was then about fifteen yards from him—the van was about three yards from the edge of the kerbstone, on the north side—that was the wrong side—the old man was put in a cab and sent to the hospital—I followed the van; it was stopped between twenty and thirty yards off—I said to the prisoner, "You must be a madman to run over that poor fellow when you had all the road to yourself, "pointing to the road, which is fifty feet wide, and there was nothing but a cab there—he made no answer—he did not get down willingly—I said, "You had better get down and see about the poor man, "and he got down—he was going at least eight miles an hour—they seemed to me two good horses and they were going as fast as he could make them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You heard loud shouting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; from the people—it was a kind of general shouting, a sensational shouting—I understood that the shout was because the man was in the way, but I did not see him till afterwards—if the driver shouted to him it must have been almost momentary with the general shouting of the people—a person coming from Stepney-green to get into Cleveland-street would have to drive over the very spot which I describe, from the kerbstone—he could not get across the road without driving in that direction towards the off-side of the road—he had pulled up at the time I overtook him—he appeared to be sober—I saw nothing to the contrary—I am not a driver of horses, but I often hear fire<lb></lb>engines, and I thought it was a fire-engine coming, by the noise it made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ropemaker, of 6, Union-street, Spitalfields—on 3d March at a quarter to 4 in the afternoon, I was in the Mile End-road, and saw a two-horse van driven by the prisoner at a very furious rate—I heard a shriek, looked towards the van and saw a man lying on the ground, and immediately both the wheels of the van went over him—there was a little check to his speed by the wheel going over the man, which raised the wheel five or six inches, and then the prisoner turned his horses' heads and drove on as fast as he could—I ran after him and said, "You wretch, stop, you have killed a man"—he said, "What is that to you?"—I shouted to him that he should have got out of the way—he still remained on his box where he was driving, and I said, "Come down and see what you have done"—he got down very reluctantly, and I discovered then that he was intoxicated—I am no judge of the speed of horses, but I should say that he was driving at the rate of two miles an hour—he was coming faster than a cab at its ordinary pace which was coming along on the near side, he passed that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not pretend to be a judge of pace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was examined before the Coroner, and am told that the verdict was accidental death—I will not say that I saw a whip, but the prisoner had the reins in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of London-road, Hackney—on 3d March, I was walking in the Mile End-road, and saw the prisoner with a van load of coals and two horses—I am accustomed to horses—he was going at the rate of seven miles an hour, not more—I saw the old man</p>

               <p>scraping the road, and saw the prisoner's van coming along thirty or forty yards off before it met him, and when it got six or eight yards from him, I heard the prisoner halloo out to him twice, bat the man did not appear to hear him, his back was to the van—the prisoner tried to constrain the horses, but could not, and after passing over the body he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> on one side, about fourteen or sixteen yards—when I had seen the man put into a cab I went to the van—the prisoner was ordered down, and he got down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the defendant shout out loudly to the man in the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, twice—any person possessed of the ordinary unimpaired faculty of hearing would have heard him—not hearing the shouting, the defendant endeavoured to pull up, but was not able to do so in time—the horses appeared fresh, one more so than the other—the road is very broad there, coming from Stepney-green to Cleveland-street—the direction is across the road, so as to bring him to what would be called his wrong side—he must necessarily have gone on his wrong side to get to Cleveland-street—the prisoner seemed rather excited when he stopped; but whether it was from the accident, I can't say—I have been accustomed to horses all my life—he did not appear to be driving at an unreasonable pace, as he was in a broad thoroughfare without any obstacle; but in a coal-van it did seem un<lb></lb>reasonable, because they generally walk—one horse was sluggish and the other very fresh.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, East-side, Bethnal-green—I was nearly opposite Cleveland-street, coming from the City, and meeting the van—it came at a very rapid rate, I should say ten miles an hour—I did not see the old man scraping the road till he was down; he was about level with me, but I was looking forward—when the very was raised, I turned to the van and saw him down, and several people round him—the van did not stop—the prisoner did not seem to be restraining it at all, but one of the people stopped him, and he was told that he had run over a person—he said that he ought to have got out of the way—I requested him to get down—he did not show that he was inclined to do so; in fact, he was more inclined to proceed—he did get down—he appeared to be the worse for liquor—I heard a shout—I do not know whether he made it or not—the van was then close on the man.</p>

               <p>Was that before or after her being brought to bed? - She did not appear to be different to what she used to be.</p>

               <p>What do you know of her being brought to bed of a child? - About three o'clock in the afternoon two of my children went to the vault; they came back and said they heard a noise of a child crying. Miss Gwatkin lodged with me. I went with the children and listened, but heard nothing; soon after other people in the house heard it afresh a second time, and then I heard it cry.</p>

            , a lodger, he attempted to take it out, but before he had accomplished it Mr. Ellis, who is now here, came to his assistance, and they took it out.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Ellis? - A jeweller, I believe, he lives at the next door.</p>
               <p>What condition was the child in when it was taken out? - I cannot say, I was so frightened that I fainted away, when I came to myself I saw it upon the carpet, and the ladies were cleaning it.</p>
               <p>When it was cleansed how did it appear? - I cannot say much of that for I went to take care of her, and did not attend the child.</p>
               <p>Did the child cry or move? - Yes, it cried. After the child was found the ladies were very desirous to know the mother. Then I taxed Miss Gwatkin with it, upon which she said, if I would walk into the parlour she would tell me. She said it was an accident, and that she had no thoughts of a murder.</p>
               <p>How did she account for it? - She said she had occasion to go to the vault; that she was delivered on the vault, and the child dropped into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150089"></xptr>At what time did the prisoner tell you she had been delivered of the child? - She did not tell me any time, nor did I ask her. I was in the yard from eleven o'clock till two hanging out some clothes and taking them in; I imagine I should have heard the child if it had then been in the vault, as I was close by the vault for the whole morning, and the yard is very small; it is not more than two yards square. At three o'clock in the morning I took the child out of the bed, it ate two spoonfuls of gruel, and it opened its eyes and appeared to me as well as any new born infant I ever had of my own; in half an hour after that it fell into a convulsion fit and died upon the nurse's knee.</p>
               <p>ELISABEEH TRACEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Robinson. I saw Miss Gwatkin at eight o'clock in the morning, when I went to open the door for a lady who is a lodger; she asked me to fetch her twopenny-worth of brandy; she said it was for Miss Baldwin's tooth-ach.</p>
               <p>Who is Miss Baldwin? - She is here; she lived in the house. Miss Baldwin came down in the morning, and said she had had a bad night with the tooth-ach. At eleven o'clock I saw Miss Gwatkin sitting at work as well as usual; the door was open as I passed by. I was down in the kitchen at about three o'clock when Miss Robinson came down into the kitchen, and said she heard a noise like a child or kitten in the vault. My mistress took a candle and looked down the necessary; upon this Mr. Dowson attempted to take up the board but could not. Mr. Ellis came down and took up two boards; he said there was a child; I returned into the kitchen and heard no more for two hours after. Between three and four in the morning the nurse called me up and said the child was in a fit. The child died in a fit.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child after it was taken out of the vault before it was in a fit? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you see it? - In a person's lap who was dressing it.</p>
               <p>How did it seem then? - Very well.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - That was between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner's having told any body of her having been delivered of a child? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of this matter? - No further than that Miss Gwatkin took the candle once and looked down the vault; she said it could be nothing but a kitton. It must have rolled down under the boards.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect it to be a child then? - No, I thought it to be a kitten then.</p>
               <p>When was this? - At the time of the alarm, before the boards were taken up.</p>

               <p>At about two o'clock I believe, or it might be half after, I took up the boards of the necessary house, and found the child there.</p>
               <p>Could you form any conjecture how long it had been there? - No.</p>
               <p>When it was cleaned in what condition of health was it? - It cried. As soon as I had taken it out I delivered it to Mrs. Bailey, and went for a midwife to the mother. I brought Mr. Jackson, an apothecary in Newgate-street; he has a partner that is a man-midwife; he was not in the way; we begged Mr. Jackson to come and attend the woman.</p>
               <p>Was the child in good health or bad? - It appeared in pretty good health; Mr. Jackson thought it might live; so did I.</p>
               <p>In good health was it? - Pretty good health; not so hearty as it might have been if it had not been down there. I thought it was likely. to live.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child afterwards? - Yes; I saw it again in the evening about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How was it then? - Revived very much to what it was before; it cried, and they talked that it had ate; I did not see it eat, but it was more lively. The next day I heard of its death. I live at the next house; I was not present when it died.</p>
               <p>Mr. JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of July last Mr. Ellis came for my partner; he not being in the way, I attended him to the house to see the infant.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150090"></xptr>In what condition did you send it? - I found it washed, and the umbilical chord (the navel string) had not been secured; I therefore immediately secured that, and desired them to rub the stomach of the child with a little warm brandy; I thought the child might recover.</p>
               <p>You found it rather sick? - Rather sick and faint.</p>
               <p>At what time was you called? - About four in the afternoon. I waited about a quarter of an hour with the child, I found it so much better, that I desired them to use the brandy, and to rub it with flannel, as I thought there was a great probability of the child's recovering.</p>
               <p>When did you see the child again? - About eight in the evening; it was then better in every respect; I then took with me Mr. Wade, my partner, we found the child better, and were both of opinion the child would recover.</p>
               <p>Did you think it had recovered, or had any remains of the languor occasioned by the exposition? - Very little of the languor; it recovered in every respect; we directed the child to be put up in the warm bed with the mother; and Mr. Wade upon coming down said that the prisoner was much pleased at seeing the child so much recovered, she said every thing should be done that could to save it, and every thing she could do for restoring it.</p>
               <p>Did you continue to attend the child? - I did not see it any more; I called in the morning and found the child dead. They told me it died about four in the morning of a convulsive sit in the nurse's lap.</p>
               <p>Do you conceive that convulsive fit to be in any degree occasioned by the situation in which the child originally was? - It is almost impossible to answer that. There are many infants that die of convulsions that appear very likely to live; and it is very clear that the child was not much hurt by the stench of the place as it lived near thirteen hours afterwards. I cannot say positively to that question.</p>
               <p>Do you incline to think that was not the cause of its death? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You say the child was almost well? - It was abundantly better in the evening in every respect, and I had hopes of its recovery.</p>
               <p>Were your hopes of its recovery very strong in the evening about seven o'clock? - Yes, both myself and partner were of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Then you thought it would recover? - I had scarce a doubt of its recovery, nor had my partner.</p>
               <p>When you say you had scarce any doubt that the child would recover, you seem to acknowledge that their was a little remains of the languor still upon it? - There was, but it was trifling.</p>
               <p>You practise midwifery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think this child was come to its full time? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Have not you known some instances in the course of your practice, where women have been suddenly taken in labour? - My partner practises midwifery.</p>
               <p>But from that sort of intercourse you have with your partner do not you think it possible that women in certain situations might be delivered at a time not expected? - There are many instances of that.</p>
               <p>Had this child any mark of violence on it at the time you saw it? - I forgot to mention that I carefully examined when I first saw the child, and there was not the least mark of violence upon it. I was not satisfied with my own examination, but likewise desired Mr. Wade to examine, and neither of us could find the least mark of any violence upon it.</p>
               <p>When did the mother express her satisfaction that the child was so well? - When it was carried up between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Whether you think it possible that a woman, being at a necessary, upon a needful occasion, may be taken in labour, and for the child to drop from her into the necessary without her putting it there? - I have made enquiry respecting that; I have never known an instance of it; I have frequently heard of its being so, and I was informed of a lady, whose name it may not be necessary to mention here, that had her child drop into the necessary. I think it very probable.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 23rd of July Mr. Ellis came to me between the hours of one and three, and asked me to lend him a hammer, a hatchet and a chissel; I lent them to him; in five minutes after that another gentleman came and said there was a child in the vault. I went immediately to Mr. Robinson's, which was next door to my house, when I came there Mr. Ellis had got up one board; then I saw the child's feet; he took up the other board and took out the child, and put it into a lodger's apron; I put that apron into my apron and carried it into the fore parlour; the child cried twice before we took it out of the vault; but I do not remember its crying afterwards till we got it into the parlour; it was then very faint and low; I rubbed it with things, and did all I could to bring it to itself; I asked for something to wash the child with; I desired Mr. Ellis to go to my house and bring some warm water which was on the fire, and some Holland's Geneva, which he did. I was in a fright. Mr. Bailey said to Mrs. Robinson, who have you had in your house to day? she said no stranger; then one of the gentlemen said the mother of the child must be in the room. I wrapped the child up, and laid it on the floor, and said to the prisoner, I beg your pardon, ma'am, but you are the mother of the child, she said, O no, I am not; I said do not deny it, you are; she said for God's sake have mercy! we went into the room together; I said if you are the mother of the child, for God's sake do not deny it, she said I am the mother of the child! I said stay here, I will fetch something for you; in my flurry instead of bringing things fit for the mother and child, I brought some old rough dried shirts of Mr. Bailey's.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner confessed she was the mother of the child, did she tell you any thing about the manner of her delivery? - She said she was upon the vault and it fell from her.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she did not tell of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - I am.</p>
               <p>Can you give an opinion respecting it? - There is a difference in women.</p>
               <p>Do you think there are any women to whom that accident might happen? - I do not think it possible.</p>
               <p>You said there is a difference in women, but do not you think it possible with any woman? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I do not understand that you have ever practised as a midwife? - No.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ground of your observation must be very confined indeed? - I have been the mother of children.</p>
               <p>As you have not practised as a midwife, nor are yourself a very old woman, the possibility of information to you must be but little? - I answer according to my judgement.</p>
               <p>Court. You have only hitherto spoken of the state of the child when it was first taken out, and a quarter of an hour after, did you see the child in the after part of the evening? - I wrapped the child up in a petticoat and put it on the carpet, I found it very cold, after that I carried it down to the fire, and warmed it as well as I could; I never saw the child after that day till the coroner's inquest sat upon it.</p>
               <p>In what condition was it when you saw it about five o'clock? - Very weak and low, but I think stronger than when I took it out, it had recovered in some measure.</p>
               <p>When you saw it at five, you say it was a good deal better, but did you think it was quite recovered of the first sickness? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you expect it would live at that time? - I cannot say, I did.</p>

               <p>Did she never say at what hour she was delivered? - She did not</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BALDWIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the affair, I know nothing of the murder.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the condition of the child? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see the child? - Between two and three o'clock upon Mrs. Robinson's carpet, it was then wrapped up in an apron.</p>
               <p>How was the child as to its health and vigour? - It was wrapped up and I did not see it.</p>
               <p>When did you see it? - When it was dressed, at about six o'clock, at the time my sister saw it.</p>
               <p>How did it appear then? - Very well; as well as a new born infant generally does.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Miss Gwatkin give any account of her delivery? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Not after the thing was found out? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her no questions about it? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further of this matter? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are I believe a man-midwife and surgeon? - I am.</p>
               <p>You have been in court and heard the evidence in the course of the trial? - I have.</p>
               <p>Then from your experience and knowledge in the profession, I beg you will state to the court whether it is not extremely probable and possible for women to be delivered in the manner you have heard described? - It is certainly possible, I have known several instances in the course of my practice where I have been very near at hand and have been called and when I have attended my patient, I have found a child born.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a man-midwife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you practiced that profession? - Nine years.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever known any instance that makes it possible for a woman not to be delivered suddenly by herself without assistance, but in such a manner that she being upon the necessary house the child might drop into the hole? are you of opinion that might happen? - I am clear it can happen.</p>
               <p>Could not a woman who should find herself in that situation rise from the seat so as to prevent the child from dropping into the hole? - I cannot answer to that.</p>
               <p>Court. If she had a mind to drop it there she might perhaps, the question is whether she could not prevent it? - To that I cannot answer.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>How long have you practised midwifery - About twenty-three years.</p>
               <p>Have you, in the course of your practice, known any such sudden deliveries as that, if a woman had been at the necessary-house, she could not have moved from the place so as to have prevented dropping the child down the hole? - I have known women delivered at the camp-necessaries drop the children into the hole, not being able to help themselves; those children have been taken up, and though bruised they have lived, and the languor of this child might very easily be accounted for from the umbilical chord not being secured.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150093"></xptr>I believe you may know that very young children are often taken off, with convulsion fits exceeding suddenly? - The most healthy children often are.</p>
               <p>Where you have had no expectation of it before? - Very suddenly.</p>
               <p>Dr. DOMINICETI sworn.</p>
               <p>I have delivered 2000 women of children. I have seen instances of women being at the little-house, going through other evacuations, and the child has followed.</p>
               <p>In those cases could not the woman remove from the place? - It is impossible when it is so sudden. I never heard the name of the prisoner, nor anything about her, only being present in court I speak what I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. DEPUTY AXFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>You know, I believe, the young woman at the bar? - I do.</p>
               <p>And her family and connexions? - I do.</p>
               <p>What has been her reputation and character? - Respecting her family they are equal to any people in the country of Hereford; as to her character, when she came to London she has been at my house, and Mr. Alderman Sainsbury's, and some houses that I know who have connexions with her family, but on account of a little dispute between her family and her she thought proper to get into some business to earn her bread, in consequence of which she went to work for a linen-draper at the other end of the town; he came to me to enquire her character; I told him I would be answerable to any amount he might entrust her with, and if she had applied to me I should have entrusted her with any thing she might have wanted. I could not have conceived she could be capable of destroying a child of her own body.</p>

            . I believe you looked into the box of the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you find any child bed linen there? - Yes, I did. I went to the box to look for something she wanted, and I found some child-bed linen there.</p>
               <p>When you came to nurse her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether there were any marks of convulsion sits in the child after it was dead? - It looked very black and very much convulsed all over.</p>

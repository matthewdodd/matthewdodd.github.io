            . I live in St. Martin's-street, I am apprentice to Mrs. Kelly, I missed a couple of aprons, and suspected the prisoner at the bar; she was going to take a pair of sleeves out of pawn; I went after her to see where she went; I followed her to Mr. Hodges's, a pawnbroker in Green-street; I saw her go in; I went there after she was gone, and asked if they had not two aprons pawned by that person. They were produced to me. After that I asked the prisoner if she pawned them there; she denied it, but at last she owned that she did carry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>E. Harding. She was a workwoman where I was apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lodge in the house?</p>
               <p>E. Harding. She did.</p>
               <p>Riley. I cannot be positive to the prisoner, these two aprons were pawned at our shop by one

            ; she had used our house about two months; one was pawned on the 11th, the other the 15th of July. The prosecutrix came and asked me if we had not a person of that name that used our shop, that had pawned such aprons, so I fetched them down. The woman that pawned them had a duplicate away with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call a duplicate?</p>
               <p>Riley. We make two papers of what the people bring, and she had one, and we kept the other [Producing one.] This is that which I kept.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Here is the other, it was found in the prisoner's trunk; I saw it taken out by Mr. Kelly. [Produced, and compared.]</p>
               <p>Riley. These are both alike, and this last produced, the person that pawned the aprons had away with her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

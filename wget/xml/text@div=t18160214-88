She had lived with me upwards of two years, and was employed in washing some linen the week before Christmas. After that the linen in question was missed, and was not forthcoming. He was questioned by me repeatedly concerning it, and made various equivocating replies; that it was gone to be ironed; that it was taken to be mangled. I then taxed her with having pawned it, and she gave up three duplicates. I went to the pawnbroker's and identified the linen. Under an impression that she was connected with others, I went to the Police-office, and Mr. Leach committed her for a week, and then her father came up from Denbigh. She always conducted herself with honesty in my service.</p>

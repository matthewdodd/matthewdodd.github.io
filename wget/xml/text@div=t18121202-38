            . Q. Will you state to the court what you know of the charge against the prisoners at the bar - A. I cannot swear to these men at the bar. I do not know their persons, nor that they robbed me. On the 7th of November I was going through the Temple with a gentlewoman. We were talking about business. It was about a quarter past eight, or thereabouts; and as I was going along a number of men surrounded me. Just at the entrance of the Temple, by the first block, by the fountain; some man struck me on the chest, and another man took hold of my seals of my watch, and broke my chain. It was gone in a moment; and by my falling against the lady, she fell against the wall, and before I could recover myself from her, my seals were gone. I have never seen my seals since.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the persons of either of them that you saw that night, that probably took away your seals - 
               <persName id="t18121202-38-person449">A. </persName>
            No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar - A. I know them full well by seeing them at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them again, and tell me whether they are any of the persons that you saw that night - A. I cannot swear that they are either of them.</p>

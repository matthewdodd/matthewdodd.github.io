                  </hi>. I live at Armitage, in Staffordshire, and am a boatman. On the 6th of June I was on board Robins's boat—I came up with it to the Paddington Canal—I had a watch in my watch-pocket—I had two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a four penny piece, in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—I laid down in the boat, and went to sleep, at nine o'clock—I do not know who was in the boat—I awoke at one o'clock—at that time my watch and money were safe—I went to sleep again, and awoke at two o'clock, and then my watch and money were gone—I looked about to see who had taken my money, but I could not find any one—I went away, and then went to the boat again—a young man who was in the boat with me told me something—from what he said, I looked about, and the watch was found—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

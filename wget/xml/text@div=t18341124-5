                  </hi>. I am the son of George Dibden Pitt, of Gibraltar-row, West-square. On Friday the 8th of August, I went out to fish—I went to a ditch near the Surrey canal, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a child in the ditch—it was in the water, lying on its side—it had its clothes on—the water did not quite cover it—I did not touch it, but called a man named Carter—I saw nobody but Carter—he was about one hundred yards off, walking along—he came and took the child out of the ditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener and labourer, and live in Downing-street, Camberwell—on the 8th of August, I was near the Surrey canal—Pitt called to me—I instantly ran to him, as he said there was a child in the water—I saw the child lying in the water, on its left side, in the ditch, which runs parallel with the canal—it is a ditch made to take the waste water—it is of a clayey nature at the bottom—it had been cleaned out a fortnight before, I believe; but there was mud and clay at the bottom—I should think the water was about eight inches deep—I instantly ran to the child—it was lying on its left side, and its hand a little out of the water under its face—I got hold of its left arm with my right hand, and when I pulled it, the shoulder cracked—it is a good bit down from the bank to the water—I should think it is from a foot to fourteen inches—the top of the bank, which is the towing path, is about six feet—I let go of the arm and got down, and took hold of the child under both its armpits—it still seemed to me to stick, as if it was forced in by some means—I had a difficulty in getting it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgement, would the weight of the child by itself have buried it so deep in the mud as it was, if it had fallen from the bank by accident, or any means? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I should think not; for there was a great quantity of flags there, and there was sufficient strength in them—they are strong enough to keep a heavier weight than that from sinking so deep—there was a handful of flags lying on the bank, as if they had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240018"></xptr>
               <p>just pulled out—they were wet, green, and fresh, as if just pulled up—I took the child out to the top of the bank, and called a veterinary surgeon, named Eldridge, whom I saw in Mr. Moseley's yard, about one hundred and thirty yards off—he came instantly and felt the child's pulse—he said he thought he could feel the pulse still beating—I ran from there to the Albany Arms as fast as I could—it is two or three hundred yards—I took the child with me, and got a hot bath ready as quick as possible—they had hot water in the house—I stripped the child and put it in—I ran directly and fetched Mr. Haskey, a medical gentleman, who attended to it instantly—I should think it was nearly a quarter of an hour from the time I first saw the child till Mr. Haskey came—every means were used to recover it, but in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By "flags," I suppose you mean green flags that grow by rivers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave the same account before the Coroner as I have now, that it required more than extra exertion to lift it out of the mud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say it might have happened from the child rolling down the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the sinking into the mud—I said I thought it was forced into the mud—I said it might have rolled down the bank into the ditch—I said that was not impossible—it is possible it might have rolled down into the ditch—I examined the body of the child—there were no marks of violence on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the Coroner were you asked, at the close of the ex<lb></lb>amination, whether the child might have rolled down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said it was possible it might—the flags on the bank were only on that particular part—they were fresh gathered, as if pulled just out of the spot where the child lay, and the flags under where the child lay were driven into the mud—I went and examined them afterwards—there were no footmarks by the side of the ditch—it was impossible to see them, as it is turf and gravel—it had been raining for two days before—when I went down to take the child out, the footh-path against the side which had been fresh cut gave way, and my foot slipped—I made no impression, with my feet on the top of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the flags to be taken out fresh and green, was it necessary, to enable a person to take them out, to have gone down from the top of the bank, to the place where you were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He must have gone down from the towing path to the lower path—I saw no marks there—the per<lb></lb>son must either have knelt down, or put their feet right into the water to get at them—I saw no knee marks—the nature of the flat part of the bank would not make even an impression of a heavy shoe—I stood on the lower bank in the first instance, and reached the body without putting my feet in the water; but finding it would not come up, I was obliged to put my foot down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a child had rolled from the upper foot-path, would it have rolled into the water, or only on the lower foot-path? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might, if it had tripped head over heels—the bottom bank is not above two feet or eighteen inches—I cannot say whether, in that case, it would have gone so far into the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of the parish of Camberwell. I knew the child, Charlotte Matilda Finnegan, in its lifetime—I saw the body of a child at the Albany Arms, on Friday evening, the 8th of August—it was the body of the child who I knew as Charlotte Matilda Finnigan—I was sent for when the prisoner was brought to the station-house—I have the clothes of the child—I recollect seeing her in these clothes at church—they were covered with clay mud—I have a plan of the spot—it is impossible for a child to get there by itself, as they were bring<lb></lb>ing loam to raise the road, and it was all along—if the child had been on the towing path, it was not impossible for it to fall into the ditch—I know the bridge across the canal from the side of the water nearest to his father's house—it is about eight hundred feet from the bridge to where the body of the child was discovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you present at the christening of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the prisoner's sister told me its name; and I removed the prisoner, his wife, and child, in 1833 from our parish to Lambeth, and know its name by that—the prisoner's sister lives with her father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left the child there under great excitement of mind, and I cannot tell how it came by its death.</p>

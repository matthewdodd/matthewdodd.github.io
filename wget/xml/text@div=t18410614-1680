                  </hi>. I am secretary to the London and West<lb></lb>minster Steam-boat Company. Charles William Christie is one of the trustees, and there are others—the prisoner was in the employ of the com<lb></lb>pany for three seasons—he was to attend at Westminster-pier every morn<lb></lb>ing, and receive from the chief-receiver small tickets which were put up in a book containing from 400 to 500, and to give each passenger one of them at his station, which was the Old Shades-pier, near London-bridge, on receiving 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at night he was to account for each ticket which was not left in his book—these tickets enable the persons who receive them to land, and when they land they give them up—a Mr. Brown was employed to settle with all the collectors at night—he was the only person to whom they should account—on the 13th of May a communication was made to me by Tyrrell, who was a check-taker at Hungerford-market pier—it was his duty to receive a ticket from all persons landing there—in consequence of what Tyrrell said to me I communicated with the directors, and I then caused Tyrrell to mark some tickets and supply the prisoner with them from time to time—in consequence of what afterwards transpired I had the prisoner apprehended on the Tuesday week following—I was present when he was taken—he was searched in my presence, and this roll of tickets, screwed up together in a small piece of paper, found on him—he said they were thrown into his box on the Sunday night by the owners of the Old Shades-pier—the owners of the Old Shades-pier have no access to our tickets—neither the prisoner, nor any person employed in a similar capacity, are authorized to issue any ticket which is not in one of these books.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Tyrrell been in your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten or eleven days—less than a fortnight—the prisoner has been in custody since the 20th of May—two receivers have been discharged since then—one was discharged because the station was broken up, and the other because the Company had not confidence in him—we have another person in the prisoner's place—I have heard that Tyrrell has been in the police—he was recommended to our Company by the Eastern Counties Railway Company—the prisoner came most highly recommended to our employers by Mr. Seager, who attended here yester<lb></lb>day to give him a character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these check-books always regularly made up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in that way this one is—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—each one should contain 500 checks—the yare sometimes incorrect, but that is explained at night—it is the duty of each check-taker to hand them to Mr. Brown at night, and the numbers ought to correspond with the numbers taken out of the books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the London and West<lb></lb>minster Steam-boat Company, and have been so since the 21st or 22nd of April—I am stationed at Hungerford station—it is my duty to receive tickets from persons who travel by the boats, and to deliver them up at night to Mr. Brown—I know the prisoner—he was in the Company's ser<lb></lb>vice</p>

               <p>before me. On Tuesday morning, the 11th of May, the prisoner and I met at the station at Westminster in the ordinary way of business he called me on one side and said he wished to speak to me, which way did I leave Hungerford at night, I being the last person on duty—I told him which way I went home, and he said he should like to meet me at the Swan public-house, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I agreed to meet him there, and did meet him from half-past nine to ten o'clock—he said to me, "Well, Tyrrell, our wages are very low"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I can tell you how they can be made better"—we walked round Cannon-row, and he wished me to go another way to elude Mr. Brown—we did so, and he said, would I supply him with six dozen of tickets a day, of his issuing from the Shades—I told him, well, I would consider of it—it would require some little consideration—he said, "Well, see what you can do to-morrow—I know what Hungerford is—you can supply some from there"—he said the general thing was to allow the collector 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, but for every six dozen I could supply him with, he would allow me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was nothing more passed between us that night—I endea<lb></lb>voured to see Mr. Leith on the following day, but could not—I saw him on the Thursday, and I communicated to him what had passed between me and the prisoner—by Mr. Leith's direction, I marked three dozen of tickets on Friday the 14th of May, and supplied the prisoner with them—he did not pay me for them that day—on Saturday the 15th, I supplied him with three dozen more, and he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two three dozens; on Sunday the 16th, he had three dozen; on Monday the 17th, four dozen, and I received 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him; on Tuesday the 18th, he had four dozen, and on Wednesday the 19th, four dozen, for which I did not re<lb></lb>ceive any thing—those which I gave him on Wednesday the 19th, were rolled up in a round piece of paper—they were all marked and loose—they were tickets which had been collected on Tuesday, the loth—I collected five of those marked tickets at the Hungerford station—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">lookingat them.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is that book you have in your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a list of the tickets collected at Hungerford—I am not aware that there is any thing but dates and numbers in it—I did not keep a minute of the conversation I had with the prisoner—when I first met him that night at the Swan public-house, he took me by the arm, and said our wages were very low, and if I could keep my word, and he thought I was a person he could depend upon, he could tell me how the wages might be made better; and when we got to Parliament-street, he made the proposi-tion—when he said he thought I was to be depended on, I said I was, or something to that effect—I think I am a man to be depended upon—I am as honest in my calling as you are in yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So you listened to his proposition, and pretended to be friendly to him, and intended to betray him the moment you had opportunity, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the first opportunity I had to give the information I re<lb></lb>ceived—he said he wished me to supply him with six dozen tickets per day, and for every six dozen he would allow me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he named no other number to me—he said about six dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you never say that his proposition was from four to six dozen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His proposition was about six dozen—I might say from four to six—I could not swear to that now—he said about six dozen a day—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen was the regular price, but he would give</p>

               <p>me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for every six dozen—I said I would see, it required some little consideration—I did afterwards say, "Is that all, only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes, you know we run all the risks and hazards"—I believe I have not stated that before, because I was not asked the question—I have not invented it—I have worked some time on the Eastern Counties Railway—before that I was in the police for about seven years altogether—I resigned once or twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They coaxed you back again, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my friends got me back—I left the first time to go to Sir Thomas Forbes Reynolds, as a watchman—I left of my own accord to go there, and after I was not re<lb></lb>quired at Sir Thomas's any longer, I returned, and Mr. Day gave me a recommendation to go back into the police—I did not resign a second time—I was discharged for getting a drop of drink—I cannot swear how many charges were made against me before the one on which I was dis<lb></lb>charged—they were chiefly for drinking, I believe—I have been reported for talking to a person on duty—I cannot say how many times I was re<lb></lb>ported, it was not thirty times, it might have been twenty—I am not positive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am told you got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward once, is that true? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Did lever swear such a thing as that? Why did not you ask if I got 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? I never said so; I do not know what 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward has to do with this business—I never got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have got a reward for apprehending a person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say you got it for shooting a man? now swear you did not, if you dare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir, nor nothing of the kind—the prisoner tried to take me in—I did not intend to trap him—I do not expect to get any promotion or reward for this—if any was offered me I would take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you employed in the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost seven years, and it is nearly seven years since I left it—I cannot now remember how many charges might have been made against me—they were for drunkenness, or talking on duty, or paltry reports.</p>

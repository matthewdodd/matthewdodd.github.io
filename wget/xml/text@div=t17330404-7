            . The Prosecutor came to me in Drury-Lane Playhouse-Passage, and asked for a Constable. I went with him to the House, where we found only the Prisoner. I ask'd him, if it was she that took his Watch, he said, No, the Women that took it were gone. I told the Prisoner if she'd procure the Watch I'd give her half a Guinea. Give it me then, says she, and I'll find the Watch. Will you so? Says I, then if you can find it for half a Guinea you shall find it without. But she would not, and so she was sent to Bridewell, and while she was there, the Watch was sent to the Keeper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a poor desolate Girl, and had been but a Week in the House, but I thought it was better to be in any Business than to live idle. The Prosecutor came home with my Mistress, and they and another Woman had two Quarterns of Brandy, for which he paid me a Shilling, and then bid me go out, which I did, and in about an Hour he and the Women went out together, and afterwards he came again with a Constable, and said, he had lost his Watch, and offer'd me half a Guinea to help him to it again; but because I could not, he had me before Justice De Veil, and so I was sent to Bridewell.

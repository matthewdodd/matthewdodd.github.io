               <p>Do they appear to be of the same mould? - They are not the same pattern as that is; I do not know that either of them is; but they are fresh, because the very blackness that they put on the colouring is on them now.</p>
               <p>Look at that little pot? - That is the blacking they make use in colouring sixpences.</p>

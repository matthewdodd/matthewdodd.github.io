                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Cox's-square, Houndsditch. On the 6th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I went into a beer-shop in the Fulham-road—I had a bundle, containing some shawls, with me—I called for a pint of beer, and afterwards for another pint—Mrs. Salmon and another woman were in the bar—I was there about half. an-hour—I was tired, and said to Mrs. Salmon, "Can you tell me where I can get a lodging?"—she said, "I can accommodate you with a good lodg<lb></lb>ing, you can sleep here"—I left my bundle in her possession, went into the tap-room, and dozed for about five or ten minutes—I then went to the bar<lb></lb>again, and saw my bundle—I thought it felt different—I opened it, missed four shawls, and said, "Mrs. Salmon, I am robbed, and nobody has robbed me but you"—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I took out the four papers the shawls had been wrapped in—Mrs. Salmon directly took and threw them on the fire—I said, "I am a poor man, give me my pro<lb></lb>perty back again, and I won't hurt you"—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—in about ten minutes another woman, who was in her com<lb></lb>pany at the time, and M'Cormack, came in—they called me a b foreign I b——, and the other woman gave me two slaps on the mouth, which I had I the marks of for a week—I said to Salmon, "Look how I am served; I am robbed, and beat into the bargain"—she said, "Serve you right, why I say you were robbed? you were never robbed in your life"—in about fire minutes in came her husband—he said, "What is the row?"—she said, "This foreigner says he is robbed; he has drunk three pints of beer, and won't pay me; and I won't give him his bundle up, because he has no money"—I had no money—I had paid 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave her a pin for the rest—her husband said, "What is the matter?"—she said so and so—he said, "Why don't you <hi rend="italic">split</hi>? then you are clear"—she would not say—another woman said, "That woman next door"—I went to one police-man, but be would not take the charge—I got another policeman, told him what had happened, and we went next door, where M'Corroack lives—she was with Mrs. Salmon when I gave her my bundle to take care of, and another woman too—we went up stairs into M'Cormack's room, and the policeman found one of my shawls under the bed—she was down stairs at the time—I directly gave her in charge—she said she knew nothing at all about it—it was very lucky there were two policemen to protect me, I might have been killed, for in about a quarter of an hour there were more than thirty women round me.</p>

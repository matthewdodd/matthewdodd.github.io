                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Horace-street, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. On the 12th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I came out of No. 1, Horace-street, and saw Michael Sheehan and the pri<lb></lb>soner's husband fighting—her husband said to me, "Do you think worse of your brother than you do of me?"—I said, "Yes, certainly," and he knocked me down—my brother was nearer to me than I was to Sullivan—I did not think my brother the most in fault—I was not there at the com<lb></lb>mencement—when Sullivan knocked me down, the prisoner came with a knife and struck me in the face—I had struck her husband after he struck me, and then her brother struck my brother—she made a second attempt, and a man <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her off—she made a third attempt at my brother, and wounded her husband—tbey were fighting—I followed her into the room, and said, "Mary Sullivan, I give you in charge for stabbing me"—she instantly threw the knife away—it was a (able knife—my wound was dressed at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Tooting-court, Marylebone. I heard the cry of "Murder," and found the two Sheehans lying on the ground, and the prisoner's husband over them—I did pot see the prisoner when I first came up, but the persons around hallooed, "Murder! the knife"—I looked round, and saw the prisoner with the knife, stabbing the man—she went off, and I went after her—I saw the knife in her hand—I am not related to any of the parties—I saw Sheehan's head bleeding a little.</p>

I saw Michael Sheehan and Patrick Sullivan arguing with one another—Michael Sheehan wanted to fight Sullivan—Sullivan did not want to fight with him—he said he would fight—Sullivan said, "If I have no other way of extricating myself from you, I suppose I must fight"—Michael Sheehan struck Sullivan, and they struck one another—they had another quarrel after that—Sullivan came out and struck Sheehan with a stick, and tumbled him on the street—William Sheehan was also in the street, and they were all three tumbled down—I saw the prisoner come up with a knife—William Sheehan was fighting with her husband as well as Michael—he came to his brother's assistance, as far as I could see—they were all three down—the prisoner first struck William, and then attempted to strike Michael, but in doing so she struck her husband.</p>

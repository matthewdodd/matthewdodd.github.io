                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Aston, of King-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields, in the parish of Christchurch: it is our dwelling-house. My hus<lb></lb>band went out on Thursday night, a little before twelve o'clock—he left the key behind him—I ran after him with it, and locked the door—I am sore of that—I returned in about five minutes, and when I was three doors from my window I saw a man jump out of the window, and one out of the passage—I called "Stop thief," ran after them, but could not see any thing of them—I returned again, unlocked my door, went in, and missed my new gown—I went back, but could see nothing of them—I saw a po<lb></lb>liceman, who called me—this is the gown now produced, and shawl also.</p>

About twelve o'clock at night I heard the cries of a woman—I met the prisoner running, and stopped him—he had the gown and shawl under his arm—I observed the premises—the shutters had been forced—there was a bolt in the middle of the shatters—they had been pulled open by main force—the loop the bolt goes into was wrenched from the shutters, and the window was open.</p>

On Sunday night, the 23d of August, I let down a fare on the Surry side of Westminster-bridge - I was a little intoxicated: as I returned I met a person who looked like a groom, and he offered me 6 d. to take him as far as I went. We had something to drink at a house in Long-acre. I think I had about 24 s. or 25 s. in my pocket. On the Monday morning I saw the prisoner at my house in Little Britain; he came about nine o'clock, and said he was one of the persons who assisted me in getting into the coach the night before, and that he was accused of having taking some money from my pocket; that he was innocent - but if it came before a Magistrate, as he was afraid it would, for he was spited by the other parties, it would be his ruin - but I could serve him very much if I would say I put the money on the seat of the coach. I told him I could not say what I had done with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you not had other persons about you - A. Yes.</p>

            . On Monday morning, 24th August, about two o'clock, I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles, I heard a rattle sprung - I went to the place, and found several watchman and the prisoner at the bar, and another witness; they all stood round Vane: I enquired into the case, and the people said he had fallen from the box of the coach; I told them to take him to the workhouse doctor; I then lifted him up, and he seemed to talk; the waterman said he knew the man - we then took him to the coach, and I said put down his feet, and somebody get in the coach with him. The prisoner went in the coach and assisted in getting him in, there was a good light from the gas lamp; I stood with one foot on the step of the coach, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the waistcoat or breeches pocket of the prosecutor, and take it out again, and heard some silver larger than shillings, chink, I said</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what are you about," I then took the watchman's lantern got in, and took the money off the seat of the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"See what my own fellow-servant has been doing."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What situation is the prisoner in - A. He is a supernumerary patrol, and has been so about one year and nine months - I did not swear at the Police Office that his hand was in his waistcoat pocket; I said it was his waistcoat or breeches pocket; he had the man's body in his arms when he was helping him into the coach; there was quite light enough to see what he did; the prosecutors breeches were not loose, but I cannot tell whether the pockets were open or not - the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, but the night patrol did not take him in charge, but told us to go on our duty, and to appear the next morning at the office. He attended voluntarily at Marlborough-street; and said</p>
               <p>"I was mistaken, for the money fell out of his pockets in getting him into the coach" - this happened about two o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 23d of July, I was in St. Giles's; I went to the coach, and saw the prisoner there among the rest; I heard Price say as he was standing on the coach step,</p>
               <p>"What are you at," Price then got into the coach, and brought out five half-crowns, which he said he had taken from under where the prisoner had sat, on the seat of the coach.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160017"></xptr>when Price first got in, he said</p>
               <p>"Here is money he has been robbing the man of," and he brought it out. Peperow said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Peperow say it had fallen out of his pocket - A. No, he said he knew nothing about it. I am a patrol, and have been so for three years; I never had a word with the prisoner in my life - he got into the coach first, and then helped to get the man in; I believe the man's feet went in first.</p>

            . I am the beadle. On the morning of the robbery, Price said he had a curious charge against his brother patrol; I said</p>
               <p>"This charge shall not be overlooked" I sent them about their business, and went to the coach, and saw a watch ribbon, I said</p>
               <p>"We will have the man out and properly searched" - I then found that his watch was safe, and in one of his pockets 9 s. 1 3/4 d., which I have here; his pockets were both buttoned when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When you looked at the man's pockets were they buttoned - A. I believe they were - I believe Price and the prisoner had been on good terms.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK to VANE. Q. Do you judge of what you had in your pocket, by what you took out in the morning, and what you took in the day - A. Yes; but I do not know how much I spent with the man to whom I gave the ride; I might have drank some more afterwards - my box coat was taken from the box while I was drinking with that man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I merely state that I requested Mr. Rowe to search me at the watch-house, which he refused to do; I was then called back and searched, and 3 s. 6 d. was found on me, that was all.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you ever say that you had had a quarrel with the prisoner - A. No. I never stated that I knew the different watchmen had a quarrel with him, and that they would injure him if they could, nor any thing at all like it.</p>
               <p>J. GOVEY. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields; I have known the prisoner seven years, and never heard any thing against him - I have heard Suttie say more than once or twice, that the prisoner was naturally hated by the patrols, by making himself too officious - he said so about two months ago.</p>

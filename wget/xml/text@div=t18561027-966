                  </hi>. I reside with my mother, who keeps a ham and beef shop at No. 87, Leadenhall-street. About the end of Aug., or the beginning of Sept., the prisoner came to our shop, in company with his mother—he asked for some ham and beef—I served him with it—while he was there, he said he had known my father above twenty years ago, and that he had known the shop as long as that, and that he had known Mr. Pallet, the ward beadle, a great many years—he said his mother was in the receipt of a small pension—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay for the beef—he asked for a pen and ink, and wrote his name and address on the back, "Richard Crump Barford"—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—he wrote this in my presence—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which he took, and went away—I put the note in the cash box, there was no other there—about a fortnight afterwards, he came again, alone; he said he wanted some more ham and beef—he was served with it—his con<lb></lb>versation was just the same as before, very familiar, talking about Mr. Pal<lb></lb>let—he paid with another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I examined it, and saw that it had his own name endorsed on it, and two others, Miss Taylor, and Mr. Price—I placed that note also in the cash box, below the one that I had previously received—I gave him change, and he left—I saw him again not much more than a week afterwards, about the 26th or 27th Sept.—he asked for some ham and beef again, which he had—he said he was trying for a situation at the Clothworkers' Hall, and if he got it, he would try and get me the order to serve the Hall with hams—he asked me if his mother had been there—I said I had not seen her, and he said most likely she was over at Mr. Pallet's—he paid me for the ham and beef with another note—he wrote his name on it in my presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I placed it in the box, underneath the other two—on 4th Oct. I paid away the two notes which he had first given me—on 6th Oct the prisoner came again—he said, "I have come again to see you"—he asked for some ham and beef again—I served him with some, and a piece of German sausage, and three penny loaves—he produced another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and wrote his name, "Richard Barford;" and then he said, "I had better write my whole name," and he put "Crump" over—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I placed it in the cash box, underneath the last I had received—on the follow<lb></lb>ing day the two first notes, which I had paid away, were returned to me as forged—the prisoner came to the shop that afternoon; he said he wanted some beef—I told him I could not serve him with any more beef, and I had a charge against him for passing forged notes—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I gave the notes to the constable.</p>

               <p>he called <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, was with him; I do not know his name; I never saw him in my life before Earwaker introduced him to me; he said he was a cattle dealer, and said he had been to Croydon, and made a deal with one farmer John Cook; I was aware that a farmer, John Cook, did live at Croydon; this entirely took me off my guard; I had not the slightest idea or suspicion that the notes were forged, or I should not have offered them to any person; I put my own name and address on the back when I passed them; I have given every information to the detective for the apprehension of Earwaker, and I trust your Lordship will allow further time to allow the detective to apprehend Earwaker; I feel confident if he is taken I shall be quite able to prove I had no notion the notes were forged.")</p>

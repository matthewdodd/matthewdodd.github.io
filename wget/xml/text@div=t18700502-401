I am a potman, at the Crown Hotel, Cranbourne Passage—on the 8rh April, about 5.30 in the afternoon, I answered the bell of the coffee-room, and found the prisoner there—he called for a pot of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>, and I went to the bar and got it for him—he refused to pay me, paying that he would have it on trust—I told him that I could not give him trust—he said it was all right—he then said he would have a drink, and as he was going to take the pot of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi> for the purpose, I took it away, and was pro<lb></lb>ceeding towards the bar, when he followed me, as I thought, with the inten<lb></lb>tion of going out—when I had put the pot of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi> on the counter he struck me on the top of the head with some sharp instrument, and rushed into the private parlors—I followed him, and pulled off my watch and chain, with the intention of getting him out, when he struck me again on the forehead—blood flowed from the wounds, and I was taken to a chemist's, and then to the station-house, where I became insensible, and next I was taken to the hospital—I remember nothing more—I did not strike the pri<lb></lb>soner at all—we had no ill-words, and there was no ill-feeling whatever between us.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Argyle Square—on the afternoon of 8th April, I was at the Crown Hotel, Cranbourne Passage, and saw the prisoner there—I heard him ask the potman for a pot of ale on trust—the potman said he could not trust him, as he had paid the landlord for it previously to bringing it in—the prisoner then said "It is all right, I have had it from the landlord"—the potman would not let him have it, and said he should take it back again—the prisoner then went to drink out of the pot, and the potman took it away—the prisoner followed him, and then they returned, and the potman took off his watch and chain with the intention of removing him—then the prisoner took out a knife from his coat-pocket—I saw it open—he made three or four digs at the prosecutor, and struck him on the head—he was smothered in blood when we were carrying him across the road to the doctor's—the landlord came to his assistance—we afterwards took the potman to the hospital, and the prisoner was given in custody—it was A brown-handled knife, as far as I could see, and it opened with a click—I did not see what became of the knife afterwards—the prisoner had two friends with him, and I did not tee the knife after they left.</p>

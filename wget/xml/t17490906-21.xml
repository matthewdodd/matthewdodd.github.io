             at half an hour after eight-o'clock, his face and head were all bloody; I asked him how he came so, he told me three or four men met him at the bottom of Salt-peterbank and robbed him. I went with him to see if I could find them. We were told they run towards Tower-hill; we were directed to Murphey's house in Nightingale-lane. Murphy came out with his hanger drawn, and said, here is Murphy.

             drew his hanger. I was near him without a stick: I said to a fellow servant, lend me your stick; they took to their heels, and ran down Nightingale-lane; as we followed, a little boy told us, they were gone down Black-horse-yard; when we came up there, we were directed to a house in New-rag fair; there were then about twelve of us; this was the house where Boyd liv'd; there were two doors to the house, we surrounded it, and Boyd looked out at the window. I said to my wife, who followed us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174909060011"></xptr> get some links, which she did; we lighted them up; then we knock'd at the door and asked for Murphy; Boyd with a stick in his hand, came and opened it; (the stick was shewed in court, it was very bloody) he said, Gentlemen, come in and see if Murphy is here; Boyd run up stairs again, and we all concluded to go in: as I was going up stairs, the prisoner darted an iron spindle (which was put in a wooden handle) at my head, from above, but missed me, and I drew back. Then one of our company went up with a chair upon his head, and another walked near him with an iron bar belonging to the glass-house; when we got up, Dumsey was jump'd into bed with some of his cloaths on, and Boyd run up into the garret; there we took them, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Three other witnesses gave the same account.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was positive as to Boyd, and believed the bloody stick in his hand, was that which he had been used so ill with. He would not be positive as to Dumsey .</p>

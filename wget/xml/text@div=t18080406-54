               <p>Q. Is that the house in which you sleep. - A. Yes.</p>

There is a kitchen and a small paved wash-house that goes from the kitchen; in the washhouse there is a door that leads into the accompting house, and over the accompting house are these rooms situated.</p>

               <p>Q. You know nothing of the robbery not till you heard of the loss. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was this. - A. I think it was the 14th of March I received it, and on the 15th I heard it was lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Upon hearing it was lost what did you do. - A. I made every enquiry I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of the prisoner. - A. I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the enquiry that you made elsewhere, what did you do. - A. I was not determined about taking the prisoner up till about eight o'clock in the evening. I went to Hatton garden office; Trott came down with Eklesoe and me, and we took the prisoner up in St. John street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Trott searched him. - A. No, not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Trott produce any thing to you. - A. Trott brought the prisoner up stairs and produced three one pound notes and two papers, a bill of parcels and a receipt, and there was a new watch likewise produced in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you state any thing what the prisoner told you, tell me whether you said it would be better or worse for him if he did not confess. - A. Nothing was said to the prisoner at that time; we were occupied about looking at the notes and the watch; I gave my opinion the watch was new, that it could not be wore one day in my service, and that the bill of parcels had been found which was in the parcel that was stole, because it was a bill of parcels for goods paid for, and was enclosed in this parcel; the prisoner said that the papers did not concern any body, they were picked up in the street; I sent my young man to Rogers to enquire if that bill of parcels came with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Trott search him a second time. - A. Yes, Trott searched him a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner then. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-54-person518">A. </persName>
            Yes; When Trott was searching him the second time I told him I would prosecute him; I wished him to say where the property was.</p>
               <p>Court. At what place was this. - A. This was up stairs at the public house. Trott told him he had better tell us where the property was; he would say nothing at that time; Trott desired him and me to go up to one end of the room; he told me he would go into another room; in consequence of that we went into another room. When we got there I told him it was very evident<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060037"></xptr>that he had taken this parcel, as the papers that was enclosed in it were found upon him; he must know where the property was; I would make no promise, his objection was that I had threatened him I would prosecute him; he then told me that the watch he had bought in St. John street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Wykes, I am sure you do not mean to say any thing but what is the truth, of that I am quite satisfied; did not you make use of this expression, George, if you will confess, I will do what I can for you. - A. No such a thing; he told me that he paid for the watch a ten pound note and received the change, and I should find a good deal more money at his lodgings up two pair of stairs, No. 13, Northampton street; I should find the money in a box near to his door, it was in his jacket pocket, either on the top of his box or just withinside of his box; I went with Trott up to the pawnbroker's first, and left him at the Pewter Platter public house with the other officer; we went from the pawnbrokers to his lodgings, he had given us the key of his box; we went into the first room the door was open; we turned a little to the right to a door that went into the next room; his wife answered us, and opened the door; we found nothing in that room particular; Trott went back with the key of the box to the room where we went first into, he unlocked the box that was standing at the door; he brought out a jacket, holding it in this manner, hanging down, with the notes half out; Trott took them out to the amount of fifty seven pounds; we searched a little about, we found nothing else there as I recollect; we went to the Pewter Platter; the officer had taken him to prison. When I told him he had better tell me where the property was; he told me he had bought this watch with the ten pound note; he said there was a five pound note his wife. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. We must not hear what his wife told you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp This parcel was entrusted with you, and was booked for the Wellingborough coach, you are answerable for that property. - A. I do not conceive myself as answerable, because it was only booked as a parcel.</p>

               <p>Q. However it was put in your office to go by the Wellingborough coach. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the usual way to go into this accompting house to go into the bed rooms over it. - A. You must go into the yard to go to the bed rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in order to go to these bed rooms you must go through the yard and then up a staircase. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of this that you made no promise to him namely, saying George, if you will confess I will forgive you. - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not retire from Trott the officer for the purpose of getting from him what he had done with the property. - A. I thought he would tell me though he would not tell them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You found the property however in consequence of what he said. - A. Yes.</p>

            We understand you were applied to by Mr. Wykes to apprehend the prisoner. - A. I was, on the 15th of March in the evening; I went to St. John street with Mr. Wykes; I then told the prosecutor I did not like to go into the yard, but to send the person out to me; a person was sent out to me, I made enquiry whether the prisoner at the bar was gone out; I was present at the apprehending of the prisoner; the prisoner was taken by my brother officer

            , on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him. - A. I did directly; I took the prisoner to the public house, the Bull I think it is, nearly opposite of the Windmill; I there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060038"></xptr>searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find. - A. The first thing I found was a watch; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had it by him three years; on his saying that I looked at it, I said it could not have been long purchased; there was a mark inside of the silk so fresh and plain, I thought he could not have had it three years; my brother officer was searching his jacket pockets; while I was searching his small clothes he pulled out papers doubled up together, and threw them down to me to examine; among the papers is a bill and receipt, and a one pound note, doubled up of a heap, as if it was a piece of dirty paper; he was not searched before Mr. Wykes; then after that I took him up stairs to a private room, where Mr. Wykes was sitting; I then cautioned Mr. Wykes not to make him any promise, threat, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say this in the presence of the prisoner. - A. I did a great many times. He then begged to go with Mr. Wykes into a private room; I suffered them to go, Mr. Wykes said he would be answerable: they were there some time together, what passed I cannot answer for. I went in at last, they were so long, I said I could not wait any longer. When I went in he was then shedding of tears, he said he was sorry for what he had done, and he hoped his master would forgive him. (I forgot one thing; that was a key that I found upon him of his box, which I found before he went up to his master.) He said he was a guilty man, and part of the money he had stole was either on the box at home, or in the box, and that was the key that I had taken from him belonging to the box; I had learned before where he lodged; he then confessed that he had purchased this watch, and he would shew us where in St. John street, at a pawnbrokers, he would point out the shop; I went there and found he had changed a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the pawnbroker's name. - A. Newton is the servant's name; and the five pound note he had received in change, he had given to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that five pound note. - A. I found it at his wife's sister's her name is Kitty Payne; I had this note from her. I proceeded to his lodging; I found fifty seven pounds in his box, this key unlocked his box. There is one ten, two fives, seven two's, and twenty three one's; what makes the difference is the change of the notes, they are not the same notes.</p>

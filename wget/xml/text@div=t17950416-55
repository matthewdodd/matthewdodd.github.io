               <p>Q. How long was she in your lodgings? - Only three days. I had a suspicion that things were out of the room, and one of the neighbours told me that she laid a bed the greatest part of the second day; she came on Thursday the 12th, on the Monday following I insisted on coming into the room, and when I came into the room I found the bed quilt, sheet, and flat iron out of the room; I told her I insisted on knowing where they were gone; she said one was ar Mr. Parker's, Wood-street, and another was in St. Martins Le Grand. I have got the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the duplicates? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not force them from her? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I only wish to ask her if she did not give me till twelve o'clock to get these things out, and I had not time to go to my friends to get the money.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant; I produce a sheet pledged for one shilling and sixpence, by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it? - The 16th of March.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Good was with you at this time. - A. He was, and the sums were written by Mr. Good; Mr. Good very closely interrogated him respecting his being the person that certificate purported him to be.</p>

               <p>Q. Under what name did you address him then. - A. I did not address him by any name, I spoke to the landlord of the house; he was called by the name of George, and when he came I recognised him, I said your name is Mac Goven, he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt that the person that was described as George by the landlord, was the prisoner that you had seen the check given to. - A. I have no doubt, no more than I have of my existence.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was he on board your ship. - A. He came on board in Madras, May, 1804.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave your ship. - A. In China, November, 1804, he left the ship by being invalided, he was sick, he could not do his duty.</p>
               <p>Q. In your return home did you make any prizes. - A. None whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that these captures were made, was the prisoner on board of your ship. - A. He was not on board at any capture.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he not being on board at the time of any capture, he could not be entitled to any of the captures. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you know Mac Goven very well. - A. He was a favourite seaman, and always about my person.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with his hand writing. - A. No, I was not in that habit of intimacy with him, he was merely one of my bargeman, and constantly in my cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that certificate, and see the signature to it, whether that is your hand writing. - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask you, as knowing these two persons Calder and Mac Goven so well, is the prisoner at the bar Mac Goven, as he represented himself to be. - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he never was on board so as to be entitled to any prize money for the captures. - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Mac Goven. - A. I left him in the Carolina frigate, I came home with the admiral, he was on board that ship last August.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you leave him. - A. I left him on the 28th of February of the last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any part of that certificate your writing. - A. None at all of the certificate, it is so irregular (witness looking at the certificate). When I first saw the signature I had my doubts, I would not have so positively swore to it unless I had read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You mean by that it is quite impossible that you signed that certificate from the irregularity of the body. - A. I am positive I did not sign it, and the invaliding of Mac Goven, who was never sick, but always about my person; I should not have signed the certificate which stated him being invalided; and the list of prizes are not in the order in which they were taken; if I had given him a list I should have given him a list of the prizes in the order they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember giving any certificate to Mac Goven. - A. I gave every man one when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not necessary for the captain to do so only when he leaves the ship; I observe the date of the certificate is three months before you left the ship. - A. Yes, which makes it inconsistent, when I was in Canton, it is dated where the ship was, and where I was.</p>

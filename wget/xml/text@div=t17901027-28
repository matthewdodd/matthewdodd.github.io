               <p>Have you any doubt that they knew perfectly well how these goods were come at? - I cannot say what they thought; I suppose they must think so.</p>
               <p>To whose house did you convey those things? - They were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear their names? - Not to my recollection.</p>

               <p>You have occasionally bought several things not honestly come by? - Yes, for seven or eight months.</p>

               <p>How often had you dealt with him before? - I have bought things of him before.</p>
               <p>Have you not, upon your oath, bought goods frequently of him before? - I have, but not frequently.</p>
               <p>Now, you are serious in that answer, are you? - If he had any thing, I bought it.</p>
               <p>Whenever you did buy things of him, did not you know they were dishonestly come by? - Yes, Sir, I must know that they were not come honestly by.</p>
               <p>What led you to this person of the name of Moses? - Because it was a light night; I was afraid of carrying them to my own place, and therefore I carried them to that place.</p>
               <p>What is his real name? - His name is Moses; that is all I know of him.</p>
               <p>Moses what? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - About a twelvemonth; he lives in an alley, but I do not know the name of it; I know the way to it; it is an alley in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Is there any number on the houses? - I never looked for the number.</p>

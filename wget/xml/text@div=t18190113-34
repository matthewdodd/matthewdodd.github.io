Risley called me by name, and said his father had sent them to change the poney away for a larger one, as it was too small for him; I knew him before - Lawrence said he only came with him for company. I showed him two horses which I had, and said I did not like to have anything to do with it unless his father came; he said his father was busy in the garden, and could not come, but he trusted to my generosity to do justice. He went away, returned, and said it was all right, for his father came honestly by it, and gave 5 l. for it in Smithfield; I detained the poney - nothing more passed. I went to look for his father at Ponder's-end, Enfield Wash, as he gave me that direction. I could not find him there - I have never found his father out. As I returned, I heard a poney had been lost, and gave information to Morrison - I delivered the poney to him next morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of George Cuff, we keep the Queen's Head, on Tower-hill. On Wednesday, 3rd May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Jones came for a pennyworth of gin, and gave me a half-crown which I thought was bad—I took it to my husband—he pronounced it bad, and came down with me and sent for an officer—I told Jones I had every reason to believe he had been there the day before with a bad shilling—he said he had never been in the house before—an officer came and took Jones in custody—my husband gave the half-crown to the officer, after marking it—I afterwards found the shilling I had taken the day before—I had it in the till at the time with other shillings, but I remarked that it was greasy—Jones said he took it at a cook's shop—I gave it to another party, and he brought it back again—that person is not here—this is the shilling—I identify it by my own mark.</p>

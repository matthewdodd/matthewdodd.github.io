Upon the 4th of August, another clerk belonging to the company and myself came to London. I went to Piccadilly, and there met the prisoner and another woman; I went with these two women to a tavern; from thence, after having sat and drank three or four hours or more, I do not know how long, I was drunk, and I suppose the rest were so too, I went with the prisoner to <placeName id="t17800913-38-crimeloc221">Hedge-lane</placeName>

I sat on the bed and dropped asleep; at six next morning I waked and found my pocket had been picked of a note and bill; my watch was gone, but I found it on the bed. The prisoner did not live in that house; I went back to Piccadilly and enquiring of the woman who was with my friend, I found out where the prisoner lodged; I went to her lodgings and took her up. I am sure I had the note and bill in my pocket when I went to Hedge lane; I felt it in my pocket a few minutes before I went there. Upon my telling the prisoner it would be better for her, she confessed taking the bills. I found the door open when I waked in the morning.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether I went upon my head or my heels, I was so intoxicated; as I was going along the room I stooped to buckle my shoe, and kicked something before me; I looked down, and under the corner of the table, where the negus was, I saw a piece of paper; I thought it was a piece of a letter I had pulled out with my pocket handkerchief; I put it in my pocket. I was much intoxicated; I had been with him from seven in the evening; I gave him a direction to my lodgings, expecting him to call again. I never removed from my lodgings. He gave me 2 s. before he went with me.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you give her two shillings? - Yes, I told her my wife was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130043"></xptr> in the country, I would have nothing to do with her.</p>
               <p>How came you to go with her? - To oblige my neighbour.</p>

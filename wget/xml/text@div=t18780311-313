                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 28, Church Street, Rotherhithe—I was present at St. Andrew's Church, Holborn, on 4th March, 1872, when my daughter was married to the prisoner—the banns had been previously published—this is the certificate of the marriage (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—they lived together about three months afterwards; there was then a separation—since then I have seen the prisoner, but not spoken to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner was not living at my house before his marriage—he was 16 years of age, but he deceived me as to that; he told me he was 20—he never slept at my house before his marriage—I don't know where he lived—I knew where his father lived—he was not living there—my daughter was pregnant before her marriage—I gave him money to keep him after his marriage, not before—I don't know that he was married without his father's consent—he did not warn me against the marriage; he did not say his son was under age, he said he was very young—he came to me with the Relieving Officer one Saturday, a week or two before the marriage, and he said whatever might occur he would not be answerable—I was not keeping the prisoner at that time—I went with him and my daughter to put up the banns, I forget whether I paid for it—my daughter was confined about six weeks after her marriage—after living with the prisoner three months she went away and lived with another man, and has been living with him ever since, and had children by him—she is not the prosecutrix—she is about 12 months older than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. She left him because he did not use her right; he did not keep her, and I found he was very young.</p>

               <p>him on 7th May, 1876, at St. James's Church, Bethnal Green—this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—he told me that he was a married man, but that his wife was dead, and also two children, and that he had been a widower two years—I first heard a rumour of his wife being alive about 12 months after our marriage, and I said to him "William, have you got another wife alive?"—he said "No, my wife is dead; if you were to travel all round London you would not find another wife alive belonging to me"—I afterwards found out where his wife was, and in consequence of what she told me he was given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I turned him out of the house about four months ago, because he did not maintain me or his child—I was not told by Wilson, a cabman, before I married him that he was a married man, or I would not have had him—I did not say if the first wife did not mind I did not care—his brother did not tell me he was married—I was a servant at the Express coffee-house before my marriage—I have drank with the prisoner since those proceedings, but not at his expense; he ran after me and spoke to me when he was out on bail—I did not say I would go back and live with him.</p>

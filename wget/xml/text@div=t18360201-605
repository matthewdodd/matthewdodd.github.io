                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Cole, of Waterloo-road, a Pawn<lb></lb>broker. I was in the shopman nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 9th of January, and saw the prisoner standing outside with both his hands in the window—I saw him take two watches out—I had heard the pane of glass break, and saw his hand through the aperture—I went to the shop door, and found it fastened outside with a cord—I broke the cord, got out, and pursued him down Webber-street, into Queen-street—I saw him throw one watch down—I pursed him across New-cut, into Wind mill-street, where he was stopped, and I gave him in charge to the officer—he took two gold watches worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I had seen them safe a quarter of an hour before, and I missed a gold eye-glass, worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a piece of cord was found on his person, corresponding with the cord which fastened the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Thomas-street, Lambeth. On the morning in question I was at the engine-house nearly opposite Mr. Cole's shop—I heard the glass break, and saw the prisoner run thought the court, and in Queen-street I saw him chuck a watch down—at the bottom of the street I saw him throw another down, which I took up, and put in my pocket—he still ran into Windmill-street, and at last stopped, and I came up to him,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MURDO</hi>. I am surgeon of the gaol. I do not think the prisoner is in a state of mind to make his defence at this time—I have seen him constantly since his admission to the prison, and he has appeared to me imbecile, approaching to idiotey—it appears to me to be want of mind—I do not believe him be an accountable agent at his time—he is ex<lb></lb>tremely</p>

               <p>quiet and obedient to every thing I tell him, but I can got no answer from him but "Oh, yes"—his pulse is very quiet—he has no fever or discase—I belive him not capable of knowing what is passing, or making his defence—I was asked to see him the day after his admission, being told that he was violent before he was brought to the prison—I found him with handcuffs on—he was very quiet, and I ordered them to be taken off, but since that he was never seemed to me to be in a reasonable state of mind—I was told he had attempted to hang himself, but I have seen no evidence of that on his person—I have not seen the least thing to conclude his weakness of mind might lead to self-destruction—on his ad mission I asked him what he was brought there for—he said, "Oh yes, Sir"—a fellow-prisoner said it was for breaking a window—he said, "Oh yes, Sir"—I said, "What else?"—he could not tell me—another prisoner said, "For taking some watches"—he then said, "Oh yes, Sir, it was so.

When the prisoner first came in he was in a state of great irritation, and I was obliged to have him hand cuffed, to prevent mischief—he has attempted to destroy himself hang<lb></lb>ing himself with a handkerchief, and at other times, was very restless and foolish—I do not think him in a state to understand what is passing,</p>

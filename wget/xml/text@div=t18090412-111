I found the prisoner at the office in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer at Hatton-garden office. On the morning of the 28th I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Page's shop; in consequence of information I received from Mr. Page's servant, not on this charge, I asked the prisoner where he lived; he told me; I went to Mr. Blyth's house, when the prisoner's wife came home; we went into his room; they said they had lost two blankets.</p>
               <p>- NIGHTINGAL. I am a servant to Mr. Page, pawnbroker, Liquorpond-street. On the 28th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to pledge these blankets; he said they were his own blankets, but we had information before that he had been robbing his lodgings; we sent for an officer; he said he lived in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

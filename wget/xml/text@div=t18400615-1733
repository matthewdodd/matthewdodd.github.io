                  </hi>I am the wife of James Bowden, a tailor, liv<lb></lb>ing at Laytonstone, Essex. On the night of the 7th of June, between eleven o'clock and half-past, I was returning home from Stratford, with my sister, Mary Ann Gregory—when we got to Cam Hall-lane, a man came out of the lane, caught hold of my arm, and told me I must give him my money—he had something white over his dress, like a smock-frock and a handkerchief tied over his mouth, and his hat over hit forehead—I never saw him before—I told him I had none—he then asked me who I was—I told him I was a poor woman, and had no money, or I would gave it to him—he then stood and frowned at me, and said, all at once, "Well, you may go on"—I ran to the first house I came to, which was the Thatched House public-house, about 100 yards off—they were just shutting up—they opened the door, and a policeman came up—he afterwards brought the prisoner back to me—I knew him again—he was then dressed with something white over his coat, and hit hat over hit forehead, the same as when he stopped me—I had no money or I should have given it to him.</p>

                  </hi>I am fourteen years old. I went with my sister-in-law on the 7th of June, and was returning from Stratford—I saw the prisoner—he caught hold of my sitter's left arm, and asked her for her money, in a gruff voice—I saw him put his hand to my sister—he was dressed with something white over his clothes—a handkerchief over his mouth, and a hat over his eyes.</p>

                  </hi>I was on duty in Cam Hall-lane, on the night of the 7th of June—I saw the prosecutrix there, and from her information I found the prisoner about half-a-mile up the road—I took Him into custody—he had something white over his dress—I ascertained it afterwards to be his shirt—it was token from hit back and put over his dress, with the collar cut off, and the bosom cut out—he had tied a white handkerchief over his face—he was sober—I never saw him before—the only part of his features that could be seen were his note and month—I accused him of stopping the two ladies on the road—he denied it at first—I said it was no use for him to deny it, for I had teen it—he then said he would go with me—he said he had only stopped them, and asked them who</p>

               <p>they were—I said I had seen a person with a white dress in the road that night, and I knew it was him—I had seen him at the time he stopped the prosecutrix—I was about one hundred yards off up the lane—it was a very moon-light night—I found no money on him—I know nothing of him at all—I believe they know him at Lambeth-street—I found a kind of mole-skin pouch in his pocket.</p>

Not at all—but I believe he had a stick in his possession—there was something in his hand at the time, but I could not tell what it was—he had nothing when I apprehended him—I suppose he had thrown it over a garden-wall—I tried to get admittance, but could not, as the house was to let—I applied twice, but could not get admittance—when I took him he was walking deliberately along the road with his hands in his pockets—I told him he was my prisoner—he turned round, and said, "Me? "—I said, " Yes you are "—he asked, " For what? " I said, " For stopping two ladies on the road "—he said, as he went to the station-house, he was not ashamed of what he had done—I was present when he was examined be<lb></lb>fore Mr. Broughton, and saw Mr. Broughton sign this—this is his hand<lb></lb>writing—it was read over to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" The prisoner says, All I said to the ladies was, 'Who are you?, as we were walking along the road; I made no stop at all; they said they were poor people; I said, ' Go on, ' and they kept on walking; that is all that passed between us."</p>

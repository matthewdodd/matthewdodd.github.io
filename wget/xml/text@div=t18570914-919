                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of Bauwens' Patent Candle Company. I hare been connected with that company ever since 1853—as one of the directors of the company, I was cognisant of the apparatus, and the mode in which it was manufactured and used—I did generally make myself acquainted with all the process and the construction of the apparatus; not minutely—I have very frequently looked at this model—from my knowledge of the apparatus, it is a correct and accurate mode)—it was produced on the trial at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi>, and was looked at, examined, and spoken to by the defendant—this other model, marked "G," was produced on the same occasion, and was examined and spoken of by the defendant—I heard him refer to it—he was in the witness box, and these two models were just beneath him under the table, and he was asked by the Counsel for Bauwens' Company if that was the model he had made and sworn to in the proceedings in Chancery, and he said, "Yes"—I think he said that that was the model that he had made and sworn to in the Chan<lb></lb>cery suit—there was no other Chancery proceeding except that which resulted in an injunction being prayed for—these are the two affidavits made by Hastings—these are the only two that I know of as having been filed—there are exhibits on the back of the model, showing that it was exhi<lb></lb>bited at the time of making the affidavit on 16th Jan.—the letter "G," purporting to be signed by Mr. Wingate, has been on it ever since it has been in my possession—it was in my possession before July—I should tell you that it is not the same model that was on the table at the time, but it was the original model, and there was a copy—we were directed by the Chancellor to exchange models, and we each gave the other the original; and for the purposes of convenience, we had an exact copy made, which for convenience was admitted as the model—I cannot say that I heard the defendant make reference to his affidavit, other than as what he had was always, ever since I have known it, a separate flue, in which the pipes were placed, and by which it was separated from the furnace—some Stour<lb></lb>bridge tiles were at the time of construction placed between the fire and the pipes—a Stourbridge tile is made of a day with great power of resisting the heat—no portion of the pipes was exposed to the naked action of the fire, except what would get up through the little hole, when the damper in the chimney is out—when the damper is drawn oat it makes a draught through the flue—when the damper is closed there is no draught through the flue, and therefore the heat does not ascend—the Stourbridge lumps protect the whole area of the space upon which the pipes rested—I have never seen it in any other way than that—from the time this apparatus was constructed and put in operation, up to the time these proceedings occurred, I saw the apparatus very frequently—during the whole of that period there has never been any substantial alteration from the original construction that I have spoken of—there was never any alteration in the form of construc<lb></lb>tion; I never happened to have seen it under repair—I cannot say whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140006"></xptr>
               <p>the pipes were made of wrought or cast iron—a person could not see the pipes by looking through the furnace door—I have myself ascertained that to be physically impossible—there is a small hole above the furnace door, called a sight hole—through that a small portion of the pipes can be seen—I have seen the apparatus at various times at work—I am conversant with the process of manufacture—I never saw these pipes red hot—I always understood that it was not a portion of the process to keep the pipes red hot—I have never seen them red hot—we endeavoured to make them red hot after these proceedings commenced, and found the greatest difficulty in doing it, so much so that when we thought they were red hot we found they were not—I cannot say that I remember the person of the defendant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a solicitor, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am; the management of the business is left to Mr. Bau<lb></lb>wen, he is the manager—he established the Company, it was formed in the summer of 1853—it was a Company of 50, 000 shares of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I possess between 3, 000 and 4, 000 shares, originally I had 8, 000; I am sorry to say the Company has not paid any dividend—I really cannot say whether we have registered any accounts—I do not remember whether or not I ever had the curiosity to inquire—I cannot tell the time when the furnaces were originally constructed, it is a considerable time ago; I remember on the trial I said it was about twenty months, but I believe it was about two years and a half, or something like that before the trial; I have since ascer<lb></lb>tained it was in 1854, by inquiry of Mr. Bauwen—I was at the manufac<lb></lb>tory very frequently, and with considerable regularity, almost always once a week, except I have been out of town or unable to attend, and very fre<lb></lb>quently twice a week, and sometimes even oftener than that; I have been there many hundreds of times—I have not on those occasions examined the apparatus particularly and carefully with the object of seeing in what state it was, because it was not within my functions at all to do that—I did not see the coil of pipes laid, I merely saw the bed which was built for the pur<lb></lb>pose of receiving the pipes which were to be laid on it; I have never seen the pipes except through the sight hole—I never saw the thermometers until after the Chancery proceedings—I know we were ordered by the Vice Chancellor to work with thermometers; and after that time we did, to ascertain the positive degree of heat in the still and in the steam—I think we began to work with the thermometers either the latter end of Dec., or the beginning of Jan.; we began before the Vice Chancellor ordered it, because we wanted to ascertain what the actual relative degrees were, by sight instead of by judgment—I cannot tell how soon the coil of pipes was laid after the furnace was built; I have never seen the furnace at any time, when the bed of Stourbridge lumps were not there—I could just see the end of the pipes through the sight hole, the turn I mean, it is not properly a coil—I have looked through the furnace door, dozens of times—I have looked through it occasionally ever since I have known the furnace, while it has been at work—I cannot tell you anything about the particular periods at which I have done so, because it is such a casual matter, it is not likely I should make a memorandum in my memory, or in a book, as to when I looked in at a furnace door—I looked in because I think it is a very fine sight to see a blazing fire burning; and when I have been there, and the door has been open, I have just looked down in that way and looked in—I hardly ever go to a furnace without doing so—that was the reason of my looking through the furnace door, and for no other reason until these pro<lb></lb>ceedings commenced, and then it became a matter of very great interest—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140007"></xptr>
               <p>believe the first intimation we had of any proceedings being threatened, Was on 8th Nov.; and I have no doubt that within two days after that I should be down at the factory; I do not know whether it was on Saturday, or when it was—I will undertake to swear positively, that it was about two days after 8th Nov. that I looked in at the furnace door in order to ascer<lb></lb>tain the state of the apparatus—I do swear it most positively—I do not say two days after, I said I did not know whether it was a Saturday, or what day it might be, but the first available day; within two or three days after that I went down and made a most minute examination of everything connected with it, because it was then a matter of interest—I cannot fix the date nearer than this, that it was immediately or as soon as ordinarily convenient after receiving this notice; I have no hesitation in saying it was within two, three, or it might be, four days; I should say it was certainly within two, three, or four days after receiving the letter dated 8th Nov.—I might not have received it until the 9th, that might be Saturday—Tuesday was our ordinary day of meeting, and I have no doubt I was there on the Tuesday afterwards—the letter gave me information as to the particular character of the apparatus—I do not know whether it would do so to a per<lb></lb>son not' acquainted in the same degree with the apparatus, with the process carried on, and with the words of patent specifications—either the letter or. the subsequent inquiries that I made gave me information of the nature of the complaint that was made—whether I had got that particular informa<lb></lb>tion before I went to the factory, or whether I saw Mr. Bauwens at my office before I went to the factory and got it from him, I do not know, but when I made the inspection of the apparatus I did receive such information as enabled me to judge, and that was the time when the first inspection was made; I did not know as much about it as I did subsequently when I em<lb></lb>barked n it—I made an experiment as to obtaining a red heat by means of a damper in the flue—it appeared to be a red heat, but on pushing a steel skewer through the sight hole, and making it impinge on the iron pipe, of course the pipe being softer on account of being hot, it went in and made one of those stars which you see there; it was red hot then, and it scaled off—this is the damper which regulates the heat in the fire place; when this is opened the draught rushes through the furnace up this fine—I should say that that is not the direct course of the heat, it goes round the still, and round the chimney—anybody else is as capable of judging of the course of the heat as I am; there is a little hole, and the heat has to go through there; if you lift up the flue you will see that the hole is at the mouth of it, and it does not appear that the heat should go there to get up the chimney—I do not think that up the chimney at once is the direct way, but anybody in Court is as competent to form an opinion upon it as I am; in fact I have not formed one—by pulling out the damper the heat could be raised—the quickness depends upon the distance to which you draw the damper out; if you draw it out to the full extent it is hot very rapidly, because a great part of the draught will enter through the flue, but if, as. is the fact, the damper is only drawn out to a very small extent it would not—it was done entirely for the purpose of that experiment, so that there was no possible chance for the heat to get out, and by pulling the damper out of the coil flue, it heated it very rapidly—I did not then find that I made the pipes red hot; I do not know that we could not have done so if we had gone on a sufficient time; we went on sufficient time to prove the experiment, in the presence of three of the best engineers in the country—I do not remember how long we went on; you must not press me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140008"></xptr>
               <p>too hard, possibly it may have been half an hour or forty minutes, or it may have been twenty-five minutes, I mean after the damper was removed; but I did not make the experiments myself, they were conducted by Mr. Nay<lb></lb>smith and other gentlemen—I found the flame ascending very much, it came through this hole, through the part which is nearest to the furnace door, and then it was drawn by the draught for a short way over the pipes—I do not know of any repairs to any extent, of the furnace; I remember seeing the still partly pulled down, I never saw any repairs at all done to the pipes—I have heard of the pipes being taken out and replaced since the furnace was erected—I did not see it done, but they would have to take off the top of the flue to do it, and I should see it—the proceedings against Bauwens' Company in Chancery, were for the infringement of four patents, and there are proceedings against Bauwens' Company for the infringement of two patents still—I should not think Hastings and Murphy were important witnesses for the purpose of proving the infringement—I have always thought that they would be called—they were the only witnesses in Chau<lb></lb>cery to the infringement of the four patents; there was another, a Mr. Robert Brown—Mr. Napoleon Bauwens is a brother of the manager, he is not here; he was present at Guildhall when I was in the witness box—he did not appear in the witness box on that occasion, and I can tell you why, as it is as well to know; he cannot speak English at all decently, and the Jury and everybody were so tired and disgusted with the length that it had gone to, that we thought it was a very good reason for not calling him—he could speak his own language.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the managing director of this candle company, which takes its name from me; it is carried on at Canal Bow, Pimlico. The prisoner was about a year or eighteen months in my employ<lb></lb>ment—he came first of all as stoker of the still, but he took too much, and was removed from that post to stoke the boiler—he left off stoking the still about six months before he left—he had a full opportunity of knowing the apparatus that I used for melting the fat, and was acquainted with the whole of the machinery—he supplied the furnace with fuel, and attended to things generally under the command of Wickham, the foreman—I was examined on the trial at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi>, and also in Chancery—my attention has been fully called to the matters in difference—I have seen this model before—it is as correct as could be made in small proportions—here is a loose damper here, which you may call the furnace damper—it is never used—it was my mind and skill which invented this apparatus—I superintended its being put up, and have managed the factory from day to day down to this time—the apparatus has not been in any way different in regard to the pipes since Aug., 1855, than it is now—the company was formed in 1853,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140009"></xptr>
               <p>and I began to work the machinery in its present state about Aug.,—from the beginning of 1854 we only worked for the sake of trial, and to take the patent out, which we did in April, 1854—the pipes have been taken out, and fresh pipes substituted several times—we always keep two sets of pipes, because when one pipe breaks we have to take the whole set out, but they have always been the same kind of pipes, strong gas pipes of wrought iron—we are not particular about the bore—there is a great difference between wrought iron and cast iron as regards resisting heat—if the pipes were ordinarily red hot while working they would soon be worn out, and it would be injurious to my mode of manufacturing the fat—the pipes were not ordinarily red hot from day to day—I did not order Hastings to keep them red hot, but to keep them at a sufficient heat to distil the fatty matters over—I have seen the pipes from day to day from the time the furnace was first erected—they were generally black, and if they began to get a little reddish I made observations to the fireman upon it, and would not allow it—the prisoner was the fireman's assistant—the pipes would not have been kept red hot from day to day—there is no difference between the Stourbridge tiles and lumps, except in shape—this is one of the tiles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); two of these two feet square, and two others a foot and a half, formed the roof of the furnace—this is the exact sire of the front tiles—when Hastings acted as stoker, feeding the furnace, he must have seen these tiles, and knocked his poker against them—there could not be a period when we used these pipes in which this layer of tiles was absent—steam was passed into the still at certain periods, and we let the fat run constantly in—we have machinery to feed it gradually, but at first we have to feed it—the furnace acts directly on the still; the heat goes round the bottom part first, and then to the back, but the heat at the back is not required till we have got the stuff to run in—we throw steam in from a boiler, which we use for various purposes—the lower the temperature at which the steam comes in, the better it is for the quality of the stuff; but to obtain quality with quantity, about 100 degrees below the temperature of the fat is the best heat for distillation—if the tempera<lb></lb>ture of the boiling fat is exceeded it is not a profitable working—I aim at the quality of my article—you cannot look in at the mouth of the furnace and see the pipes—I have seen Hastings cleaning the pipes, taking the soot away—he took off the Stourbridge lumpe, but not the tiles—he had a broom, a rake, and a scraper—he stood on the top, and as he looked down he must see the layer of Stourbridge tiles between the pipes and the fire—the pipes do not lay naked to the fire; there has always been a layer of Stourbridge between them and the fire—since the proceedings by Price's Company against me, I have not made any alteration; there was no need—I first saw this other model at the Chancery Court—this coil of pipes is not at all like mine—it is not a careful model.</p>

Japp, 23rd and 24th May, 1856"—Japp first came to the factory on 13th Oct., 1855, and left on 6th Dec, 1856—I believe I discharged a dozen or more of my workmen after the law suit began—I do not recollect, on the occasion of the second, or Japp's coil, asking him whether any part of the pipes could be worked in, but it was my rule to use the old piping as much as I could—I do not remember who assisted in putting in the second coil, or whether it was put in between 6 and 7 o'clock on Saturday night after the men were gone—I do not recollect, on that occasion, desiring Mr. Wickham, as the men worked late, to give them some beer, but that was so—I cannot tell whether Japp's coils were fastened together with copper wire, or whether the second coil was fastened with iron wire—I recollect afterwards a third coil being made while Japp was in my service, by a person named Weeks, a brother of my foreman—Weeks came to my factory in Sept or Oct., 1856; Sept. I think—he was employed in making the third coil shortly after he came—the second coil had been in about four months—the third coil was put in as the others had been, raised from the ledge by a brick at the comers—it would have been prejudicial to have kept the temperature of the steam below that of the boiling fat, both as to quality and quantity.</p>

               <p>and split; they would not last three weeks—they were not ordinarily red hot, they were black—I have never ordered Hastings to keep them red hot—I have frequently found fault with him for having the fire too far for<lb></lb>ward, which tended to heat the pipes too much—when I have seen the pipes black, I have never complained to Hastings, and ordered him to make them red—it was the most advantage that they should not be kept red; it was less profitable—the pipes were not regularly cleaned—Hastings was suc<lb></lb>ceeded by Hubert Brown, and Dawson succeeded him as day man—there was no night man.</p>

I assisted Mr. Bauwen to make out a specification of his patent, particularly the one of the 10th April 1854—the still was worked differently, but the other apparatus are the same as I described in that specification—I have examined this model—in April, 1854, there was the same kind of division between the fire and the pipes as now, but I cannot say what it consisted of—I visited the premises in the latter part of 1856, and at the commencement of this year, and the apparatus was precisely the same as regards the furnace, but the still was quite different—there was no alteration whatever in the mode of conveying the heat through the pipes—the action of the fire on wrought iron pipes would be much greater than on cast iron—it would wear them out, and if they got red hot they would get leaky in the joints, I imagine, but I never tried, and therefore cannot speak from actual experience—if they were to be red hot, cast iron would be the best material—this pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one-eighth of an inch thick—it is an ordinary gas tube—if the object of Mr. Bauwen was to keep the steam below the temperature of the boiling fat, and to keep the pipe from getting red hot, this pipe would be decidedly adapted to that purpose—I have seen the apparatus at work—it seemed to work satisfactorily.</p>

I have been for many years foreman of the tallow pressing at Bauwens' Patent Candle Company, I remember the furnace being erected, and the still constructed—the pipes of the furnace were exactly the same as this model; it is a correct representation—there were Stourbridge tiles between the pipes and the fire, and it was not possible for the fire to affect the pipes—the construction has remained substantially the same to the present time—it is not possible to see the pipes by looking through the furnace door—they can be seen by looking through the sight hole when there is a fire—I have never seen them red hot—you may see the hot air, but as to seeing the pipes red hot, it is a thing impossible—the fire playing betwixt them might seem to be a little red, but they were never red with heat—I remember the flue which contained them being cleaned—soot used to collect in it—Hastings was employed there a portion of the time I was there, as stoker, and I saw him once engaged in cleaning out the flue.</p>

               <p>took the new coil from the smith's shop, carried it to the furnace, and rested it in its bed, and Wickham went to Mr. Napoleon Bauwens to find out whether it was suitable—he came and said that the heat could not get under the side pipes, and told us to raise it—we raised it with half a fire brick at each end, so as to allow a play round the coil; but the half fire brick was too high, and we altered it by putting what they call a slip—when that was done the coil rested on standards on one end, and a fire lump at the other, and was covered with sand—I could not see anything between the pipes and the fire—there were no Stourbridge tiles at that time—if there were I must have seen them—we had occasion to lift up the pipes while fixing them, and I knelt down, on the two surfaces, and had a great deal of trouble to get my hand down—I could not get it on the other side to put the bit of slip in, so I put my hand down in the centre of the coil to put it in, and am able to say that down the middle, underneath the coil, there was nothing between there and the fire—there was a space—after the coil was put in we tied it up with some copper wire to keep it up as a fixture, and we noticed how long the copper wire lasted—it was a question among us every morning, whether the copper wire had given way—we looked through the sight hole to see how the heat was, on the pipes, and they were red hot—it was work which I had not been on previously, and I took an interest in it, and looked at it often, and on such occasions the pipes were red hot—I have looked through the furnace door and seen the pipes, but if there had been Stour<lb></lb>bridge tiles between the pipes and the fire I could not have done so—that coil lasted nearly six months; and Mr. Bauwens, the master, came and told me he wanted me and some one else to do some work—it was to make a new coil of pipes for the still—I saw the old coil taken out for me—it was resting on the bits of tiling, as we had put it in—there were no Stourbridge lumps, only a fire lump for it to rest upon, but nothing in the centre between it and the fire—the coil was most dreadfully burnt, and I made a new one out of second hand pipes, and put that in—I cannot say the day, because it was regular work—there was a question asked, "These last pipes being new lasted six months, I wonder how long these will last, being made out of second hand pipes?"—I worked the old ones in, having cut the middle out of them to make a long length—the middles were the strongest—I took the best parts—we commenced to put them in on the Friday night, me and a man named Dawson; we left it on Friday night, and we had it in on Saturday night, I believe—Hastings assisted to carry the coil from the workshop to the place, but not at any other part of the workmanship—that coil was put down on the same principle as the previous one—there were no Stourbridge tiles between it and the furnace—it rested the same as the other—it was put in in the same way, and we had the directions from Mr. Napoleon Bauwens—we lashed these together with iron wire, and passed the steam through to see that it was all right before we left it—there was a question whether the iron wire would last longer than the copper wire—I saw it at work frequently, and the pipes were red hot—I cannot say that I took the trouble to look at them through the furnace door, because there was this peep hole which I had made the sketch for, and I could see through that that the pipes were red hot—that coil lasted some weeks longer than the other—when they were burnt out, a third coil was put in by Weeks—I was the stoker at that time—I cannot say when Weeks came—he was dis<lb></lb>charged after the Crimean war, and came to work there—the second coil was taken out some six or eight weeks before Christmas, but I did not see</p>

                  </hi>. I have been engaged in chemical pur<lb></lb>suits for a great number of years—I have made a great number of experi<lb></lb>ments with Dr. Hofmann, for the purpose of getting evidence in the action against Bauwens' for the infringement of Price's patent, in June last—they were conducted with the most rigorous accuracy—we stipulated that we should have complete command of the apparatus, and of the material to be distilled, and have every opportunity afforded for the examination of it, and that that which was left from day to day should be under our seal, and we had all those advantages—the laboratory was completely under our control—the result of our experiments was not that it was injurious both in point of quantity and quality to work with superheated steam; quite the contrary—in the first place, we found whether we distilled without steam at all by the direct action of the fire, or whether with subheated or superheated steam,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140032"></xptr>
               <p>that the effect was the same in all cases; but when we came to compare the quantity produced and the amount of decomposition, we found that, without the use of steam, there was a certain amount of loss; when we used the sub<lb></lb>heated steam there was less, and still less with the superheated steam, and we had evidence of there being more pitch in the first, less in the second, and least in the third—pitchy matter arises from the decomposition of the original matter—comparing the subheated steam with the distillation by open fire, there is a loss of 98/10 per cent., when distilled by the naked fire, without steam, and 7 1/2 per cent with subheated steam, making a saving of 21/3; per cent, with subheated steam over that of the fire without steam; but when we used the superheated steam the loss in two experiments tried with one another was only 2 1/2 per cent; so that there was an advantage of 5 per cent, in the yield over the other processes; not only was the pitch less, but there was less gaseous matter produced—the result of the experiment was to satisfy us that persons having the right to work with superheated steam will adopt it as the most beneficial mode—the difference is considerable for such manufactories—that would be one candle in twenty—I have heard it stated that there was soot of a red character, by one witness, and that it was not of a black colour, by another—that would lead me to conclude that the temperature of the flue was above 800 degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise the carbonaceous matter would remain unconsumed—the red matter is the ash of the organic matter, containing a little iron—that is the lowest heat at which the combustion of carbonaceous matter would take place—I am able to say that wrought iron pipes exposed to such a temperature in a flue, not in direct contact with the fuel, and not subject to be red hot, and then allowed to cool, would last a considerable number of months—I have had great experience, and have apparatus at work constructed of wrought iron, similar to these pipes; but the case is different in allowing pipes to remain constantly, or nearly constantly, at one temperature, preventing them from cooling below redness, because the cake of oxide on the outer surface scales off on cooling, in consequence of the rate of expansion in the iron being different; if it is again raised to a red heat, a fresh coating of oxide is formed, and when it cools that flakes off, and thus you gradually oxidise and use up a pipe; but if it is kept at a red heat the coating of oxide actually protects it from the action of the fire; but if it is placed in contact with the fire, the coals containing sulphur, a sulphnret is formed, and the pipe is soon destroyed—these of Mr. Bauwens would last upwards of six months, because I have had pipes myself exposed in that way to the direct action of flame, but not of the coal, exposed to the action of the fire so as to produce a red heat, like heating by gas in contradistinction to solid fuel—here are several layers of oxide scaled off this pipe, and I should say it has been heated and cooled several times.</p>

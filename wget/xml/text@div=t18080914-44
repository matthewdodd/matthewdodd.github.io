The two prisoners came into my master's shop and asked to look at some worsted stockings; I shewed them some; objection was made to them; upon which they were put away, and Williams advised Brown to have cotton ones; I shewed them several sorts of cotton stockings; they made choice of one pair; I put them on one side; they asked to look at some worsted ones; I went back to get some worsted ones; when I came back I missed a paper of stockings from off the counter; I said nothing; they made choice of a pair of worsted. While we were agreeing for the price, Williams walked out of the shop with something under her apron, she ran across the street; I pursued her; I took hold of her gown; she dropped the stockings and I picked them up; I brought her into the shop and sent for an officer; when I came back the man was gone; in about half an hour he came in the neighbourhood; then he was taken.</p>

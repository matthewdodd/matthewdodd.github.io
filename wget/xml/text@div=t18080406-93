               <p>Q. Did you lose three pound of candles at any time. - A. Yes, on the 26th of March; my house is a corner house; it stands in Glocester street, and in Charlotte street.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for charging the prisoner with having taken them - A. I watched that night, and searched a hole under a window in Glocester street; there I found a parcel containing three pound of candles wrapped up as it is now; I stood at the private door, till such times as he returned; he run back the same way as he came, he passed me; I immediately pursued him, I overtook him in Glocester street, brought him back and gave him in charge of the officer; I asked him what he had got there; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him for any length of time - A. I have known him for these five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any money transactions between you - A. Before he came to me I had a little money of his in my hands; I owe him now nothing but wages, which is seventeen pounds.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. This is a return for his friendship - how came you not to pay him his wages - A. He always had what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he taken candles and deducted them in his wages. - A. Yes.</p>

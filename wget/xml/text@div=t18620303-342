                  </hi>. I am a waiter and live at 6, Red Lion-court, Charter house-lane—on 4th February, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Long-acre—I was quite sober—when I got near St. Martin's Hall I felt a sudden pressure on my throat—I was pulled backwards, and fell on my back—I felt a man's hand in my waistcoat pocket, and saw Leary leaning over me—I called, "Police," and sprang to my feet; another man left my side at the same time, but I did not see his face—he was on the same side of me as Leary was, but rather behind me—one went across the street, and con<lb></lb>tinued on the opposite side, and the one I followed kept in front of me, that was Leary—they both ran towards Drury-lane—I never lost sight of Leary, except for an instant, when he turned the corner and ran into a policeman's arms—he was then five or six yards from me.</p>

I am a tin-plate worker, of 27, Matilda-street, Cale<lb></lb>donian-raod—I was in Long-acre, heard a cry of "Police," turned back, ran into Drury-lane, and saw two men running, the prosecutor and Leary—I was past Bow-street, going towards Leicester-square, when I heard the cry—I followed, and saw the prosecutor fall, I pursued Leary, and saw him run into the arms of policeman 70, in Brownlow-street, I think it is named.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 82). I was in Parker-street on the morning of 4th February, on the right hand side, going towards Holbern—Brownlow-street is on the left—I heard a cry of "Police," which sounded from Wilson-street; that is nearly opposite Parker-street—I saw Cunningham running several yards ahead of two or three persons who were behind him; and, hear<lb></lb>ing a cry of "Stop thief!" I made a spring at him, but missed my hold, and he crossed Drury-lane into Parker-street—I pursued him—Wilson-street and Brownlow-street are on the same side of Drury-lane—the man I saw was on the same side of Drury-lane as the others—he ran into a house on the left hand side of Parker-street, fifty or sixty yards up, and got into the back yard—I was not three yards behind him—he turned round on seeing me enter the yard, and I said, "What did you run away for?"—he said, "I was not going to stop there to be knocked about"—I said, "Hearing a cry of 'Stop thief!' and you being the first man running, I shall take in your in custody"—he said, "I shall not go, there is no one here to charge me; if there was I would go, but there is not, and I will not go quiet"—I said, "You had better do so, for I intend taking you"—he said, "Then we will have an up and down for it"—I collared him and took him to the station—I found Leary in custody coming towards Bow-street—I had not seen him before, but I saw a person ranning in the same direction—when in the dock they denied knowing each other at all.</p>

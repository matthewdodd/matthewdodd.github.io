On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050044"></xptr>the 3d of December, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop. From information, when she went out of the shop, I followed her, and overtook her about forty yards from the shop; I laid hold of her, and brought her back. She delivered up the piece of ribbon to me, and wished me to let her go. I took her back to the shop. Mr. Sapwell, the officer, searched her. He found four pieces of ribbon in her boson, three were ours. I knew them to be my master's. I measured the four pieces of ribbon, they contained sixty-six yards and a half. They were worth 1 l. 5 s.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this young woman in the shop. - A. Yes, I served her, she asked for three quarters of a yard of ribbon. I took out a drawer of ribbons, and produced them to her, she bought three quarters of a yard, it came to three pence. I did not know any thing untill Hall brought her back. The account that Hall has given, is correct and true.</p>

            . I am a constable, I searched the prisoner. I found four rolls of ribbon down her bosom, there were three of them claimed by Mr. Bruton. When these were found, she fell on her knees and begged for mercy. I have got five pieces, I did not find an owner for one piece.</p>
               <p>NICHOLSON. Four of them pieces are my master's.</p>

The gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, told me I must come back. I went back, I was very much frightened. I am innocent.</p>

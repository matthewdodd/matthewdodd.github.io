One of them calved about a fortnight ago; the other died; it was over drove. They were both ready to calve. I know the prisoner very well; he lived with Hancock, a butcher, at Bow-bridge: he has gone by my marsh lands; he knew they were my cows, and he knew they were in that land all the winter.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I saw the cows on the 18th of March, in Bow. The prisoner was driving them along, about five minutes after three in the morning. He was driving them toward London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes. I spoke to him. He told me he brought them from Rumford, and they had strayed out of the drove into Handcock's Marsh; he was going to take them to Shoreditch. He told me he was going to take the money for the cows. He did not tell me what money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the cows - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose cows were they -

               <p>Q. Have you seen them since - A. Yes, I saw them at Worship-street, and those are the cows that I saw at Mile-end on the 18th of March, and which Mr. Cole claimed as his own. They were red and white cows; they were in calf, and very pretty cows. When I saw them in Worship-street I knew them again.</p>

            . I am a butcher. The cows were brought to me about half past four on the same morning, in New Inn yard, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they brought - A. By the prisoner at the bar, and offered for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in calf - A. Yes. He asked eight pounds for them. He said he brought them from Mr. Greenhill. The gentleman ordered him to bring them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Greenhill - A. No. I told him I should keep them and go to Mr. Greenhill. As I was going along I stopped at Bow-bridge, at Mr. Handcock's, and asked him whether he knew any thing about two cows that his drover brought down. He said, yes: there had been a gentleman enquiring about two cows that he had lost out of the marsh. I told him I had got them at home. The prisoner brought them in. Before Mr. Cole came the prisoner brought a bill to receive four pounds upon the two. It is put bullocks in the bill. I did not give him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not fit for the butcher, were they - A. No; they were too heavy in calf. I am sure the prisoner is the man that brought me the cows, and offered them for eight pounds, and they were the cows that were claimed by Mr. Cole.</p>

            . On the 18th of March last the prosecutor came to my house, he informed me he had lost two cows. I went down to New Inn yard. The witness, Young, delivered the cows to the prosecutor. They are the same cows that the prosecutor swore to at the office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt about the two cows. I have had them since Michaelmas. I had them in the marsh all the winter. I saw them there every day. They were worth from fifteen to seventeen pound each if they had good luck in calving. They were small cows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. When had you seen the cows before you lost them - A. The day before I saw them in the marsh. I had a key of the marsh-gate. The gate was taken off the hinges to get the cows out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Hatton-wull. Enrly in the morning of Thursday, the 20th of July, I saw King come out of No. 27, with part of a cast-iron furnace—there was a van at the door, and King gave it to the van-man—Taylor then brought out some iron bars of the furnace, and gave them to the van-man—Taylor then came out, accompanied by Watson, with a sack containing the lead of a water-closet—he gave that to the van<lb></lb>man—Watson and King brought out the lead lining of a cistern—I went up to Mr. Knot, at Mr. Reed's, the brewhouse—I then found Fink, the police<lb></lb>man—he came to the house.</p>

Thornton made a communication to me—I went to No. 27, Hatton-wall—I found a van at the door—I saw Tay<lb></lb>lor bring out a sack—I got into the van, and found it contained lead—it appeared to be the bottom of a water-cistern—I found three other sacks in the van, containing pipes, and part of a water-closet—I fitted these things to what remained on the premises, and they corresponded exactly—I went to the house—Taylor shut the door in my face—I got another officer, and got into the house—I there found Taylor—he said I had no right to interfere with people moving their own property in open day-light—I saw Watson in the shop, and King in the parlour—I asked Watson what he was doing—he said he merely came in to be shaved—King said he was a lodger, and they had nothing to do with the moving, they were only employed by the landlord to move the things—there was not the slightest appearance of shaving—some part of the shutters were down, and some up—I sent for Mr. Knott, the managing clerk of the brewery—King then said he wanted some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and ordered coffee of the woman in the parlour, and they all partook of it—I went over the premises—in the back-house the whole of the roof was off, and the furnace and iron-work was gone—the lead I found fitted it—Mr. Knott came, and gave the prisoners in charge—as we were going</p>

               <p>along, Watson said he assisted in moving the things, and was to hare some<lb></lb>thing to eat and drink for his trouble—there was 350Ibs. of lead in the van, a stone sink, and 850lbs. of iron.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HAINES. I live nearly opposite of Mr. James. On the 31st of December, about a quarter before six in the evening, I was crossing the road towards Mr. James's shop; I saw the prisoner come out of the door with a cheese in his hand; he put it under his arm; it was a whole Gloster cheese. The prisoner set off running, which made me suspect he had stolen it. I ran after him, and called out stop thief: he directly chucked the cheese down; he ran three hundred yards; a man told him if he did not stop he would knock him down. A boy picked up the cheese, and it was taken to Mr. James's. I am sure I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. James's shop with the cheese.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BEAL. I live at No. 27, in the same street that Mr. James's shop is in. I saw the prisoner on the day he was taken; I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw Mr. Haines running after the prisoner; I picked up the cheese in Scott's-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never charged with any thing of the kind; I was going to my master at Hoxton; I heard the cry of stop thief; I run after the man a quarter of a mile; I lost sight of him; the gentleman stopped me, and charged me with taking the cheese.</p>

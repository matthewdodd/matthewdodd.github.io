I took up a Load of Oysters about Five o'Clock, and carry'd it to the back Side of Paul's . - The Person paid me for my Trouble. - I came to my Lodgings as the Clock struck Six. - The next Day I went down to Billingsgate about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon. - There comes down a Man from the Blue-Anchor, St. Mary-Hill, and said, Porter, you must go up to the Blue-Anchor. - I said, I would not go back again, for I thought it was out of some Game. - After that this Gentleman comes, that is, the Constable, and charg'd me with a Robbery; I went to go before two or three Justices, but they were not at Home, - I have Witnesses that I was at Work.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was on a Monday?</p>
               <p>Sparks. Yes. About Four o'Clock I went down to Billingsgate to fetch me some more Oysters. I said to him, why did not you call again? He said, I thought I had brought you up enough. I said to him take your Basket, let me have some more. I went and bought my Goods, and coming back to Cannon-Street, I said, I cannot keep pace with you. When I came to my own House he said, you have staid a great while behind me. Then I reckon'd it was about half an Hour after Five in the Evening. So he emptied my Goods and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it was half an Hour after Five ?</p>
               <p>Sparks. I think it was, for the Fog arose so that I could not go his Pace.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner these 20 Years, he bore a good Character when he was 'Prentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general Character?</p>
               <p>Cheater. He has a general good Character.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you begun to have Knowledge of him 20 Years ago, have you known him of late?</p>
               <p>Cheater. Yes, to this very minute. As to Pistol or Sword, I can prove he never was worth such a Thing in his Life.</p>

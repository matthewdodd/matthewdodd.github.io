               <p>JOHN SCOTT, ESQ. I live at Islington, in the parish of St. Mary's. I was not at home when this happened.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN JOPSON. I am servant to Mr. Scott. Last Monday week Mrs. Scott and the man servant went out, leaving me at home; I went up about a quarter past eleven o'clock, to look at the parlour fire - I set the scuttle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170005"></xptr>down, and looked out of window, and saw a boy looking through the iron railing. I put the coals on the fire, looked again, and he was still there, looking towards the kitchen window. I went to the top of the kitchen stairs, for a brush to sweep the hearth - I looked out of window again, and he was gone. I ran down stairs, and found three doors open - two of them were open when I came up, but the other was shut. I ran through the kitchen into the pantry, and on looking over the plate I missed all the large silver table spoons - a person must open the door which was shut to get to the pantry. I missed eight table spoons, which I had seen five minutes before. I ran up the area steps, and found the area gate half open - it was shut before. I saw the boy who had been looking through the railing, and the prisoner, about six yards from the house - I saw the prisoner give a frail basket to the boy who had been looking through the rails. I ran after them, the boy came back, and asked what I wanted with him; I just opened his basket, and could see nothing but oranges and lemons in it. The prisoner ran away, and ran across a place on the left-hand side of the road, where there is some timber - I lost sight of him while he went behind seven new houses. The boy with the basket also ran away. I met a labouring man, and called to him to stop the prisoner, and when he was nearly caught he turned back, and came up to me. - I laid hold of him; he asked what I wanted with him - I said he had been into my master's house; he said he had only been to the door to see if I wanted any oranges or lemons. I took him home, and sat him in the kitchen - he took off his coat, and desired me to search him - nothing was found on him. Rumbold brought the property in. He told me afterwards that he had come in and took the spoons - I asked what he was going to do with them; he said to buy bread - this was before the officer took him.</p>

            . I was going up New North-road last Monday week, and saw the servant calling to two boys - the boy with the basket turned back - she looked into his basket, and then ran after the prisoner, who walked away. I found eight spoons under a piece of timber on the left-hand side of the road, the same day, and took them back. I saw no more of the boy with the basket.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I went out at a quarter to eleven o'clock, and on returning home I met the servant - she said the spoons were stolen. I went in doors, and in a few minutes Rumbold brought the spoons in.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN JOPSON. The place Rumbold has described is where I saw the prisoner run. He must have opened the door which was shut before he could get them. The other boy ran back towards the house, after I looked at his basket.</p>

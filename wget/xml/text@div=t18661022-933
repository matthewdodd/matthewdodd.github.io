I am a clerk in the Inland Revenue department, Somerset House—I produce a bond of the Leeds Banking Company—the date of it is 26th November, 1859—I also produce a Gazette, the date of which is 27th August, 1844—that shows the amount of notes that the Leeds Banking Company are entitled to issue irrespective of stamps: that amount is 23, 076<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the total amount of notes only, not of notes and bills; there is no limit to bills—I also produce the last half-yearly return made at our office—it is dated 4th August, 1864—it contains an account of notes for the half-year ending with the week Saturday, 25th June, I believe—it was returned to our office—the half-yearly return contains the amount of notes and bills in circulation, week by week, from the beginning of January—I also produce the weekly returns corresponding with this half-yearly return—it is the weekly returns of the amount of notes in circulation this is only a copy of the original—these are sent up week by week to the stamp office, the Inland Revenue office—they relate to notes only—there is no limitation for bills, and I have no separate return for bills—I have got the other half-yearly returns from 1860 to the time the bank stopped pay<lb></lb>ment, the 10th September, 1864, is the latest account—I have got the half-yearly returns for the same period as well.</p>

This is the original—the affidavit of the 4th July, 1864, is at the back of the half-yearly return—that is an affidavit purporting to be signed by the prisoner—I administered the oath to him, and this is his signature—he was sworn in the usual and regular</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a Commis<lb></lb>sioner to administer oaths? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I am a solicitor by business—I was also connected with this bank—I was a director of it—a paid director—I think I got about 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—that was in addition to my share of the profits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just give me an idea of this prosperous bank down to 1864, what profits did you divide last year? what did you get out of it yourself for the year 1863, ending 1864? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect the amount of dividend, without reference to figures—I cannot answer without making a calculation, but possibly about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about twenty per cent. per share on the original capital on 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is including bonuses—I was paid for at<lb></lb>tending as private Director of the bank—I did various matters—I was un<lb></lb>doubtedly paid independently of a Director of the bank to investigate the accounts and see that the matters were rightly returned—it is the manager's duty to examine the weekly accounts—I did not take on myself to perform that duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you did not perform that duty? These banking companies are attracting public attention; we want to know what Directors do. Did you as a paid Director never look at the weekly returns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never looked at the weekly returns—I never verified them—I may have casually looked at them—I did not take care to inform myself of the correctness of the half-yearly returns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a great variety of duties; I can<lb></lb>not enumerate the whole of them—I did not ascertain the state of the bank, the state of the issues, or the state of the assets—I took my money when it was offered to me—I do not mean to represent to the jury that I entirely neglected the duty that I undertook—there were a good many duties in advising the manager of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you advise if you did not make yourself acquainted with the state of the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not inform myself of everything—Mr. Wilson was a paid director, equally efficient with myself—his duties were the same as mine—he and I did not meet and have any conversation in relation to the issues of the bank—there were five other directors—we had board meetings once a month, and occasionally—I was nearly always present, and the others were generally present—all the books were not laid before us—I am not aware of any book being asked for and not produced by the manager—it was a rule of the bank that the general Directors should not look into the books at all—that was an original rule—the private Directors had to look into the books—we actually had a rule excluding the general directors from looking into the affairs of the bank, and we two gentlemen are the only persons who did it, and were paid for doing it—the bank went to ruin on the 19th September, 1864, and since that time it has been in the hands of the liquidators—I do not know whether 13, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been spent on the liquidators.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a complaint made against the defendant about the mode in which he managed the affairs of the bank long after this affidavit; do you know that an action was commenced against the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was brought in my name, but beyond that I know little about it—in ad<lb></lb>dition to being a paid director, I was a paid plaintiff—I know nothing more than that—the action was compromised, I have heard by the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220065"></xptr>
               <p>paying somewhat beyond 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I only know from hearsay that he settled that action, and that this action was commenced long after all these matters were known—Mr. Turquand is in Court—we were carrying on a very large speculative business, discounts at an enormous amount, and re<lb></lb>discounts with our own name on the paper—I believe that was the source of the mis<lb></lb>chief—I knew of the nature of the business to some extent—I also knew that the bank was holding mining shares to a considerable representative amount belonging to a person named Osborne—I took a good deal of trouble to ascertain whether those shares were good—I did not entertain a good opinion of them to any great extent, it was very doubtful—bonuses were granted while this business was going on, but no bonuses were affected by the value of those shares—they were of an inconsiderable amount, compared to the entire transactions of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by saying he was sworn in the usual and regular manner? Do not you know perfectly well that the directors ought to have made this return, and to have made the affidavit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. They are authorised to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it done? was it part of your duty as a paid director? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not—I have a memorandum of my appointment as Commissioner, if you will allow me to refer to it (<hi rend="italic">doing so</hi>)—I see that it does not assign a district—I believe I had a regular jurisdiction—I was commissioned by the Lord Chancellor—I have not got my commission—it is filed I presume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least notion notion what you are commissioner for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you had asked me as to the Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, I could have answered you, because there a commission is delivered which definitely points out the district, but the Chancery com<lb></lb>mission does not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least notion what you are commissioner for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To administer oaths in England, no, I believe it would be for the West Riding of Yorkshire—I do not know whether it includes all England—I have administered a great many oaths beyond the bank parlour—this oath was administered most probably in the bank parlour at Leeds—I will swear it was at Leeds, because I have signed it at Leeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No, you have not. Look at it. You have told me your reason for knowing that it was sworn at Leeds is that it is so written, where is it so written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am much surprised that the form issued by the stamp office is defective—I have put the jurat to the form, which is printed—Leeds is in Yorkshire—I do not find Leeds on this paper—I was mistaken in saying that it was at Leeds because I had put it on this piece of paper—I can recollect that it was sworn Leeds—my recollection is that it was at the bank parlour, but I will not swear whether it was there or at my office—I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether you are a commissioner of Leeds, you have no notion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have—I have no doubt this was sworn in the bank parlour, but I do not wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose there was no very great solemnity about it, a lot of papers are brought in, and you say, "I say, Mr. Greenland, just swear this?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably it would be the reverse, and Mr. Greenland would say, "Swear me to this affidavit"—Mr. Michael produced the returns, but Mr. Greenland himself produced them in the bank parlour—I swore him on the Testament—I am quite sure of that—I kept a Testament in the bank parlour, and it was amongst the books—I am quite sure of that if it was sworn there.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did Mr. Greenland succeed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. John Smith—Mr. John Smith did not succeed a person named Redfern—John Smith was the first manager—he became partner in one of the principal Yorkshire Banks, and on that the prisoner was appointed in his place—I do not know of my own knowledge that the returns were made in precisely the same way in Mr. Smith's time—I know nothing about it—the business was very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And Mr. Greenland had to see the whole of the customers; you never saw a customer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did, but Mr. Greenland saw the great majority of them—he made all the money arrangements of the bank I understand, and there were a number of clerks kept who would make different entries in the books—there were about ten or twelve clerks—I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not your duty to verify the books, and was it not his duty to see the customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not my duty, I verified the accuracy of the books periodically—I mean every half-year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then your answer must be altered; it was your duty to verify the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some of them, not the whole.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the accounts were so kept that they could not be unravelled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—they were very voluminous indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many hours did you spend there every day about lunch time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I have ever lunched at the bank—there was no chief clerk by that precise name—there was a rule that the paid directors should be out of business—I am an attorney, but a profession is not a business—I consider that an attorney is not a commercial business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not consider an attorney in business, the interests of clients are not so necessary to be attended to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have the oversight of those who might be regularly in commercial business—I never considered I violated the rule—I consider an attorney is in a profession, but not a business in that sense—the defendant became manager about twenty years ago—he is now more than seventy, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there other persons in the service of the com<lb></lb>pany besides the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twelve clerks, more or less—as far as I know, the defendant had the control of them all—he is not a director or a shareholder—he received a salary from the banking company, which, I think, was 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I think that included his bonuses—he had nothing to pay out of that, no clerk—I was there when he entered the service of the company—I was not connected with the bank then—it would be a mere guess if I were to tell you with what salary he began, but it is within my recollection when his salary was less than 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was increased several times—he had the custody of the books, and as far as I know he examined them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">It all turns upon the question whether the case is one which, in the words of the statute, is</hi> "<hi rend="italic">not otherwise expressly pro<lb></lb>vided for." This is an indictment for perjury, which cannot be supported at Common Law, nor is there any cause pending; therefore, to constitute perjury, it must be made so by the words of an Act of Parliament, and the question is whether the perjury is created by this section. The affidavit is totally illegal from beginning to end, because it is the duty of the bankers to make the affidavit together with the defendant. The question has been raised whether the prisoner is a qualified person for that purpose; but, without going into that at present, the question now is, what is the jurisdiction given by this section to adminster an oath? has it been given? and how are these words to be interpreted? and, also, if there is to be a verification on oath, what is to be the verification, and who is to administer the oath? The</hi> 9 <hi rend="italic">Geo. IV., c</hi>. 23,<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7, <hi rend="italic">says that any Justice of the peace is empowered to administer it.

At the time the Act passed there was no such person as the manager of a bank in the sense in which it is now understood. He is a new. officer, performing duties of a different kind, resulting from the formation of joint-stock banks. The</hi> 9 <hi rend="italic">Geo. IV., c</hi>. 23,<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7, <hi rend="italic">requires the bankers or directors to make the affidavit, and they are to make it to the best of the knowledge and belief of such person or persons, and of his or their cashier, accountant, or chief clerk. Therefore, unless the Commissioners choose to interfere, the banker would produce either of those three parties to join in the affidavit. In that affirmation the only person who acts is the manager. In this case the only person who makes the affidavit is the manager, and he does not declare himself to be either cashier, account, or chief clerk. Altogether the transaction is utterly informal; the Directors have not been sworn to the affidavit, and the manager is not the person intended. He is in the place of the proprietors or owners of a private bank; he is, in fact, what bankers were before joint-stock banks existed</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEANE</hi>. Look at the word "notes," and tell me the meaning of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It means the notes of the Leeds Banking Company, and any notes not Bank of England notes which were in hand at that date—this book (<hi rend="italic">labelled weekly balance of cash</hi>) is the weekly statement of the affairs of the bank, it was laid before Mr. Greenland every Tuesday—I have seen him with it—it is not signed—the weekly trial balance and the weekly statement of the affairs of the bank are the same thing—there is also one of cash—"notes in circulation" means notes signed, both in circu<lb></lb>lation and in the till—the notes in use on 25th June, 1864, were 47, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is in Mr. Clarkson's writing, but it was laid before the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now it is, as far as I gather, from that book that you gather the weekly amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the cash in hand each Saturday—I get the issues by taking the notes in use as appearing in the general ledger, and deduct the notes in hand, which I get from the cash balance book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The result, as far as you have put it, is that there is a larger issue than there ought to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There appears from these figures to be an over issue—it is from these two books that that conclusion is arrived at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you find that the paid director, Mr. William Sax Ward, signs every one of those as well as Mr. Greenland? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are not all signed by Mr. Ward, but most of them are—he signs them as having found them correct—he attaches his signature to the cash balances—the cash balance is obtained by the notes, gold, silver, and sundries being counted by Mr. Greenland and Mr. Ward—they would count it on Monday morning and attach their signatures to each sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that is one of the foundations for the weekly returns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For this purpose it is made use of—it is the only thing that is made use of for these returns—Mr. Greenland had a variety of matters to attend to, and</p>

               <p>was continually engaged—the minute-book was kept by him recording what took place at the Board—I do not think any book from which the balance-sheet was made up was kept by Mr. Greenland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who prepared the balance-sheet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Kirkby—Mr. Greenland prepared a balance-sheet of profit and loss, but Mr. Kirkby entered it in a book—Mr. Greenland drew the draft, and Mr. Kirkby afterwards inserted it in the book—this certificate of the cash to which the signature of Mr. Ward is, is undoubtedly true—I find Mr. Ward's signa<lb></lb>ture to other books of the bank, the balance-book, and the journals—I do not mean the weekly balances, but the annual balance-book—Mr. Green-land signed the notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of the Leeds Banking Com<lb></lb>pany since 1835—I was twenty-eight years a cashier—I was fifteen months junior clerk, and then went to be cashier—in 1859 Mr. Redfern, one of the cashiers, died, and I took his place—I made a discovery in 1859 with regard to the issue of notes, in consequence of which I spoke to Mr. Green-land, who was then the manager of the bank—I told him that I had not notes sufficient to make the return correctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our own notes, our own issue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not notes sufficient to make a proper weekly return on the average of four weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you tell him? I told Mr. Greenland that I had not sufficient notes to make the returns, he said, "You must do it as it has been done; take from the Bank of England notes, and put it to our own notes, and make the return in that way."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What more took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did as he told me—I added the Bank of England notes to our own notes in making the return, reducing the Bank of England notes, and making our own notes more—that would have the effect of making a false statement as regards the issue, by taking the extra number of notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not want the Inland Revenue to believe you had issued a larger number of notes than you ought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but a smaller number—I wished to make the return under the mark—if I had made a true return it would have been above the mark—I was to add the notes of the two cashiers to our notes as if we had our own notes in hand—I added Bank of England notes to the notes in hand, thereby apparently reducing the notes in circulation by that amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did that from time to time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I pre<lb></lb>pared the half-yearly and weekly returns which had to be made to the Stamp Office with reference to the notes: it emanated from me—those weekly returns were signed by the prisoner and sent up to the Stamp Office week by week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that they were untruly returned. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, I would not swear to every one, but as a bulk they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that done week after week till the bank stopped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from 1859 to 1864—in making those returns I always arrived at it in the same way, by adding something to the notes in hand—it was always done by a false addition to the notes in hand—during the time I have been in the bank I have been under the prisoner's orders, except four years, when I was under Mr. Smith—the returns were not the same then, the Act of 1844 had not come into operation—since I have been under the prisoner I have had to obey his orders implicitly—I took my orders from</p>

               <p>him—I have before me the weekly statement of cash-balances for the week ending 25th June—I find my signature to that week, and find that the notes in hand, which I certify to as being correct, are 2535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is a true statement of notes in hand as far as I am concerned—all the other weeks in that half-year are correct, to which I have certified as far as my cash is concerned; the notes in hand—you may take it that all the others to which my signature is attached are correct—this book was laid before Mr. Green-land every Monday when he was at home—he might have been absent a few times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long do you say you were under Mr. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think four years and a half from. July 1835—I am now in a bank in Leeds, the Exchange and Discount Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand your evidence, it is that you were committing for some years a deliberate fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not feel myself responsible for that fraud—I knew it was not correct—it was wrong—you may call it a fraud, but I was not responsible for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you considered it your duty to commit fraud in obedience to a superior officer? I dare say the bank you are in will like to know. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They know all about it—I admit that I was committing a deliberate fraud for years, but I do not consider myself responsible; but if my superior officer was to tell me to do it again I would not do it, because I have had trouble about it, and 10, 000 to 1 I should not be asked to do it—I could not object to it; I could not quarrel with my bread and butter—rather than quarrel with my bread and butter, I admit this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you tell one of the managing directors that this gentle<lb></lb>man put you up to commit a fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no appeal—Mr. Smith was my first employer—there were directors, but they never interfered with the bank business at all, not with me personally—they had to examine my accounts—they never asked for any book—I knew, as far as regards the notes, that a false account in my writing was laid before them, and I knew that from week to week I was practically deceiving my employers, as far as that goes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And now when the bank breaks you charge the prisoner with being the person who told you to it; having committed it for years, you throw it upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be much easier for me to have got through the work in the proper way than to do as I have done—I believe nobody was present when he told me, but it is seven years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you betray the man whom you had been acting as an accomplice with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately the bank stopped there was a meeting at my house—I live at the bank—I will not swear whether I then said that I had been making all these false returns, or whether it was found out by Turquand's people, because I am not quite sure—there were 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. re<lb></lb>issues, and I think Mr. Charles Butler found it out—I, of course, then owned to it—he found out that we had not notes in the bank anything like what the issue was—he knew what we had a right to issue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he find in the books that was false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would know what notes we had in hand by the books, and he knew what notes were issued—when I was told to take from the Bank of England notes and add to our own I made false entries in one book—if Somerset House wanted to look at my books they would have confirmed the returns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you had the false entries of notes in your books, what was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220073"></xptr>
               <p>to prevent anybody abstracting any notes from your book and putting Bank of England notes instead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was merely in figures, not in cash—though I could make one false result, I could not make another in actual cash by taking away part of our own notes, and filling up with Bank of England notes—it was only in one book—the "notes in circula<lb></lb>tion" here is all false—the only way to show what our circulation was would be to take the addition of these three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose by some possibility there was some rogue in the bank, could not he have got hold of some of the cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because every other book is correct, but this book is not correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which is the book you made the false entries in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This book—it is called the circulation account—it is not all my writing—this is one of my false entries (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—this is a false sheet as far as notes are concerned—this, "Particulars of cash in hand ending 14th December, 1861, notes 14, 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," means our notes in our own hands—it is not 14, 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in circulation, but in hand—this entry of 19th November means the same—the whole of this entry is false—I can scarcely tell how it could be corrected, or how an accountant could find out how much of this is false—if 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of our own notes actually in the till had been abstracted I could tell it, because this book is of no use in the actual cash transactions of the bank, it is only for the Inland Revenue—the only other book that I kept is our cash-book—that will not show what cash we had on 18th November, 1861, but the earlier book will—this is the true book, and this is the false book, and by comparing one with the other you see the difference—I had a similar book before me when I made the entry—when I saw that I had only in my till 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and that if I returned that I should be above the issue I added an imaginary figure to make it up 11, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so as to make the issue below the proper sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you call this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The circulation book—it was kept in the safe—it was not among the books. pro<lb></lb>duced to the directors at their board meetings, but I have nothing to do with that—I was not present at the board meetings; I was never called in—the safe was open to every clerk—I kept the key at night for five years—Mr. Greenland had a duplicate key—no living persons made entries in this book but myself, but Mr. Redfern did, and false ones—there are no entries, I believe, by Hurst—I have not told Hurst to make entries in this book or to make false entries anywhere—I will swear that—I never told Hurst to make entries which I knew to be false—I was aware that the returns made from my false book had to be verified on oath—I knew that once every half-year any one who was a party to this would commit perjury if he knew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never went before the directors at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, except the half-year when I took the books before them to audit—this book never went before them, but they were entitled, to see it—this book does not affect the accounts of the bank at all—I had one key of the safe and Mr. Greenland had one—the safe was open in the day for any one in the office to take out the books—Mr. Greenland was present at the meeting of the committee after the bank stopped, and Mr. Butler said to him, "Now, Mr. Greenland, we have been asking Mr. Kirkby about the issue of notes; will you tell us what you know about it?"—I referred to Mr. Greenland, and said that I had asked him how I was to do it, and repeated what I have to-day—he said that he did not remember my</p>

               <p>speaking to him about it; but, the question being very much pressed, he said, "Well, I do not remember, but I believe what Mr. Kirkby says will be truth"—I believe that is word for word—I know a gentleman named Wales, and another named Biggs—they were both present—the balance-sheet of the affairs of the bank was not prepared with the slightest reference to the book, which I pointed out before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time was Mr. Greenland very ill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made it appear so—Mr. Wales was in the room, but whether he went out during the time Mr. Greenland was there I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He did not, because he has been speaking of it. Was Mr. Kirkby sent for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to explain, after Mr. Greenland said that he did not know anything about it—Mr. Greenland did not say in those words that he did not know anything about it, but he made an evasive answer—his answer was that he could not explain it, he did not know anything of it—that is what I call an evasive answer—Mr. Kirkby was then sent for, and Mr. Butler asked him to explain what he did with respect to the over issue of notes—Mr. Kirkby explained the matter fully—he said that he had made up the balance to return to Government by making up all the notes he had as Leeds Bank notes, and that he had done it under the instructions of Mr. Greenland—he said that all at once—I am sure he used the word instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Last time you said, "At the instigation?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I cannot be positive whether it was "instruction" or "instigation"—I look upon those words as both bearing the same meaning—I am quite sure it was one of them, and I give the preference to "instruction."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then "instigation" is your own word? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he may have used both—there were a great many questions asked at the time—Mr. Greenland sat in the room, and I really thought he was ill at the time—he asked to go out of the room, and said that he would go and get a little fresh air and return shortly—he said, "Perhaps it might have been so, and if Mr. Kirkby says so it must be so"—he did not say, "Perhaps it may have been so"—I did not understand it so—I understood it was, "If Mr. Kirkby says so it must be so"—I am not one of the prosecutors—I am not contributing to the prosecution, and I have never been asked—I am not going to do so.</p>

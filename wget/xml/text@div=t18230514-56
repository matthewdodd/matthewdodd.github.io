            . I was servant to Mr. Wyllie. On the 6th of March we went to bed about twelve o'clock. I looked at every door, to see that they were secure, and I am certain the back kitchen window was fastened, and the front area door bolted - I came down next morning, a few minutes before seven o'clock, and found the warehouse door at the foot of the stairs open, and things laying about, and the hall door also open; I had fastened it with two bolts and a chain; the cook got up before me, but did not notice this; I had left a large damask table cloth on the kitchen table, which was gone - I alarmed Mr. Wyllie, and then came down and examined the house; I observed a small square of glass cut out of the window, of the back kitchen, where the fastening was; a person could then push his finger in and push the fastening back; I also found a large piece of wood, cut out of the front area door, there were drops of blood about the area, and on the wall as if a finger had been wiped on it.</p>

            . I am a Hackney coachman, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140024"></xptr>Gibraltar-court, Gibraltar-row, Lambeth-road. On the 6th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the Elephant and Castle stand; I went to the Rulers' room at the corner of Marshall-street, and saw the two prisoners there; I knew neither of them before, but Gloyd was there, whom I had known from a boy; he spoke to me, in the hearing of the prisoners. they were all in company; he said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got a coach in the rank," I said Yes, he said, well then, he should have a good job for me up in Conduit-street, Bond-street, about one o'clock, if I would be there, I said</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will come, if I get a job any where near there." Fuller was dressed in a cut off blue coat. with blue buttons, kerseymere breeches and top boots. I was at Hatton-garden, coach-stand, and was ordered by a lady to drive to Argyle-street; I got there about one o'clock, in a few minutes after, I drove on to the stand at Conduit-street, and stopped in the rank; about half past one o'clock Gloyd walked by and went towards Mr. Wyllie, he had been gone about five minutes, then returned to my coach door with three or four rolls of something under his arm; my horses heads stood on a level with George-street, looking towards Bond-street - Gloyd opened my coach door and threw the rolls in, and then got in himself to place them; he remained in the coach - the two prisoners came with their arms loaded, in the same manner. I did not observe what the rolls were, but when they were taken out, I saw one was a large roll of dark cloth; Fuller then had no boots on, but shoes, that was the only difference in his dress. The prisoners returned backward and forwards four or five times, and brought something every time. The last time they came was a quarter past three o'clock. Mr. Wyllie's shop is on the left hand side going out of Regent-street - my coach was in the middle of the road, where the first coach always stands. They got into the coach, and shut the door, and told me to drive to Cornhill. I was going to stop in Cornhill - one of them let down the front glass, and said,</p>
               <p>"Dont stop here, drive on to the first turning to the right after you pass the church," I did so, and they then ordered me to take the first turning to the left, which led into a little square. They pulled the string for me to stop, under a lamp on the left hand side; it was then about quarter past five o'clock, and then Fuller jumped out from the off side door, and knocked at the door on one side of the lamp, which was immediately opened by a man in his shirt sleeves; Fuller returned to the coach. They all three took an arm full of the rolls into the house. Fuller remained in the house with them, while the prisoners fetched the rest out; they all went into the house; the door was shut - they had been in the house about the space of five minutes, when Gloyd returned to me, and put five sovereigns, and a one pound note in my hand; he said</p>
               <p>"Here, we shan't want you any more, you may go about your business," I had been on the stand a quarter of an hour or better. My horses each have a white star on the forehead; I talked with the watchman in Conduit-street about the badness of the weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what night of the week was it - A. Thursday. I saw them at the Rulers' room at nine o'clock; nine or ten people were drinking there. Gloyd sat with the prisoners; the conversation was in a low tone; I did not suspect any thing wrong; I did not ask where he brought the parcels from; they were nearly three quarters of an hour bringing the goods to the coach; it was above half past two o'clock when he came up, and a quarter past three when we started. I only saw the watchmen once.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you come here from gaol - A. I have come from Tothill-fields; I was taken there because several threatened to kill me. I did not suspect any thing wrong till he put the money into my hand; I did not refuse it; and in the morning I told my mother I thought I had been carrying people who were after no good; I told nobody else; I was apprehended about three weeks afterwards, and related it to the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give information before - A. I did not know what to do; I was as likely to be wrong as right; I do not expect to escape punishment by being a witness; I believe the magistrate did say if I told nothing but truth it would save me. The coach I drive is No. 77; it is my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not think it odd that a coach should be wanted in Conduit-street from the Elephant and Castle - A. Not at all; my being hired to Argyle-street was quite accidental; unless I had been there I should not have gone. I had a fare to Fleet-market first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it suspicious for one man to wait in the coach while the others fetched the bundles - A. No; they brought the rolls in a direction from Mr. Wyllie's; I saw them come out of his door; the back of my coach was that way; I did not offer to pull up to the door; I was within twenty yards of the house; they told me not to drive up to the door; I could not tell whether they lived there or not; I believed it was their property. and only expected my fare. I did not speak to Gloyd while he was in the coach. I have not talked with him since.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was busy in the coach putting up the rolls - A. Yes; Gloyd has been in Tothill-fields. but we have been kept separate. Mine was the only coach on the stand; a chariot had driven off.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Wellington-street, Newington-causeway. On Wednesday night, 3d of March, I went to a house in Conduit-street, with Fuller and Rodham, and I had known them nine or ten months - he, Rodham, and I had agreed to go two or three days before, and Bishop, the coachman was to ply there. On the evening of the robbery, I saw Bishop at the Elephant and castle, about four or five o'clock and asked him to ply at the West end of the town, in a street where there were some fine large new building at the end of it; I do not know the name of the street. I told him to meet me there at one o'clock. Nobody was with us when I said this - the prisoners were twenty or thirty yards off - they stopped in the street, not in a house - I afterwards went with the prisoners to Oram's in the Strand, where we stopped till a quarter past eleven o'clock - we then went to Tinkler's (Rodham's) lodging, in Shoe-lane, Holborn, and stopped there till a quarter before twelve; all three of us together; we then look a centre bit and some keys, we had with us before; they belonged to Tinkler - we then went to that end of the town, where the new buildings are, and where the robbery was to be committed; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140025"></xptr>went to Bishop; he was in the rank before we got there, which was about one o'clock; I said nothing to him; Price and Tinkler went down the area to the kitchen door, with the centre bit; they unlocked the area gate. I saw no more of them till they came out at the private door; they then went back and fetched some cloth. I had been waiting about an hour and a half for them. It was two hours before we left the house for good. They brought rolls of cloth with them, I and Bishop put them into the coach, which was twelve or fourteen yards from the door, in the ranks. Bishop helped in with the cloths. I stopped with the coach while they went back for more. Tinkler and Price went backwards and forwards, and brought cloth to me, which I put into the coach. We told Bishop to drive to the first turning past Whitechapel church, and then the first turning to the right. The centre bit was Tinkler's; he had some keys also, and a stock. When the coach stopped, we knocked at a door, and the things were taken in. I returned to Bishop, and gave him three sovereigns first, and 1 l. in silver, and gave him two more sovereigns in the afternoon. I was apprehended about ten days ago. The robbery was advertized about a week after it happened. Tinkler and I went beyond Stoke Newington, and lived together there - he went by the name of Rodham, and I as Matthews. We were apprehended, and put in the watch-house, and on the Monday morning, when the watch-house man brought us some water, we pulled the door open and ran out. I was taken the next day in Rhodes-fields, Islington. We got 109 l. for the cloth, and it was shared between the prisoners and me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you known Bishop - A. A good while. I saw him at the Elephant and Castle, about four o'clock, his coach was there then, he knew what we were going about. I did not see him before on that day. I gave him 4 l. at first, and told him, I did not know what there would be more for him, but it would be settled, and if he came to my lodging in the afternoon he should have it, which he did, and I gave him 2 l. more, as his share of the booty. It was part of the plan that his coach should be on the stand, and not at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the Ruler's room - A. Yes; I was there about a week before the transaction. Tinkler was there then, but not Price. I have seen Bishop there frequently, but not on the night in question.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he was aware of what you were going about - A. Because we applied to him one night - it was not done then, as we had not got the centre bit, and we applied to him on the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Ruler's room, on the night you meant to have done it - A. Yes, in the day time Bishop and I were there, but neither of the prisoners; I told him we knew where to get some cloth; he knew all about it.</p>

            . In March last I was watchman of Conduit-street. I heard of this robbery on the 7th of March. I was on my beat the night before, and saw a coach on the stand. I had some talk with the coachman. I never saw his face, and should not know him again. I particularly looked at his horses; they stood at the head of the stand, at the corner of George-street; they were very dark brown or black horses. I saw the coach there until I called three o'clock but not afterwards. I think one horse had a white streak on the face. The coachman appeared to me to have a large blue top coat on, which he wrapped all round him, and said he would have a sleep and threw himself back on his box; he appeared to be asleep every time I passed him.</p>

            . I am a dealer in spruce and ginger beer, and live in Sion-street, Whitechapel. On the morning of the 7th of March, about four or five o'clock. I was awake and heard a coach pass my door, and draw up about two doors further, towards the Commercial-road, at a house kept by Solomon's. I heard the coach door, and also the house door open; a person came out - there was passing and repassing several times, the coach was there about ten minutes or quarter of an hour, but it being dark and the coach just under the window, I could not see it; I heard of the robbery afterwards, and went to Mr. Wyllie.</p>

            . In March last I lived in Peter-street, Cow-cross - the prisoner Tinkler lodged with me there; he went by the name of

            ; he lived there five or six months, and left on a Friday. Mr. Wyllie came to me the day after he left; he gave me no warning. I did not know of his going - he paid me three weeks rent on a Friday morning, and he was out overnight; at least the young woman said so - I do not know it myself. He left me the day week after he paid me, and did not pay me for that week. The young woman went away four or five hours after him. I then looked about the room, and found a centre bit in the cupboard, and a key stowed behind the grate - it was given to the officer. There was a large hole in the centre of the closet, and one in the door. The large hole appeared to have been made by the centre hit. That mark was not in the closet before the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You know nothing of his being out - A. No. The centre bit was not there before he came.</p>

            . I keep the house No. 4, Peter-street, Cow-cross. Fuller lodged with me for four months - I think he gave me the name of Williams; he left some time in March, about the 11th or 12th. Neither me or my wife live in the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Fuller in bed, in Clement's-place, Temple-bar, on Sunday, the 16th of March - Pace and Handley were with me. We found a coat and breeches in the room where he was; he said they were his - I did not notice his hand, but at one of the examinations I saw a cut on one of his fingers. We took Rodham and Gloyd on the 4th of May, about three o'clock in the morning, with another man - he denied all knowledge of Gloyd; we put them in St Margaret's watch-house; they afterwards escaped. I found a knife, a file, and a piece of candle on Rodham. I took Salter to Mr. Wyllie's, and to No. 4, Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know when Gloyd first said that he knew of the robbery - A.

            . I assisted in apprehending the prisoners. The breeches found in Fuller's lodging were stained with blood - he had a cut in his right hand, which looked rather fresh; it was not healed up - I think it had not been done above a week. We apprehended Rodham with Gloyd and another man, on Sunday, the 4th of May, and on Monday they had escaped. Rodham denied all knowledge of Gloyd or the other, and gave his address Northampton-row, Clerkenwell. Salter delivered me a key and centre bit.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I produce two pannels - one of which I took from Mr. Wyllie's door, and another from Wheeler's. There are marks of an inch and three eights, and a four inch centre bit on them; there are marks of the inch and three eighths centre bit on both. The centre bit found is a four inch one - it fits the mark on the pannel at Wheeler's, but not at the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The centre bit does not fit the marks in Mr. Wyllie's pannel - A. No; but there are marks on both pannels of an inch and three eights centre bit having been used. Centre bits are made of regular sizes, on a progressive scale. Every carpenter has a regular set of them.</p>
               <p>MR. WYLLIE. I got the centre bit and a picklock key from Wheeler's on the 25th.</p>

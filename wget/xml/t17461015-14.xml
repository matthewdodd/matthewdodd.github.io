            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morgan. On the 13th of April last was a Twelve-Month I lost a Guinea; this Man, the Prisoner at the Bar, and another along with him, came into my Shop: My Wife had just receiv'd four Guineas, and push'd them up towards me to put them into the Till; but I was busy and the Prisoner put out his Hand and took up a Guinea: I saw him, but thought he would have put it down again. He withdrew himself as if he would go out, and said, you know I am an honest Man, I will soon return it; so he whipp'd away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he took the Guinea away?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Yes, my Lord, I spoke to him when he was going away, and that was his Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this ago? You say last April was a Twelve-Month.</p>
               <p>Morgan. This Man, my Lord, was never to be found by me nor others that wanted to take him. I heard that the other Person went sometimes as his Servant, his Footman, and sometimes for his Son.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night was it?</p>
               <p>Morgan. About Ten o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What Shop do you keep?</p>
               <p>Morgan. A Broker's Shop, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell there?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Not much; sometimes I sell some Things. I went to several Places to enquire after him: I am positive this is the Man, I saw him at my House twice before, about a Fortnight before that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did he follow?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I never heard of any Business, besides taking of Houses and defrauding People; I never heard any other Character of him in my Life.</p>
               <p>Court. (to the Prisoner.) You hear what this Man says.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Man is a Pawnbroker, my Lord; I was oblig'd to pawn some Things about a Twelve-Month ago, and he lent me a Guinea more upon them about a Week after: I wanted a little more Money upon a Wig that cost me three Guineas. Ask him whether he did not lend me a Guinea more upon the Plate last Easter Saturday was a Twelve-Month; upon two Silver Spoons and a Silver Salt .</p>

            (to Morgan.) Had you any Plate of him in pawn? Was there any Money advanced as he speaks of?</p>
               <p>Morgan . Not one Farthing at that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you advance at first upon the Plate?</p>
               <p>Morgan. My Lord, I don't remember exactly what it was; but he had it again .</p>
               <p>Q. When you was robb'd of this Guinea did you pursue the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morgan. My Lord, I went to the Door, but I could not see where he was gone.</p>

            .) What do you know of this Matter ?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I know, Sir, he came to our House ; I was busy behind the Compter in receiving some Money. I shov'd some Guineas towards my Husband, and desir'd him to take Care of them; the Prisoner directly took up a Guinea and ran out .</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was that ?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Really, my Lord, I can't tell justify the Day, but it was about a Twelve-Month ago. My Husband went several Times after him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Court. ( to the Prisoner.) This Woman says she was in the Shop at the Time when you took up this Guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Her Husband said , let my Jetter have a Guinea more upon his Plate .</p>

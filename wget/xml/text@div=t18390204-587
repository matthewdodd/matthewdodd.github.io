                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Peryer. He keeps a chandler's shop, in Brick-lane, Old-street—the prisoner occupied a room up stairs, when we took possession of the premises—I have a room on the same floor with hers, which I occupy as a store-room—I missed some things from there on the 21st of December—I afterwards told her I had lost some things—she said she did not know any thing about it—the key of her room will open the door of that room—she said I might search her room if I liked, and the first thing I saw was my apron—I then sent for a police<lb></lb>man, who found the stockings under her bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The drawers were given me by a person in the next room, whose key also fits that room—the stockings belonged to the person in the next room, for what I know—I said the apron was Jane Clark's, and the prosecutor said, "I can bring the fellow to match it"—the hand<lb></lb>kerchief was given to Ann Barrett to pawn, by Jane Clark—a towel I never saw—the apron was in my drawer, for Jane kept her things in my room.</p>

I searched the prisoner's room—I found twenty-five duplicates, an apron, a towel, and two pairs of stockings—the prosecutrix claimed them all—the apron was in the first drawer, next the door, where the prosecutrix had seen it—the stock<lb></lb>ings were under the bed—the towel was on a chair, and the duplicates in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brick-lane, Old-street. I produce this handkerchief and drawers—they were pawned by the prisoner in the name of "Ann Barrett, No. 1, Rose-street"—the dupli<lb></lb>cate of the drawers was found at the prisoner's.</p>

            . I was standing at the corner of West-street, about half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 22d of December - the prisoner passed me with a blanket round a bundle under his arm; he turned into Field-lane, and went into No. 9 - I stood looking, a young woman came out, and said "What are you looking at?" I said" At that print;" she then went in - I followed her. and I heard her say as she went in, "It will not do for me;" I then went in, and took the prisoner, and these articles - I delivered him up to Barnley; he had laid the blanket on the counter, and this furniture upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know this woman very well? A. No; I do not recollect speaking to her before; she is not here - I do not know whether he was selling these things to her - she said it would not do for her; I asked whose things they were, and he said they were his own; he gave an address at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether it was his master whose address he gave? A. I do not know; his master came to the office the next day: I saw the prisoner carry the articles, and he walked into the shop; I stood about a minute at the door, and the young woman came out.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am a constable. The prisoner was put into my hands, with this property; I asked him where he lived - he told me at Mr. Sadgrove's, <placeName id="t18290115-141-crimeloc739">Eldon-street, Finsbury</placeName>

            . The prisoner was living with me; this blanket and furniture are mine - they have my private-mark on them: they were in my warehouse; I cannot exactly say when I had seen this print - I missed it when I heard of this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you other furnitures of the same kind made up? A. Yes; we had sold some - I should think not more than half a dozen pieces; we always put the private-mark on our articles; this was not sold.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to leave a white four-post furniture, and this was with it; I had taken it to Newington; I rolled it up in the wrapper, and was taking it home- I was coming down Field-lane, and this Jew woman said"Have you got any thing to sell?" I said No - she laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150058"></xptr>hold of me, and said,"Let me look;" she dragged me in, and the watchman took me directly.</p>
               <p>MR. SADGROVE. He was out with furniture that day and the day before, but with none of this descripution; he had to take a set of scarlet curtains to Shacklewell - he packed up the parcel: we have several blankets to pack goods in - the prisoner said he had done it by mistake; he has lived four years with me.</p>

            . I let the prisoner out about eight o'clock that evening; he was then to go home - he had gone out about four o'clock in the afternoon, to take the red curtains home; he came back about eight in the evening, and went away immediately - he took no parcel with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then when he was going out for the evening he had no bundle? A. No; I cannot exactly swear who packed up the bundle he took out in the afternoon - the orders were for him to pack it up, and take it to Shacklewell: it was about four o'clock in the afternoon: the porters do one another's work, unless they are heavy goods; I am sometimes away - they might, in my absence, assist one another with light goods.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

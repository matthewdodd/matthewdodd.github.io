                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 5, Temple Street, Bethnal Green—on Monday, 21st February, between 6 and 7 in the evening, I was in Hare Street, Bethnal Green, and met the prisoner and two other men—they tripped me up, and as I was falling backwards I received a blow on the back of my neck, which threw me forward—I put my thumb into my waistcoat pocket, and held my watch—as I got up, the prisoner came in front of me and snatched my chain from my waistcoat—it broke away from my watch—I called "Police! murder!" and they ran away—I saw the prisoner two days after at the Spital Square Station, and picked him out from eight or nine other men—I am quite sure he is the man—my chain was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dock labourer, and live at 16, Wentworth Street—on Monday, 21st February, I was with the prisoner between 6 and 7 o'clock, in the Soup Kitchen, Commercial Street, Spitalfields—he was sitting at my side—I should say it was about 6.30, and I was in his company till 7.20—I often used to meet him there—he lived in the same house with me, and we had tickets—we went every other day when soup tickets were given out—Hare Street is about a quarter of a mile from Commercial Street—a great many persons were at the Soup Kitchen at the time—I do not know that any of them are here—we left together, and I went with him to his mother at Middlesex Hospital—we returned at 8.30.</p>

               <p>Parker. His name is Fish; the lad is in court. I took him to Justice Fielding's; there he gave his evidence, and was admitted an evidence to come here. There was another boy taken up, upon his evidence, whose name was Gammon, but nothing was found upon him. M'Donald was taken up, and the rest of the prisoners, but they denied knowing any thing of the robbery. (The eighteen handkerchiefs found at the Fountain, seven at Mrs. Perry's, and three at Mr. Burton's, produced and deposed to). M'Donald and Farrel both said, they knew nothing of the evidence Fish, but said, he was set on by the thieftakers.</p>

               <p>Fish. Mr. Parker's young man was in the shop, while we were taking them; he was packing up some linen. Then we went to Kitt M'Donald's room, in Black-boy alley, and counted them.

               <p>Gammon. I have been acquainted with them about three months: I have been acquainted with Fish about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with them first?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We had been drinking together at the Hog in Armour, in Field-lane?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you set out from, when you did this robbery?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We were at Kitt M'Donald's, in the morning, and we went out to take a walk; we walked about the Park, till it began to be dusk: then we went a little way down the Strand, on this side Charing-cross; there we robbed a shop of thirteen handkerchiefs; it is the shop of Mr. Dent; they were red and white ones; then we went on towards home; we saw a pane of glass was cracked in Mr. Parker's shop-window; we pushed the glass in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that?</p>
               <p>Gammon. I can't say who did it; we were all four together: we took out the handkerchiefs: Kitt M'Donnald stood a little way off; we gave him some of them; then he went a little farther off, and after that he crossed the way to Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs did you take?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were about 105 or 106 handkerchiefs and neckcloths; there were five neckcloths; these are part of them, (pointing to them produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you count them?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We counted them at Kitt M'Donald's lodgings.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop near Rosemary-lane. On the 17th of December I had been looking over the papers there I read about Mr. Parker's being robbed: I charged all my people, if any handkerchiefs were brought, to stop them; in about half an hour after came

I asked them whether they had any more: they said, no, they had only these three; they took out but one, at first, but my wife seeing more in her apron, she took the other out. I desired them to recollect who they bought them of, and when; they said, they bought them about half an hour before they brought them to my shop, of a man in a striped waistcoat: I said, is he a seafaring man; they said, they did not know: the man they described answered the description of the man they call

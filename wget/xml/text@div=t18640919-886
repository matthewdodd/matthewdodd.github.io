                  </hi>, M. D. I am physician and medical officer of the Mary lebone Workhouse—on the morning of 6th August, my attention was called, to Eliza Mitton by Mr. Fuller—she was then in the lunatic ward of the workhouse—I was with her some time—in my judgment, she was a person of unsound mind; I have no doubt of it—about 1 o'clock that day, the defendant came to the workhouse—he came to my room and said, "You have got one of my patients here"—at first I did not know who he meant, and I asked him for an explanation—he said he came for a Miss Mitton, who had escaped from his house—he said his name was Mr. Henry Wilkins, of Ealing, a medical man—Mr. Wilks, the Commissioner of Lunacy, was in my room at the time, and he asked him in my presence if she was a certified lunatic—he said, "No"—Mr. Wilks asked him whether his house was licensed—he said, "No"—directions were afterwards given for Miss Mitton to be given up to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the Commissioner direct her to be given up to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave no directions; he sanctioned it—that was on the same day—she came in between 3 and 4, and I saw her between 11 and 12—I did not think of asking whether she was suffering under a periodical disease at the time—I should, no doubt, have ascertained it had she remained—the brain of nervous persons is occasionally affected when that is the case—I don't think it depended upon that in this case—I should, of course, consider it a pertinent question, had I entered into the case in the afternoon, but she was taken away before I had time to do it.</p>

M.; Insanity. Eliza Mitton, about thirty years old. Found in Edgware-road, and brought by police-constable 509 S, Portland-town station. Sent to Dorcas ward"—he said, "Yes, that is the young woman"—I then asked him to sign for her across the entry, and be wrote in the book, "Received this patient from the Master of the Workhouse. H.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By the term "advanced imbecility," you imply in increase? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The tendency would be to increase; it would not all come on at once—I apprehed that the disease first manifested itself at the age of fifteen—she is a somewhat hysterical person; alternately laughing and crying without any reason, a highly nervous temperament—such an organization would, no doubt, be aggravated by the periodical disease, and be very likely to have the brain affected by the working of the nerves at that time—she is a person of no mind, or very little—it would go on in that way from time to time, and so destroy the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man—I was on visiting terms with Dr. Wilkins—I have known him for seven or eight years—between 1862 and August this year, I have occasionally been in the habit of going to his house, and have seen this lady there—I first saw her in 1862, and from the oppor<lb></lb>tunity I had of seeing her, which was only casually, I considered her to be suffering from general debility, accompanied with a very weakly, nervous state—she seemed to be suffering from a general bad habit of body—she was a pale feeble-looking woman, and I have no doubt the functions of life were very imperfectly performed, and very likely the functions that have been spoken of were not properly, if at all, performed—that functional derangenent would affect the health—her physical health was very low—I saw nothing then to indicate any aberration of mind—I never heard anything breathed by my friend Mr. Wilkins, or any individual, that there was any aberration of mind, and I never saw it myself—I saw her from that time up to August in the present year, and latterly I have observed, of course, the change which has been mentioned—that was during the present year,</p>

               <p>about two or three months ago—I have observed decided indications of mental aberration, and inconsistency of manner, garrulity, and incoherence which I had never observed before—I did not see her at the time she escaped—the last time I saw her, I considered she was in that state that she would not be competent to manage her own affairs; though I think she was in that condition that she could take care of herself pretty well—she knew pretty well what she was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she left this gentlemen's house, up to the last time you saw her there, was there, in your judgment, anything in her conduct to justify confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not any restraint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say there were decided indications of mental aberration, when was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At my last visit to Mr. Wilkins, about six weeks or two months ago; it might have been in July—I don't think she required any restraint—I don't say she was competent to manage her own affairs, or to take care of herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you fix some date? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot fix a date—it might be two or three months ago—I do not think she deserved to be confined in a lunatic asylum—I think the surveillance of a medical man would have been necessary—I should have been very sorry to Bee her put into a lunatic asylum if she had been a daughter of mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ealing, and also in Westbourne-ter-race, London—I know Mr. Wilkins—I have been in the habit of going to his house, and have occasionally seen the young lady in question there—I cannot state the exact date when I last saw her, but it was sometime during August, shortly before the 6th—I have frequently seen her, but cannot say exactly when—I always considered her of a weak mind, and nothing beyond that—there did not appear to me the least reason for restraining her—I would not have had it done on any account—she was always exceedingly quiet when I saw her—sometimes she has conversed with me—her conversation has always indicated a feeble mind—she was always treated as one of the family, and took her meals with them—from what I have seen, Mr. Wilkins's conduct was invariably kind to her—he has a large family of children—they were all living in the house, and railed with her.</p>

Q.</hi> What is your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the Madras Civil Service—I am not in the medical profession—I have been backwards and forwards to Ealing constantly; sometimes residing there for five or six months in the year—my visits to Dr. Wilkins were those of an ordinary friend, calling occasionally—I occasionally saw the young lady when I called—I never saw her otherwise—I have never dined there, or taken a meal there—I have gone into the house when they were having their meals, and seen her seated at the table with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Grimble and Co. distillers, in Albany-street, Regent's-park—I have known Mr. Wilkins for the last fifteen years—I have been constantly in the habit of going to Ealing—I lived there six years during that time—I have been in he habit of going to his house, and have seen the young lady there four of five times times within the last two years—the last time I saw her, I think, was in June, walking in the street with a servant—I drank tea there the first time I saw her—she sat at table drinking her tea the same as the others—I saw nothing peculiar inner</p>

               <p>conduct—that must have been more than two years ago—I never saw anything indicating that she ought to be confined or restrained; the only thing I noticed about her was, that she seemed to be talking to herself—she had a book reading, and appeared to be talking to herself—I spoke to her the first time I saw her, and she answered me as rationally as you do—she was treated as one of the family, and associated with the children—I have seen her with Mr. Wilkins's daughters, I believe, upon each occasion—the last time I called, she was alone in the dining-room, and I was shown in to her by the servant—I have, unfortunately, some experience in these matters; I had a brother who lived to the age of thirty-two, who was perfectly imbecile from having received a fall when a child, although he was perfectly intelligent in many things; we could not consider him other than imbecile, but he was never restrained in any shape or way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you do for him during his imbecility? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We merely gave him medicine occasionally, and kept him on the lightest food—he was not put under the watch of any person—he was sufficiently rational for this, that if he had had once met you, if he did not see you for two or three years, he would address you by name; but we could not teach him to read, or to put his boots on; he always put his left boot on his right foot, and spoke in an imbecile way—he was weak in intellect—he was quite able to take care of himself—he sat at table with us like others—except into the garden he never went out alone, as a matter of course.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a teacher of the French language, and have resided at Ealing for the last seven years, I have been in the habit of teaching Mr. Wilkins' children for the last four years—I used to see Miss Mitton there every time during the last two years, and besides I would occasionally tall at the house, and would generally see her there—I have had occasion to see her at least four times a week—I always called her a child; an over-grown child; a childish mind grown up with her—I never saw her do anything wrong—I never saw anything that indicated that restraint was requisite—when strangers would come into the house, and stay for half an hour with her, they would scarcely notice anything—she would converse with any person that came in—occasionally she would be a little shy; in fact, what was most noticable in her was timidity—she was very nervous—she would talk rationally, but childishly.</p>

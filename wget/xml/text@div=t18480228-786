                  </hi> I am one of the presidents of the London district in the Post-office. The prisoner has been employed there some years as clerk at the Hampton divison, and received a salary of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—a letter addressed to a person at Bettersca-field would go to the Hampton division—on 17th Feb., in consequence of something that reached me, I spoke to the prisoner as he was leaving the office—he had hold of the handle of the door leading to the water-closets—I said, "oh, you have not signed in the right place this morning"—he said, "I will attend to that when I come up"—I said, "No; attend to it at once"—he then returned, and walked into the signing-room, close to the president's room—I opened the door of the president's room, and said, "Step in"—I took him into the room, and said, "I suspect you have got a letter in your pocket"—he made no answer—I said, "Then you have a letter in your pocket; give it to me"—he</p>

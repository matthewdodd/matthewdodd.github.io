I live at Little Essex Street, Kingsland—I was married to the prisoner on 16th July, 1866, at St. James's, Curtain Road—I was confined on October 9th, 1871—when I had been confined three days he told me I had a bastard at the side of me, and I was no wife of his, he had a wife in the country better than me—he had previously told me he was a married man, but he said afterwards he did it to aggravate me, and said "I have got no wife but you"—he did not tell me he was married to anyone else before he married me—I received two letters from him, one</p>

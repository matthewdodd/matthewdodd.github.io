            , brought the prisoner to my house on the 9th or 10th of June, to reside there for a short time - she staid six weeks and three days, and left on the 23rd of July - she lived in the same room, sat at the same table with us, and knew where I kept my keys and property. On Wednesday night, the 22nd of July, there was in my cupboard, a 20l., a 10l., and four 5l. Bank notes - I had received the 20l. from my nephew, and received 40l., in 5l. Bank notes, from Colonel Bentinck; I gave my nephew four of those 5l. notes for the 20l. note, and the 10l. note I had from a lady who lodged in the house; there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in a paper - these were all in a cupboard in the dining-parlour; I saw those notes safe in the closet about eight or nine o'clock at night, when I went to put away the tea, and at bed time the prisoner was sitting in the small back parlour with me; I left the room to go round the house, to see that it was safe; the closet was in the next room - I was not gone more than five minutes; I came up again, sat down, and put away my work; I looked at her, and said, "Good G - d, Miss Eckhardt, what a smell of fire there is;" I ran out with the candle - she followed me; I said, "Good G - d, where is it?" she pointed to a little bit of string like a thread, which hung down from a nail in the closet, and said,"There it is;" it hung down by the side of the cupboard, which was open at the time; I ran to the cupboard, and there was a fire.</p>

               <p>Q. What was burnt? A.Paper - I put it out, and said, "Good G - d, my money is burnt;" it was some paper which I had there - I put it out as well as I could, and ran down stairs; I got a shovel, and put the burnt pieces of paper into a plate, and begged her not to touch it till my nephew came in - I went out, and when I returned she was still at the cupboard, and said, "Here is your gold, that is not burnt, but your stupid English money, paper money, is burnt;" I then waited for a short time, to see that every thing was right - there was no danger in the cupboard, and then we went to bed; she at that time slept with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any money transactions between you, in the course of which you could have given her either of these notes? A. No - this was on the 20th, and on the Saturday following, the 23rd, she went away; she told me and my nephew she was going abroad, to travel with a new married gentleman and lady, who had come from Cologne, and were going back there; that she was going to Paris, going to travel, and then going home to her father and mother at Cologne - she said that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080006"></xptr>lady and gentleman were to meet her at Southampton; she was to go with them across the water, and then home, but she at first told me she was going to Winchester - she afterwards said she was going to Southampton, as she could not get a place to Winchester - on the Sunday or Monday after she was gone, I went to the wardrobe to get my shawl to go out with my nephew, and could not find it; I have also missed lace, dresses, cambric handkerchiefs, muslin, gloves, pieces of new silk, a crape shawl, veils, a long shawl, a lace shawl, feathers, and various, articles of dress - I have lost also two rings, and a portfolio of drawings was taken from my wardrobe; I have seen some of them since - I never permitted her in any way to take these articles; I did not know she had got them - the very night before she went away I said I had got some things to sell; she looked at them and paid me eighteen sovereigns for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LOVEDAY. Q. I thought you had never had any money transactions with her? A. I conceive that was my money, and her board and lodging was included in the amount - I do not always lock my drawers, but I see that the keys are laid on the table; I locked the closet when I went to bed, but that was after the fire - I had been to the closet before I went down stairs; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night -I put the candle on the table which stands by the closet, and threw in my work; I did not take a candle into the cupboard - the fire was discovered about that time; we went to bed about half-past ten or eleven o'clock - it was all done within ten minutes; I merely threw the work into the closet, and saw that the notes were there - I did not count them - I saw that they laid on the shelf in two parcels; the 10l. note was with some bills and two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - the 20l. and the 5l. notes were altogether; I usually drink a little table-ale, and when I have none in the house I send to the public-house for it; I have lived with the Bentinck family more than thirty years - I did not touch the notes when I went to the cupboard, but am certain they were there - I saw the two parcels, but did not examine to see the notes; my nephews have lived with me some time; I am single: the prisoner knew where I kept my keys - the cupboard door was not locked, nor yet put too; a piece of string was hanging down, and there was fire at the end of the string - the end paper was burning; I collected the burnt pieces of paper, thinking when my nephew returned he might find the numbers of some of the notes - he was out of town: I thought it might be the notes, but it turned out to be nothing but paper which I had some tea in - we have since found the notes, therefore they could not be burnt; I am not related to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18310908-4-person130">Bentinck</persName>
             - he pays me an annuity; he paid me 40l. in July, which was half a year's annuity - he paid me these 5l. notes, and the rest in gold and silver; I received 40l. odd from him - the 10l. note I received from Miss Impey, a lodger; I never saw any thing of the notes afterwards - the two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns, which were in a paper, were left behind; the burnt paper was taken to the Bank - I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner pay you 18l. for? A. She bought a dress for 1l., and six shifts for half a guinea a-piece - that was a week or a fortnight before, but they had not been paid for; I had no money transaction with her till she paid me for them the night before she left; she asked me that night to show her some more things, and she would buy them - it was then she bought the shifts; the shifts were made of Dutch linen, trimmed with cambric, trimmed in Holland; she paid me three guineas for a blue dress, and the shifts came to three guineas, and there were six weeks' board and lodging at a guinea and a half a week; my nephew brought her to my house in a coach from an hotel in the Haymarket - Colonel Bentinck had written to him to fetch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not receive twenty-seven guineas from her? A. I swear I did not receive more than eighteen; I have heard her speak of Mrs. Kently, but I never saw her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You called her Miss Eckhardt - is that the name she was known to you by? A. Yes - I did not know her by any other name.</p>

             - I took her to my aunt's, and she boarded and lodged there; while she was there a two-penny post letter came, addressed to Madame Roulette - she heard my aunt tell the postman nobody lived there by that name, and I heard the same; I said I thought there must be some mistake, it must be for Miss Eckhardt - she opened it immediately, and said it was for her; before she left my aunt's she told me she wished to get a place by the stage to Winchester, that she had been to the coach-office, and every place was engaged for the following day, but a French lady had booked a place to go to Southampton, and she had arranged with that lady to have her place, by paying for it; this was the second day after the burning in the closet - I went with her to the New White Horse cellar, in Piceadilly; she took two trunks with her, and an umbrella, that was all - when she got to the coach-office she showed me a ticket, which she said she had received from the lady, with the lady's name on it, which was Roulette; I made no remark to her, but she said, "Roulette I thought it was Broulette - that must have been the French lady who was going to take a governess' situation which I had given up - you remember a letter coming to me in that name - that must have been the lady; I wish I had remembered it, I would have talked to her about it;" I saw her off by the Southampton coach- this was on Saturday, and on the Tuesday following my aunt missed some property, upon which I went to Southampton, and at last found the prisoner at a young ladies' boarding-school, kept by Mrs. Wood, at Houndwell, near Southampton; Mrs. Wood, spoke to her by the name of Roulette - I told Mrs. Wood, in her presence, what had brought me there; I said she had made so many false representations at my aunt's house that she must return with me to town, to clear them up; Mrs. Wood took two drawings from the mantel-piece, and said, in her presence, that Miss Roulette had given them to her as her own drawings; I believe them to be my aunt's - I asked her for her keys; she gave them to me - I went up stairs with a constable, and opened her boxes; they were the same boxes as I saw her take to the stage - I saw some feathers on the top of the boxes when I opened them; I did not search the boxes - I put in some things which were found; there were shawls, lace, silk stockings, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080007"></xptr>various articles - I put them into the boxes, locked them, and brought the boxes to town, with the whole of the things belonging to her; I put the keys into my own pocket - the boxes came to town untouched and unaltered - I left them at Mary-le-bone watch-house; an officer, who had met me at the coach, was with me at the time - the boxes were produced before the Justice, with the same things in them; my aunt saw them there - they have been in the hands of the officer ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to the hotel to fetch her? A. I went there to see her, in consequence of a note from Colonel Bentinck, and the next time I went I found a note in her possession, directed to me, from General

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say this piece of silk is worth 5l.? A. Yes - here is another piece that is cut off it; I kept my purse in a drawer - I did not keep my money in a box; I am sure I drink nothing but table-ale - half a pint at dinner, and half a pint at supper.</p>

I left Amsterdam in the capacity of companion with a lady of the name of Kently; having arrived at the Custom-house, and not finding my box, Mrs. Kently desired me to return to the steam-boat to look for it - however it was not there, and the captain representing that it was probably left at Rotterdam I returned to the Custom-house, where Mrs. Kently had left a note for me, desiring me to follow her to her residence at Pall-mall, but not being able to trace her there I was compelled to repair to an hotel; the keeper of the hotel took the utmost pains to find her, and I put an advertisement in the newspaper for the same purpose, but all in vain - reduced to despair, on finding myself thus forlorn in a strange country, I recollected a General 
               <persName id="t18310908-4-person138">Bentinck</persName>
            , who was well known to a family of the name of Eckhardt, with whom I had been very intimate during my stay at Cologne; I addressed him under the signature of my friend's name, Cristine Eckhardt, begging his assistance in finding Mrs. Kently; he came to see me, and showed me so much kindness that I felt ashamed at having given him an assumed name - he procured me a lodging with Miss Carey, No. 20, Connaught-terrace, till I should be able to find Mrs. Kently, and to recover my box; I received my box from Rotterdam, and at the same time a letter from Mrs. Kently in which she told me that she had deceived me, and many other things which I cannot now repeat - Miss Carey persuaded me to remain with her and try to get another place; I accordingly answered several advertisements (but in my own name), and at length had the good fortune to be engaged by Mrs. Wood, of Southampton, who expressed her entire satisfaction with my testimonials as to character and deportment, confirmed as they were by the representations of Mr. Herstatt, at Cologne; many times I felt inclined to make it known to Miss Carey that I was not Miss Eckhardt, whose name I had been induced by my distress to assume, but I was ashamed to do it - from the first day I discovered that Miss Carey was always drunk, and often in such a state as not to know what she did; on the Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080008"></xptr>before I set out for Southampton, I changed with others a 10l. Bank note for her, and these she says are the notes which were burnt - in the evening she was very much intoxicated, and on going to a cupboard with a candle she set fire to it; after it was extinguished, she said that she had put some Bank notes into the cupboard and that they were all burnt; the day before I left she showed me after dinner twelve shifts and two dresses, asking me to buy them of her, which I consented to do, and paid her nine guineas, and nine guineas for my lodging - in the evening, being very drunk, in going up stairs with me to bed, she asked me if I had any money left with which to buy some more things; I said Yes, and she brought me a great quantity of things, telling me that I might have them all for thirty guineas; I told her I could not give so much, but that I would give her eighteen guineas, which she at length agreed to take, (saying that she was in want of money,) and helped me to put the things into my box; now she says that I stole all these things - she had several pictures, which I asked her to lend me to copy them, but she refused, and when I left I took them with me; she took at the office a black lace veil from my bonnet, (which I had worn during my stay in her house,) saying it was hers; she also told the Magistrate that I had given her three gilt shillings for three sovereigns, having seen in my box some gold dust which I used to put on my writing, and some gold leaf, which I had brought from Amsterdam for the purpose of ornamenting some trifles; Madam Van Doesberg, at Amsterdam, knows all this, and also that I was possessed of 80l., 50l. in gold, and 30l. in Bank notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, at 22, Portland Street—about 11 on Thursday, 22nd June, the prisoner came to my house, asked for a glass of ale and gave me a sovereign—I gave him change with half a sovereign, and the rest in silver and copper—he put his hands down to take it up—my attention was called off to a person on my left hand asking for a glass of ale in a hurried manner, and when I turned back the prisoner said to me, "I asked you for all silver, "and he passed a bad half sovereign towards me, not the one I gave him—I said, "You did nothing of the kind"—I saw it was bad, it was a very bad imitation—I marked it, rang for my servant, and told him to take care of the prisoner till I got a constable—I gave him into custody—I am quite positive this is not the half sovereign that I gave to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This man was not employed by Mr. Cadell? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any porters employed in your shop? - Many: I went and examined the window; I found it covered with boards, which were quite loose; they could be removed very easily; there were two iron bars across the window; there was room for the prisoner to enter; I think some of the parcels must have been drawn through, as I discovered a rusty nail with a bit of brown paper on it.</p>

               <p>I live in Haughton-street, Clare-market; I keep a pork-shop, and buy a great quantity of waste paper; I have bought a great deal of the prisoner; I gave him twopence-halfpenny per pound; I have one parcel here. (Produced.) I bought them the night before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Davis. I think this parcel is the property of Mr. Cadell; I have no doubt of it myself; they were tied up precisely as they are now; they were not sold, on account of being stained.</p>

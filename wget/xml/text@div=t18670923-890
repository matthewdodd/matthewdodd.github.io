I am a fireman, and live at No. 9, Orange Street, Red Lion Square—the prisoner lodged with me in my room—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 10th I got home about half-past seven, the prisoner was there—I told him I felt rather tired, and he persuaded me to go to bed, which I <hi rend="italic">did</hi>—he had told me he was going to Brighton to receive some orders—about half-past nine I turned over in bed and saw the prisoner going out of the door—I said, "It is very near time you went to Brighton, the day will be gone before you get there"—he said, "Yes, I will; good morning," and went out—I thought there was something strange about him, and directly he bad gone I went to my box and missed my bank-book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—the last time I saw it safe was when I made the last deposit, on the 30th July—I immediately went to the London Bridge station and saw the prisoner—I said, "I want you to come back with me to the lodgings"—he said, "All right"—we had got a little distance, and he said, "What is up?"—I said, "You know very well what is the matter, you need not ask such a question as that"—he said, "Oh, do not make a noise; let as go into a public-house and talk about it"—I said, "No, I do not want to go into any public-house at all; we will go back to the lodgings and talk about it"—he said, "My portmanteau is at the station, I will go and get that"—I accused him of stealing the bank-book, and said 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was too much for me to lose—18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what I had deposited—he said, "You mean to accuse me of it?"—I said, "Yes, certainly I do"—he opened his portmanteau and took from it a purse, and from the-purse he took some money and gave me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said that was all the money he had, but he would pledge all things he had, as it was time for him to be in Brighton doing hid master's business, aud that if I liked to go to the bank with him he would give me a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a security upon his honour—I have ascertained that the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been withdrawn—he went back with me to Orange Street, and I gave him in charge—when he opened his portmantean I saw a scarf inside that belonged to me—I never gave any one authority to take my bank-book—this toothpick, towel, and bottle are my property—previous to the 10th September I never knew or saw Mrs. Elizabeth Moore, of 52, Galway Street—I never gave anybody authority to use my name to be addressed there.</p>

On the morning of the 10th Sep<lb></lb>tember I was called to No. 9, Orange Street, Red Lion Square—the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing a bank-book and a scarf—the prisoner said the prosecutor at the station told him if he could not prove one charge he would not press the other, meaning the scarf—I took the prisoner into custody—he gave me a ticket and said, "That is the ticket of a portmanteau that I have got at the London Bridge Station"—I went to the station and got the portmanteau, and I found in it this shirt, towel toothpick, and bottle, all of which the prosecutor identified.</p>

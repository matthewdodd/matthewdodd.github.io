                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Worship-street police-court. On 20th Jan., Peters made a statement—there were examinations on the 20th, 25th, and 27th—they are not returned in the form they are taken—I took down accurately what Peters said on his first examination on 20th Jan.—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">decided that the witness could not read the statement to contradict the depositions, unless the depositions were put in, which was accordingly done.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Witness continued</hi>—Peters commenced by saying, "On the night of 26th Dec., at <hi rend="italic">half-past ten o'clock</hi> I was on my way home, the prisoner was with me," &amp;c.—he has never varied the state<lb></lb>ment that the prisoner is the person—Aburrow was examined on 25th—he says, "I am brother-in-law to complainant, &amp;c.; it was not quite <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> when we left the Three Colts."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi>) On 27th Dec., about three o'clock in the afternoon, Peters came to the Bow station—I introduced him to the superintendent—he had been drinking excessively—I do not think it was excitement—he told the superintendent he had been robbed of between seventeen and eighteen sovereigns, and a gold watch, chain, and seals, in the neighbourhood of Twigg Folly, between nine and ten the night before, and that his name was Peters, and he kept the Star and Garter, Humberstone-street, Commercial-road, for another person, and that accounted for the quan<lb></lb>tity of money in his possession—he afterwards said he did not think it was so much, that it might have been as many shillings, and that it was only an old family silver watch—his brother-in-law said he did not think he had so much money—the Three Colts is, I should say, three good miles from Mrs. Davis's—Green-street runs in a direct line from the bridge.</p>

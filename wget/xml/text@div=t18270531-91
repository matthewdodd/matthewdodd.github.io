            . I am apprentice to a law-stationer, in Chancery-lane. On the 31st of May, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Inner Temple-lane, and saw two men dressed in dark clothes, trying to put a key into the lock of this shop-door; I watched them under an archway for about five minutes - they continued at the door; then Sangster came up and stood for about five minutes before the one who was at the door; I called the watchman - we stood under the archway - I then went up Hare-court, came up and saw four at the door; Knight was the fourth; I went and told Mr. Slann; I believe the key was put into the door before I saw either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where were you going? A. Home to Lambeth; I spoke to nobody in Temple-lane; the shop is at the corner of Churchyard-court.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Inner Temple-lane - Marshall called my attention to this shop; I went up and saw four men standing there, three of them stood conversing with Knight, who was at the door; I went and stood some time looking in at the next shop; I saw they were twigging me, and went under the archway; I saw Sangster turn round Churchyard-court; he came round and turned his back to the door - I went over - Mr. Hemlock came out of the Seal Office, and said (quite loud enough for them to hear) that he had been watching them some time- they ran away - I found a key in the door - I ran after them, and called Stop thief! Knight dropped two bags, a dark-lantern, and two picklock keys, which I picked up - he pulled them out of my hands, but I got them again, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you hear Sangster ask somebody for some place in the Temple? A. No; I had not got my watchman's coat on - I took Sangster, and saw nothing fall from him.</p>

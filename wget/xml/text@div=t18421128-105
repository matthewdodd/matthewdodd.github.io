                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Wales was in my service about nine months. On the 25th of Oct., I went to a pen-case on a wardrobe in one of the bed-rooms—in consequence of that, I missed a double-barrelled gun, made by Man ton, and the apparatus of the case—I had not seen it for eight months—it was in a mahogany-case, inclosed in a leather-case—the ease was there—I asked Wales if he knew anything about it—he said he did not, he did not know I had such an article—he had an opportunity of going into my bed-room—I gave him into custody on another charge—on the 3rd of Nov. I saw Hannon at the station—he was cautioned by the inspector, and told he was charged with stealing a gun—no threat or promise was held out to him—he then stated that he and Howe brought the gun from my house, went out shooting with it, and broke the stock, and then sold it to Mr. Jack<lb></lb>son, in Wigmore-street, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Mr. Jackson, and he had the stock and barrel—this is it—I am the leaseholder of my house, and live in Devon<lb></lb>shire-street, Portland-place—the gun is worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as an article of sale—I valued it at twenty-five guineas, and I would not have sold it for that.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 31st of August last, I placed myself in a situation where I could see the prisoner, knowing that he would be sent into a room to look out goods for an order. When he had looked out the goods he took six wineglasses, and concealed them in his breeches and his waistcoat, he was sent out with the goods that he was desired to look out, into Holborn; after he had left my premises and gone into Shoe-lane I went out and desired him to return, which he did without any hesitation. In the mean time I had sent for a constable, and on the prisoner's return I accused him of having property of mine about his person; they were taken from him in the presence of one of my shopmen.</p>

               <p>beer—I stood against the table in the tap-room, and not two minutes after I saw the convict Benson—he must have been there when I went in, because, as I turned round, I was struck instantly—I did not speak to him, but as I turned to put my pot on the table I was struck on the lower part of my mouth with a heavy instrument, and knocked insensible; a hand would not do it—when I was conscious again I was being brought out of the police-station—my upper lip was torn, and I had a hole through here, and I could not use my teeth for five days after—I did not pull out any money before I was struck, nor was there any scramble for money—I did not strike anyone's arm to my knowledge—I did not knock any money out of Benson's hand—I did not knock him down, nor did we punch one another—after I received the blow from him I was insensible, and did not know where I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture-dealer, of 2, Miles Street, Trafalgar Road, Greenwich—on Saturday, 21st October, I was at the White Swan, Charlton, acting as waiter for a relation of mine, during the fair—this was the last day of the fair—Thornton, whom I knew by sight, came in a little before 9 o'clock, it might be ten minutes before the half-hour—I saw him standing against the table in the tap-room, with a pint or a half-pint of beer—Benson, a man with a wooden arm, and a hook screwed in, was there, with two or three others—he was pushed by his friends inside the door—I after-wards heard a scuffle, and found that Benson had got hold of Thornton, and forced his head upon the grate, and deliberately ran his hook into his mouth—he released him from holding him down, and Thornton turned round in a stooping position, with the hook in his mouth, halloaing "Murder!" "Take it out!"—I ran to the bar, and told Mr. Turner, who sent me for a policeman—I was absent two or three minutes, and when I came back I found Benson in custody, and Thornton up the yard, sitting on a form, bleeding—I know Henry Tull as a witness in the case—I cannot say whether he was in the room, because I was not there at the time it was done—there was no pushing the elbows or scrambling for money while I was there—Thornton struck no blow in my presence, and I did not hear any noise; in fact, it was quietly done altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They did not both come down on the grate—Thornton's head was down on the grate, and the hook was run into his mouth—it was deliberately done—Benson drew his arm back in this way, the same as I should do if I was going to punch anyone.</p>

I am a labourer, of Woolwich—on the night of 21st October I was in the White Swan tap, and saw Benson there, and two or three men in his company—he was not sober—Thornton was sober enough—he was leaning against the table, with a half-pint of beer—he was there when I went in—they were doing nothing then, they were standing oppo<lb></lb>site one another—I went out at the back, came in again, and saw Benson <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his arm, and give Thornton a <hi rend="italic">swipe</hi> across the face with his wooden arm, and then he got him down on the fire-place, and hooked him, forced</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Benson had him close down when he drove the hook into his mouth—the man was then raised up, and a lot got round him—he was not quite down when the prisoner got his hook in his mouth—he did not fall quite down—I was examined at Benson's trial, and said that he drove the hook into Thornton's mouth before he fell, and dragged him by it with the hook in his lip—he dragged him to the fire-place—he did not knock him down with the back of his head on the fire-place—he did not close with him, but the man sang out "Murder!" and "Police!" and the police came and took them both away.</p>

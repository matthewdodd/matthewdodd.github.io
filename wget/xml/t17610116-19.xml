I sent up to her at Hampstead. She was brought to me. I charged her with taking them. She confessed she had taken them, and that she had carried them to her aunt's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her aunt's name?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. Her name is Elizabeth Street</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her your consent for carrying them there?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her aunt?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. She is a gardener's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give an account how she took them?</p>
               <p>M. Hill he said she took them while I was out. I had a search warrant, and went to her aunt's house, and the aunt gave them to me, as soon as came into the house</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say before the justice of the peace?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I was not with her there. [The goods produced, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Street. Mary Adams brought these things to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you her aunt?</p>
               <p>E. Street. I am. I delivered them to Mrs. Hill, when she came and demanded them. I did not see what they were when she brought them in.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I believe she never did such a thing before.</p>
               <p>E. Street. I will take care of her, and take her into my house if the court will please to shew her favour.</p>

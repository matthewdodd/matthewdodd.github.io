            . I met the prosecutor; he was followed by four men - I looked round, and saw one of them pick his pocket; the book fell on the ground, and the prisoner picked it up - I pointed him out to Captain Wallace, who seized him, and it fell from his breast - he said, he picked it up, and would be glad to restore it; but before that, he had been making off with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of the other three - A. They escaped - all four were together at the time of the transaction.</p>

               <p>"Sir, take it; I picked tup." I did not know the gentleman was robbed of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to John Drewett and Thomas Fowler, bankers in Princes-street, Mansion House. On the 24th of May the prisoner pre<lb></lb>sented this cheque at our counter, signed "Emanuel Cooper," who keeps an account with us, and trades under the firm of "E. Cooper and Co.;" but he is the only person, I believe—I asked the prisoner who he brought it from—said, "From Mr. Oldham, Mr. Cooper's clerk"—I immediately took him to the partners, and told them it was an attempt at forgery—I knew immediately it had not any resemblance to the usual signature of the firm we sent for Mr. Cooper, who came over, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade under the firm of "Emanuel Copper and Co.," this not my signature—I never authorised any body to sign &amp; cheque for me—it is not at all like my hand-writing—the prisoner was in my service as carman at the time—it was his duty to sweep the counting-house out in the morning—sometimes the cheque-book is about, and sometimes looked up—on the 23rd of May I was sent for to Drewett's, in consequence of which I examined my cheque-book, and found this cheque fitted to the end of the cheque-book, where two have been taken out without my knowledge—I found four torn out at the end, two of which I was aware of and two I was not, and it tallies with one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons are there in your employ?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty or fifty—about six or eight have access to the counting-house—the prisoner's business would only call him into the counting-house on a morning—he had nothing to do with the books—when I was sent for so Drewett's I asked him to write his name—he did so—I am of opinion the cheque is not his handwriting—I had never seen him write before—it not appear to be the same writing as his.</p>

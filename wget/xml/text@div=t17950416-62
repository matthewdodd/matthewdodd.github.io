On Monday the 6th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came into our shop and asked to look at some cambrick; it was shewn to her by a young woman in the shop; she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that yourself? - Yes. I then perceived her, directly after that, looking at some printed cottons; I took particular notice of her turning and shifting herself round, and working about her pockets, and thought she had some intention of stealing, if she had not stole some thing; we were exceeding busy at the time; after she had purchased some cotton, she asked me if I had got any work for her? I said, if she would walk up into the warehouse I would talk to her about the work. Instead of taking her into the warehouse I took her into the dining room, and there searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find on her? - Printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out of her pocket? - No, I laid my hand on her, and charged her with it; and she turned herself round and threw herself, with some degree of violence into the chair, and the cotton fell from under her petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it fall from her petticoats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a paper as it is now? - No, only the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be your cotton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any private shop mark upon it? - Yes, my own marking; it is Mr. Clarke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one of the cottons that was shewn her, or only what lay on the counter? - The young lady will speak to that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you serve her at all? - Yes, I did. When she first came into the shop she asked to look at some cambrick, which I shewed her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you shew her besides? - Printed callico; among the rest I shewed her this print; she bought a small quantity of cambrick; she gave me a shilling and said she would call for it the next morning; she also bought some cotton for the child; she was to call for the things the next morning. I know nothing more than Mr. Boyd took her up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is the same that you shewed her? - Yes, I am confident it is the pattern, and has the private mark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been several times to the shop to ask for work, and gave three different places to go for my character, in Holborn, and likewise in Westminster; and they told me they would send me work if in case any came in, and they told me to call every other day; I called then as I wanted a bit of cambrick to frill a single man's shirt, that lodged in the house; I asked the young lady if there was any work? she told me there was something, and told me to call the next day; and I told them I would take it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160138"></xptr>goods;, which would be as well as money; and that was the gown piece that I bought I was to have them things, and pay it at so much a week, and I was to work it out.</p>
               <p>Court to Barter. You gave me an account that she purchased some cambrick and cotton for a child's frock, are you sure that she did not purchase this piece? - She did not purchase this; it was a different pattern she bought; I told her we had no work.</p>

               <p>Q. Then that shilling was merely left with you that she might have the goods afterwards? - Just so.</p>

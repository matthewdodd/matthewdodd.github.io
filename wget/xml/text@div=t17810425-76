On the 21st of February, being Fast-day, I went out in company with a gentleman, in the morning, about half after nine: I left my wife and sister at home: I had previously agreed to meet them at my father-in-law's, in Jermyn-street. I met them there; and we returned home at about half an hour after 10 o'clock at night. We found the door on the single lock. I had a candle from Mr. Dell's, my next door neighbour. I went into the house, and missed the several articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Had the house any appearance of having been broke open? - None; only the door being on the single lock. On the Saturday following I was informed, that there was an advertisement in the paper which answered to my things. By the direction of that advertisement, I went to Mr. Moseley's, at No. 100, in Bunhill-row: there I found the coat and waistcoat and shirt, and a pair of sheets; they were marked with this mark (producing it); I made it myself: there was likewise there my wife's Marseilles petticoat, and a gown and coat.</p>

On February the 21st, between eight and nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Old-street-road, with a bundle upon his head: he was standing against the wall: from his behaviour I suspected he had got smuggled goods. He went into a yard, as if he was going into a house: he put the bundle under his arm. I told him I was an officer belonging to the excise, and insisted upon seeing what he had got. He asked me what I meant to search for: I told him run goods. He said if I searched for that, I might search; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250090"></xptr> he had none. I untied the corner of the bundle, and put my hand in, and found it was linen. He went into a house, and up stairs; I followed him, secured him, and delivered him and the bundle into the custody of the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter: I live at No. 44, Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On the Fast-day, about 8 o'clock, in Old-street, I saw a man give the prisoner the bundle, and gave him a shilling to carry it just by Moorfields, to James-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see him give him a shilling? - I heard the bargain as I was going by.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I might have seen him before, where he has been sawing; I never was acquainted with him before: I often employ sawyers myself. I knew him by sight these twelvemonths.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you see him? - Just by Mr. Croker's brew-house.</p>
               <p>Did you know the man that gave him this bundle? - No; I never saw the man to my knowledge in my life. I was making water when I overheard them.</p>
               <p>Were they standing together, or coming along? - They were coming along talking together: the other man had the bundle under his arm, and gave it to the prisoner. I heard him say, I will give you a shilling to carry it to James-street, by Moorfields. They both went away together.</p>
               <p>Did you walk the same way with them? - No, I did not, only just to the turnpike; then he crossed down Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>To Whitefield. It was, I think, between eight and nine when you saw the prisoner? - Nearer nine than eight.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Old-street-road? - About thirty yards from the turnpike, which is fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Croker's brew-house. He told me he took it up in Golden-lane: his words were, as near as I can recollect, a man gave him a shilling in Golden-lane, to carry it to Bayfield's: that was when I had him in the garret.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him, he was standing still? - Yes, against the wall, making water, I believe; but I cannot say.</p>

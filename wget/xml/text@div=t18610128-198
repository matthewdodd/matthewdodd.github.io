I am stationed at West Ham—on the night of 26th December from information I received I went with policeman Collins to a house in North Woolwich-road, West Ham—Collins knocked, and we waited two hours before we were admitted—the door was then opened by a female, with her son as I am informed, and on entering we found the prisoner lying on a bed in the back room, and Mrs. Ward lying on a bed in the front room—the prisoner appeared drunk; he staggered about very much—I then went down to his shed in the back yard and found these eleven pewter pots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a half-bushel basket—here are names on all of them, and some are quite new—I looked in the back room and found this quart pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under some rags, and this pint pot with Richardson's name on it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the shop—I also found a quantity of metal which has since been given up to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live with Hotham and Turner, as shopman. On the 16th of September, the prisoner came to our shop for some trifling article; I saw him, when he was going out, take the tea from off a pile of chests; the tea is in a bag; there were several parcels; I threw down the scales, and ran out immediately; he ran a few yards, and dropped the tea; I followed, and kicked his heels up; he got up again, and ran three parts of the way up Clements-lane; and he was taken and brought back; I never lost sight of him after I went out of the shop: (produces the tea): I can swear to the tea; it is Mr. Hotham's writing on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was four hundred yards off when he took me; there was a crowd, and he came up and took me.</p>

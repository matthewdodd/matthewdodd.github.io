On the 17th of December, rather before six o'clock in the evening - (it was quite dark; the lamps had been lit a long while;) in consequence of suspicion that an attempt would be made on my house, I was on the watch, having seen some men lurking about my house the day before, in the day time; I am not able to say who the persons were. I was on the watch in the parlour, just by the side of the parlour door, which concealed me from view; I am quite sure the street door was shut and latched, in the usual way; no one could have entered from the outside without a key: I heard a trifling noise at the door- it was repeated, and I was satisfied the lock was being picked; the noise was as if a key had been put into the lock - after an interval of two minutes, I distinctly heard the instrument taken out of the lock - I was about eight feet from the door; in about two minutes the same noise was repeated again - there was a cessation for a moment or two, as I could hear a person going by; and the very instant that person had passed, a person on the step of my door began to be moving again, with his heels and feet on the step, shuffling about; the second attempt did not succeed, and the key was taken out again: it commenced again in a few minutes - something was put into the lock, and the door was opened about an inch, as I could see the light from the street; the door was then again pulled back, close, but not relatched: they then went away for about three minutes - I heard footsteps go away, but could not say whether it was more than one person: in two or three minutes I saw two men come into the house - I allowed the prisoner, who was the foremost, to come within two feet of me - I then gave him a violent blow on the head, and instantly laid hold of him; I ran him back, against the other man, and shoved that man out, still holding the prisoner: I shut the door, keeping him inside- I beat him; he did not strike me, but I used violence to him, for, being in the dark, I did not know what subject I had before me: I hallooed out, "I have got him," and requested them to go backwards, to alarm the neighbourhood; the maid-servant came up with a light, and when I found it was a man I could manage, I ceased to use more violence. I kept him there till I thought an officer was outside to receive him. He said, "For God's sake, let me go," and desired me not to beat him; I forgot to state that directly the door was shut a man wanted to come in to assist me, but I said he should not come in: we opened the door, took him out, and, not seeing an officer, I pinned him up against the wall, and then removed him to a public-house; a crow-bar was kicked out of my house in the scuffle: there was a phosphorus-box and matches, and a picklock-key, which opens the door, picked up, close at the door; I found a match inside the passage of the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100032"></xptr>and compared it with the matches in the phosphorus-box- it appeared to be one of that description: it is the same sort of box as is sold at chemist's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me, when we got into the public-house, what I did there; I told him I looked at the door, and could find no name, no knocker, nor bell, and I was inquiring after Mr. Earl, my master; there was nothing but a brass knob to the door.</p>
               <p>MR. CUFF. There is a knocker to my door. I was on the alert, and if there had been a knock, I must certainly have heard it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner. This phosphorus-box has been in my possession ever since. I searched the prisoner, and found a knife and 8s. 6d. on him; this crow-bar, dark-lantern, and key, were brought to me at the door; I tried the key to the prosecutor's door, and it opens it; there appears to have been one match taken out of the bundle.</p>
               <p>MR. CUFF. These are the things that were found. I found only one match in the passage.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the door be opened without a key? A. It could not - it is a common lock, and requires the street door key to open it without.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He says he heard a noise at the door - that it was unlocked, and shoved open about an inch: as it was dark in the passage, I do not see how he could see it was shoved open about an inch. I went there to inquire after my master. If I had had those implements would they not have been found in the house? and if I had thrown them away, should I not have been seen? they were not brought forward for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>One witness, who had known the prisoner three months, gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a fruit-salesman. On the 28th of September Mr. Skinner told me he had lost a marn of apples - I went and saw the prisoner in Henrietta-street with it; he set it down, and said he would go and pay for it - I said it was too late; I collared him; the officer came up - he got from my hold and struck me, but he was taken - I had known the marn before; it had the bottom nearly out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he ask you to take them back to the market, and he would show you the person he had them from? A. He said he would take them back, and pay for them - no other person was within hearing, to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am keeper of the market. I came up, and found Mr. Smith had hold of the prisoner; I took his arm loosely, to go to the watch-house - he snatched it from me, struck Mr. Smith, and ran about twenty yards, but was taken; he said in the watch-house that he bought the apples of a tall man; the man was brought there - he did not go to the market, nor ask to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you know the man? A. He is a remarkable tall man; there is not one so tall as he is - the prisoner had offered money for the apples, and given 8s. 6d., but the man would not take it, and then he said he took them, but he did not know what induced him to take them, without the devil did, and he was not happy till he took them.</p>

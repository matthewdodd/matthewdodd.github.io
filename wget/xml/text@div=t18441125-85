                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Parsons. I am shopwoman to Mr. James Peet, a straw<lb></lb>hat manufacturer, who lives at Hammersmith—about eleven o'clock, on the 26th of Sept., the prisoner Miller called and ordered some bonnets to be sent to No. 2, Peter's Cottages—there was to be a choice for his lady and her child—I forgot to send them, and the next morning, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner Dawers called and said a gentleman had ordered some bonnets—I said, Yes, and 1 had for<lb></lb>gotten to send them—(she brought me a card in the name of Miller, but she now calls herself Dawers)—she said she would like to select the bon<lb></lb>nets that she wished sent, and pointed to one in the window that she would like for herself—I brought it to her, and she ordered me to send that and some others for some young ladies about twenty-six years of age—she selected thirteen, and ordered me to send them and a few others to No. 2, Peter's Cottages—I told her I would send them immediately—she said I need not send them for one hour, she should not return before—I then packed them up and sent them by a boy, and a young person to wait on her—the young person returned, and said the lady was not at home, and she was to call again at seven o'clock—at seven, I sent again, and the servant refused to give them up, and said the ladies could not decide about them till the next morning—I got no bonnets back, nor any money—I sent seventeen bonnets for examination and selection—this is one of the bonnets, the one Dawers pointed out, and said she should like for herself—there was no price put on these bonnets—she did not ask the price—I have never been able to get the other sixteen.</p>

             came into my house on the 2d of October, between eight and nine at night, along with two fiddles; Murray pretended to be very drunk; they came with the fiddle playing down the court where I live. They danced in the house, and rapped all their hands on the table together to make a noise; they called for liquor to the amount of two shillings and three pence as fast as I could serve them. Rose Keefe came in a little after the music began, she sat down a little while, then she went out, she came back again, and then she went out a second time, then she gave a loud cough at the door, and they all went away except one young man, he staid behind and called for a pot of beer, I don't believe he knew any thing of their design. Murray seemed very sober, I went up stairs and found my bed-chamber door up one pair of stairs broke open, and my bureau which was in that room broke open; I missed upwards of twelve pounds, there were five drawers missing out of the bureau, I found one of the drawers afterwards, as I was shutting my window at the back of my house; there was I believe upwards of two pounds worth of good halfpence, and they took two pounds of bad halfpence; I lost a table-spoon and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.) I had been up stairs about five o'clock, when I changed the six and nine-pence for a customer. Keefe lodges in my house, upon the same floor as my room that was broke open; Keefe went about, pretending to shew us where the people lived, and she led us wrong; I found nothing again but one guinea and one halfpenny, which I can swear to; they were found in one Mrs. Smith's pocket, who is mother-in-law to Delaney.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. So the man that came in drunk, went away sober?</p>
               <p>Ferquharson. Yes; he went away sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What, he got sober by drinking more liquor?</p>
               <p>Ferquharson. I believe he only shammed drunk when he came in, for he soon appeared to be sober.</p>

               <p>Richard Delaney. Freel's wife and Keefe came to my lodgings about a week before the fact was committed, and said they had a secret to impart to me; that Ferquharson had two or three hundred pounds, and they intended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230010"></xptr> to rob him, for if they could get it, it would be the making of them; he said Mrs. Keefe lived on the same floor opposite Ferquharson's room; they said they intended to do it that night, we were disappointed, and so we fixed on the Wednesday following. Freel's wife came up to my room about five in the afternoon, and told me they would get a fiddle in the house, and said that while they were dancing below, the door might be broke open above. I went to the place where her husband lodged, I met with

I knew nothing at that time of what was doing above stairs. I went to my room: there was my husband, Freel and his wife, and Fotterel; they shuffled about; I was frightened, I suspected there was something wrong among them; I asked my husband what he was going there for with his Irish and, I said I supposed he was going to have us all hanged; my husband upon that struck me several times, and I was obliged to go down stairs. Murray did not go up stairs, he was standing at the door; they came down after they had been up stairs some time; we walked all away together, and we walked about all night.</p>

I had a letter for Freel's wife, she asked me to go and drink with her at Ferquharson's; I was in liquor; I wanted Ferquharson to let me have a lodging, but he could not; Freel promised to get me a lodging; she took me to her house, the door being shut, she took me from thence to Delaney's, we could get no lodging there, so we walked about the greatest part of the night; at last I got to a house somewhere in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230011"></xptr> an alley, where I got to bed for two hours; I went away in the morning, and saw no more of them.</p>

               <p>Murray came to my house with a letter; I asked him to go and drink with me; we met Mr. Delaney; I intended to get a lodging for him; when I got home to my lodgings, the door was locked; I went from thence to Delaney's lodgings, I could not get a lodging there, so we walked about the street.</p>

               <p>"one hundred pound draft on Marsh and Co.' There were two other drafts of Marsh and Co. one was eighty-five pounds three shillings, and the other was two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was but one entry of one hundred pound to Marsh and Co. - A. There was not, I gave it to Bannister, our out-door clerk, for the purpose of collecting it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Bolland. You are a collecting clerk there, do you recollect calling over with Mr. Skelton on the 26th of July any draft which he charged to your account. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it to be delivered to you. - A. On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. They consisted of bills for payment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any draft drawn by Wade, Stables, and Wilson. - A. I did not look so particularly at that, because we merely called them over according to the sum; I called over the draft and Mr. Skelton read the book, the draft tallied with the book.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday evening what did you do with these bills so charged to you. - A. I sorted them for the walk on Monday, bound them up with a bit of paper, and pinned them and put them in the drawer used for that purpose; on Monday morning the paper was round it, and coming from my round I found I could not answer this one hundred pounds; when I came home I found I was one hundred pounds deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. State to the court what made you take these steps that you took with regard to the prisoner at the bar. - A. From the extraordinary manner in which he went on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Tell us facts. - A. He had two new suits of clothes, and the last evening that he was housekeeper he could not eat the supper, he ordered a fowl and some oyster sauce, at his own expence, and very lately he has been continually going to the Circus, and from thence to Vauxhall, with some girls of the town; in consequence of that we came to a determination to open a closet which belonged to him, the prisoner kept the key of it; it was on Sunday the 10th of August we opened it, and found therein three five pound bank notes, Mr. Aldridge and Mr. Willats were with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found you were a hundred pounds deficient did you tell Mr. Parry of it. - A. No, the next day Mr. Hallifax told me I was to make it good or my securities.</p>
               <p>Court. You had no knowledge of the deficiency till you came home to render the account at one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170011"></xptr>o'clock. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you immediately tell your master. - A. I applied to some of the clerks; I went to Mr. Marsh to stop the payment at five o'clock; I returned at one, I found at four o'clock that it was drawn by Sanxton and Atkins, I then immediately went to stop payment.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the first time that you heard any thing of the loss of this hundred pound draft. - A. On Monday the 28th of July, the day it was lost, Mr. Bannister mentioned it when he came home from his walk.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you observed in the prisoner's conduct did that occasion any suspicion concerning him. - A. Yes, he used to go continually to the Circus and to Vauxhall with some girls of his acquaintance, and four nights in the course of a fortnight he slept out; he bought a gold seal, and had some new clothes come home.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of all these suspicions did you, Bannister, and Willats, determine upon any plan to find out whether he was concerned in taking this note. - A. Yes, upon Sunday morning the 10th of August, I, Bannister, and Willats, went to the closet used by the prisoner, it was locked, and the prisoner had the key, as far as I know; the prisoner had slept out that night, we forced the closet, and after searching it some time, I found three five pound notes in the bottom drawer on the left hand side of this closet; the notes have been in the care of Mr. Parry, I gave them to Mr. Parry that morning they were found, we put our signatures on them when we found them. (The notes shewn to the witness.)</p>

               <p>Q. Looking at these notes with your signature upon them, have you any doubt that these are the notes you found in the prisoner's closet. - A. No doubt, we all three went together to the closet, and all assisted in breaking it open.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Bannister) Look at these notes, and tell me whether there are any marks on them you know, and whether these are the notes you found. - A. These are the notes.</p>

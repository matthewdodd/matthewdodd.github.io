               <p>I have done business for the Mint upwards of twenty years; this is what we call cecil, it is flatted down to the size, and cut into round blanks, and afterwards filed round the edges, and scoured with paper, cork and several things that are here, and put into aqua fortis, which produces the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Are those the instruments used for counterfeiting coin? - Yes, this is aqua fortis, when it is put into aqua fortis and water, which leaves it black, it is rubbed with sand, or salt, and then it is white, and it is afterwards rubbed with something to make it black; every thing here is compleat: (looks at the sixpence, in the nutmeg grater) the shillings were fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. Are they like the Tower shillings? - The Tower shillings, when they come out of the Tower, are all milled, these are made to imitate old shillings.</p>

I had been to her box before, but did not look over the articles. I told her I was sure she had nothing of mine, as I had always found her very honest; on the Sunday afternoon I searched her box, with a constable; he brought the keys, and opened the box; I examined, and found in a pillow-case, the two articles in the indictment; I had never delivered that to her; I had given her warning some time before, and her time was nearly expired; it was a piece of a shirt that is of no value, but has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hovell. Q. When did you first communicate your suspicions to her? - A. I stated it to her on the Friday that I was robbed; but I did not suspect her, I had a high opinion of her honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. She opened the box very readily? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was opened, and you might have seen the contents? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the search was made? - A. Yes; she sent to have her things; she was then in prison; I thought it then a justice due to myself to examine particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.What might you have said to her, in order to induce a confession? - A. The confession had nothing to do with these articles.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On Friday, the 22d of November, I apprehended the prisoner in the parish of Shepperton; I took her before a Magistrate on Friday; the prisoner gave me the keys of her box on the Sunday; I went to Mr. Fairfield's house; Mrs. Fairfield found a part of a shirt, and part of a sheet; (produces part of a sheet.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fairfield. They have my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Poole. Q.It is a part of a shirt, and part of a sheet? - A. The remaining part was in her box, made into things for her own purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. The other parts you have not brought here? - A. No; they were made up into other things, and there were reasons why I thought it was not proper to bring them. I am sure they formed the remainder of the sheet.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

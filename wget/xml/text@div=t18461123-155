On the 4th of Nov, the prisoner was given into my charge—Mrs. Topley handed me a bottle of wine—the prisoner was sober—on the road to the station she asked me what she had done—I said she had broken Mr. Tapley's window and stolen a bottle of wine—she said she was not aware of it, and she could not have done it—I have seen her loitering about there, and about ten minutes before this she took some oysters out of a tub and put them in her lap—a person went up and asked her for the oysters—she swore she had not touched them, at the same time dropping them out of her lap—some people think her not of sound mind—I think she does it to escape being given in charge—she robs everybody about there—she does it openly, at broad day-light, before anybody—I believe she drinks—she tells me her mind is perfectly sound, only when she gets drunk.</p>

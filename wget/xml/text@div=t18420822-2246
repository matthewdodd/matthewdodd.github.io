               <p>of July I met Brown in the Broadway, just by the pump—he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, what do you think I have done?"—I said, "I don't know, have you left?"—he said, "No," and pulled out the spoon—we both went down towards his mother's—he said, "Wait there till I come out"—he just ran in doors and left his bundle, and came out again—he said, "Come and take a walk up Strutton-ground"—he went to Gatterell, who is a jeweller in Castle-lane—we went up stairs, and Brown asked him if he would buy the spoon—he looked at it and said, "My wife is just gone out, I expect her in a few minutes, she will give you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he did not ask where he got it—he knew it had been taken wrongfully—he merely said, "I have got a wife and a large family, I hope it is all right"—I knew it was all wrong, and went and told Jane Parrott of it—I had not dealt with Gatterell be<lb></lb>fore, I did not know where to go—Brown had the money—Gatterell paid it—his children were lying in bed—his wife did not come in in time, and he put on his shoes and stockings, went out, and got the money—I know Gatterell's boy, which was the reason of our going there—it was about ten o'clock at night.</p>

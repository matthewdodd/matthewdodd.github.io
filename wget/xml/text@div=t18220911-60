I know that Joseph was very ill, and came in about six o'clock - he slept in a chair till eight o'clock, and then his mother persuaded him to go to bed, which he did, and I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, when I heard somebody knock at my door, as I thought; I opened it, and it was Joseph coming down stairs. I asked how his head was; he said it was very bad. I saw no more till the officers came, and took him - but I do not think Joseph was out of the house.</p>

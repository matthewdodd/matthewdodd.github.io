I saw the prisoner take a silver watch out of his pocket, in Diot-street, St. Gyles's, the prisoner said he would take care of it, we wanted to get a lodging for Harrison, Harrison is since dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it publickly?</p>
               <p>Dalton. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was stealing of it?</p>
               <p>Dalton. No, I thought he would take care of it for him. Three days after I asked him what he had done with it? he said he left it with the landlord, but would not say what his name was, or where he lived. I took him before a Justice, he then acknowledged he had pawned it at one Davidsons's at Queen-hyth; I went there with the prisoner and two constables, there it was produced.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said Harrison desired him to pawn the watch, which he did, and gave him 14 s. 6 d. of the money, and he was to give him the rest afterwards.</p>

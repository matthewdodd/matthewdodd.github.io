            . I am drayman to the prisoner Linton, who carries on business at Islington-green; he <rs id="t18280410-211-deflabel1133" type="occupation">sells small casks of table-beer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18280410-211-defend1193 t18280410-211-deflabel1133"></join> - I have seen Fagan there several times, selling casks. One day about the 30th of November, he brought a porter cask, marked "T. Harris, Hampstead-road;" he saw Linton, and said, "I have brought you one of your casks:" they walked out together, as if they were going to have a glass; Linton used to pay 2s. for them; I saw no money pass that day. About December Fagan came and sat a cask down - Linton came and asked if I had any money - I gave him 6s.; he gave Fagan 2s. for it - it was marked with Mr. Harris' name; Fagan came to me when I was washing casks in the yard, and said, "Is it not a shame, the old man does not allow more than 2s. for the casks - he sells them for 4s. 6d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived with Linton? A. Four or five months; I left last Saturday week: before that I lived with Mr. Mitchell, of Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged for dishonesty? A. I am not compelled to read my life to you; I was discharged once: I had been about three weeks with Linton when Fagan brought the first cask - I did not inform Mr. Harris of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100101"></xptr>I went-to Brewer's: Hall about February, and told Bassett, for I thought it high time it was stopped. I never bought a cask - I warned Linton of it several times. I have been desired several times to fetch casks for him, but would not do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been in the trade a long time? A. Yes; I believe the casks cost 8s. each, new - they are better for being new.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY declined proceeding any further in this case.</p>

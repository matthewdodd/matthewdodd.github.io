On the 28th of December, a few minutes before five o'clock in the evening, I received the articles stated in the indictment from Messrs. Judkins, Faber, and Barlow - the lamps were just being lit. I was at the corner of Skinner-street and Bishopsgate-streets, alone, and had all this linen wrapped in a damask table-cloth. All in a moment I saw three men; one of them came, knocked me down, and made an attempt to take my bundle. I thought I had better lose my life than that, and kept hold of it. In a moment one of the others came, dragged me some little way along, and got it from me - the third stood by my side, while I was screaming out as hard as I was able. He said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, mistress, can I assist you?" I saw a woman standing by my side, I thought she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120027"></xptr>assist me, but all three went off, and she went with them. I saw the man who had the bundle turn the corner with it.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were taking you bundle did you observe the features of any of them - A. The one who dragged me - I had my eye on him until he got it, which was sometime - it was that prisoner at the bar I am positively certain; I looked at him very attentively. It was very light, the snow was on the ground, and they were lighting the lamps. I could see him plainly. They all got away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. Next day, at the Mansion-house. I knew a person was taken, but I did not know which. When I saw him at the Mansion-house he was mixed with other people - I pointed him out, and have not the least doubt of his being the man who dragged me and got my bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he got your bundle had you much view of him - A. I saw him running in the middle of the road with it, and saw him turn down the top of Skinner-street. I have found none of my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After you made an alarm, did no one come to your assistance -

I heard somebody calling, as I thought, Stop thief! I went up, and saw the prosecutrix in the middle of the road, crying out that she was robbed. I told her I had seen three young chaps with a bundle, I saw no woman near them. I directed her to Lomer's lodgings, and went with her there - he was not at home; I did not go in with her. I gave information to Gregory. Next morning, I was sweeping my room, the prisoner came up, and knocked at the door, I opened it, and asked him what he wanted? He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Langley, what do you say I robbed a woman?" I told him to go about his business, or I would kick him down stairs. He said he would not go, but would deliver himself up to my husband, who is a watchman. I told my husband to take him then if he would not go, and he took him. I was present when the prosecutrix saw him at the Mansion-house, standing among twenty or thirty others - she said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you are the person who took my bundle!" I had not pointed him out, nor given her any intimation of his being the man.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bishopsgate. On the 28th of December, about half-past five o'clock, I was informed that Cox had been robbed. I saw her with Langley. Next morning, her husband brought the prisoner to me. I told him I must take him to the Mansion-house, he said he was very willing to go. I was present when Cox first saw him at the Mansion-house, mixed with other people. She spoke to him immediately, without his being pointed out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was she not in the Justice-room when you brought me in - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went home I was told I was charged with robbing a woman, and that Langley had given information of it; Next morning I went and asked her why she charged me with it? she used bad language, and said she knew nothing of me. I told her husband I would go to any office, and gave myself up to him. When I got to the Mansion-house I had my liberty in and out until the prosecutrix came. I am innocent. I saw Langley in the evening - she interfered with company I was with. She said I was a thief, and she would seek some way to take my life. It is through family affairs.</p>
               <p>JURY to LANGLEY. Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. He lived near me about two years; we were not acquainted. I never threatened him. He has told me he would murder me, and has knocked me down. I have told him if he did not let me alone I would serve him out some day. I have interfered with him when I have seen him do that which was not right.</p>
               <p>JURY to GREGORY. Q. Was the prisoner permitted to go in and out at the Mansion-house - A. I left him in charge of Dayer, the officer, and when I returned I found he had the liberty of the outer room. I think he might have got out if he had tried.</p>

            . I live in Sugar Loaf-court, Angel-alley; the prisoner has lived in the neighbourhood four years. I was coming by the George, public-house on Tuesday night, which was the night of the robbery - I heard Langey say

             was the man who robbed the woman. The prosecutrix said she did not know who it was, whether it was Lomer or not, but that three men had done it. I have heard Langley say she would hang or transport Lomer, if it was in her power. I live a good step from the prisoner now.</p>

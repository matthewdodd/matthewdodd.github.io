                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at Hounslow—on 3d October, about twenty minutes past eight, I was in a public-house with the prisoner and another man—I had not known them before—I left at a quarter past eight, and shortly afterwards they ran and overtook me, and told me they would show me a footpath across into South all—they then took me up by the side of a clamp of bricks, and the other man said, "You deliver your money"—I had a purse and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my left hand—the prisoner put his hand in my left pocket, but there was nothing there—I missed 4 1/2. from my right pocket—they also took my hat—I halloed—they lugged the skin off the back of my left hand, where the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was—they had my fingers nearly open, but another man came up and they ran away—i gave information to the police next morning, they took me to the prisoner's house, and I iden<lb></lb>titled him—I have not the slightest doubt he is one of the men.</p>

               <p>swear to you if you had different clothes on—you had black trousers on next morning when I went to your house—you put your right hand in my pocket, your left was in a sling—there were two females with me at the first public-house—I have not seen the other man since—he was rather thin, and a trifle taller than you, or he may be the same height—I could swear to him if I saw him—I was drinking with no one in particular—I never sat down in the house—it was a quarter to eight at night when we left the third house—I did not get intoxicated—the other man had my 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or it might be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., perhaps you got two or three coppers—I do not know which of you took the cap, but I rather think the other one had it—I stood up by the clamp, and after you had rifled all my pockets the other man said, "The b——has got it in his fist," and I held it tight, which I could not have done if I had been tipsy—you did not assault me, but you tried to get my money.</p>

On 4th October I received informa<lb></lb>tion from the prosecutor, and took him to the prisoner's house, at nine o'clock in the morning—when the prisoner came out of his bedroom he put on a pair of black cloth trousers—Ladd identified him—I asked Ladd if he was dressed the same yesterday—he said, "No; he had got a pair of black cord knee-breeches"—I told the prisoner to take his trousers off and put on his breeches which he had on yesterday—he did so, and Ladd identified him more clearly—the prisoner said, "Well, if I had known it would have come to this, you old b——I would have had all the lot you had got"—he said that he came from Mr. West's beer-shop, and went to a beer-shop kept by Mr. Kitson, and stopped there all the evening, which I found was false—he had his arm in a sling, his left arm, I believe—I searched the house, but found nothing.</p>

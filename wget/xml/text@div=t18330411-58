            . I am the wife of Thomas Willocks- we live in Wentworth-street, and rent a house at No. 1, <placeName id="t18330411-58-crimeloc339">George-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18330411-58-crimeloc339" type="placeName" value="George-street"></interp>

I locked the door of that house safe at half-past seven o'clock, and about nine I went across, and found the street door open - knowing nobody was in the house, I got a light, and pushed the street door further open; I saw a man's hat laying down, with the padlock and staple off of the parlour door, which was on it at half-past seven o'clock, when I had locked it; I called a Policeman, and went into the parlour with him - I found the dining-table moved out of the back parlour to the front parlour door, and the pillows and bolsters shifted from their right place - I had made the bed all in order before I went away; I found the pillows and bolsters doubled in two, and laid at the foot of the bed - the prisoner was laying on the bed, with his face downwards; he was in a most deplorable state, without any shoes on - he pretended to be asleep; nothing was missing, the property was only removed - I am quite sure the table, pillow and bolster had been removed; I had polished the table, and put it under the window - the bolster and pillow were on the bed when I went out; only one lodger lived in the house, and she was out - I had left nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GREEN. I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Wentworth-street on Tuesday, the 12th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening - I went to the house, in consequence of the alarm, and found the prosecutrix holding the street door; the lock and staple laid by the hat in the passage - I went into the front room, then into the back room, and saw the prisoner laying on the bed- he appeared to be very heavy asleep; I shook him - he did not take any notice; he appeared to be sound asleep - I laid hold of his legs, and pulled him off on the floor; he then said, "Halloo! halloo!" I said, "How came you here?" he made no reply; I said, "I shall take you to the station-house;" the pillow and bolster were laying on the bed, doubled up, and the table was moved from the window towards the door, about three yards - I took him to the station-house, and when he got there he answered every question put to him, and did not appear so drunk as when I first found him; he gave no account how he got there in my hearing - the staple had been drawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. Yes, once, in the same room; I took him out of it about a month before, on suspicion of coining - he was sitting there with a woman who then occupied the room; she had nothing to do with the house at this time - the house is let out in rooms to girls, but at this time only one lodged there, and that was up stairs; she slept there - they call her Jane.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH WILLOCKS re-examined. The woman who lodged in the house at that time was Jane Smith; she was a weekly lodger, and lodged there five years - her husband is at sea; I gave the house up after the robbery, I was so frightened - she lodged there till I gave it up, and she now lives with me in Wentworth-street; my husband is a journeyman slaughtering-butcher: I had seen the prisoner once before, walking by the place, and asked what he did there - he said he did not know; Smith is twenty-eight or twenty-nine years of age, I think - she does not receive visitors that I know of; she receives none at my house - I cannot say how she gets her living; she is out all day, almost - the house is furnished very comfortably.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURROWS. I was with the Policeman - his evidence is correct; we found the prisoner on the bed, apparently very heavy asleep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About a week before this I was in the room with the woman who rented it: the prosecutrix came in intoxicated, and demanded her rent - an altercation ensued; she called in the Police: she had given them some secret information concerning me - the room was searched, but nothing found.</p>

               <p>Vernon.

               <p>Is that a proof it had been snapped? - It is in the same manner I found it; there is a small ball within side; I found it in the Goswel-street road, loaded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One of the witnesses said a ball; I want to ask whether it was loaded with shot or ball? - That is what I found in it. (A ball put out of the pistol.)</p>

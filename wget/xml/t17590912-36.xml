            ; he said it was a counterfeit; then the prisoner got jumping about, telling him he had won the two-pence, calling the deceased names, and saying he went after whores and such. Archer had a block-brush in his hand, he hit the prisoner a blow upon the elbow with it; as soon as he had hit him, the prisoner turned round and said he would chop him down, and flung the knife, which he was scraping the block with, immediately at the deceased; it hit him on the left side his navel, a little below.</p>

               <p>Addison. Over-handed. (A large knife, about three inches longer then a Shoemaker's knife; and a hair-brush, with a handle about a foot long, were produced) These are the knife and brush; the knife hit him and dropped down; the deceased lived. 'till that day se'nnight, and then died.</p>

               <p>Addison. They never sell out as I know of; they seemed to be friends before this.</p>

            . I am father to the deceased; I ask'd my son, after the accident happened, how it began; he said, he hit the prisoner over the arm with a brush; and the prisoner said he would do him a mischief, and flung the knife at him immediately. He had a Surgeon to attend him, but he died just about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Archer. I believe the wound he received on his belly.</p>
               <p>Mr Seirs. I am a Surgeon; when I saw the deceased, on the first of August, his hands were on his bowels covered with blood; there were a prodigious quantity of his bowels out; I imagine the wound was given with a sharp instrument; the wound was about an inch and half wide, and had past through into the cavity of the belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from the kind of the wound, that it might be done by accident, by falling out of a person's hand, or done by force?</p>

               <p>Mr Seirs. It appeared to me to have been done by force; that as he threw it over-hand, by it's striking him so low, it was on the descent, having taken, as it were, a circle. He lived 'till the eighth day and then died. There was another accident happened after the wound was given, he ran between two and three hundred yards with his bowels in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he might have lived, had proper care been taken?</p>
               <p>Mr Seirs. Yes: I do.</p>
               <p>Q. to Addison. What became of the deceased after the wound was given?</p>
               <p>Addison. He immediately ran a-cross the way, about a stone's cast.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon; I can say no more then what Mr Seirs has said; I was sent for to the deceased between ten and eleven o'clock at night, Mr Seirs was there; the lad's bowels were out, as many as would fill a handkerchief; I opened the wound and they returned again; about one o'clock the boy, by struggling, forced his bowels out again; I went and returned them; after that, the boy grew extreamly uneasy, and died in a few days.</p>

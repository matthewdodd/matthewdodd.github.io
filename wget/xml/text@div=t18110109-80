I met Mr. Ayres and Edy in the street, we stopped in Gough Square, Mr Ayres took me of one side, and stated, Mr. Falding you need not be afraid of trusting Mr. Edy now, his uncle is dead, and left him six thousand pounds, Edy was dressed in mourning with a black crape, I made an appointment to meet that day at three or four o'clock, we did not meet on that day, the next day Mr. Edy called at my warehouse, I made my transaction in confidence of the report of Mr. Ayres, I sold my goods to him.</p>

             the madman; Mr. Falding said, you are an apt scholar, when I met you I asked you what relation left you the property, you said you had come up to town to make use of some law process in case you should die within the twelvemonth, that the property might be secured to your wife and family, so that your brother could not touch it; Mr . Edy replied, I have an expectance, I have a rich relation , who when he dies, will leave me all his property. The goods were all delivered before this, I kept the books at that time</p>

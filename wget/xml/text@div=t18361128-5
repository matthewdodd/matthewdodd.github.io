                  </hi>. I am a soap maker and tallow chandler, and live at No. 65, Rosemary-lane, in the parish of Whitechapel. On the 17th of Novem<lb></lb>ber I went to bed about half-pastten o'clock—Gilbert was the last person up—in the morning by a private watchman—I got up, and found the shop door wide open, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of halfpence and pence, which had been tied up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, gone, and the till, and a great quantity of coppers besides, which were loose in it—the till had been locked, but it was so heavy it could be opened by being drawn down—I examined the premises, and there is a little back-shutter right up under the ceiling in the kitchen, which was done to admit air—it is about nine feet from the ground—I found that open,</p>

               <p>and by foreing it open it had stopped the clock at half-past one—I suppose that was the time it was done—I did not observe whether that shutter was fast the night before, but the cracks round it had been stopped with paper, to prevent the cold coming through—there was a button to it, but I do not know whether it was fast, but it was quite closed, with the paper round it, and it would take a smartish push to get it open—that shutter communi<lb></lb>cates with a little yard of mine, which leads into another yard, and then into a cow-yard—we traced footsteps from that shutter across into the cow-yard—there were marks of two naked feet down the wall into the cow-yard, where we found an old pair of shoes—they were prints of naked toes scraping down—the policeman was with me.</p>

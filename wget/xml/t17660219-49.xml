            . On Wednesday last in the afternoon about two o'clock, I was standing in <placeName id="t17660219-49-crimeloc281">St. James's park</placeName>

He immediately ran away, I pursued him, and took him by the collar; when he was got about five yards from the place, I charged him with taking my watch; he denied it, but there was no watch to be found, he must have got it off to some of his companions. There were people that stood by the side of me said, they saw something throwed. I am certain it was the prisoner that I felt twitch at my watch; there was no mob where I stood at that time; if there had been a mob, I could not have pursued as I did. The watch was advertised, and Sir

            . I was with Mr. Maidman. I missed him, and soon saw him have the prisoner by the collar; I went up to them, we searched the prisoner's breeches and coat-pockets, but did not find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search under his arms.</p>
               <p>Whitfield. No, we did not; the prisoner was in great confusion? there was not a great crowd; he prosecutor, I, and another, stood of a row.</p>

            ; we live in the Fulham-road. On the 1st of January I went home as the clock was striking ten; I found every door except the back door had been opened - the drawers had been ransacked, and two broken open; the cupboard doors were all open, and I missed property to the amount of 18l. or 20l. - among the rest were two silk gowns, and a pelisse, worth 6l. or 7l.; I had left home about ten minutes before one o'clock - there was no one then in the house; I left every door in the house locked -I found in the passage a piece of sperm candle, and the remains of a phosphorus-match; these are my gowns and pelisse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is your husband? A. He has been in service; he has <rs id="t18320216-50-viclabel274" type="occupation">kept lodging-houses</rs>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On Thursday, the 5th of January, I was in Tothill-street, Westminster, with Evans - I saw the two prisoners and another woman, near the King's Arms; Roberts had this bundle under his arm - he was talking to Davis and the other woman, between a pawnbroker's and the public-house; I passed them a short distance and watched them- I saw them go into the King's Arms, and Evans followed them; I then went in, and Davis was abusing Evans - I asked Roberts what was in the bundle; he said some silk dresses, which were his own - I said, "You know me?" he said, "I do;" I said, "Where did you get these?" he said he bought them six months ago, of a man in Petticoat-lane; Davis was still making a great noise, and there were several women in the house - I requested Roberts to come into the street; he did so, and then he again said he bought them of a man six months ago, in Petticoat-lane, but he could not tell his name; I had left the bundle at the bar, and while I was talking to Roberts, Davis was coming out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160021"></xptr>with something under her cloak - I suspected she had got the bundle, and asked what she had got; she said it was her own - she was loath to show it me, but I pulled it from under her cloak, and found it was the same that Roberts had had; it was then near three o'clock - the bundle contained these articles, which Mrs. Bannister afterwards claimed; on the evening that I discovered where they were lost from I went to Davis, who had been discharged the first day, but could not find her - I found her on Sunday morning, the 8th, at lodgings, which she said were her own: I found in the parlour this screw-driver, which, in my opinion, fits the marks found on the drawers at Mrs. Bannister's - Roberts said he had been in the habit of dealing in such things for two years; he lives in Ann-place, Westminster-road, and he stated so before the Magistrate, but he had first given me another direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Davis was twice examined? A. Yes, and twice discharged, and I was ordered to take her again - Roberts then had an olive coat and dark trousers on: the bundle was larger than it is now - Evans was not examined the first day, I believe, but he confirmed my statement on the second day; I cannot say whether Evans heard me ask the question in the house, but he did in the street - I swear that I put the question in the house, and out of the house, as a precaution to myself; I am certain Roberts did not say in the house, that he had been a dealer, attending Petticoat-lane for six months; but he said, distinctly and correctly, that he bought those things six months ago, of a man in Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was with Grossmith, and saw Roberts and Davis in Tothill-street -Davis left Roberts, and went into a pawnbroker's shop; I followed her in, and asked what she was pawning - she turned and said, "You vagabond, I am taking something out, "Which I found she was - I then said, "Where is the man that was with you?" she said, "I had no man with me:" I went into the public-house, and saw Roberts there- Davis followed me in; I said to her, "Here is the man, what have you now to say?" she made a great noise - Grossmith, came in and said, "We will have none of this;" he took Roberts out - I then went out, and heard Roberts say he had bought the things of a man in Petticoat-lane, six months before; Davis took a small parcel out of pawn, which she said was a gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What passed inside the public-house? A. There was such a confusion inside, that I did not hear what passed between Roberts and Grossmith - when I came out my attention was not called to any thing that passed, further than Grossmith said, "How long have you been a dealer in these things?" he said two years - that he bought things in the street, or of any body where he could get a bargain.</p>
               <p>Davis. Q. Had I any bundle? A. Yes, the bundle you took out of pawn - she afterwards took up this bundle, and was coming out; Grossmith stopped her with it.</p>

            . I am a gunsmith. I was at the Three Jolly Gardeners. in Rochester-row, on the 5th of January; I saw Roberts, who was a stranger to me, in that house, between twelve and one o'clock - he had nothing then; he took some gin, and went out for a quarter of an hour, when he came back with a bundle in a silk handkerchief, which he laid down by his side; the handkerchief had red spots, and I believe this is it - I left him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon at Woodford, of fifty years' experience—my professional services were called for upon 14th April, to tend a cow of Lady Morrison's which had lately calved—I found her suffer<lb></lb>ing from apoplexy; produced by parturition—parturition apoplexy we call it—I administered medicine to her three or four times—she died on 15th—I should say such an animal would net be fit for human food—the defendant is a knacker and harness-maker, not a jobbing butcher—he has not a slaughter-house that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What medicine did you give the cow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We only give them a little cooling medicine, because we have no chance when the brain becomes so depressed; to relieve the pressure on the brain—that destroys life very much as mechanical pressure would—I should say that a cow dying in that state, and attacked in that way, would necessarily be too bad for anybody to eat, if the blood was not drawn out—I saw it the same morning after it died—it had not been dressed then.</p>

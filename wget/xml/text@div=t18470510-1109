                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop, in Coppice-row, Clerkenwell. On Sunday night, the 25th of April, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop—he wanted some bread and cheese—it came to twopence halfpenny—he tendered me a half-crown in payment, and I gave him change—he went away—I put that half-crown in my pocket, separate from any other money—I had no other half-crown in my pocket—on the following morning I tendered the same half-crown to the baker—he found that it was bad—it did not go out of my sight—I am sure I got back from the baker the same half-crown as the prisoner gave me—I again put it in my pocket, where there was no other money—when I got home I marked it, and wrapped it up in paper—I put it in a drawer, where it remained till I gave it to the constable.</p>

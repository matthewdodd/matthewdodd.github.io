            . I am a foot-boy to Mr. Barrow. I was directed to go to master between seven and eight in the evening with the coats; I could not find them, I saw them safe at half past three.</p>
               <p>GOODMAN SOLOMON. I am a deaer in clothes, in Field-lane. On the 3rd of October, between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop with this Chaise coat; she asked me one pound for it; it is worth four pound in the trade; I would not buy it. She had another coat on her arm. I asked her what she wanted for that; she said, she would sell this first I asked her whose they were; she, said, her husband. I told her to fetch him in, and let me see him; she walked off. My wife fetched Barnley, the constable; he took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my two coats; I paid seven guineas for one of them.</p>

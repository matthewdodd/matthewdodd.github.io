                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edwin Clarkson, and live at Tottenham. The prisoner lived in my service about three weeks—in con<lb></lb>sequence of missing some articles, I spoke to her and her two fellow servants, and requested them to allow me to search their boxes—I had missed two or three petticoats, several handkerchiefs, and a knitting case—what made me speak to my servants was, I found some stockings of my daughter's in the servants' room which had been worn.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230038"></xptr>
               <p>can you mention any specific thing that you missed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot—I had several bad servants with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what day was it you spoke to the prisoner about permitting you to search her box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Saturday, 16th Sept.—I said, "Esther, I hope you will allow me to search your box;" or rather, as I did not wish to touch her box myself, I wished her to show me what she had got in her box—she refused—I think she said, "No, I will not; I never was asked such a question by any mistress"—I sent for a policeman the game afternoon—he came about 6 o'clock—I had had the conversation with the prisoner a little after 2 o'clock, I think—when the officer came I went with the prisoner and the other two servants to her room—the policeman did not go till the prisoner had opened her box, and I saw some of my things in her box—I had left him down stairs—the prisoner knew that he was in the house—the servants did not all sleep in that room; the prisoner and the nursemaid slept there—the nursemaid's box was opened first—I think it was not locked—the prisoner's box was locked—she opened it her<lb></lb>self, and I found in it a night shirt belonging to my father and one belonging to my son, a petticoat belonging to myself, and one of my daughter's; three handkerchiefs belonging to another daughter of mine, and a knitting case—they are all here—some of the things are marked with the initials of the person to whom they belong—the value of the whole is about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my own petticoat is new, and one new petticoat was cut out and made, not for my daughter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This girl only lived three weeks in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had a character with her from the lady with whom she last lived—it was an honest character—I had missed things previous to this girl coming into my employ—I think it was about half-past 3 o'clock when I first asked her to allow her box to be opened—I sent for the officer about 6 o'clock in the evening—I did not place the prisoner under any restraint during that time, but her room was not left—either one of my daughters or one of the servants was in the room—I do not know that there was a serious quarrel between the nursemaid and this poor girl, and that the nursemaid threatened that she would serve her out before long—I think there had been a few words between them, but I do not know what.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That nursemaid is still in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the one that I believe there had been a few words with is—she had been housemaid, and was afterwards nurse—I dismissed her because she was not servant enough for me; she was not strong enough—her name is Harriet Brook—she has not gone into service since—I know her relations—I could find her—neither of my servants are here—the prisoner was indignant at the pro<lb></lb>position of searching her box, but when the policeman came she offered me the key—I said I should prefer her opening it herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was in the room when these things were found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both the other servants—the prisoner did not say anything to me when these things were found.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not say something to the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as soon as a few things were found, I sent for him, and he asked her what she had to say to it—I forget the words she said exactly, but she said she must take the consequence of it—he asked her what account she gave of it—I cannot recollect what she said at first, but she said, "I must take the consequence"—she did not say she could not account for how they got there, and that she was perfectly innocent—she did not say anything about their having been put there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 82). I was sent for to the house on 16th Sept—I was left below, while Mrs. Clarkson and the other young woman Went up stairs—I do not know where they went—a night shirt and some other things were found, and I was sent for, and went up stairs—I saw the remainder of the box searched—I stood close by, while the things were taken out—the prisoner herself took them out—there were three handker<lb></lb>chiefs taken out, a night shirt, and some new linen, or something for petticoats, I believe it was—they were placed in different parts of the box—the box contained, besides these articles, different articles of wearing apparel belonging to the prisoner—I made some remark when I went in, "What have you to say to this?"—she said, "I don't know, Sir; I have done it, and I suppose I must put up with the consequence of it"</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You understand me, I hope; when you took her into custody on this charge, did she not say she did not know how the things came in her box, but she supposed she must put up with the consequences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear her say anything of the kind—I did not hear her say she did not know how the things came in her box; that I swear—I was examined before the Magistrate—my examination was read to me—I signed it—this is my writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposition</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition was here ready as follows:</hi> "On Saturday evening last, about 6 o'clock, I was sent for to the house of Mr. Edwin Clarkson, when the prisoner Esther Bayford was given into my custody, and I saw several of the articles I now produce taken from her box, she having previously given up the key—the prisoner said she did not know how the things came in her box, but she supposed she must put up with the consequences."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now which statement is true; you have stated to-day that she did not make use of the words, that she did not know how they came in her box; you stated before the Magistrate that she did; which is true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did say, "I don't know, Sir; I have done it, and I suppose I must put up with the consequences."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows:</hi>—"I have two keys to my box, and I had lost one of them for two or three days; I suppose some person must have put the things into my box, as I know nothing of them, and am innocent of the charge made against me."</p>

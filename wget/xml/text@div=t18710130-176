               <p>it, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after December, 1867, I supplied Mr. Bell with potatoes from time to time and was paid—I did not know that my brother took a bill of exchange or a promissory note for a cheque of Bell's which had been dishonoured, till we were in the Court—I know it now—I don't know how much it was—his transactions and mine are quite separate—we always expect the money for the sales of potatoes within a week, or something like it—perhaps I may have sold him potatoes and not been paid the balance for a week afterwards—about the middle of May, after the dishonour of one of these cheques, or both, I received a note from Mr. Bell, countermanding the delivery of any further quantity of potatoes—he had got my lot then; he ought to have sent to me sooner—there was not a quantity of potatoes which would have been forwarded to London, if I had not received that note—I did not send him more than he had ordered—he telegraphed for 20 tons 19 cwt.—he afterwards wrote for a few trucks more, when he sent me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and I sent him 17 tons more—I believe the letter, ordering a few trucks more, was written on the 13th—I charged him 115<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I sought 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him, and then he offered me 115<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not been seeking a market at Blackpool for those very potatoes in vain: that I swear—I had not offered them to any one in London, only to Mr. Bell—I know Mr. Dowse since this affair happened—he is a potato dealer in London, I believe—I never wrote a letter to Mr. Dowse—I had not been offering potatoes to him before I sent these potatoes to Mr. Bell—I had not been in correspondence with him, or in personal communication with him; I had no communication with him whatever—I have not received any communication from him up to this date—the first interview I had with Mr. Bell, after the dishonour of these cheques, was on 26th May, at his house in London—my brother was present; not all the time—he said if I would allow the matter to stand over, he hoped shortly to be able to arrange things—my temper was good enough on that occasion—he said something to this effect "You ought not to be so hard upon me, I suffered a considerable loss by potatoes which you sent to me a couple of years ago, and you need not make such a fuss about your being possibly a loser by me now "—I was not out of temper with him, I merely said I should consult a solicitor, he having obtained these goods so recently, and so barefacedly to telegraph for these goods and get them, and then to call himself together—I said "I shall consult a solicitor before I leave London," and then it was he said to me and my brother "You need not be so put about, I suffered a loss by you some two years ago, in reference to potatoes that you sent to me "—I had previously asked him if he could let me have some money—he did not say "If I am obliged to fail, I cannot give you any money in preference to my other creditors "—he never named no preference whatever—he said "I cannot give you any money "—he did not, at that interview or any other one, say "If I were to give you any money, and were obliged to become bankrupt, it would be doing injustice to the rest of my creditors "—the interview at Blackpool was on 17th June—my brother was present a part of the time—I had had some talk with Mr. Murray, my solicitor, before I left London, in May—I did not tell him to tell Mr. Bell that if he could not find money to pay me, I would see whether I could not prosecute him—I did instruct Mr. Murray, on 17th June—at the interview at Blackpool, I did not tell Mr. Bell that if he would pay me or get for me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, and something in the pound on my debt, that there should be an end of the matter—I said nothing of the kind to him—I was not trying to get 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs at that time—I never thought</p>

               <p>of such a thing as 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs, and part of what he was indebted to me, on 17th June—I was not extremely anxious at that time to settle the matter by getting 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the defendant—I had a lot of talk with Mr. Bell—I don't know that I have ever been in a bad humour with him all the time, though, there might be now and again a sharp word—he did not dine with me on that day—I believe he had tea at my house, bat I would not swear it—I don't know that he dined at my brother's—I was not there—we had a game at bowls on that day; several games—I was not going to behave badly to him when he came to see me—I don't think I am behaving badly to him now—the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had never been named on that day—I had a lot of talk with him—I was anxious to settle, of course, but it was not named on that date—it was in November last that 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the fixed sum for costs—it was on 17th June that the conversation took place with reference to the father-in-law—I never saw him in my life till I was at the Bankruptcy Court—I said we would have the bills, if his father-in-law would back them—I had heard that his father-in-law was a man of means in the same trade—I did not know it, only from hearing it—I told him if his father-in-law put his name on them I should be satisfied—on 15th July, this letter was written to the father-in-law, at Bell's request—I did not show that letter to Bell before I sent it—I did not see Bell between 17th June and 15th July—I have not had any conversation with the father-in-law, Mr. Peart, yet—my communication to him was by letter, that was all—an application had not been made in the mean time to the Court of Bankruptcy, to sanction a prosecution—I was present when my counsel made the application to the Judge at the Bankruptcy Court for permission to prosecute Mr. Bell for obtaining money from me by fraud—he dismissed it—I did not hear him say that there was no pretence for asking him to give authority for the in<lb></lb>tervention of the criminal law in this case, or that it was a monstrous applica<lb></lb>tion—I would not undertake to say what it was the Judge actually did say—the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed for costs after the application for permission to prosecute—I don't know the amount of costs before, when we had the conversation at Blackpool, on 17th June—we had never had the bill—I never said to the defendant, on 17th June, that I must have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to satisfy my lawyer, and some of my own debt besides—I did not name a sum at all; 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed in November—there was no other sum fixed at any time—I did not suggest that 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do—it was their side said that—Mr. Webster offered 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, to our solicitor, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—per<lb></lb>haps 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was wanted, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, at some time or other—we never consented to take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I did not tell him, when he was down at Blackpool, to try and put the screw on the old gentleman, meaning his wife's father, and try and get the money out of him—I asked him if he thought his father-in-law would do it—I did not say to him "If you can't do anything with the old man, see what the wife can do"—I never heard it named before—he said he did not know anybody who would back the bills, and I said to him "Don't you think your father-in-law, Mr. Peart, would do it? '—he did not tell me that he was surprised to find that his bankers had stopped his over-draft?—after he had got all the potatoes, he wrote me a letter to say that his bankers had slopped his over-draft; but he did not say that he was surprised that they had done so—I did not know that he had been in the habit of over drawing his bank account, I first knew it when he wrote that letter—I sent the cheque back to the bank, after it had been returned to me—I did not, on an occasion previously to that, send a dis<lb></lb>honoured</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir.—Enclosed is cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our trade is very slow this week, and prices is not so good, so don't send any more at present.")

                  </hi>. I am a potato merchant, of South Beach, Blackpool—I am brother of the last witness; but we are not in partnership—I have known the defendant about three years, and had transactions with him—I had no transaction with him from 5th June, 1869, to May, 1870—in November there was a small balance due to me of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which has never been paid—on 7th May, 1870, I received this letter from the defendant, dated May 6th. (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter asking the price of flukes</hi>.) I sent this reply, dated 7th May. (<hi rend="italic">This stated the price at</hi> 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per ton</hi>). On 9th May I received this telegram, ordering 20 tons—on 10th May I sent the defendant 18 tons and some hundredweight of potatoes, value over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 12th May I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the cheque to be sent, and inquired if more goods were wanted</hi>.)

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the London and County Bank, Caledonian Road branch—we do a great deal of business with the Islington potato market and other markets—the defendant had an account at our bank for some years—it was still open in May last—the last day of payment was on 23rd May—I gave him notice in April about his account, it was this "To Mr. George Bell. Sir,—Your cheques' to so-and-so, and so-and-so,' having been presented and returned unpaid, I have again to request that you will not draw cheques unless you are prepared to meet the same on presen<lb></lb>tation"—the date of that is 18th April 1870—I must have requested him, before that, not to draw—I returned several cheques in April and May—I should say twenty or thirty—apparently, cheques were returned as</p>

               <p>early as 1867, referred to drawer—I have not the book to prove that—the "return" book that I have' brought commences with 1869—the defendant was allowed to overdraw for some long period—on 18th April he was 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn—I had one or two conversations with him about the overdrawing—I had frequently requested him to cover his account—I did that whenever his account was overdrawn—by covering his account, I mean not to overdraw—when the cheques were returned by me in April and May the account was overdrawn, and beyond my wish to increase it—on 11th April the account was overdrawn 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th April, 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 11th, 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 11th May, 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 19th May, 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—cheques were returned on 6th May—one, for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next return was on 7th May, one for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then nothing up to 11th—on the 7th May there was a payment of 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't say whether that was before or after the cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was dishonoured—it is entered "By cash "—that constitutes cheques, and gold, and silver—"bill" in the pass-book is entered as cash at the time, and debited against him afterwards, if it is not paid—there were subsequent payments in May of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from 7th May to the 23rd, the payments amounted to 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was drawing against that—from April to 23rd May the account appears to have been slightly increased—on 23rd May the balance against him was 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was about the same as it was on the 9th—I told him that it was against the rules of the bank for accounts to be overdrawn, therefore, I must request he would cover it, at the same time the over draft might stand at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I should expect it paid quickly—he was to pay in money to meet cheques, it being against the rules of the bank to have overdrawn accounts at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. It is not an uncommon practice to overdraw, but it is against the rule; that rule, like every other, has its exceptions—those exceptions are made by the manager at his discretion—it is the fact that, just previous to May, 1870, we had allowed another customer to overdraw to the extent of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Bell had had a banking account at our branch five or six years, to my knowledge—he banked there when I took the post of manager—he was carrying on business as a potato salesman—I had a high opinion of him, as a man of honour and a man of business—we balance our accounts every quarter—during that period he passed through the bank, in payments and debits, an average of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the pass-book</hi>) in June, 1867, here is 5600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each side—bills that are discounted for persons are entered in the book as bills; if paid in with the ordinary cash, they are called cash—in the last quarter in 1870, I see, "Cash, 4296<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that is actual cash, including cheques, of course—during years he has paid in many thousands a year, either in cash or in securities, which have been realized and converted into cash—the balance against him is 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the whole period that I have been manager, he has, at different times, been permitted to overdraw his account, and been charged interest for it—at times that overdraft amounted to several hundred pounds, which was afterwards honourably replaced by him; at one time to the extent of between 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which at first was referred to drawer, was afterwards passed, and his account was in credit—on 7th May he was 405<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn, and on 25th his account was in credit—between 13th and 23rd May he paid in somewhere about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in round numbers—on 11th April he was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn—when he was stopped his account had improved—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101300053"></xptr>
               <p>on all the overdrafts he was charged a regular interest, and paid it from time to time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. We took no note or any security for hit overdrafts—a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be put to his credit when handed in, and it would be left to his credit till it was met; if not paid, it would be put to his debit—there appears to have been a draft returned, on 22nd April, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the entry, I should say that was a cheque—the balance against him on 31st March was 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in October, 1869, about 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 30th September, 1869, there was a balance in his favour of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in June, 1869, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those are not the only balances in his favour; I find others—on 15th September there was a balance of 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his favour—we strike a balance there every quarter, but in our ledger every day.</p>

I was on duty on 19th Sept. in Hart-street, Seething-lane, at eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoners in Mark-lane—I did not know them before—I saw them trying the pockets of several different gentlemen—Pope lifted the tails of the coats, and Neale was close to him—there had been a fire in Mark-lane, and there was a great number of persons collected there—I watched them for about half or three-quarters of an hour, and they went together into Hart-street, Seething-lane—I there saw Mr. Furness standing with other persons—I saw Pope put his hand into his pocket and take out a handkerchief, and give it to Neale, who was close by the side of him—I immediately secured them both—Neale threw down the handkerchief—I called to a brother constable in uniform, and gave Pope into his custody—I was in plain clothes—I kept hold of Neale, and stooped and picked up the handkerchief—we took them to the station—I spoke to Mr. Furness previous to taking the prisoners—he was going away—I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him he had his pocket picked—I do not know whether the prisoners heard, me—they were near enough to hear—Mr. Furness said he had lost his handkerchief—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it in my custody since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employ of Messrs. Colley and Son, horse-hair manufacturers. I was in Hart-street, Seething-lane, about eight o'clock in the evening of 19th Sept.—I went out of curiosity to see the fire—I was standing, looking to see if there was an opportunity of passing the crowd—about a moment after I left the crowd I missed the handkerchief—I missed it before Scott spoke to me—he came and said, "I believe you have lost your handkerchief"—this produced is it—I believe it is not marked—I know it by the pattern—it is silk.</p>

I said, "Directly"—we saw a lot of policemen and a mob; one of the policemen came up and said, "You have stolen a handkerchief;" I laid, "I have done no such thing;" I was in my working clothes, all over whitewash: he searched us both, but could not find anything; he picked up the handkerchief about twenty yards off, and then took us to the station.</p>

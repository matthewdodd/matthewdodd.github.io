I was near my own house, and saw Puttock drive his cart of hay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170027"></xptr>nearly opposite the prisoner's door; it could not get quite to it. The prisoner is a married woman, her husband's name is James. Puttock got on the load of hay, took one truss, and threw it down. I followed him into the prisoner's apartment-(she keeps night-carts.) I saw her give 1s. 9d. into his hands. I took it out immediately, and asked him how he came by that truss of hay? he said he had brought it from the barracks, as it was a returned truss - He said he sold it by his master's orders. I told him I thought it strange he should bring one truss for sale. I took him into custody, took the team to market, and returned for the prisoner, she was absent. I did not take her until last Friday week. I went back to Puttock. He said he found the hay by Edgeware Barn. It appeared to me to be part of the load.</p>

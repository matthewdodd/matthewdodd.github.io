                  </hi>. I am a wool dyer, of 50, Warner Street, Clerkenwell—on 17th August, about 10.10, I was in Hatton Garden, at the Clerkenwell end—the prisoner rushed upon me, kicked me heavily on the right knee, cutting my trousers through, and inflicting a bad wound on the knee cap—he then dealt me a very heavy blow with his right hand in the chest, with his closed fist, bringing me to the ground—he knocked me down—he then seized my watch and chain, and dragged it from its setting; it was hanging in his hand—I closed with him instantly, caught him by the collar with both hands, and held him—I caught hold of the watch, and it parted at the bow, and the bow is on the chain now—I struggled and called "Police!"—I regained possession of the watch—I was unable to pursue him, through the blow on the knee cap—he also dealt me several blows on the jew, which loosened one of my teeth, and I was obliged to have it out—we were struggling together for about two minutes—during that time I was face to face with him; I have no doubt he is the man—on the following Monday I was taken to the yard of the Clerkenwell Police-court—I saw a number of men there, and immediately picked out the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You had no hat on, nor any of the others that I saw; they were all standing in a row with their hands behind them—the value of my watch and chain is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a man with you who I could not recognise—he was a mere lad—he said "Have you got it?"—he took no part in the attack—I have had palpitation of the heart ever since, and have suffered very much, and have not been fit for my occupation.</p>

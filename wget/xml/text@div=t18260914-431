            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I heard some persons discoursing outside my door, and I went out - I heard a boy in the field had robbed this lad of 9d. - I took my staff, and went to the field, and he pointed to the prisoner - there were eight or ten boys round the prisoner, who ran off in different ways, and the prisoner in another - I followed and came up with him - I secured him - he asked what it was for - I said "I will tell you that by and by;" he said he would not go; but I made him - I took him to a public-house, where I searched him, but found nothing on him - the house was surrounded with a desperate set, and I was forced to send to Worship-street to get further assistance, before I could get him away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going into my own house, and he took me. Witness. No; he was going in quite a different direction.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The little boy pointed him out immediately? A. Yes; this was a little past three o'clock on Tuesday, the 12th of September, it was in Hare-street-fields; but to distinguish that field from the others, it is called the High-field.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live at No. 15, Mapes-street, Bethnal-green. I had been for my work, and was coming home between two and three o'clock - I passed this lad and two more, who were sitting down close by where I live in Mapes-street - when I got to my own door, having nothing to do, I took my young one in my arms, and saw the prosecutor playing with his hoop; I neither saw the prisoner advance towards him, nor did I hear any alarm till the officer came - I then asked the prosecutor if he was sure it was him; and he said, "Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140163"></xptr>it was the boy with the red night cap;" there might be two or three who had red night caps on.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you kept watching him, that he might not do any thing? A. I did not see him do any thing; he was in the field, as he frequently is - a neighbour of mine flies pigeons, and he frequently comes and looks at them; I am quite sure it was between two and three o'clock - it was past three when the officer came.</p>

            . I am a swivel-weaver. The prisoner was not near the boy at the time - he was at a good distance; I was playing in the field, and saw the prisoner with a red night-cap on, but no one else; the prosecutor was not long on the ground - he had a hoop which he was rolling about the field - no one took it from him; I did not see him on the ground at all - nor see any body throw stones, nor see the officer - but I saw some man go across the field and take the prisoner; I have known the prisoner before, and played with him often, but not on that day - I was playing with some other little boys - I was not throwing stones.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

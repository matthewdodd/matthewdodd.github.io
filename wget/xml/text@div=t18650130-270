                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Greenwich Union Workhouse—on 7th January, at 3 o'clock, I placed some food in a plate, close to the coal-box, and covered it with a cloth—all the able-bodied men under sixty were there—the prisoner, who is a cripple, was sitting close by with a chisel and a piece of wood—I said to him, "It is for your comfort and mine alike to keep the place clean"—he said, "I was here before your food was, and I will make a mess if I like—I said, "You will not make a mess over my food," and pushed the bit of wood out of his hand—he said, "Hold hard, if you please," and turned round and said, "Either you or me for it, I will stab you"—he stabbed me on the left breast with the chisel, and I fell senseless, saying, "Hold me up, I am stabbed"—I knew nothing more until I was in the Infirmary—I left there yesterday—I had never had any words with him—he was a stranger to me—I am suffering from the injury now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical attendant at Greenwich workhouse—I was called there on 7th January, and saw the prosecutor—his shirt was saturated with blood, which was trickling from a wound on the left side of the breast, a quarter of an inch wide and a good half inch deep, corresponding with this chisel—I believe there was also internal hæmorrhage—he is still suffering from loss of blood—I had to administer large quantities of brandy to him to bring him to—the wound was not dangerous, but the loss of blood was serious—he was only released from the Infirmary yesterday.</p>

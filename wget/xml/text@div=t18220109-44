            . I am labourer to Mr. Ray. On Wednesday morning, the 30th October, at five o'clock, I went to the premises, it was very dark; I found the lodge-gate open, the passage door, also the wash-house door, the stable door, and the harness-room doors were all open; the wash-house and the harness-room doors were forced open, and the stable door, with the coulter of the plough. I found it near the door, it was in the plough near the hay-stack the night before. I applied it to the marks, and have no doubt but it was the instrument used.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARLAND. I am coachman to Mr. Ray. I sleep in the house, I left the stable and harness-room about eight o'clock at night, I locked them and had the keys in my pocket; I left four shirts, six neck-cloths, six pair of cotton stockings, two pair of worsted, one silk handkerchief, one striped waistcoat, and one pair of cord breeches there, which were mine; there was a cloth livery coat and waistcoat of Mr. Ray's, and a pair of blue velveteen breeches, the livery was new. I had not worn it above five or six times, there was a coachman's coat laying on the box of the carriage in the coach-house. I got up about twenty minutes past five o'clock, and found the door forced open with the coulter of a plough, it fitted the marks.</p>

            . I knew Deakin. I lived with him in October last - I am not his wife, I lived with him seven years. On the morning of Wednesday, the 31st of October, between six and seven o'clock, some persons came to our house, I and Deakin were in bed, I did not know the persons then, but do now; it was the prisoners, they came with some things, they knocked at the door two or three times; at last I heard them, and awoke Deakin, he went to the door and let them in; we sleep down stairs, they came into the front place where we live, the door was a jar. I laid in bed, and could hear what passed; I heard these men ask Deakin, if he would take these things which they had got; he replied, that he was very much against taking them; they said, he need be in no fear, for all was right,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090026"></xptr>and straight; he gave consent to take them, and one of them said, they must have some money of him, he gave them a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he did that - A. Yes; I heard the words pass between them; he then told them to take the things and leave them at the Jolly Butchers, public-house, which was about a mile from Bow-farm, where we lived, and to leave them with the ostler, till Deakin called for them - they then went away. Between breakfast and dinner, Wilson and Tufnel came again to our house, Deakin was not at home when they came in, only myself, Wilson said to me,</p>
               <p>"Well, old woman, where is Deakin." I said,</p>
               <p>"He is not at home," he was gone to West Green, on his master's business, about some potatoes, he was servant to Mr. - Bow's-farm; he said, he should very much like to have seen him if he had been at home, to know whether he meant to have the other things or not; I said,</p>
               <p>"What things is it you have got?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I cannot tell you rightly what there is, but, there is a bag full of them, wet and dry together," he said,</p>
               <p>"For they will lay in the field and spoil," there was silk stockings; laces and dresses, for all that he saw, he was ******** if he did not take that; Tuffnel was present, and one of them said, that as they stood in the house, they had a great mind to hang the things on the hedge to dry them, as they were so wet; Tufnel joined in the conversation - they both came again next evening, Thursday, Deakin was at home, and all three consulted, how they were to get the things away; they asked Deakin, how he meant to get the things away that were at the Jolly Butchers, they said, they had left one parcel at the Jolly Butchers, and one parcel in the field, in White Hart-lane; he told them he had got them from the Jolly Butchers, and they were in the house; he said, he would get rid of the things that he had got from the Jolly Butchers, first, and then he would tell them more about the others, he said he would get Balaam's cart on Friday morning, and take them down to Mr. Hart, the Jews, at Tottenham - they said, they wanted more money, Deakin said, he did not know how to let them have more till he had got rid of the things, but he gave them 10 s. more that night. He had locked the things in the bed-room before they came. I saw them there in a sack; there was a large blue coat, with three capes, and a great coat, with one cape, both livery coats; one loose-bodied servant's livery coat, a pair of corded breeches, and another plumb-coloured velveteen; two servant's waistcoats with sleeves, and another without, a pair of fustian overalls and jacket, three pair of white stockings, and three very large cambric neck handkerchiefs, they went away - next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, Balaam's son came with the pony and cart, and this sack was put in the cart. Deakin was apprehended on Saturday, and a great number of things taken away which Balaam's cart had brought back on Friday. On the Wednesday after Deakin was taken, Wilson came about eight o'clock in the morning, I said I was but very middling; he asked how Tom was, I said, he was but very middling, considering the place where he was, and very low in spirits, he was then in Newgate. Wilson said,</p>
               <p>"More fool he to be low, for I have seen a sufficient person in town on Monday, who said, if he would keep his own counsel and not tell of us, they cannot hurt a hair of his head;" he said, he supposed he must have a Counsellor. I said, Yes, I dare say he must; he said, he would get him one, and that neither me nor my two children should want. Brown, my father-in-law, was sitting at breakfast at the table at that time, and heard him. I have been married to Bonner; I did not see Wilson again till he was before the Magistrate, nor did I see Tufnel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you here when Deakin was tried - A. No. I first heard of the robbery on the Thursday after it was committed. Deakin is now in Newgate. They came on the morning of the robbery, Deakin was in bed all that night, he came home about eleven o'clock, and was very fuddled - I did not get up when the prisoners came, and did not see them; they came three times before Deakin was apprehended; they came openly in the middle of the day - Tufnel said no one knew him about there, but Wilson said, the men who were working in the road knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in hopes of saving Deakin's life by your testimony - A. I do not know, I have not been told that it will be of benefit to him. I am twenty-five years old.</p>

            , I said, Yes; he said we have a parcel to leave for him till he calls for it; we had walked on, and were close at home; I said pitch it in this open shed before the door; he said he thought he had better leave it in the stable, it would be more out of the way - Deakin called for it next day, between one and two o'clock, with a horse and open cart, there was potatoes in the cart. I saw Wilson again at my master's house, in the tap-room a few days after - I knew him again, as the man who brought the sack. Deakin was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Many people come to your house - A. Yes. I remember him as the man who brought the sack; I did not speak to him.</p>

            , JUN. My father is a blacksmith, and lives at Bow-farm. He sent me to Deakin's with the horse and cart on a Friday, about two months ago; it was a good while before I heard of the robbery - I went to Deakin's in the morning, and took something in a bag in the cart; he got in with me, we went down White Hart-lane, and I saw both the prisoners in the lane, one was in a field, and the other sitting on the stile; I did not know them before, they did not speak to Deakin; Deakin left me in White Hart-lane, and took the bag, cart and all, and returned with the cart empty - I saw the prisoners again, as we returned lower down the lane; Deakin got out and spoke to them, I do not know what he said; they talked together about five minutes, Deakin went with Wilson up a little bit of a lane, leaving Tufnel, they had nothing with them then, they came back to the cart in a little while, and brought something in a bag. Wilson brought it, and put it in the cart, without either of them saying a word; Tufnel stood ten or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090027"></xptr>twelve yards from the cart; I drove on; Deakin walked with them behind the cart, in conversation, not far up the lane; then the prisoners went back, and Deakin came on with me. I drove to Deakin's house, the bag was taken out, and carried into his house; Mrs. Deakin was there - I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw them before - A. No. It was broad day light; I had heard of no robbery then, it was on a Friday a good while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first say you knew those men - A. Before the Magistrate at Edmonton, I believe it was on the 1st of January, I know them by their faces; I noticed them very much, and am sure of them; I never said I was not certain, I never doubted it. I am thirteen years old.</p>

            . I live at Palmer's-green. I did not marry Bonner's mother, her mother is my housekeeper. I remember Deakin's being taken up; Bonner was at my house after that, Wilson came there on the Wednesday after Deakin was taken; I was sitting at breakfast, Bonner was there, and a man who is in the country; Wilson said to Bonner,</p>
               <p>"How are you," she said,</p>
               <p>"I am middling,"</p>
               <p>"How is Deakin," said he, she said,</p>
               <p>"He is middling according to the place he is in." he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make yourself uneasy about him, for I have been to a good sufficient person in town, and he says they can't hurt a hair of his head if he does but keep his own counsel," I said,</p>
               <p>"Then I suppose you are one of the men who got these things," he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes," I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken a mortal trouble to get these things, you broke a good many locks," he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, that be d - d, that is all lies, we got them in an out place." I went away, and left them there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Wilson in custody. As we went to prison, he said voluntarily in the office after the examination, that no one could hurt him but the woman, meaning Bonner; he said it was dark, and how could she see him, she had appeared against him. As we came to Newgate, he said,</p>
               <p>"I know I shall go into them cells." When Tufnel was in the cage, at Lower Edmonton, he voluntarily said,</p>
               <p>"I am the fellow who broke the locks, and I had a good swig at the cream;" he was talking to a person who gave him some beer. I overheard the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were outside the cage - A. Yes. I heard the words distinctly; I never heard him say the woman was a liar, and she would never be believed.</p>

            . I went with a search warrant to Deakin's house, and found a pair of wet stockings on a line, and a bundle of wet linen, under some sacks in the chamber; I produced them on Deakin's trial; they were given up to Mr. Ray.</p>

             re-examined. The dairy is near the laundry, there was milk and cream there, the milk was thrown about, and had been taken off the shelf; some cream had been taken off, ready for churning - there is sometimes a dozen pans of cream; I cannot say whether it was disturbed. Here is the property which was produced last Sessions; they are my master's, the marks of some are cut off, and the marks of some stockings are picked out; the mark of the red cotton still remains.</p>

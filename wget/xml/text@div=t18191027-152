On the 2d of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the back parlour, looking over some papers, at a chest of drawers, which stood rather behind the parlour door. I am quite sure the street door was quite closed - I rent the house. I was standing very still, and heard a little noise like the hustling of clothes; I turned a little aside to see what it was. I heard no more, saw nothing, and returned to look over my papers. In about a minute I heard the same noise again; I then stood so as to see the passage, and saw a gown drawn from the table in the room where I was, into the passage. I went to the parlour door, and saw the prisoner in the passage, with the gown on his arm; he had got about half way along the passage. I ran forward and laid hold of him, he dropped the gown, and struck me several times with great violence to prevent my holding him. I was extremely hurt; it was with difficulty I could move my arm for several days afterwards - he struck me with his fist, and dragged me towards the street door in trying to get out - it was then pushed too, but not fast; it opens by a small key from without. I screamed out Murder! several times. There are only a widow lady (who is a lodger), my daughter, and a female servant in the house. The widow has the first floor; she was in the garret at the time - my daughter was in the kitchen with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation in which you were, if any of the inhabitants of the house had opened the door must you have heard them - A. I must. Two minutes before that, I came out of the kitchen myself, and if the door had not then been shut I must have observed it. The kitchen stairs are close to the street door. My screams brought my daughter and the servant up; the prisoner had by this time dragged me to the step of the door; but before that, as I was screaming and struggling with him, a young man pushed the door open, came into the passage, and asked what was the matter? - I knew nothing of him. I told him the prisoner had attempted to rob the house, and I supposed he was come to assist him, as I thought he was an accomplice - he said no more, but instantly left, leaving the street door open about half way. The prisoner turned himself round towards the door, gave a violent pull, and pulled me out of doors across the street - he continued striking me all the while; I still kept my hold.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270082"></xptr>When he had got me on the step of the door, my daughter and the servant came up and rose an alarm, A young man came up, and secured him before I let him go. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you lost - A. The handkerchief was pinned to the gown, and were taken together. The gown was worth 10 s., and the handkerchief 6 d. It was not dark, I had not lit my candle.</p>

            . I am daughter of the last witness. I was in the house for two hours before. Mrs. Marer lodged in the house; neither she nor the servant had been out all the afternoon - she was in the garret at the time of the alarm. I heard my mother scream Murder! several times. I ran up, and saw the prisoner, who had hold of her, on the step of the street door, she was standing still then; he immediately pulled her across the street. Assistance came, who secured him. I saw him strike her several times - I had never seen him before. The gown had been dropped in the passage when I came up. I was at the watch-house when he was searched, nothing was found on him. Before he got to the watch-house, two men came up, said they were constables, and would take him to the watch-house. When they came to the top of Wardour-street they let him go, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go it!" - I should know one of them. The prisoner was never out of my sight until he was secured again, and taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutrix. I was standing at my door about six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, and saw Mrs. Holder and the prisoner come from her door, scuffling together, into the middle of the road; she kept hold of him, and called Murder and Stop thief! I ran and broke her from him, as he was beating her all the time over the shoulders. I collared him, and he knocked me down. He is a very strong man, and struck me with very great violence; he struck me several times afterwards. While I had hold of him two young men came up - one said he was an officer, he was well dressed, the other had an apron on; they both laid hold of him, pretending to be officers.; I laid hold of his collar too, and pushed him along as well as I could, he tried to get away. When he got to the bottom of Berner-street, opposite Wardour-street, they said</p>
               <p>"Go it!" he got away, and the two men absconded directly - I should know one of them again. I laid hold of the prisoner again myself, without losing sight of him. I saw him searched at the watch-house. A knife, 8 s. 6 d., and some lancets were found on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 2d of October, I was sent for to the watch-house, and took charge of the prisoner. I found 8 s. 6 d., six surgeon's lancets, and a knife on him. He was in a great perspiration, as if he had been struggling a good deal. He was brought in by several persons, one of whom he kicked a great deal, and scratched him so as to draw blood. He had no hat on when he was brought in - one was produced, which he denied being his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I had been to Lisson-grove with two pairs of boots, and had received 11 s. for repairing them; a man who lives next door to me went with me. I spent 2 s. 6 d., and as we came through this street, being both tipsey, he said,</p>

               <p>"Here is a brothel, come in, and we will have a lark." The hall door was open about three inches; I went into the front parlour, saw nobody there or in the back parlour; I said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go away" - he said</p>
               <p>"No, we will have a lark; I was robbed here last Saturday night of 13 s." The lady came out and caught me in the hall; I had no gown or any thing else at the time.</p>

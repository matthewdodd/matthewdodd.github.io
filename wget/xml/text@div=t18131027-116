I lost my great coat on Sunday, the 27th of September; I lost it out of my room; I work there; my great coat laid on the bed. I gave the prisoner a three-shilling piece to get a quartern of gin, she was quite a stranger to me before; she took the great coat with her, and did not return. I did not see her take it away. She brushed off with the three-shilling piece, and the great coat too; I was a little in liquor. I am sure this is the same woman; I knew her well again. I saw my great coat the next morning at Mr. Matthews's, the pawnbroker, in Wheeler-street; she was taken up the next day; she has been in prison ever since.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On Monday, the 27th of September, the prisoner pawned this great coat with me, for five shillings; she said, the money was to get her husband out of prison. In about half an hour after she had pawned it, the prosecutor came, and asked me if I had taken in such a coat; I told him, yes. I am sure it was the prisoner; I have known her some years. This is the coat.</p>

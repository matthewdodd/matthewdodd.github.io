                  </hi>. On 25th April I was lodging at 57, Euston Square and sleeping on the third floor—the prisoner lodged in the house—he is, I believe, a surgeon—on 25th April, at 2.10 a.m., I was aroused by a fearful noise in the next room as if a per<lb></lb>son was insane, and the alarm bell was ringing; there is alarm bell in each room—I went out of my room and heard more noise—what gave me the impression that some one was insane was hearing the carpets pulled up and the china knocked about, as if a per<lb></lb>son was in a state of frensy, quite a maniac—I do not think the china was broken, but I heard the furniture knocked about—I heard a rush to the door and I believe Dr. Grimes opened his door and came out into the passage—I then went into my room and shut the door—he shouted for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and made a fearful noise—I went down to my sister, who has a room on the lower floor; we went out, called the police, showed them up to the" prisoner's room, and I gave one of them an iron bar.</p>

On 25th April, about 3.30 a.m., the last witness called me to 57, Euston Square—I went with Hackett up<lb></lb>stairs to the third floor back room—I knocked at the door and the prisoner, I believe it was, asked who was there—I said "Police"—he said "What do you want?"—they had told me that he was a doctor, and I said "The land<lb></lb>lady of the house is very ill down below, she wants to speak to you;" that was done to get him to open the door—he said "I shan't come, you must get some one else"—I said "If you don't open the door I shall break it open"—he said "I shall set fire to the place and blow it up"—I then heard a rumbling noise and a cracking, and the females said "For God's sake, break the door open, he is setting fire to the place"—I swelt a fusee—they brought me an iron bar and I broke the door open—the room was all upset and I knocked my shins against a bath—the prisoner was there behind a mattrass, it was reared up on its side, and as soon as I got inside he said "Stand!"—I said "For God's sake, do not!" but he fired at me—the ball struck against an iron bar, cut a button off my coat, and glanced against the wall of the room and I found it afterwards—I went down below to get more assistance, and when I got to the first landing the prisoner came out and said "Oh, I have finished the b——"—the constable brought back Sergeant Pearson and a man named Starter—Starter went in first—they tried to paoify him by talking to him quietly and he seemed very calm then—I went behind the mattrass and behind him and seized his arms—he passed the revolver from his right hand to his left and fired four shots at random; he could not fire straight, because I was holding his arms—he said something to the sergeant about a dark man mesmerising him—the first shot, I believe, hit Sergeant Pearson, and the second as well—I cannot say as to the third and fourth, as I was struggling with him—I afterwards found two shots in the room which exactly fit the pistol, they are in copper cases before they are fired.</p>

               <p>when we got on to the third landing I saw the prisoner retreating into his room; he went in, and I saw him get behind a mattrass—Stone and the sergeant went up to him and spoke to him, and Allwood went behind him—I heard four reports, and the sergeant was badly bit, and so was Stone in two places—the prisoner seemed a little excited, but he recovered afterwards at the time we took him in custody—he fired the first shot when we knocked at the door—he was taken to Hunter Street station, and I found in his pocket these six cartridges (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a knife—Allwood took the revolver from him—he saw a doctor at the station.</p>

I live at 18, Humter Street, about 4.15 on the morning of 18th April, I was called to see the prisoner and found him suffering from a slight wound on his nose—he was very much agitated, and evidently labouring under a delusion—I said "Have you been drinking?"—he said "No, I have had nothing but a bottle of Bass's ale, but I have not had any sleep lately," or "for several nights, and I took some opium last night, but it did not give me any sleep"—he was very discon<lb></lb>nected in what he said, and I believed he was labouring under a delusion—he said that a mesmerist was downstairs below him who was trying to throw him out at the window by force, trying experiments, and that there were wires from the room below to his room, that he was cutting those wires, and while he was cutting them he was interrupted, and that he was sorry he had shot the policemen—he said nothing about a man in black—I have seen several cases of delusion, and to the best of my judgment he was suffering under delusion at that time, he was evidently insane—if I had been examining an independant patient that was the conclusion I should have come to—I did not observe any appearance of drink—opium when it has not the affect of causing sleep is a terrible irritant, and has just the contrary effect—in my judgment appearances which at first sight might be like those of drink might be brought on by opium.</p>

                  </hi>.

I am a licenciate of the Royal College of Physicians, and have known the prisoner ten years, he is a M.R.C.S.—he dined and spent the evening with me two nights before this; I had not seen him for many years and I accompanied him nearly to his house—he was very much depressed, and not the same cheerful man that he was when I first knew him in<lb></lb>Sheffield, he seemed sometimes vacant and absent about things which I expected him to be <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi> at, he seemed to have lost himself; I saw nothing more of him—I have had charge of convict establishments and had many lunatics under my charge—I fully agree with the other medical evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, slating that on the Sunday evening preceding the occurrence he felt very unwell and went to bed earlier than usual, but failed to get any sleep and got up at 6 o'clock and took a dote of opium to see if it, would compose him, and knowing that I or 2 grains had no effect upon him he took</hi> 4 or 5, <hi rend="italic">after which lie became more restless, and during all Mon<lb></lb>day did not feel it safe to venture into the street, but remained at home all day and went to bed at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, but could not sleep, having an idea that somebody below was making him an experiment for mesmerism or electro biology; that he then felt the preliminary, symptoms of an epileptic fit and shouted out "Stop that devilry, I will have no more of it;" that he had some recollection of rushing at the bell wires under the impression that he was being influenced by them, and thought the room was filling with vapour sent through the floor, and tore up the carpet, and put the mattrass on the boards to prevent it coming through and threatened to fire through the floor; that when the door was being broken open he fired at the thick part of it above the lock to deter' the man from entering, having no idea that he was a policeman, and that the other shots were fired accidentally in the struggle, and he expressed his sorrow that he had been instru<lb></lb>mental in inflicting injuries upon men against whom he entertained no malice.</hi>

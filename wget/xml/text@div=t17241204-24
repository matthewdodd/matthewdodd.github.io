John Hancock depos'd, that having been drinking at the Globe Tavern in Covent Garden, he took Coach there, and ordered the Coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172412040006"></xptr> to drive to his Lodgings, at Mr. Pain's, a Brasier, at the Golden Lyon in Grace-Church-Street. The Coach stopt by the way, and he lost his Watch, but by what means he could not tell, he was so disordered with drinking.

             the Coachman deposed, that in Fleet-Street the Prosecutor got out of the Coach. Why do you get out here, Sir? says the Coachman. Because I am at home, says Mr. Hancock. - No, Sir, you are in Fleet-Street. - Pray don't you trouble yourself about that, but take your Money and begone, said he; and taking out his Watch, offered it to the Coachman for his Fare. As they were in this Discourse, the Prisoner and another Woman came to the Coach, and seeing the Gentleman's Watch in his Hand; Come, my Dear, says one of them, let you and I go home to Bed together. The Prosecutor then put them both into the Coach, and this Evidence drove on to <placeName id="t17241204-24-crimeloc135">Ludgate-Hill</placeName>

             depos'd, that the Prisoner three times offered him a Shilling to let her go; but he refused, and carried her before the Constable, where she was searched; but the Watch was not found upon her. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that coming from Wood-Street Compter, where her Husband was confined, she saw the Man and a Woman talking together at a Coach-Door, they asked her to go and drink, but she refused, and went on towards Fleet - Ditch, where a Man clapt her on the Shoulder, at which she was very much surprized; and turning back, he charged her with taking a Gentleman's Watch, of which she was then as innocent as she was at the Hour of her Birth.

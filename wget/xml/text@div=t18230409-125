            , of Ludgate-hill. Pearson was our porter. We had about 7 cwt. of copper-plates in the warehouse. On the 5th of March some were missing. White, the apprentice, went to make enquiry. I then charged Pearson with it. He denied any knowledge of it; but after some time, and under some inducements, he made a confession. In consequence of what I learnt from him, I went to Field-lane, and saw a person, named Gray. Part of the house was a green shop, and the other part an old iron shop. From the information of Pearson, I went on the 7th or 8th of March, to the prisoner's house in Giltspur Street. I asked what he had done with his stock when he quitted the old iron trade, - to whom he had sold it - I did not mention Field-lane. he said he sold it to one and Nathan; that man was the only person he did business with, except the hawkers who came about to buy small quantities of brass and copper. Nothing further passed. Before this, the officers had brought him into the presence of Pearson, into our counting-house. Mr. Mawman asked Pearson if that was the person to whom he had sold the property. He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, it is." Robinson said, he never saw him, nor had he ever bought a plate of him. Robinson was then taken to the Compter, and I asked him about his stock, as I before stated; and in consequence of what I learnt from Mrs. Gray, I went to the witness Ham. The value of the property may be 100 l. or 500 l., it depends on the sale of the work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was Pearson in custody when you first saw the prisoner - A. Yes. He said he dealt with Nathan for the stock he had on hand when he left off business.</p>

            . I was porter to Mr. Mawman, and was charged with stealing this property. The prisoner kept an iron shop in Fleet-lane. I took some engraved copper-plates there for sale, about April, 1822. I got them from master's warehouse. He paid me 4 d. per pound. I received that day 10 s. or 12 s. for them. They were wrapped up in paper. I knew they belonged to the Dilitanti society. The paper on them was marked so; he never asked who I came from, or who I was - his wife and child were present. There were engravings with the plates - the children laid hold of them, and his wife said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, you had better burn them." I do not know whether he did or no. After he left the shop Mrs. Gray succeeded him. I went to sell her some copper-plates, which I also stole from master. I asked if she bought old copper. She said, Yes. She bought some of me after she had taken time to enquire about it. I told her I had sold some to the man who kept the shop before. When she paid me, she told me she had been to Mr. Robinson about them. I have sold some to another person who lived in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you lived with this gentleman - A. Five years; on and off. I did not know the value of them; some of them were quite clean. I was examined four times, and then admitted as an evidence - his wife and daughter were in the shop; he gave me the money himself, and took the ready-reckoner to cast it up. I sold him some in October; the last I sold him was about a week before he went to keep a cook-shop, in Giltspur-street, which was in September. I sold them to him on the day on which I stole them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is he the man to whom you sold them - A. He is; the conversation about burning the prints, was in his presence - he gave four pence a pound for the first lot, and six pence for the last.</p>

            . I succeeded the prisoner in his shop in Fleet-lane; he carried on a tailor's business, and an iron-shop there. I believe Pearson to be the person I bought 23 lbs. of copper of, in September; they were engraved plates. The prisoner called on me, and in consequence of what Pearson said, I told him a person had been concerning some copper-plates, he said I might give him six pence a pound; and they were perfectly safe, meaning that I might deal safely with him. Pearson came afterwards and I refused to buy any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was to share no profit in them - A. No. I thought he meant to say they were honestly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090050"></xptr>come by. His old iron business was managed by his wife; he left the shop in October.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder, and have known the prisoner five years, and frequently bought metal of him; he brought me copper several times in the course of the last year; there were plates among them; some of them were engraved</p>
               <p>"Dilitanti Society" I gave him seven pence half-penny, and eight pence half-penny a pound for them, which was the price of metal. I saw one before the Justice which corresponds with what he sold me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he sell you any in September - A. Yes; I believe he did not know what they were - I melted them as old copper. I had some of the same description last week, from a respectable house in Shoe-lane; when they are worn they become old copper, and it is impossible for a man not acquainted with engravings to know whether they are worn or not.</p>

            . I live in Ludgate-street. These plates belong to me, and Mr. Payne. I have the care of them; it is impossible to state their value. I bought half of them at Mr. White's sale, under an idea there would be a second volume of the work, and if so, they would be worth 1500 l. or 1000 l. I have no doubt but the common value of them is 200 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What becomes of worn-out plates - A. Many are scratched across, so as not to be used, and sent to the coppersmith, either by my clerk or myself. There are collectors who give much more than copper-smiths for them, but these are in a high state of preservation; and I think it impossible any one could suppose them worn out. I cannot say how the trade dispose of their plates.</p>

On the 21st of March, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I went up to my drawing-room - this clock then stood on a slab on the stair-case, and was not fixed. It was about twenty feet from the door, which was fastened, for I tried the door as I came out of the parlour, having lost two great coats from the passage shortly before. It has a spring lock, and cannot be opened outside but by force. I was alarmed soon after, and the clock was gone - I went and found the door ajar. I bought the clock of Captain Hall's executors, with the lease of the premises, three years ago, and gave ten guineas for it. Since it was stolen the maker's name has been erased, and a new top put on, and new handles; but I know it by the minute hand, which I had bent, and tried to straighten myself. I missed it on the 21st of March, and found it on the 15th of October.</p>

            . I am a clock-maker, and live in Bond-street. I know this clock; I made it myself for Captain Hall, in January, 1819 - he lived where the prosecutor now does. The handles are now altered, and Pettigrell and Duterell our names are erased, and that of Grant inserted; I can see where it has been scratched out, and the handles are new. Mr. Hall gave me fourteen guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You sell many clocks I suppose - A. Yes. I have a private mark on this now, by which I know that I made it. I do not think I have sold another one of this description; I may have made two, but not more, not in a mahogany case.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Roper's service. On the 21st of March, at ten minutes to nine o'clock, I went up stairs to put one of the children to bed, and saw the clock as I went up - I came down in twenty minutes, and it was gone. I had not been out of the front door that night, nor any of the servants.</p>

            . I live in Adam-street, and have known the prisoner since 1807; he was then a gentleman's servant, since which he has bought clothes and unredeemed pledges. On the Saturday week, before the 1st of July, he came to me, and said his things were going to be seized for rent, and asked if I would buy a clock, and knowing him so long, I said he might bring it on trial for a week, which he did in about ten minutes - the price was 7 l. 17 s., and on the 1st of July, he called; I said I would keep it, and paid him - he gave me a receipt - he said he bought it at Robinson's rooms, of a young man who was going from town.</p>

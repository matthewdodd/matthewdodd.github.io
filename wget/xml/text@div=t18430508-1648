                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Nott—he lives at an hotel in Oxford-street—on the 7th of May, I and my husband were going in a steam<lb></lb>boat from Hungerford pier to the Tunnel pier—there was a great rushing behind me—I felt a pull at my bag in which I had a purse and in it a half-sovereign—I turned and saw the prisoner take his hand out of my bag—he was close to me—I said, "What business have you to put your hand in my bag?"—he said, "I beg your pardon, you must be mistaken"—I said, "My purse is in your hand"—my purse was in his hand—I took him by the collar and called to my husband, and said, "This man has taken my purse"</p>

               <p>—I saw him put his hand down by his side, and under his coat—he was accompanied by a female and another man—the female was as close as possible to the prisoner.</p>

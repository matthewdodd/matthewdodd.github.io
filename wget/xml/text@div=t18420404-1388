                  </hi>. I am master of the West Ham Union Workhouse—the four prisoners were discharged from there on Thursday morning, the 24th of March—in consequence of circumstances, I went into the laundry on Friday morning, the 25th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, and missed from there three shirts, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief—I traced some footmarks over the back fence into the Infirmary-yard, and from there into the laundry—none of the articles were found—I gave information to the police—Allen was brought in in the afternoon—I ordered him to be locked up till we traced the footmarks—he made a statement about others, but nothing about himself.</p>

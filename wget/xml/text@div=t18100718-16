On the 7th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I returned home, and was in the act of sitting down in my parlour that adjoins my shop. I hear a crack at my shop window; I run out of the street door, I saw the window was broke; I saw two men run, I pursued them, calling out, stop thief; about ten minutes they got so far a head of me, and my being out of breath, I gave over the chace; then I came home and missed forty one handkerchiefs. On the next morning, I went to Mr. Matthews in the Minories, I found one of them pledged there for three shillings about half an hour after it was stolen; I gave information at the office, the officers told me they knew the men, and where the property was, they were playing at skittles every day, they could take them; I was afraid to go, this passed on.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen any more of the handkerchiefs since, except that one that you saw at Matthews's - A. Two handkerchiefs I have seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the handkerchiefs laying before you lost them - A. In the window, the pane of glass was cut as if with a diamond, in the shape of a half moon; the hole was large enough to reach their arm in, and take out the handkerchiefs.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the glass fallen in the shop - A. No, outside, the glass fell on the pavement, and gave the alarm; there were two lights in the shop, but when the window was broke the wind blew one of the lights out. It was a dark night.</p>

There was another man in the court where I live, it was very dark, I had every reason to believe it was Davis, but I am not sure. I am positive to the person of Piper. Here is one of the silk handkerchiefs I kept for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear that the prosecutor had been robbed - A. The next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been accused wrongfully more than once, both in London and in the country - A. Not in London, in the country, but I never was tried. In June, I was going over Blackfriars-road, a carman asked me to lend him a hand with some cotton, I gave him a lift up in the cart, and they came and took me to Guildford; the thieves run away. I did not undergo a trial there was no ground for the accusation.</p>

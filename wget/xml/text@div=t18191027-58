On the 16th of September, between eleven and one o'clock in the morning, I lost these handkerchiefs - I was not at home at the time. I went with Furzeman and found the prisoner, Watkins, in custody at the watch-house; he said he did not do it, but he knew who did. In consequence of what he said, I went in search of the boys, but did not then find them. I went to Mrs. Wasman's, in Vine-street, Chandos-street. I went up to the first floor, saw a woman there, and asked leave to search the house? She refused at first, because I had no warrant. I went to Bow-street for one, but the magistrate was gone; I returned and told the officer so. He applied to her a second time, and she said he might search, but we found nothing. About eight o'clock in the evening, the officer and I went to the one shilling gallery of the Cobourg Theatre, and there secured the other two prisoners.</p>

            . One Wednesday in September I was crossing from Drury-lane to Museum-street, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, opposite Mr. Manning's, and saw a little boy, standing with his back against a post, opposite his house - it rained very hard; he had no hat on. I walked a little further, and saw the prisoner, Watkins; he gave a whistle, and the little boy ran up to him - they both stood before me. Watkins said something to him, which I did not hear; the child said to him,</p>
               <p>"They have not been out." Watkins told the child to keep his post, and then the child went back to the post. Watkins kept a few paces before me, and whistled again, two boys, apparently of a height, came up to him. I left them talking together, went back to see what it all meant, and saw them round Mr. Manning's shop; I went in and told the shopman of it. The boys' backs were towards me - I do not know the other prisoners.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Manning. On Thursday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock, the last witness came to the shop, and gave me information. She went to the door, and pointed to Watkins, who was smoking a pipe and leaning on a post. She said our house was beset by that man, and some boys. I went into the shop, and asked Cheesewright, the shopman, if we had lost any thing? He immediately went to the window, and found a pane of glass cut out, and lying in the window as if it had been pushed in, and six silk handkerchiefs gone. The glass was safe when I opened the shop at seven o'clock in the morning - the handkerchiefs were of a chocolate colour.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHEESEWRIGHT. I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 16th of September I was in the adjoining shop when the information was given that the window was cut. I was called in, and found a piece of silk handkerchiefs gone, which I had put there that morning, exactly opposite the pane which was cut and pushed in - the glass had been newly put in; the handkerchiefs were not put two inches from the glass. I then went out, and observed Watkins at the opposite corner. His noticing us made me suspect him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 16th of September, I took Watkins about one o'clock, at Seven Dials, and asked him where he was at half-past eleven? he made no reply. I then asked him what he was doing at the corner of Museum-street? he said he was there - I took him to the watch-house. I fetched Mr. Manning to the watch-house, and in consequence of information which I had received from Watkins, I went in search of Collis and Margett. About a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon Cook came up to me, and in consequence of his information, Manning, myself, and him went to an iron-shop kept by Mrs. Wasman, and asked her if she had bought any handkerchiefs that morning? she said, No. I said,</p>

               <p>"Have the goodness to let me search, I have no warrant." - she refused. I sent Mr. Manning for a warrant, he returned in a quarter of an hour, she then let me search. I found nothing, nor did I expect it, for I had left her husband down stairs all the while. I then went to the Cobourg Theatre, and took the two other prisoners.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Rose-court, Crown-street, Soho - I know Collis and Margett. On Thursday morning, the 16th of September, about ten o'clock, or a little after, I was in Seven Dials with others; Collis and Margett came up with some things in a blue apron - they called two or three more lads away. Margett had something in a blue apron under his arm. He spoke to one of the young lads who stood there, and said he had seen Long Jerry (there is a constable whom they call by that name) - that Jerry was coming by them, looked very hard at them, and that he (Margett) said,</p>
               <p>"I must go and put this on, or my father will blow me up." They then went off to get breakfast, as they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was in the apron - A. Not then. I met them in Compton-street about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, they asked me where I was going? I said I was going home. They asked me to go with them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270032"></xptr>Chandos-street. They went up Long-acre into Angel-alley, and there shewed me the handkerchiefs - they took me into a necessary to shew them to me; there were five in one piece, and one by itself - they were chocolate-colour, and about a yard and a quarter square. They then began to run, and told me to run too, as they were in a hurry. They then went to Vine-street - Margett took them into an old iron-shop, kept by Mrs. Wasman. He staid there near a quarter of an hour, then came down, and said the lady only offered him 16 s. for the six. Collis said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it! we must not take that - we can get more by pledging them." Margett said,</p>
               <p>"We had better take it, or we shall get caught with them." He went up, and remained there about five minutes; he then came down and said she had given him 17 s. for the handkerchiefs, and one for himself to do what he liked with.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the money - A. Margett gave 8 s. 6 d. to Collis, who gave me 2 d.. I suspected they had stolen the handkerchiefs, and asked them if they had done so? they would not tell me for a long while, at last they said they had taken them out of a linen-draper's window, but did not say where - Margett then gave me 2 d. also. He went to a shop and got dinner, and Collis went and bought a hat in Broad-street, St. Giles's; they then left him, and Margett bought a pair of boots in Monmouth-street; he then went and bought two laces for his boots. A woman came up to Collis, and told him not to come near Seven Dials, for Watkins was taken - they then went away. Collis said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, that is right! - Watkins is taken up for us, and we shall get through it." One

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Union Court, Spitalfields—on 31st August, about eight o'clock, I was in Ratcliff Highway, and saw the prisoner and several others striking a female, with a baby in her arms—I said, "It is a scandalous shame; if you have any animosity don't hurt the infant," and I took the baby out of the woman's arms—the prisoner than seized me by the hair, and struck me on the head twice with some sharp instrument—I bled very much—one wound was on the right aide of the head, and the other on the back—I knew the prisoner by eyesight before—after she struck me she turned round to her companion and said, "She has got some money; we can go and. drink her health"—the companion said, "Whereabouts has she got it?"—she said, "In her front pocket"—the companion then tore my apron off me, and put her hand in my pocket, and took my money out, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—they tore the lining out of the pocket—somebody said, "You had better go away; here comes a policeman," and they all ran off—I only knew the prisoner and her companion—I had seen them together several times before—I made my way to the London Hospital, and had my wounds dressed—I afterwards gave information to the police, and they would not take her—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—about 9 o'clock on 31st August I examined the prosecutrix—she was covered with blood, and her clothes were very much torn—she had lost a good deal of blood—I examined her head, and found two wounds, which were evidently caused by the same instrument—I don't think it was a knife, it must have been some instrument that was jobbed in—they were punctured wounds, but the wounds were curved—the wounds were exactly alike—both reached to the bone—the bone was laid bare—she has been spitting blood she says for some weeks—I could not say that the wounds would cause that—she had signs of erysipelas—the wounds have healed now.</p>

This is all spite—I was never in the row at the time she was cut—I was at the "Melbourne Arms," and when I was coming home the two sisters met me and laid hold of me, and beat me, and tore my bonnet off, and their brother was there—the prosecutrix said, "Don't beat her any more; they have locked my companion Kate Regan up; I will lock her up, and say it was her that stabbed me."</p>

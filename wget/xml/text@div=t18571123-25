                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing jeweller, at No. 5, Dyer's Buildings, Holborn; I have manufacturing premises at Birmingham. The prisoner has been in my employment over three years—it was his duty to make sales of goods, and receive moneys for them—when he received money it was his duty first of all to enter it in a book, and give me a copy of it at the end of every month—he was either to pay the money away to my order, or remit it to me—there was an understanding that until it came to about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he might retain it in his hands, and when it came to that amount, he was to remit it to me through my bankers—that was to be done once a month—the average amount that he collected monthly was from 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—somewhere about 20th Oct., after something had passed between us, he furnished me with this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a statement of his deficiencies up to that date—this list does not contain the three sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has never accounted to me for those sums.</p>

               <p>pay me—I saw him on the Monday, and said, "What arrangement have you to propose?"—all he said was, "I have not seen my son"—I then gave him into custody—at the same time he handed me this corrected list—no particular date was fixed for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be remitted; he was to be allowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. commission beyond a certain amount, but that amount has never been realized, and therefore never claimed—I believe the prisoner has a large family—the apology he made for this matter was, that his daughter was ill, and was obliged to go into the Middlesex Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

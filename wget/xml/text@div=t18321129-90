            . I am a labourer to Mr. Flowers, at the Eel-pie house, Limehouse. On the 20th of September I went to Whitechapel, up Draper's yard; Dexter showed me the stable where the horse was, and then I saw the prisoner - I said, "Does this horse belong to you?" he said Yes - I asked the price; he said nine guineas - Johnson was in the stable: I said, "I can't sell it at that price, but if you will bring it to my master, at the Eel-pie house, I could sell it this afternoon for you;" he said he did not know the way - my brother said he would show him, and they came down together; I said to him, "Put the horse into the stable - I cannot go with you yet;" I afterwards went to Bow with them, and called at the Black Swan - they stopped there while I took the horse to Pepper's, and we went over to Mingay's; he offered 7l. - I returned to the prisoner, who refused to take it - I said, "Come along and make your own deal;" he went, and Mingay bought the horse for 7l. 15s.; I was to be paid for it at eight o'clock - the prisoner waited there till half-past eight, and by and by Pepper arrived, and it was paid for; the prisoner made his mark to the receipt, and Pepper said he would have"Warranted sound" written on it - as he could not write I wrote it, and the prisoner made his mark to it; I gave him the money - he gave me 5s. for my trouble; we had four or five pots of hock beer there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you did not bargain about it as your own? A. I tried to sell it as my own - the Magistrate did not threaten to commit me; I generally sell in my own name - when Mingay said he would bring the money at eight o'clock, I said, "Don't disappoint us, for this man will want his money;" he knew before the money was paid that it did not belong to me; I sold it as one I had exchanged - I wrote "Warranted sound" on the receipt, as the prisoner directed me; I do not know who wrote the rest of the receipt.</p>

I do not know who wrote the receipt; Mark Rogers brought it to me; I gave it him back, as"Warranted sound" was not written on it - he wrote that, and gave it to me; the prisoner was in the tap-room, and not in my sight; I did not see who put the mark to it -Rogers brought it to me in the bar; when I saw Robinson's name to it, I said, "Is this right?" and gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290047"></xptr>Flowes - he said, Oh Yes, it was all right he thought, but he knew nothing about it.</p>

             SKILLERN. I am an officer of Unionhall. On the 21st of October I went to Mingay's stable, and found a gelding, which Yalden's son claimed; it was delivered to him - I apprehended the prisoner the same day, in Bunhill-row, about five miles from Mingay's; I told him I wanted him - he wished to know what for; I told him for selling a stolen horse to Mr. Mingay, at Bow; he said he had bought the horse on the other side, or on this side of Farnham, and gave 6l. or 7l. for it - that he did not know the person he bought it of, and did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you acquainted with

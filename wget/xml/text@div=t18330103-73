On the 21st of December I placed a piece of linen across some other pieces on my counter, at a quarter-past seven o'clock; I went out for about five minutes, and then returned; I found the prisoner at the end of the shop, and a young girl near the door - I missed this linen, and inquired for it; my young man came from behind the counter, through a flap, and this piece dropped from the prisoner's person - I did not see it, but I heard it; I saw it on the floor, and my young man took it up; the flap had been raised to get to her, but the linen could not have been thrown down - the prisoner said she had not taken it- she was about five feet from the place where it had been; there were two other pieces on the counter - she had moved from where she stood while we were looking for the linen.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HODGKIN. I am in the prosecutor's service. On Friday evening, the 21st of December, the prisoner came into the shop - she asked for some ribbons, and produced a pattern which we could not match; she then asked for some calico, and then for some black stockings; I had to leave her to go to the window, and turned my back towards her - while I was doing that, she moved towards the cross-counter, where the linen was, and where the flap was; when Mr. Spooner came back, he asked what had become of the linen - I said I did not know; we began a search for it - I came through the flap, and heard the linen fall from the prisoner: I can undertake to say it did not fall from the counter - I picked it up near her feet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say I had never moved from the place? A. No - I said you moved about three feet nearer the counter where the linen was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that, after looking for some stockings, you found the prisoner in the same place you had left her in? A. No, I said I left her six feet from the counter, and when I returned, she was three feet nearer to the linen - this is my deposition - but she had removed three feet nearer the linen; when the alarm was given, she remained still in the same place.</p>

            . I live in Finsbury-street, and am a carpenter. I followed Mr. Spooner into the shop, and there was a search after the linen - I stood about a yard and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030043"></xptr>half behind the prisoner; I heard the linen fall, but did not see it till it fell on the floor - it fell close to her feet; she said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to purchase some articles - Mr. Spooner came in and went round the counter several times; there was a confusion, and something fell; he said I was going to steal this linen - I said I was not.</p>

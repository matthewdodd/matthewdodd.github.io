I did not see Scannell at that time, but I know that Ring struck me on the right eye - they then went on and went down Charles-street; I washed my eye at the pump, and went to a wine vaults, at Charing-cross, to inquire for an officer - I got Mr. Goddard, and we went after them to the Park - Scannell was taken there, but nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. A wine-cooper. I was quite close to Britton, and am quite certain he did not say he would fight any one of them; there was a fight with Britton, and I went up to assist him; I did not see Scannell at that time; I found him near the Horse Guards in the Park; I did not say he had taken a sovereign from me; I did not see him till I saw him in the Park.</p>

            . I was with Hill and another person, named Forrest; we had just passed the pump, where some young men were standing; I saw the prisoner among them; a young lad said to me, "Sir, there is some water on your coat;" I pulled it off, and the back was covered with water; he pointed Scannell out, as the one who did it; I said "Sir, what did you do that for?" he struck me in the mouth; Hill came up to take my part, but before he could look about him he was pulled down- I did not see Scannell at that instant, for some were on me, and some on Hill; I afterwards saw Hill lying on the ground; the two prisoners were upon him - I cannot say that I saw Ring, at that moment upon him, but he was in their company; as soon as they had knocked him down and took the money, Hill got up - he could not see out of one of his eyes, and his nose was bleeding - I had a white hat on, and they said "Fall on the man with the white hat on;" I retreated and they did not follow - we followed them at a little distance, and one of them used very bad language, and said "What are you going to do now?" I made no answer, but watched them; we followed them to some steps leading to St. James's Park - Goddard, the patrol, turned round the corner, and Forrest ran and told him - he followed them into the Park - they scattered and ran, and Scannell said "It is of no use- it is all over?" Goddard heard him say that, and took him. Ring was taken at his own house on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were there four of you when Scannell was taken? A. Yes; three of us and the officer. I am a saddle-tree-maker; I did not offer to fight any of them; Hill was near me, and he could very well see the boy who struck me; I took my own part, but they all came up to me, and fell upon me, before Hill got up; I did not strike them first, nor offer to fight Scannell; he had a yellow handkerchief on - there was nothing said about a sovereign - Hill did not say he had lost one; I did not see any money, but I heard it on the stones; it lasted about ten minutes; I never lost sight of Scannell - I followed him into the Park - they were walking in the Park, but they all ran and scattered - Scannell had been running but he gave himself up. I swear Scannell ran, and the officer saw him - this was near the canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw very little of Ring? A. No; I am sure he was of the party.</p>

            . I am a saddle-tree rivetter. I live at No. 15, Monmouth-street. I was with Britton and Hill - I heard a little boy come and tell Britton that some water was thrown on his coat - he pulled it off, and there was water all over it - he went up and asked which of them did it; one of them struck him on the mouth, but I cannot say which, because I was behind him; about thirteen of them fell upon him - Hill went up - five or six of them came away from Britton, and knocked him down - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140078"></xptr>saw Scannell put his hand into Hill's pocket, and turn it out - the money fell on the ground, and Scannell, Ring, and another person, picked it up; I was going to help them, but one of them said "Pitch upon the other with his watch," meaning me; I drew back, and went to see for an officer; when I came back they had all got up - Hill was all over blood; he said he had lost 7s.; we followed them as far as Charles-street; they kept walking in the road, and turning round, and swearing at us, and asked what we were going to do now; when we got to Charles-street we saw Goddard, and we pursued them into the Park, and took Scannell there - they were all standing in a cluster, but when they saw the officer they all scattered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Could you see the person who came up to Britton? A. No; not to identify him; I kept aloof - it lasted two or three minutes - there was a great confusion; we gave no alarm in the street, but we did in the Park.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw nothing more of Ring than his picking up the money? A. No; there were some small boys left standing round the pump.</p>

            . I am fourteen years of age. I was near the pump in Parliament-street - I saw the three witnesses walking, and thirteen or fourteen standing round the pump; Scannell had a mouthful of water, and he squirted it over Britton and Hill - Britton pulled off his coat to look at the water, and turned back to Scannell, to ask what he did it for - they made no reply, but formed a ring round him; Britton was then struck, and Hill went to assist him - he was knocked down, and they cried out"His pocket - his pocket;" Scannell put his hand into his pocket, pulled it inside out, and the money fell on the stones; there were some silver shillings; Scannell and two more stooped down to pick it up; I took notice of the prisoners but cannot swear to the other; Ring picked up some of the money - they all fought - I did not hear any challenging; Forrest was coming to assist Britton and Hill, and they cried out "His watch - his watch!" he then drew back; the others then got up, and Hill went to the pump to wash himself, as he was all over blood; I did not hear him say any thing about his money - the others then went away, and we followed them, and three or four of them asked what we were going to do; they turned down a street leading to St. James's Park, and Goddard came up - Forrest went and told him - he pursued them into the Park, and Scannell cried out "It is no use - it is no use;" and the officer took him; I went with Goddard on the Monday, and took Ring in Crown-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you been talking this matter over? A. No; I am sure I have not talked to the other persons about it; I was close by but I did not interfere; it lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I had never seen Scannell before; he was taken in about ten minutes after, near the cannon in the Park; he was not standing looking at the canal; I swear he ran; the officer could see him run. I swear the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you pick up any of the money? A. No, not 1s., nor the little boy's neither; it was only those belonging to the gang took it- there was nothing said about a sovereign in my hearing.</p>
               <p>HENRY GODDARD. I am an officer. I saw Forrest, and, in consequence of what he said, I went into the Park, where I saw Scannell, with a gang of twelve or thirteen persons; they turned round and saw me, and ran in different directions - I took Scannell then, and Ring the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not Scannell standing near the canal? A. No, he was going on, near the bomb, walking with the others; I did not hear any thing said about a sovereign; I saw them first in Charles-street; I swear they all ran - I overtook Scannell, and took him to the watch-house - nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who directed your attention to Scannell? A. Forrest and Britton - there were others mentioned, but I made Scannell the object of my pursuit - they were not within view at the time Forrest spoke to me; I asked who were the principal persons, and they pointed the prisoners out; they would not have known which way to have gone only I happened to see the gang running into the Park.</p>
               <p>SCANNELL'S Defence. I and Ring, and two or three more, stopped to get a drink of water - the prosecutor and two or three others passed, and one of the boys there threw some water, which happened to go on one of their coats - a little boy went and told him, and he turned back and asked who did it; the little boy pointed us out, and he struck one of the lads, and they all got fighting - we then went into the Park, and the prosecutor and his companious came up, and said we had a sovereign belonging to them; the officer then came and took me.</p>
               <p>RING'S Defence. I was coming from Millbank, and we stopped, and one of the boys took a mouthful of water, and squirted it over one of their coats; he turned back, and asked what they did it for, and one of them struck him; he then struck me, and my nose began to bleed - he struck me again, and I hit him in my own defence; the rest came up to assist him - the others struck them, and we all fell to the ground; we got up and walked into the Park; I was going towards home.</p>

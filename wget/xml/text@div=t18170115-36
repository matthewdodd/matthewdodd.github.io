               <p>JANE JEALOUS. I live in George-street. On the night of the 28th of December, I was at the coffee-shop, in <placeName id="t18170115-36-crimeloc181">George-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170115-36-crimeloc181" type="placeName" value="George-street"></interp>

Stanton, the deceased, came in with a girl soon after me; the prisoners came in soon after. There were more than twenty men, and five women in the room. Stanton called for some coffee, he pulled out his money, and paid for it, and said, if I lose this, somebody must starve. The two prisoners, and several others, took him away from where he was, and drove him into the corner; when he was in the corner, they set him in a chair. The prisoner, Downs, put his hands upon the deceased's mouth, he tried to get away, and Downs put his fore finger and thumb upon Stanton's throat, he kept them there some time, I should suppose ten minutes; and the persons around kept pushing: during that time, the prisoner, Walton, was putting his hands into the deceased's pockets, and gave something around amongst them; they were there about half an hour altogether; he was in the chair about a quarter of an hour, and it gave way, and he sunk in it. The landlord Besthall, then came, and sent them out. The two prisoners took Stanton and led him out; they had been in the corner some time before they put him in the chair. The deceased made a noise with his throat, as if he could not speak; after this Walton asked a boy, named George Graham, if he wanted any money, and told him not to say no, if he did; for he would let him have a dollar; he kept pulling money out, I could not see how much; about twenty minutes after, I went out of the house, by myself, and saw the deceased in the hands of four watchmen; he appeared dead: both the prisoners came into the coffee-room again, and the other men with them; they stopped there, and the four watchmen came in, and asked for the young man who had bathed the deceased's temples with vinegar; nobody answered; and the watchmen went away about a quarter of an hour after. The prisoners stopped there till four o'clock, and then went over to the Turk's Head public-house; I was there when they came in. About five o'clock the prisoner, Downs, went out for a short time, and came in again, and said he had been taken up on suspicion of the dead man, and let out on his own bail; and that he had to appear on the next day, and would swear hard and fast against the d-d b-g-r. Walton was present. The deceased gave Walton 2s. or 3s. when he paid for his coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Prisoner WALTON. Why did you not acquaint the coffee-shop man, or the watchman of it - A. If I had said any thing, one and all of them would have ill-used me. When the watchmen came, I beckoned to one of them to tell him, but he did not understand me; I did not tell the watchmen when I saw them with the deceased, because I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that Downs did not take hold of his throat, until he was in the chair - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that Downs took him by the throat, and threw him into the chair - A. I cannot say whether he pushed him in by his neck or his body; I did not hear the noise in his throat until he was led out at the door-he appeared as if he could not keep himself up; the prisoners supported him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the man was dead, when you was at the Turk's-head - A. I did. I did not drink with the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman; I had no lodging. On the 28th of December, I went to Besthall's coffee-shop, at a little after twelve o'clock; the two prisoners came in after me, with several more. The prisoner, Downs, first went up to Stanton. I did not take particular notice until he was in the corner: Walton was with him. Stanton was sitting in a chair, and Downs had his hand on his shoulders near his neck. Walton was rather more stooping; they were surrounded by persons. I was sitting in a box four yards from them.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was sitting down, how could you see them, as they were surrounded - A. I could see them; the chair broke with their restling: Besthall came up, hearing the chair break, and sent them out. The prisoners took the deceased towards the door, and the prisoner, Walton, pushed him out of doors; they did not come back till about twenty minutes after. I went out before they returned; when I returned, the two prisoners came into the shop. Downs said, there is a poor man dropped down dead, and I rubbed his temples with vinegar. Four watchmen came in to enquire for the young man who rubbed the deceased's temples with vinegar; as they wanted to know how it happened. Downs went and hid himself in the corner, he stooped down to conceal himself in a place, where the watchmen could not see him: he must have heard it. Nobody answered. The watchman said they did not want to take him, they only wanted to see him. I did not see Walton in the room at the time. At four o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners went over to the Turk's-head. I went too, nearly at the same time; I sat in the same box with them. There was a young man between me and Downs; one of the beadles came in, and stood with his back to the fire. Downs was laying with his head down, I pushed by him to get out, and he said, D-n you, sit still, do you want him to see me; his head was turned from the beadle. I got out at the other side, and left him in that posture, and left the house. I was afraid to tell the watchman, my life had been threatened.</p>
               <p>Court. He was thrust out at the door - A. I do not mean to say that he was dead at that time; I did not hear him make the noise.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, I live in George-street. I was in the coffee-shop at the time when Stanton came in; the two prisoners came in soon after; there were a great many men with them. I observed nothing till I heard the crush of the chair, I got up, and said, Oh! my G-d, they have killed the man. I went to the place, the men pushed me about, and said, d-n you, what is it to you. The prisoner's, Downs, arms were towards the neck of the deceased, and Walton had his hands towards his breeches; I did not see him take any thing out of his pocket, he drew his hand backward and forward. Besthall ordered them all out; the two prisoners laid hold of the deceased. They came back afterwards, and I heard Walton say, d-n it, deal fair. I could not see what they were about. Downs was very much agitated, his handkerchief was torn, and his waistcoat unbuttoned. The patrol came in, and asked for the man who had bathed the deceased's temples. Downs was laying his head down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DOWNS. Why did you not tell this at the time - A.I said, they have killed the man; and a man thrust me back, and said, d-n it, hold your tongue.</p>
               <p>Court. How near were you to the man when he was taken out - A. About four yards, the crowd was very great; I saw him lifted up in the middle of them. Downs was sitting down when the patrol came in, he did not change his place.</p>

            . I reside in George-street; on the 28th of December, I was at the coffee-shop, about twelve o'clock. I was sitting in a chair behind the door, and the prisoner, Downs, came up to me, with the deceased, and told me to get up and let him sit there; I got up, and Downs took him by the collar and set him down. The deceased staggered as if he was in liquor. I went away to the other end of the room, and nine or ten men surrounded the chair in which the deceased was put; I heard it crack. Besthall came, and said he would not let us be there any longer. The men all went out together, and the deceased was with them; the deceased staggered very much, he looked ill-he frightened me; I saw Downs with him. I remained in the shop till eight o'clock next morning; several men came back, the watchmen came and enquired for the man who had bathed the deceased's temples: nobody answered. I did not see any body move at the time.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. I apprehended the prisoner, Walton, I found him under the bed in the kitchen, at No. 7, Church-street, St. Giles's, on Sunday last.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the deceased about three o'clock in the morning of the 29th of December, he was quite dead, and nearly cold; there was an appearance about his face and neck, which indicated a determination of blood towards the head; the eye was very full, and had a livid appearance. I endeavoured to bleed him in the arms and temples, without effect: these symptoms would proceed from strangulation, or pressure of the throat.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person applied his thumb and finger to the necks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150016"></xptr>and he died of that, would it have that appearance - A. Most certainly. He appeared to me to have been a healthy man; the foaming would arise from apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after a man receiving a pinching in the throat, would he live - A. If it continued many minutes, he would have died directly. A man might walk across the street after such strangulation, but he would be in a very exhausted state. If the pinching at the throat had continued a quarter of an hour, he could not walk about. A person subject to a determination of blood in the head, is subject to apoplexy, and liquor would encourage it. I cannot say whether his death was occasioned by strangulation, or apoplexy. I did not discover any marks, the pressure would not leave marks. It is my opinion that it was apoplexy, arising from the pressure.</p>
               <p>DOWNS' Defence. I was in the coffee-shop, the other prisoner came in, we were talking together; a few minutes afterwards I heard that the decaesed man was laying down next door to Mr. Boilam's; I went out and told the watchmen, and I asked for some vinegar, and bathed the deceased's temples.</p>
               <p>WALTON'S Defence. I was in the coffee-shop with some young women, the deceased came in and had some coffee; soon after a number of men came round, and began talking with the deceased; one of the young women broke the chair, and I went to help the man out. After this the deceased came out, and went into an eating-house, and sat down by me; it is kept by Mr. Adams.</p>

I jumped up, to save myself, and broke it. The deceased was in another chair by my side, his chair was not broke. Walton was trying to get me out when I broke it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Jealous was in the room when I broke the chair. Walton did not send for me to be a witness here; I saw him on Saturday last.</p>

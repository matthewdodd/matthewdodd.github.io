               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was your apprentice, not your servant? A. Yes, my apprentice; this is a part of his indenture - I have the other part; it states that there were 4l. received by me, but this I received from the Drapers' Company; these receipts are for 10l. more, but that was under an agreement between his father and me; his father was to pay the expence of the binding; but he was very poor, and he said he had heard of a charity in the City which would grant me 4l.; I went to the hall, and told the gentleman I had received 10l., but he said I must say nothing about that, or the 4l. would not be allowed - but it made no difference in the stamps. I have received 14l.; I do not remember that the prisoner was told it would be better for him to confess: he was taken on the 20th of May; he said if I would forgive him he would do so no more.</p>

            . I was sent for to take the prisoner; I said his master charged him with robbing him of some silver - he denied having it; I said I should search him as naked as he was born; I was searching him, and this bag was round his neck; he said he was sorry for what he had done, and told his master where he had sold some before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anything said about confessing? A. He said he was very sorry; but he was not told if he would tell where he sold it, he should not be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. His master accused him of taking some silver before, he said he had, and had sold it in Broad-street, St. Giles's - he told me where, and I took a summons, and took the people, but he could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. EDGINTON. Q. I see this 5l. bill was due on the 19th of May - did you receive it the day before the prisoner was taken up? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He promised me forgiveness if I would confess; and his father came to the prison and said the same.</p>

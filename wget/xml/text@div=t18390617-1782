                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Bedfordbury. The prisoner attended on my wife in her illness—in May I had the misfortune to lose my wife—the prisoner rented a room in my house—she quitted about a week before this happened—I missed an umbrella on Sunday before the 10th of June—the prisoner denied all knowledge of it—I saw the coverlid and other things on her bed at the milk shop where she lived—I cannot say if the umbrella was safe on the 16th of May—we had it on the day of the funeral.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave this woman in charge as your servant, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I received a communication from the prisoner as a message from my wife as to where she had concealed some money—the prisoner said she knew it was there—it was I believe sixteen sovereigns—I recovered it by going to the place—my wife and her had been on good terms—the prisoner with her husband went to my wife's funeral, but I did not observe what gown she had on—there was a little shower—it was not very showery—the umbrella was not produced from her room, but from my parlour—I delivered it to my little girl—I do not re<lb></lb>collect any thing of a quarrel between the prisoner and me—her husband said his wife had made a charge of 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for six weeks' attendance on my wife—he wanted to get a sovereign from me—he made me deduct a sove<lb></lb>reign out of the rent—I intended to give her something—she attended on my wife five or six weeks occasionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said that all you wanted was your sovereign, and if you got that back you would be contented, and she should be discharged, only you were afraid of your recognizances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing like that—her husband brought a friend one night to make me say something or other, and brought a paper for me to sign, which I refused—I said I considered I was robbed of a sovereign—my wife had paid the prisoner half a crown a week for what she did—I had a quarrel with the prisoner about her child beating mine—I missed these things on the 9th of June, and my wife was buried before that—I do not know what the prisoner and her husband left my apartment for—I saw some part of their goods removed—I did not borrow a boy's shirt of the prisoner—I will not swear I have not got a shirt of hers at home now, or some towels and pillow-cases—I do not recollect that I said any thing about the prisoner's discharge—I was bound in a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bond to appear, and I could not afford to lose it.</p>

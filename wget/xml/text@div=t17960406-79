I sent her down to know what was the matter; she came up, and said she could make nobody hear; I bid her go up to the top of the house to a trap-door, and call the men together; it is a double house, they work in the next house, there is a communication; the man followed her down stairs, and said the house had been robbed, for they found some of my property as they came into the parlour; I did not look at the window, but at the pictures which were taken down, six of them; and a pair of spectacles that I left in a wine-glass were on the side-board, and the case on a harpsichord.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was this to the parlour that looks into Stationer's-court? - A. They are two houses, and there is a communication at the top, and at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What passage was the prisoner taken at? - A. At that which goes up to the printing-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Between one and two in the morning; I asked the prisoner what business he had there; he told me he had been at two or three clubs, or public-houses, I cannot say which, that he wanted to ease himself, and thought that a proper place; and made his way up this passage to go and ease himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door of this passage always open of a night? - A. It was till then.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible he could get into that house through that door? - A. Yes; he could not get into the dwelling-house that way, he might through the cellar; but he must have broke a large iron bar to get into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say the cellar-door was broke open? - A. No; when the bundle was found, I sent a person to see if the cellar was broke open, and it was not.</p>

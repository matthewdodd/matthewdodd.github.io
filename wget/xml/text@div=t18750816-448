                  </hi>*. I am a painter, and live at 31, Frederick Street, Caledonian Road—on Saturday morning last about two o'clock, I was crossing Barnsbury Road and saw the two prisoners and was knocked down by Cook, I caught hold of his leg and pulled him down—I rose up and we had a scuffle—they knocked me down a second time, and they tumbled me about, pulled me across the road, and kicked me on the eye—Cook put his hands in my pocket and took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Kellard felt me all about the body as I was on the ground—they then left me—I met the sergeant and told him I had been knocked down; I had been drinking, but was not drunk, I was quite capable of knowing what I was about—I saw the prisoners in custody about twenty minutes afterwards.</p>

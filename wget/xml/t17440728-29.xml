               <p>N. B. The stature says, if any person within his Majesty's dominions shall marry another wife, his former wife being alive, shall be guilty of felony. Then it is provided, that this act shall not extend to those who shall be beyond the seas for seven years together, or who whether husband or wife shall absent themselves from one another for the space of seven years, one of the persons not knowing the other to be living at the same time.</p>
               <p>Taylsworth. And please you, my Lord, they knew one another were alive very well; Mr. Elgar was a drover, they met together and saw one another.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in Burton's house? - No, I was not; about six in the evening I was in Rolls-buildings, I was coming out of my father's house, which is nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - I observed two men outside of the rails, and the window open of Mr. Burton's house, the prisoner at the bar was in the parlour; on which I went over the way, and as soon as I went over, one of them went off; the other stopped outside of the rails; I asked them what business they had to do there? on which the prisoner at the bar came to the window, and shewed himself to me; on which I asked the prisoner who he was? he said he belonged to the house, and if I did not get out of the way, he would jump over me; on that he came up, and said, now you see who I am, I belong to the house; I told him it was very well if he did belong to the house, but I insisted on his going into the house; on which he went up to the other man, and drew a stick from the other man, which he had under his coat, and aimed a blow at me with the stick; on which I got into the middle of the road, and evaded the blow, and called out, stop thief! and he ran off, and I pursued him into White's-alley; he was out of my sight at the corner, but I see him again before he got to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him running? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken? - Yes, he was taken in a minute after he ran off, within a hundred yards from the place.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140089"></xptr>Q. Was he taken while he was running? - Yes, he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - Yes, very sure, he poked his face almost up to mine when he jumped out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - About six o'clock last night.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no remains of day light? - No, I don't think there was, it was near night.</p>

               <p>Q. What account did he give of himself? - The moment he was stopped, he asked me what I had to do with him? I told him that there was a cry of stop thief, and I suspected him to be the person; immediately this person came up to me and secured him.</p>

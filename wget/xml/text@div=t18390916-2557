                  </hi>. I am a footman, out of a situation, and live in Chapel-street, Islington. On the evening of the 16th of August I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> is Goswell-street, to take some luggage belonging to my wife—I returned in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Goswell-street—two persons came up to me when I got out, and asked if I had lost any thing, and I missed a silk handkerchief which was safe before I took the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, a cheesemonger, in Goswell-street. On the evening of the 16th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, I was outside the shop, cleaning the window—the prosecutor was on a visit at our house—he called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the door, and put a bed into it—I saw the prisoner two or three yards from him, while the prosecutor was agreeing with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man about the fare—he was very busy about the prosecutor for some time—I then saw him put his hand into the pocket, and take the handkerchief out, put it in his breast, and run up the court—the prosecutor got on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> directly, and drove off—he returned in about twenty minutes, with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told him of his loss, and information was given to the policeman next morning—the prisoner was brought to me on Saturday afternoon, and I identified him as the man—I am certain of him—I have often seen him near the shop.</p>

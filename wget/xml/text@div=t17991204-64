               <p>Q. Was that lot afterwards missing? - A. It was; I heard nothing of that article till I saw it at Bow-street, upon the apprehension of these men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do a pretty considerable deal of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a considerable deal of hurry in doing that business too? - A.Rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing unsual that mistakes have happened of the sort we are now talking of? - A. It is very possible.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not less likely that the goods amounting to a guinea and a half, and the other amounting to a guinea and a half, the sum being the same? - A. Very unlikely.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it uncommon for persons to purchase in another name than their own? - A. It is not unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. This Major Crump did not give in the whole of his name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had been persons frequenting your sales? - A. Yes, About in particular; they had purchased a great many things at our sales, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. A mistake never happened with them before? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 9th of October? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have seen them at sales since that? - A. Yes, once I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing? - A. I think they did.</p>
               <p>Q. And paid for it? - A. They always paid for what they bought.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount do you think they had purchased? - A. Pretty considerably at different sales; they have bought of me, of my brother, and they have bought of my nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. And they have always paid fairly and honestly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that you thought it was very likely to be a mistake? - A. I said, it was possible a mistake might have happened in the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles purchased by Mr. George, was the knife-case containing knives and forks; and the articles they purchased were knife-cases? - A. Yes; after an article is sold, they are left in the room till they are called for; the knife-cases all stood together.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be very possible that even the porter might have delivered it by mistake? - A. I think not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Robins; the prisoner Abbot, came on the 10th of October, for the lots he had purchased; I looked them together, and placed the four knife-cases by themselves upon the table; he said, he could not take them with him then; we had a sale in the other room that day, and he went to attend the sale in the next room; and I saw the other prisoner, Tanner, in the next room, at the time Mr. Robins was felling; he said, he wanted to take them away; I then took the keys of the ware-room, and he went with me, I could not stay any longer; he said, Tanner was gone for a coach, I left him in the room; when I thought there had been time enough for a coach to be called, I went into the room again; I found Abbott there and the goods were removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember if there was any mark upon the lot that Mr. George bought? - A. Yes; it was marked with chalk, lot 203; he went away, and I locked the door; a few days afterwards, Mr. George enquired for his lot, and I could not find it any where; a few days after he came to our sale-room; I asked him if he had taken the knife-case away in a mistake; he said, he believed not, but the knife-cases that he had taken away, he had sold to Tanner; he said he would enquire of Tanner about it; I saw him again afterwards, and he told me he had enquired of Tanner, and that he had not got the lot marked 203; I had given him the number of the lot upon a piece of paper; I believe I saw him as much as three or four times, or more, after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after was it that he was taken to Bow-street? - A. I should suppose a month, or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first spoke to the prisoner, Abbott, the other prisoner was not in company with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After these things had been missed, Abbott came several times to the auction room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The two prisoners did not lodge together at this time? - A. He said he had sold them to Tanner.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken into custody, he was taken to his father's house? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never attempted to take him into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had spoke to Tanner, and Tanner told him he had not got it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other knife-cases in the room besides? - A. Yes, there was one other, containing knives and forks, which he purchased the day that he came to fetch the others away.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are upon sale, you open the head, and shew the articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they are sold, you put down the head, and put them away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you if you can tell, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040050"></xptr>it is shut down, whether it is full or empty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY-ELIZABETH COLLINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in the same house with the prisoners; it is Abbott's father's house; Tanner lived with Abbott; I came to live there about five weeks ago, and they lived there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember their coming home in a backney coach together? - A. Yes, once they did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they bring with them? - A. I believe two waistcoat-pieces that they had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any knife-cases in that house? - A. Yes; I saw some up stairs in Mr. Abbott's room; Mr. Tanner slept with him in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who brought these knife-cases into the room? - A. No, they were not brought there while I was there; the knife-cases were all laid up in a corner, and their dirty cloaths laid at the top of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Abbott was living in the house with his father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Tanner was acquainted with him, and lodged in that room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the coach came, you are sure no knife-cases came then, but waistcoat-pieces? - A. I saw no knife-cases then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any chalk upon these knife-cases? - A. I did not look at them.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the patroles of Bow-street: I apprehended the two prisoners on the 17th of November; Tanner was brought to my lodgings by a master tailor, and I took him into custody; I afterwards went to Abbott's lodgings, in Nell Gwynn's-buildings, Battle-bridge; and there I found this knife-case, and five more; (produces it;) it is marked at the back, 203.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The mark still remained at the back of it, though it was four or five weeks after the sale? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robins. This is the lot that was sold to Mr. George; there has been one desert-knife put into it to make the set complete.</p>
               <p>Tanner's defence. I never had an intention to defraud Mr. Robins of his property; if they were taken away, it was a complete mistake.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Abbott left his defence to his counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Tanner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

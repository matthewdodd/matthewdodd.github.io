I am a milliner, and live in New Bond-street—the prisoner was in my employ—I sent her away—I received in<lb></lb>formation, and gave her into custody on the last day of May—I afterwards went to the station and saw her—she told me if I would go with her to her house she would give me my property—I went with her and the in<lb></lb>spector to Hastings's-street—she produced several boxes, and showed me a muslin cape, a lace collar, nine or ten flowers, and some other things, which are mine.</p>

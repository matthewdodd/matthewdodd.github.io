                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Prior, who lives at Crickle-wood, near Kilburn, in the parish of Hendon; we keep a house there. On the night of the 26th of August, I went to bed—I was not the last person up, but I fastened the doors and windows about ten o'clock—we have a bar to the back door, and the shutters were barred and bolted—I was not disturbed in the night—I got up next morning about half-past five o'clock—I was the first person up—It was day light then—I went into the back kitchen and found the shutter taken down, and laid down in the back house, the window wide open, and the door also—the shutter had been cut, and a hand put in to remove the catch of the window, and pull it down—I found the parlour all in confusion—I missed five shirts, (two were made, and there unmade), a pair of stays, a silver spoon, a pair of woman's, and two pairs of men's shoes—I had seen all the things over<lb></lb>night, in the drawers, except the shirts, which were on a horse in the kitchen—I never saw the prisoner till he was at the office—I saw part of my things again at nine o'clock that morning at a public-house, in the presence of the horse-patrol—there were three pairs of shoes and three shirts—I knew them again.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with Mr. Bonnet, a farmer, opposite Mr. Prior's On the morning of the 27th of August I was called by master to go into the field, at about half-past eight o'clock—there is a road across the field—I saw the prisoner in the field—I came up to him, and asked him where he was going—he said, "To London"—I said, "This is not the way to London"—he said he did not know his way, and he taught there was a way there—he had got a basket—I asked him what he had got in his basket—he said, "A pair of shoes"—my master came up at the time, he said he had a pair of shoes in his basket, and he said a bundle of rags as well—he mentioned the shoes first—my master came up and pulled the basket on one side, and I could see a pair of shoes and a bundle in it—my</p>

               <p>master said by the shoes he had in his basket he had got a girl, as they were women's shoes—he made no reply—I then directed him to the main road—he was not in the way to London, he was not in any road—I knew of this robbery at that time, and went to Mr. Prior's, and learnt what had been lost—I then went after him—I followed him up a lane leading to Hampstead—I saw him again, and was certain he was the same man—when I came within sight of him he ran and I after him, for about 200 or 300 yards—he then got over a gate—I tumbled over the gate in getting over, and lost sight of him for a moment—but on searching the didch I found him concealed under a lot of briers and brambles, quite out of sight, in about ten minutes—I said, "Come out"—he said, "What do you want of me?"—I got him out, and kept him, and by the assistance of some neighbours gave him in charge of the horse-patrol—I found this basket in the ditch with him—It contains the same things now as when I found it.</p>

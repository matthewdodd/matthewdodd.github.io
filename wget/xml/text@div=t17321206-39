I came home about seven in the Evening, and saw a Man turn into the Court just before me; but seeing me go up after him, he turned back. I went in, and found the Window of my Warehouse (which is on a Ground Floor) open, I knock'd at the Door, look'd in at the Window, and saw a parcel of Goods piled up ready to be carried off. Looking farther, I saw the Prisoner in the Room, there is a Lamp faces the Window, I am sure it was he. As soon as he found I saw him, he said, Damn ye, if ye don't desist and go off, I'll shoot ye. He stept up to the Window, in order to get out, I laid hold of him there, and pulled him down; he gave a spring to get from me, but I held him fast; and after a small Struggle on the Ground, he surrender'd, and begged me to let him go. I cr'ed out Thieves; my Wife and Maid came to the Door, and the Neighbours came to my Assistance. One of them went for a Constable, and I did not let the Prisoner go till the Constable came; and yet when he was carried before Sir

            , he denied that he was the Man. After he was secured, I found that a Pane of Glass had been taken out of the Casement, and so it was unhasp'd. And he had broke 10 or 12 other Panes with struggling, when I pull'd him out of the Window.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your Window shut after it was dark ?</p>
               <p>Fry. My Wife and Maid will give an Account of that, for I went out at Exchange Time, and did not return till about 7. I had Shutters belonging to that Window, but my Wife having lately lain in, her Maid going away that Evening, and a new Maid coming, the Shutters were left unshut till I came; none of my Goods were carried off, but were only moved from the Shelves to the Window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you no Servants that might mislay these Goods. Fry. I left the Key with my Wife. Prisoner. Did any Body but your selfsee when you laid hold on me first? Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fry. My Spouse knocked and cried Thieves. I was frighted, and came down, and when I opened the Door, he had the Prisoner by the Collar; he begg'd my Husband to let him go, or to go with him to a Tavern, for he said he had taken nothing. I saw the Casement shut half an hour past 6, when I came down to let my new Maid in. The Key of the Warehouse was left with me, I left the Goods in their proper Place on the Shelves at half an Hour past 4 that same afternoon; I double lock'd the Door, and it was not open'd again till after the Prisoner was taken, and then I went in, and found several Parcels remov'd from the Shelves to the Window, ready to be carried away. The Window Board was made like a Table, to turn up and down for shewing Goods; there was 5 Sagathys of 30 Yards each, 4 Serges, 4 Duroys, of 24 Yards each, and 1 Kersey, besides another Kersey that lay upon the Ground, which I suppose the Prisoner dropt upon his being surpriz'd.</p>

            . I came to Mr. Fry's Service December first, in the Evening, the Porter who brought my Box, set it down at the Door and went away. There being a Lamp, I looked at the Window, and saw it was safe. My Mistress let me in, and I went directly up Stairs, and look'd at the Clock, and it was half an Hour past 6; before it struck 7, my Master knock'd, and cried Thieves! My Mistress and I went down, and saw my Master have the Prisoner by the Collar. The Casement was open, and a Pane of Glass taken out of it near the Hasp; so that a Man might put his Hand through and unhasp it, and each Side of the Window was likewise broke. There were Lights brought into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060019"></xptr> Court; I saw the Prisoner plainly, and am positive he's the Man, for my Master held him, I believe, one fourth of an Hour, till the Constable came, and I stay'd all the while; I would not swear it if I was not certain, for this is the first Oath I ever took.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to observe the Window when you first came?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What Apparel had I on? Wilson. I think it was a brownish Suit; you had not that great Coat you have now, nor that Wig. It was not so good a Wig, nor quite so light.</p>
               <p>Calch Lane. I was called to assist Mr. Fry, who had taken a Thief. I called my Man too, and then went my self for a Constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Apparel had I?</p>
               <p>Lane. A darkish Coat with a Boot Sleeve, but no great Coat; and you had, I think, a darkish Wig.</p>
               <p>Pris. The Maid says it was a light Wig.</p>
               <p>Court. She said it was not so light as that you have on now. But however, as their Evidence seems a little to vary as to that Particular, the Court will take notice of it to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Knight. Yes, I took a Candle, and look'd in at the Window (which was open) and saw several Pieces of Sagathy, Serge Duroy and Kersey lying on the Window Board, and the Print of a Man's Foot that was wet. There were 7 or 8 Panes of Glass broke, and one Pane was taken out of the Casement. As Mr. Fry held the Prisoner, the Prisoner said to him, Sir, whatever Damage I have done I will pay you for. And Mr. Fry said, I don't know what Damage is done yet, because I don't know what is missing, but the Windows are broke. The Prisoner offered to pay for them, and desired Mr. Fry to go with him to a Tavern, or into his own Warehouse, but Mr. Fry refused till the Constable came, my Master being gone to fetch him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been drinking at the three Mariners in Coloman-street, and having occasion to ease my self, I went under the Arch; while I was there, two Men came out of the Court, and run by me. The Prosecutor then past me, and went up the Court; and returning presently asked me what I did there? I told him I was easing my self. Says he, my Warehouse is robb'd, and I suppose you are he that did it; but however, I'll keep you till you give a good Account of your self. I told him, I would do that willingly, I have a Witness in Court that was by at the same Time.</p>

And the Man said, My Window is open, and I believe you broke it; but whether you did or did not, I'll hold you till you give a Character of your self.

               <p>Mr. Fry. I neither said these Words, nor any thing of that Nature, for I took the Prisoner in my Warehouse. He offered to give me half a Guinea for breaking my Windows, and said, if I'd go to a Tavern, or take Coach with him to the other End of the Town, he would make me any Satisfaction.

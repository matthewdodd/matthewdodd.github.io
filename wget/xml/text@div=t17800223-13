The hat appeared to have been taken off his head in a joke, and he put his own hat on the prisoner's head and had walked about the room and cried out how fine I look in this hat! When the man came and enquired after his hat, with some difficulty the prisoner returned it. There was not any evidence to trace the watch to the hands of the prisoner. Some bad women were in the house. The watch was found in the possession of a woman who admitted in evidence, that she disposed of it, and said she had received it from the prisoner. It appeared she had been tried for felony and convicted, so was not in law a competent witness.)</p>

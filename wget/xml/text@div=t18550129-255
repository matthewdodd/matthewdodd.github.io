                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Foy, who keeps the Ship, at Shadwell. On 15th Jan., I saw the prisoners—they had been drinking in our house for two or three hours—Clancy asked for a glass of whiskey—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till—there was no other shilling there, only sixpences—Hogden was standing there at the time—after that, Clancy called for a pot of beer—he gave me another shilling—I put that in the till—I sent my daughter out with one of the shillings—she brought it back—I found it was bad—I then looked at the other shilling, and that was bad—I told Clancy he had given me two bad shillings—he smiled, and said he did not think he had done it—I sent for a constable, and gave him the two shillings.</p>

On the 2nd of February, I let a ready-furnished lodging to the prisoner - she ran away at eight o'clock in the morning on the 5th of February; the articles stated were let to her with the lodgings - she passed as a married woman, but at the watch-house she said she was not married - she gave me no notice: her husband came down the morning she left, and told me his wife had robbed me of a blanket - I went and looked, and missed the sheet and blanket likewise; he went after her; she came to me on the Friday evening following, and said she had pawned them, and would redeem them, and bring them back - I said, I did not wish to hurt her; I believed then that she was married, but when at the watch-house she said she was not married, and could not take the man's name - she put down Mary Ann Smith there.</p>

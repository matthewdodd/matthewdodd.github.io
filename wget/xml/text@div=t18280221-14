            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 9th of February, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I was on duty in Coventry-street; I heard a scream from a female voice - I stopped, and saw the prosecutrix coming out of the shop, holding her hands up; I saw the prisoner running out of the shop door, with the show-glass in his hand, and the prosecutrix after him: I crossed over, and when I got within about five yards of the prisoner, I saw him throw the show-glass down on the pavement, six or eight yards from the house; Billings, my partner, pursued him, while I picked it up - he was taken about forty yards off; he got out of my sight, but I am positive he is the man: we went to the shop, and the prosecutor came home - the glass contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

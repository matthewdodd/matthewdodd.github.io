On 10th September I was on duty at the station when the prisoners were brought there—they were placed in separate cells; but at the latter part of the evening a woman, who was drunk, was placed in Watson's cell—after that, at 9.30, Harris cried out "Boyce" twice, and said "We are strangers, mind; we don't know one another"—she said "What has come of Tom and Dick?"—he said "They are all right, surely someone will go to the house and get their box away before these b—y sods go there"—she said "Yes, by God, someone will go to the house and turn the place over before they get there"—he said "Good night; we are strangers"—I made this memorandum of the conver<lb></lb>sion at 10.30.</p>

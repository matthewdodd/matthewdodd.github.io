                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I shipped on board an English ship, the <hi rend="italic">Affghan</hi>, from Calcutta to China. and from China to this country; I was <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>; next under the Serang—the Serang was the head of our men—I was above the other men, and the Serang was above me—there were English sailors on board; there were three boys, and the prisoner, and another officer, and the captain, besides the coloured men—Rahmet Alli was on board—he was a Lascar, a common sailor—he joined the ship at Calcutta—I remember something happening on board the ship—I do sot exactly know the name of the month—I remember going to the police office here—it was rather better than a month before that, about a month before we reached England—the ship was then at sea—it was after we left St. Helena—at that time Rahmet Alli and others were engaged in pulling a rope called the main tack—it is a rope with which they pull the mainsail aft—I was on the rigging—Rahmet Alli was on the deck, pulling the rope on the right side—the prisoner was on the rail of the ship, on the side—while they were pulling, the rope broke—the prisoner said to Rahmet Alli, "Bring another rope"—Rahmet Alli did not know any English—he stood still, end the prisoner jumped down from the rail, and struck him under his neck with his fist, and he fell down with the first blow—there was a block of wood on the deck, on which the carpenter used to work—when Rahmet Alli fell, his head fell against the edge of the main hatch, and his back on the block—the block was not quite a foot high—while Rahmet Alli was lying down, the prisoner stood over him, one foot on each side of him, and began to beat him with his fists, and to kick him—he hit him with his fists on both sides of his face, and kicked him with his foot on the sides and the chest—he hit him about eight or nine times, in the face—they were very hard blows—I did not keep account of how many times he kicked him; perhaps ten or twelve times—they were very violent kicks, so that he could not speak afterwards—the mate had boots on at the time, and while he was kicking him, Rahmet Alli was crying out, "He has killed me, he has killed me!"—I came down from the rigging after the beating was over; Jetoo was with me on the rigging, and he and I lifted up Rahmet Alli, and carried him to the forecastle, and a boy gave us some assistance—Rahmet Alli was not able to speak; he was quite in a helpless state—I next saw him in the evening—he was lying still in the forecastle, not speaking—Hegot the beating about two o'clock one day—the next day, past 2 o'clock, was one day; and the following morning, at 4 o'clock, he died—I did not see him die—I came in, and saw him dead—I examined his body—it was quite swollen—as he was entirely swollen, I could not easily distinguish any marks on his body—I observed his hips and sides—they were swollen, and there were some marks which were black—he was not a very dark man—not so dark as me—I am very dark—there were black marks on his hips, chest, sides, and face—they were bruises, not cuts</p>

               <p>—I saw blood coming out of his nose after he was dead—when it was day-light, the captain gave orders, and we tied him up, and threw him into the sea—before this beating, he was in a healthy state, working in the tops—he had been accustomed to go aloft; he had messed with the Serang—he and I had slept in different places—I had associated with him—we were all together, coming from one country—he did no work after the beating—he remained lying in the forecastle all the time after the beating, till his death.</p>

Q.</hi> Any blow might cause an injury dangerous to life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; or any fall, or a shaking of the brain—blotches might arise from poverty of blood—I believe these people are not very clean—change from climate to climate would cause death in some cases. I cannot tell how long this person had the scurvy.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Affghan</hi>, and I have been so about sixteen months and a half; I have been sixteen or seventeen years master of a ship, and before that I filled a subordinate capacity. The ship <hi rend="italic">Affghan</hi> went from Liverpool to Calcutta—when I got there I was short of hands, several of my men left me—I was obliged to hire other hands; I hired twenty-four Lascars—I saw the whole of them sign these articles—from Calcutta I went to Singapore and Hong Kong—twelve of the Lascars deserted in Shang Hai—it is a common thing for these men to desert in Shanghai; wages there are very high, and sailors difficult to obtain, so that they often desert—the other men did not desert; I set a watch to prevent them from deserting—I believe the whole of them made attempts to desert—I am not aware that there had been any ill treatment of any of these men up to that time—when I found these men attempted to desert, I made application to the British Consul—I made a complaint to him, and the matter was investigated; my complaint was heard, and their answer; and the result was they were put in prison till the ship was ready to sail, and they were sent on board under a guard—the chief officer kept the log, but I kept the official log—these men behaved pretty well; they are very active in warm weather, but slothful in cold weather—a person came on board, called the Serang; he joined at Calcutta—he had the management of the coloured men—he was one of the twelve who were put in prison—there was another man, called Sumshere, the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>—he generally carried a piece of rope round his waist, with a knot to it, to start the men an end when they were lazy, and there was any particular work to do—I have seen him do that frequently; I have occasionally told him to do it—the orders are generally given through the Serang; I have sometimes given orders to the Serang, and sometimes to the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>—I have never committed any act of violence to them; I state that on my deliberate oath—I knew the deceased; he was ill about six days before he died—I saw him from time to time during the whole of that time up to the time of his death—I really cannot say what was the matter with him—I was under the impression that he was labouring under secondary symptoms of the venereal disease; his mouth was sore, and the whole of his head was swollen—there were no marks about him that I saw—he was sensible up to his death, at least, up to the evening before his death—he died in the middle watch, on 8th Feb., 15° 20' N. latitude, and 33° 20' W. longitude; it was very wet—I have an entry of the whole (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>:—"On 2nd July, Rahmet Alli and two others sick; at their own request, gave them a dose of castor oil. (There is a difficulty about getting these men to take medicine, I have had to force them to it; my intention was to give them a dose of salts, but they requested to have castor oil.) On the 3rd, the above men complaining of pains all over, T gave them soap liniment and a dose of salts: on the 4th, they still complaining, ordered them to bathe their feet in hot salt water, they declining to take medicine; on the 5th, the above men sick, gave them soap liniment; on the 6th, the above men sick, gave them a dose of castor oil; on the 7th, two of the men a little better. Rahmet Alli came aft to see if the master could do anything for him; his head was much swollen—gave him a dose of castor oil and vinegar. On 8th Feb., 2 a.m., Rahmet Alli, Lascar seaman, was found dead on deck; the Serang reported that he got up to go on deck, and on returning he fell down dead at the forecastle door; he had lost no flesh; he looked as full of flesh as when alive. He was interred by</p>

               <p>his own shipmates, according to their own religion.") Those entries were all made at the time—there was a complaint made to me about two days before this man died; the man himself complained that the chief officer, and also the second officer, had ill used him—I made inquiries into it at the time—I am quite sure that the man himself came and complained to me, and I called the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi> and investigated the matter—the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi> I used as an interpreter; he understood the English language perfectly, and could speak it perfectly—I was particular in Calcutta. I requested the shipper of these men to ship me a <hi rend="italic">Tindall</hi> that understood the English language, as my officers did not understand the Bengalee.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

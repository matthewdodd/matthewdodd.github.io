               <p>WILLIAM ELLIOT. I am the son of the prosecutor. On the 13th of December, the prisoner came to the kitchen several times for water-when she came out of the kitchen the second time she had something bulky in her apron.</p>
               <p>ESTHER ELLIOT. I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 13th of December we lost the fowls-at night the prisoner borrowed a large saucepan of me - She said it was to boil a large piece of pork and greens-this made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140050"></xptr>me suspect her. About her dinner-time (twelve o'clock), I went up, and told her I wanted my sancepan, and I would lend her another. Her husband said I should not stop her pot from boiling. She said I only wanted to see what was in the pot. I said,</p>
               <p>"if there is nothing there that you are ashamed of, why do you object?" Her husband asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him he knew I had. I sat there sometime, and said I would dine with them - They said I should have none of their dinner. I said I would see them eat. I stopped there two hours. At last she took the pot off, and emptied it into the slop-pail in the cupboard - They were two fowls; there was no pork. Her husband said he did not know how she got them. They began eating them, saying, if they were to go prison they would go with their bellies full. I gave them in charge. We found some feathers in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHT. I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge. She said she bought the fowls at Charing-cross for 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of a higler.</p>

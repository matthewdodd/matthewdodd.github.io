                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and live in the Isle of Wight—I am a trustee under Salterns bankruptcy—after my appointment on 22nd June, 1878, I went into possession of the Queen's Hotel, and held it for a month or six weeks—I was then served with an order in Crawcour v. Salter, under the Court of Chancery, and retired about 25th to 28th July, 1878—I took proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court, Ryde, and was subse<lb></lb>quently served with a writ in the action; I was made a party—the action was tried before Vice-Chancellor Malins on 8th, 12th, 14th, and 17th April—I saw the defendant sworn by the Registrar—the bill of sale was put into his hand, and he said that it was signed by all the parties in his presence,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030010"></xptr>
               <p>and that it was his signature appended to the affidavit in support of it—he was asked several times by Vice-Chancellor Malins whether he saw it signed, and whether he was the attesting witness, and he persisted in saying that he was—the result was that this decree (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was receiver before I was trustee—I was appointed on June 5th, 1878, the day they were adjudicated bankrupt—Mr. Urry, of Ventnor, the solicitor to the petitioning creditors, applied to me to become receiver—the whole of the unpaid-for furniture, value 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, was to be distributed among the general creditors; the Vice-Chancellor said that it was part of the assets—that is what the controversy was about—Messrs. Crawcour maintained their right to have their goods which had not been paid for—this prosecution was instituted by me, at the desire of all the creditors—I cannot tell you whether that is in writing, that is between them and their solicitor—no communication in writing came to me—Mr. Urry, of Ventnor, gave me verbal authority in my office, that I positively swear—I did not know till February last that the prisoner was alleged to have sworn that he saw the deed executed—I believe the Vice-Chancellor said that he considered me a very litigious person—I have not paid all the cost of these proceedings, but I have paid many hundreds of pounds, and in order to intimidate me an execution was put into my house by Hickson, Ward, and Co., the prime movers in this case—we wore going to prosecute for perjury before the case came on before Vice-Chancellor Malins, but under the advice of our solicitor, Mr. Urry, we did not—that was in February last—the question of whether the defendant was present or not was raised by the Vice-Chancellor, who said that he would have it tried by a jury if it was pertinent to the case—we decided to have the defendant prosecuted before it came before the Vice-Chancellor—I was not in Court when the Vice-Chancellor delivered judgment, I was in the Isle of Wight—I read it, but I did not know then, nor did I hear, that the Vice-Chancellor had come to the conclusion that the defendant was right—it did not occur to me that the Jury who tried him would not have the advantage of hearing him, that his mouth would be closed—it is the first case of the kind I have been in—I did not know that he might not be examined—I heard Mr. Salter examined before the County Court Judge at Ryde—I did not tell the Vice-Chancellor that I had an indemnity—I believe I named Ind, Coope, and Co., of Burton-upon-Trent, among the creditors, but I named twenty others—I knew that there was a bill of sale eight or nine days after I was appointed receiver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Newport, Isle of Wight—I acted as solicitor to Mr. Salter—on 7th January I went to the Queen's Hotel, Ventnor—I went into the coffee-room first—the two Salters were there, and the defendant, Mr. Cox, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Norman—in the coffee-room I was introduced to Mr. Norman as Mr. Crawcour's solicitor—I asked him to let me look over the deed—I was nearly an hour examining it, and the servants came in to lay the cloth at luncheon-time, and we went into the other room—I did not notice any conversation in the coffee-room between anybody there and the defendant—we went into the other room, and I said to Salter, "If I were you I would not execute that deed; the terms are so stringent you will never be able to meet the requirements; you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030011"></xptr>
               <p>may as well sign your death-warrant as that"—he said, "There is another deed which they can put in force against me"—I said, "Well, do as you like I advise you not to sign it," and after a good deal of talking the defendant went out of the room—Salter then signed it, and Norman said, "Let us have a glass of sherry together," and we met him in the passage, and he said, "Have you got the deed signed?" and I said "Yes." (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here called for the original deed, which not being produced, he ten<lb></lb>dered a copy.</hi>) I signed a parchment deed in that room on 7th January, and saw the two Salters and Norman sign it—the defendant was not then in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I put the interview down in my diary—I never made any bill of costs, as I knew that it was of no use charging my client any<lb></lb>thing—I was telegraphed for to go to Ventnor, and he paid my railway fare, and I had a glass of sherry and a bit of bread and cheese—my attention was first called last November to the fact whether the defendant was present—my attention had not been called to the matter from June, 1878, to November, 1879, nor had I any note in writing of the transaction itself—I think Mr. Richards called on me about it in November, but I have no note of it—he named it to me when I called at his office in Newport, but I do not think we discussed whether the defendant was present or not—he asked me, I think, whether I remembered whether Mr. Crawcour was in the room at the time he was signing it, and I told him he was not—he did not tell me why he asked the question—I had not been consulted about any of the previous proceedings—I had heard nothing about it from January to November last year, except when Mr. Salter filed his petition in bankruptcy—I swore him to the affidavits as a commissioner authorised to administer oaths—mine is a pretty good memory—I read the deed for the purpose of advising my client upon it, but it is so long ago and I have had so many deeds since—I believe it was an indenture of lease which was granted to the Salters—I do not say it, but it recited the lease—it purported to convey by way of mortgage to Mr. Smith the indenture of lease, and Smith was to pay 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to discharge the encumbrances, so as to save it for Messrs. Salter, but they might come in in a few hours and take possession of everything—Mr. Salter mentioned that there was a former deed from Mr. Rule—I believe the arrangement was that Mr. Rule's 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid off, but I have not seen it for the last two years—I do not know whether the encumbrance was paid off; I never saw any money pass—there is a clause enabling Messrs. Crawcour to come in at any time—it was ageed that the bill of sale was not to be registered for 18 days, to give Salter time to look out and get his money somewhere else, and then he would have paid them off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Binstead, Isle of Wight—in 1877 I took a lease of the Queen's Hotel, Ventnor, and entered into negotiations with Crawcour and Co. to furnish part of the hotel—furniture was delivered value about 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., an agreement was drawn up, and I paid all the instalments up to a certain date—on Saturday, 5th January, 1878, I was ill in bed at the Queen's Hotel, but the defendant was determined to see me, and I saw him at my bedroom door, but no conversation passed, because when the door was opened he ran downstairs—I did not see him on Sunday, but I did on Monday, the 7th, about 12 o'clock—Mr. Rhodes, my solicitor, had then arrived—I met the defendant on the ground-floor with Mr. Norman, and went into the coffee-room—my son and Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Campbell, and the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030012"></xptr>
               <p>defendant were there—I asked the defendant what right he had to interfere as I was putting his father off in lieu of the hiring agreement—he behaved like a dog at my heels—I have no doubt he felt annoyed at my remarks, and I told him to get out of my presence, I was dealing with Mr. Smith's solicitor, not with him—when we got into the other room Mr. Norman's clerk was there, and my son, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cox, and the defendant—I said to the defendant, "You go away, and do not interfere; I will pay your father the money"—he withdrew, and I closed the door after him—all the rest were left in the room—the deed was on the table, and Mr. Rhodes was perusing it—I signed it first, after a good deal of reluctance, and my son, Mr. Rhodes, and Mr. Norman signed it as attesting witnesses—the defendant was not in the room then; he had left at my request—I sub<lb></lb>sequently took proceedings to set aside the deed—I was in Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court on 26th January, 1878, and was represented by Counsel—I saw the defendant in Court, and saw him leave the Court hurriedly—after that I became bankrupt—I was examined when this action was heard before Vice-Chancellor Malins in April last, and saw the defendant sworn—he gave evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined as a witness at Ryde in August, 1878, and gave an account of this transaction—I was asked what the document was which I signed—I said that it consisted of seven skins—I said nothing about the trustees—the purport of what I said was that there was a legal gentleman present, and I thought if I signed it it would be my death-warrant, and I did not know what to do; if I did not the parties would stop in possession—I dare say I was asked how many were present—I never said that Herbert Crawcour was present, because I objected to his being there, but he was in the hotel—I very likely said in the Vice-Chancellor's Court. "After Crawcour had gone out of the room it is very likely he came in again, but if he did Mr. Norman would order him out"—I cannot account for the words, I am so excitable under this case—the defendant never came into the room again after he was ordered out, but I met him in the passage afterwards—I said, "When we left the coffee-room and adjourned into the other room I believe it was Mr. Norman ordered him out"—that is correct—I cannot say whether Mr. Norman ordered him out; my memory fails me—I may even have said, "It is very likely Mr. Norman would order him out," but I know he was not present when the deed was signed because I should not have signed it—I have been bankrupt once, and have filed a petition twice for liquidation—when I met my creditors I believe there was not much assets—I do not think the estate would realise anything—I failed in 1867, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I do not think I failed again in September, 1870, but I met my creditors and they met some assets—I only owed Messrs. Rule 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they got a mortgage out of me for 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order to turn the hotel into a company—Mr. Smith arranged to advance 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pay off what Rule had a claim for—it would not have come to my being sold up by Messrs. Rule but for that, but I dare say I told him so—I did not know that the 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to come out of Mr. Smith's pocket—I mean to say that I did not owe Messrs. Crawcour anything at that time—I had paid for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and the carriage down to the Isle of Wight cost me about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not in arrear in my payments, only 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, which was the balance of a bill I paid before it came due—while Rule was threatening to turn me out Messrs. Crawcour were not complaining that I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030013"></xptr>
               <p>two instalments behind—I did not know till 12th January that the money to pay off the mortgage came out of Mr. Crawcour's pocket—I did not know from that time until last January that the defendant had sworn that he was present when the deed was executed—I never looked at the affidavit by which the deed was verified—I am not a lawyer, and my lawyer neglected it—I paid Tindal, a lawyer, 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all the money I had, but he would not work—Mr. Urry has not been my lawyer—I swear that Mr. Tindal has not acted for me since—I swore this affidavit, and the date is there (<hi rend="italic">January</hi> 29, 1878)—it was both Mr. Norman and I who ordered the defendant out of the room—I said at Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court that I ordered him out—I was very angry with him—I did not personally invite the defendant to lunch after the deed was signed—no doubt I invited the other gentlemen, and as they had to go to lunch they might as well come to me as to the Royal—he had two or three of his sons coming loafing down there—I pledge my oath that I saw Mr. Crawcour senior in and out of Court on the day that Mr. Locock Webb made an application to Vice-Chancellor Malins—Mr. Smith is a public-house broker—I believe he intro<lb></lb>duced Mr. Crawcour to me for the purpose of getting the furniture on the hire system; I am not quite sure—he is the person to whom I applied to get the money to pay off Rule—I attended the Newport County Court in my last bankruptcy in 1878, but not to get myself made bankrupt to defeat this deed; I was obliged to go there from force of circumstances; I was forced there by creditors both at Newport and Ryde—I did not get myself made bankrupt on purpose, but being in a deplorable position I assented to be made bankrupt—the first time I saw Mr. Rubenstein was when he was pointed out to me at the Court; he was with young Mr. Crawcour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 20, Regent Street—on 25th January, 1878, Mr. Lewin Crawcour called on me with respect to registering a bill of sale on some furniture at the Queen's Hotel, Ventnor—I may have asked, if I was not told, that Herbert Crawcour's name should not appear on the deed before it could be registered—I do not know whether he signed it that day or the next, but it was arranged—he called at my office about 11.30 next morning, and we went to the Queen's Bench Office to register the deed—the affidavit was sworn there, the deed was copied over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030015"></xptr>
               <p>night—after that I had to make a call at Vice-Chancellor Malins's chambers, Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn—Herbert Crawcour went with me—coming back we went went into Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court, as there is nearly always something interesting going on there—I swear that that was after the deed had been registered and the affidavit sworn, and the note of the Vice-Chancellor shows it—the deed was registered before any application was made—on 28th June I first heard by letter from the defendant of an injunction being applied for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. This is the Vice-Chancellor's judgment—I am not acquainted with the fact that the Salters had Attempted to set aside the deed—I was brought in as solicitor on the 25th, the day before the deed was registered; before that he had Mr. Norman for his solicitor—they had not applied before that to set aside the deed—the deed was ready, but we could not get the stationer's copy ready, as it was 120 folios—it was brought to me on the 25th with instructions to register—the defendant's name was not on it at that time—the papers had not been taken out of Mr. Norman's hands then; I was acting as solicitor on the 25th for the purpose of the registration only; Mr. Norman was busy in Court, and could not register it, and the last day was getting very close—I knew nothing about it till the 25th, and I had the copy made over night—I have Mr. Norman's letter, in which he says, "I will come down if you have the affidavit ready."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If there had been, any necessity for it I would have got Mr. Norman to come—he was very anxious about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale furniture dealer and manufacturer, of Brompton—the amount due to me on this hiring agreement of January, 1878, is about 1,260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,—I was applied to by Mr. Smith to advance the Salters enough to pay off the mortgage, and I advanced 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my own pocket, and have not got a shilling back; all I have got under the decree is a right to my own furniture at its present value—I sent the defendant down to Ventnor for the express purpose of seeing the deed executed—I left it in Mr. Smith's hands—he is a public-house broker—he introduced the business to me, but not actually—I was not near the Court when the application was made to Vice-Chancellor Malins—it is utterly untrue.</p>

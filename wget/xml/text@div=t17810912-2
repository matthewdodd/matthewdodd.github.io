The prisoner came up, and ordered the coachman to stop, or he would blow his brains out; then he came to the carriage-door, and demanded my mistress's watch and money, and threatened to blow her brains out if she did not give it to him. My mistress gave him her watch and money, and he rode off.

            , the footman, gave me information that the lady had been robbed by a man in a brown coat with a flapped hat, riding a bay horse with a cropped tail, and that he was gone through Hampton-gate. Upon this information, I pursued the man: at Hampton-bridge, he seemed to make an attempt to go over the bridge, but he rode back. I heard of him at Hampton. He had put his house into a shed of a public-house: I saw him on foot, about fifty yards from that house, in Smokey-lane: as he was going towards the public-house where he had put his house, I secured him. The people at the public-house said there was a horse in the shed, but they did not know whose horse it was; I saw the horse; it answered the description the footman had given me. I took the prisoner to a public-house, and sent for a constable who searched him in my presence; I saw the headborough take from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120004"></xptr> him a gold watch in a black shagreen case, and four guineas and a half in a purse.</p>

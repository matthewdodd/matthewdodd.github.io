            , junior. - Mr. Bolland Where do you live. - A. No 105, Fenchurch-street, I am at school there.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 28th of April did you receive any bill from your father. - A. Yes, about the 28th of April, I took it to Baker's coffee house; I did not see Mr. Still there, and so I took a letter from my father, and left it at No. 6, St. Michael's-alley, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it. - A. On the side of the door there was Vaughan, and on the front of the door was Winkley, Brothers, and company; I saw a lady there, and I left the letter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time receive any other bill from your father. - A. Yes; I took the last bill on the 4th or on the 5th of May, to the same house No. 6, St. Michael's-alley; then I saw Mr. Still; he said, is it you that brought this letter up, I said yes; he said he was going to meet one of the partners of the country bank at the Edinburgh Castle, and then he would give me the notes for the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. What kind of a bill was it you had from your father - was it a bank of England bill. - A. No, it was a bill drawn upon a person in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you go to the Edinburgh Castle. - A. Yes, I got there about a quarter past six o'clock; I met Mr. Still there, and a person that called himself Mr. Hitchen. Hitchen told me that he knew my father, and if I mentioned his name to him he would recollect him; he had been to his house. He gave me the bills, and bid me good by; he gave me five pound notes to the amount of one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two bills, are these two of the bills so given you on that day. - A. Yes, I know it by this mark on this one, and I tried to imitate it on this.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark. - A. Crossing the 5. After I had done this, I was afraid I might spoil the bill; I put my finger on it to get the ink off; I sent the bills to my father by the post in a letter, and in about four or five days I received part of them back from my father, and part of them my father brought up to town himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bills after you received them from your father the second time. - A. I kept them and looked them up. After I had found the house of Winkley, Brothers, and Co. had stopped payment, I wrote to them to give up my father's bill. I saw neither Mr. Still or Mr. Hitchen afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you received the bills from your father, did you learn that they had stopped payment. - A. The next day; in consequence of that I informed my father, and I kept these two bills; and the other bills I delivered to Mr. Humphries.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether you received that of Mr. Still - A. Mr. Still wrote that in my presence. I wrote Baker's coffee-house on the back of it, that I might remember where Mr. Still wrote that note. (The note read.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have been speaking of the marks on the note, did you give the account of them marks before the lord mayor. - A. No, I did not recollect them then; but looking over them some time afterwards, I saw the marks I had made. These notes were not produced before the lord mayor; I have kept them in my desk: I brought them here this morning, and gave them to Mr. Humphries.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the two marked notes part of those your father sent or which he brought up with him. - A. I do not know; the notes that I received from Hitchen were wafered most of them, and those I received from Still were not wafered; and these two notes form a part of the notes I received from Hitchen. I remember perfectly the one that is marked; I made the mark on or about the 4th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was that the day that you received them. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to say that these two are a part of those you received from Hitchen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that out of the number that was delivered to you by one and by the other, that these notes might not be part of those you received from Still, as well as part of those you received from Hitchen. A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I understand you to answer my friend this way - that Mr. Humphries desired you to select the notes that you thought you had received from Hitchen - had you previous to that taken notice of one note from the other. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why should Mr. Humphries desire you to select those you thought you received from Hitchen. - A. Those that I knew I received from Mr. Hitchen, were all wafered; and these I received from Mr. Still were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you said before to Mr. Humphries that you did not distinguish one from the other. - A. I believe I did</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010013"></xptr> Court. When did you recollect that Hitchen's were wafered. - A. I have recollected it all along.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Notwithstanding that you said you could not distinguish one from the other. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been able to pitch upon these notes that you received from Hitchen. - A. I believe two days ago; I saw the mark on the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told the court that the notes you received from Hitchen were wafered. - A. Not all of them; this note is not wafered. I delivered seventy-five or eighty to Mr. Humphries that were wafered.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of May did you receive any notes by post in a package. - A. Yes, five-pound bills, to the amount of one hundred pound, purporting to be of the Ipswich and Suffolk bank; on that day I received a letter in the packet; on the next day another letter came from my son. There is one thing necessary for me to correct; though I applied for these bills, I did not apply for any discount; I received the full amount. I did not know at that time whether there was any discount, nor is it considered; the circulation of the bills is looked upon the same of one side as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received a prior hundred pound of these bills a few days before from your son. - A. I think on the 30th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing with that second remittance, before you received any letter from your son. - A. I had; on the day I received them, I paid a great many of them bills away.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them two bills, are you able to say whether either of the bills were included in the second remittance. - A. Yes, these that I hold in my hand; I was enabled to know the note the moment I received it in my hand, by the name of

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received from your son, did you send back part of the bills that you had received. - A. Yes, I believe to the amount of one hundred pounds about two days afterwards; I afterwards brought up the remainder on the 14th of May, and delivered them to him on the 15th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (to jury). Gentleman, the bill that he speaks to, is the bill that the son made the imitation upon.</p>
               <p>Q. (to witness) Did you know the prisoner at the bar, Hitchen, was he ever at your house. - A. I know neither of the prisoners at the bar; I never saw them before to the best of my knowledge; Hitchen never was at my house in his life; I have never transacted any business with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. You say you are not acquainted with either of the partners. - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to apply to that house in town. - A. Because of the papers now produced; I have frequently taken their bills in the country, there were a great many about.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had as good opinion of this bank as any other, and you wished your paper to be converted into their paper - A. I had a good opinion of their bank of course.</p>

               <p>Q. What did these plates purport to be. - A. Promissory notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two bills, did you engrave the plate from which this was struck. - A. I originally engraved it, it has been altered since; there is a tree introduced it was originally the Ipswich bank; it is now Ipswich, and Suffolk bank; the five is done in a different manner to what the note was originally done; the alterations are done by another engraver. Mr. Still paid me for engraving that work; he desired me to make a bill out in the name of Ralph, Holden, and Co I suppose I printed off two hundred from each plate altogether.</p>

               <p>Q. What passed between you and Hitchen when he first called - A. He wished to hire the house unfurnished; I did not chose to let the house unfurnished, upon account that we did not agree; he stated that he wanted to hire the house to open a bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who were to be the bankers. - A. He did not; he wrote in a memorandum the name of Mr. Haydon and Co.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you got that memorandum here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Where is that memorandum. - A. I returned it to Mr. Hitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. We gave them a notice to produce that memorandum.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010014"></xptr> MR. CHARLES HUMPHRIES. Q. Did you serve a copy of notice on the prisoners. - A. I served a copy of it yesterday morning to Mr. Hitchen, and another to Mr. Still.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Miss Smith) When did Mr. Hitchen call upon you again. - A. I called upon him, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the Ipswich paper; that was near a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not hear any more of him not till a month. - A. No. I agreed for the letting the house on the 30th of September.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. That agreement will speak for itself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland (to witness). You are not to tell me any thing of that first agreement - did he enter into any further agreement about the house on the 30th of September. - A. No; he entered into that agreement. I let him the house on the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no other letting him the house on the 30th of September but by that written paper which you have not got. - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you his writing in your pocket of an agreement of letting Hitchen the house. - A. I have (producing it). When I called, I told Mr. Hitchen I called in consequence of seeing different names to the house; he said it was part of the same firm, and he had this agreement ready for me, to take place instead of the other. I gave him possession of the house on the 30th of September; I let him the house at one hundred pounds a-year.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did Hitchen carry on in that house. - A. Banking business; there was BANK on the door; I never see any name on the door; I received the rent of Mr. Hitchen sometimes myself; I was very ill the chief of the winter; I did not always go myself. When I have been there I have seen Young and another; he styled himself Tyler. I did not see him transact any business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Holden. A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any person living in that house of the name of Saunders. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted that you never went to the banking house except to receive your rent. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the three persons you have described to have seen there, were Young, Tyler, and Hitchen. - A. Yes, I saw no others.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for any thing you know to the contrary, there might be other persons carrying on that trade. - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to give the receipts. - A. I did; the receipts were sometimes written by me and sometimes by my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you can tell your own hand writing, and that of your sister's - whose hand writing is that. A. This is my sister's;

He did not; when I went down to the bank, I found Mr. Hitchen conducting the business of the bank; I delivered to him the letter that I had received from Mr. Still.

               <p>Q. How long had you been in town before that person was introduced to you as Ralph Holden. - A. I suppose it might be a week or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any memorandums any other way than on this paper. - A. Certainly, always in the day book; these are my memorandums, I entered them on paper first before I entered them in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing about conducting banking business before you went there. - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You were not acquainted with the banking business when you went out, but Mr. Hitchen instructed you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the clerk previous to your going down. - A. I never saw one.</p>
               <p>Q. You were employed by these defendants some months - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the time you was employed, untill two or three days before Mr. Still was taken into custody, was any bill refused payment till within that time. - A. None that were payable at that house. I have paid bills to the amount of several thousands.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, sir, were you ever directed to practise any deceit, or to refuse payment to any bills that were tendered. - A. No, I never saw any thing of the kind; I never saw any thing but what was honourable and fair.</p>
               <p>Q. After this stoppage took place in London, had you any small sum in the bank. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Still or Mr. Hitchen direct you to pay even to the last guinea. - A. Mr. Hitchen did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, Mr. Hitchen was always acting as the manager of the business in the country. - A. When he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he there a great portion of time. - A. Certainly he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Page. - A. I did not know him till I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you have paid any notes of his - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given any bills in exchange to a man of the name of Seaman. - A. I know the name, but the man I do not know. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you continued to pay on till the last guinea was expended. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Mr. Hitchen left the country, was it before Mr. Still was taken in custody. - A. Yes, a considerable time before that; and during that time I conducted the business as usual; I received remittances to carry on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. It frequently happened that he went into the country for receiving of money to assist you in paying the bills when they came in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When you first went down to Ipswich, you went with a letter to Messrs Holden and Co. - A. Yes, I enquired at the coach office and they went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was the person that was called upon for entering the notes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was done before they were signed. - A. Sometimes, and sometimes not.</p>

I went out of town on Tuesday the 28th of April, accompanied by

            . Mr. Still told me to go to different shops and to purchase small articles, to lay out as little as I could, and to remit to him the produce of the notes (the money) that I received in change for the notes, and to be home by Saturday or Sunday, and what I bought I was to bring home; he would either keep them himself, or he would dispose of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he direct you what places to go to. - A. Yes. I was first to go to Cheltenham, then Worcester, and then to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he order you to send the remittance to. - A. Baker's coffee house, to Mr. S. Still. He gave me a parcel of five pound notes, tied up; he told me there was eight hundred pounds. I went to Cheltenham, I did not change many notes there, nor did I change many notes in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young woman change any notes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much were there distributed among them. - A. I think about an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. From Cheltenham where did you go to. - A. To Tewkesbury, and then to Worcester, and then to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you got to Oxford, in consequence of the notes not being paid, you were taken in custody. A. Yes, and there were some notes taken from me at Oxford that I received from Mr. Still.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see in this banking affair any body concerned but Hitchen and Still. - A. I never saw Mr Hitchen acting; he gave me orders as an artist, I was not his servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any account of the money Osborn, you, and Primrose laid out. - A. I kept the bills at the inn, but they were taken from me at Cheltenham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. With respect to Mr. Hitchen, you never saw him act in the business of Winkley and co. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. I think that you said you paid away more money than twelve thousand pounds. - A. Yes, it must be more than twelve thousand pounds</p>
               <p>Q. When you said there might be three thousand pounds out, had not Mr. Still told you that the average circulation was to the amount of three thousand pounds. A. One day Mr. Still stated to me that there might be three thousand pounds out, which he considered as a large sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say any thing about a clerk of the name of Hayes. - A. I knew a person of the name of Hayes, but I did not know that he was his clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he sent you into the country, was it not in consequence of Hayes having disposed of two thousand pounds, and not given him any account of it. - A. He was very uneasy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The question is, whether at the time he sent you into the country, he told you the necessity of it was because Hayes had gone off with the money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had the bank stopped. - A. Three or four days before that it was embarrassed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. What were the article that you were to purchase. - A. I myself purchased but two articles, a quire of paper and a road book, for which I gave five pound notes.</p>

            . - Mr. Bolland. I believe, in consequence of some information, you pursued Vaughan and Primrose. - A. Yes, on the 2nd of May I pursued and took them; I found upon them notes to the amount of seven or eight hundred pounds; these are the notes; they are as they delivered them up. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Still's Defence. My lord - I shall trouble you with as few observations as possible, and which I trust will be more than sufficient to explain my conduct to the satisfaction of the court and the jury, with respect to the charge of which I am accused. I have been long in the most respectable connections, my payments having been from 100,000 l. to above 320,000 l. a-year in the mercantile and commission business.</p>
               <p>Shortly previous to Christmas 1805, Mr. Hitchen took a counting house of mine for himself and partner, Mr. Roche, where they conducted business as merchants to a very considerable amount; and after they had been some time there, Mr. Hitchen solicited me to take some of their consignments, as they had a greater quantity of goods on hand than their finances would permit them to hold with convenience; to which I consented, and made them the necessary advances, to the amount of 2 or 3000 l.</p>
               <p>About the middle of the year 1806, Mr. Hitchen informed me that some differences had arisen between him and his partner, and that he had made up his mind to discontinue his connection with him, and having overtures from a gentleman of the name of Holden, whom he had long known in Liverpool, to join him in the corn and provision trade, and that if they could settle their plan, he would shortly dissolve his copartnership with Roche.</p>
               <p>Soon after, I learnt that Mr. Hitchen and Roche had agreed to dissolve their copartnership, and that Mr. Hitchen had joined with Mr. Holden and others in a mercantile concern, which they were about to establish in the country, and I was requested to take their consignments in addition to my other concerns in the same line. I agreed to take them, without thinking it at all necessary to make those enquiries as to Mr. Holden or Saunders that I should have done had it been to trust them.</p>
               <p>I received several large lots of cheese into my warehouse in October last, which I sold on their account. I afterwards received heavy consignments of cargoes of oats and other goods; so that I was obliged to transfer some to cornfactors, and which generally left a profit. They afterwards consigned direct to houses on the corn exchange.</p>
               <p>After they got established at Ipswich, I received an intimation from Mr. Hitchen that they had it in contemplation to issue their own notes payable on demand in London, similar to country banks, as they found it would materially tend to the advantage of their mercantile concerns; and they at the same time stated that they found a difficulty in prevailing on the London bankers to pay them, as they were to be issued for so small an amount as one pound; and they requested me to take a house for them, which I did in the first instance, and I supposed at that time that one of their own partners would superintend it; but afterwards, for various reasons, I was prevailed upon to become the payer, they promising that I should always have sufficient assets to answer any demand that should be made upon me. I disliked becoming the payer, principally from its being out of my usual business, and materially so, as it would appear to the world that I had two accompting-houses, being obliged to keep my mercantile one in the Borough, and they thought it indispensable that their notes should be paid in the city. This appearance was obviated by my getting my friend Winkley and his brother to allow me to make use of their names before mine in the firm of Winkley, Brothers, and company - determining in all cases and events, and which determination I always abided by, never to raise, or suffer to be raised, any money or credit directly or indirectly by that firm, and never to do any business there but pay the notes of Holden and company - never to accept any bill in that firm, or use any deception or disguise whatever. And on all occasions I directed every one to consider me the principal in it; and in my own mind and conduct, the firm was nothing else than the usual point of note where the holders might apply for their money, and which I considered myself no longer bound to pay than as I received remittances for the purpose. I always acted to the best of my judgment and abilities as the agent of Holden and company, and I exerted myself as much as possible for their interest, which they honourably acknowledge.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010019"></xptr> knowledge. I received the minutest instructions from their letters in my possession to get their plates engraved; I communicated those instructions to my clerk, Mr. Vaughan, who gave them to the engraver. With respect to Mr. Page's son, it is not true, that I gave him any of Holden and Co's. notes, on or at all near so recent as the 28th of April; nor did he have any of these notes from me which he has sworn to have had. With respect to the last parcel; and his last application, I thought it imprudent at that particular period of Holden and Co's. difficulty to give Page's son of myself notes for his bill; and more so as Mr. Hitchen was himself in town, who knew his own resources best, and who was more confident in raising money for the bank to go on, than I was or could be. - I therefore told the lad, that as one of the partners was in London, he had better meet him with me at the Edinburgh coffee house, at three o'clock that day, Monday the 4th of May, which he did; and Mr. Hitchen gave him notes for his bill, assuring me after the boy was gone, that the bank of Ipswich was paying regularly, which it was; and that he was promised the loan of a thousand pounds the next morning, to enable me to continue their concern in town. However, it was of no avail; because I was taken up the same day, on the idea that I had circulated notes, knowing that Mr. Hitchen had forged Mr. Holden's name to them; and the lord mayor was so impressed with the criminality, that he would not listen to any defence; though Mr. Holden and Mr. Hitchen came into court on my first and second examination, expecting to be called.</p>
               <p>In the month of January or February last, Mr. Hayes, who was a very able man to get connections for Messrs Holden and Co. in the West of England, was introduced to me by Mr. Hitchen; and was I requested to send him the notes from London, which I regularly did, till about the 28th of April; when he was more eager for me to send him notes than ever, and less liberal in his remittances in return. I kept paying as far as the 28th of April, he sent me only twenty pounds, and not any since, when I presume the ballance of notes he had obtained exceeded two thousand pound. It unfortunately happened that my remittances were very deficient from other quarters, at the same time. I therefore wrote to Mr. Hitchen to come to London immediately, and meet me on the 30th, and used every exertion I was empowered with, to raise money on their notes and goods in my possession. On the 28th I concluded some accident had happened to Mr. Hayes; I sent my clerk, Vaughan, in the country, with his companions, with notes he had before paid, perhaps four or five times over, and which I never saw, either them or any other signed; conceiving every exertion to be my duty in supporting Holden and Co. I was particularly careful so mark all the notes which were thus given to negotiate, that they in particular should at all events be paid, and even most sanguinely expected every other also would be taken up.</p>
               <p>The witness must acknowledge that no representation, much more any misrepresentation was made by me. I particularly desired that if, at any time, any questions were asked them, to tell the truth, and to refer immediately to me, as the principal in the firm of Winkley and Co. I had no motive or inducement whatever, to act with deception or disguise; I had no idea but Holden and Co. were honorably correct in all their transactions. I never saw, nor had I any cause for any suspicion to the contrary; the worst I knew was, they often bought more corn than I thought prudent with safety, to the due payment of their notes; so that I was sometimes obliged to write to their friends for particular exertions in sending me money; though I never did, or had occasion to use extraordinary measures myself, till I saw my empty letter on the 28th; though I had their authority to circulate as occasion required.</p>
               <p>I will not tresspass longer on your patience, but beg leave to assure you that my intentions in every thing I have done were perfectly honest, and with the best of motives. Therefore I must rely on your justice; first in believing there was no fraud, and therefore there cannot be any forgery. And secondly, if Mr. Hitchen signed Mr. Holden's name on emergency, he was fully authorised so to do, by a regular power of attorney for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Hitchen's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the the jury, I have but little to add after what has been said by Mr. Still. In the month of June in the last year, I agreed to enter into partnership with Mr. Holden and Mr. Sanders, in the corn and provision trade; in which I have been brought up to from my youth, and with the concurrence of my partners I went to Ipswich, and took premises suitable for our business; and having left workmen to do what I considered necessary, I came to London untill they should be completed; Previous to my going down to commence business, my partner and myself waited upon Mr. Still, and requested him to take our consignments, to which he consented. provided the quantity did not exceed his finances for the usual advance. I then returned into the country; and as Mr. Holden who was the senior partner, was only occasionally at Ipswich, I requested to have his letter of attorney, to authorise me to sign his name in his absence, which he accordingly gave me.</p>
               <p>After some short time, we considered it would be beneficial to our interests to have small notes payable in London, in the same manner as country merchants and bankers do; and we accordingly applied, as Mr. Still has stated, to several London bankers, to request them to pay our notes, but they declined paying so small notes as one pound. We then requested Mr. Still to pay them; he at first declined, but he afterwards aceeded to our solicitations, upon understanding that he was in no shape to be responsible, and upon condition that his name was not inserted upon the face of the notes. Every thing being thus far settled, we sent Mr. Still's directions to get the plates engraved, sending him at the same time the form; and upon this being completed, we commenced issuing notes on the 5th of November 1806; and from that time untill the begining of May in the present year every note issued by us was duly honored. A great many of the notes thus issued were signed by Mr. Holden; and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that a great many were signed by me, and which I considered I was authorised to do by virtue of the letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>It has been asserted, that some fraud must have been intended from my name not appearing upon the face of the notes. This I most solemnly assure you is not the case; the only reason for its suppression, was that between three and four years ago, in consequence of sustaining very heavy losses, I failed in business, and it was apprehended that if my name appeared it would come to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010020"></xptr> the knowledge of some persons who were acquainted with my former failure, and who might, by mentioning the circumstance, injure the credit of the establishment at Ipswich; but to all those with whom I transacted business, I ingenuously avowed that I was a principal in the firm. This is well known to my clerks, and to every one at Ipswich.</p>
               <p>During the time we were in business in Suffolk our dealings were extensive and regular; we had always one or two ships in our employ, and our consignments being very considerable, and requiring larger advances than could be made by Mr. Still, they were made by other gentlemen, who are in attendance, and will prove the regularity of our mercantile transactions with them. - Gentlemen, Mr. Still has truly told you that our failure originated with Hayes; had he acted honestly, not a note of ours would have been unpaid. It was with the utmost astonishment and concern that on my arrival in London on or about the 30th of April, that I for the first time learnt from Mr. Still the conduct of Hayes. Notwithstanding which, we determined if possible to withstand the blow. I sent to Ipswich instructions to pay as far as the last shilling would admit, and used every exertion to raise money to answer the emergency. I had determined to go in the country in search of Hayes, when the apprehension of Mr. Still put an end to all further exertions, as no hopes could be then entertained of retrieving our credit.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, both myself and partners attended before the lord mayor upon Mr. Still's first examination, in order to give evidence on his behalf, which circumstance his lordship perfectly well recollected upon my being afterwards taken into custody. We also attended in the neighbourhood during several subsequent examinations, for the same purpose; I was conscious that I had done nothing intentionally wrong, and I was not therefore anxious to shrink from investigation. I visited Mr. Still several times in prison, but at last, upon one of these occasional visits, I was detained, and examined with Mr. Still before the lord mayor, who committed us for trial. - Gentlemen, I am perfectly aware of the situation I stand in, and the prejudice entertained against me in the minds of the public. - Here I am, gentlemen, on a commitment, standing before you, confident that no prejudice prevails in this honourable court, but that it will do me the honour to give me an impartial hearing. I have done my utmost endeavour to shew you and the court the simple transaction under the agreement of partnership of myself, Holden, and company; and clear am I, had we not met with the losses before stated by Hayes, together with the unfortunate apprehension of Still, we might have carried on the business with honour and advantage to ourselves and families, with accommodation and benefit to individuals, as well as the public at large, to the general good of trade and commerce.</p>
               <p>Having said thus much - allow me just to shew the misfortunes that has since attended us, from the losses sustained aforesaid - first, by stating briefly the charges alleged against us, with our simple and candid defence thereto, for the clearer comprehension of you, gentlemen, as to the facts, previous to your verdict, where our lives, and all that is dear to us, is pending.</p>
               <p>I stand here indicted for a forgery; perhaps it may have been proved I did utter such notes; and perhaps it may have been partly proved I have written, signed, or endorsed the name of

               <p>Gentlemen, is it not unprecedented to attempt a criminal charge; - under such circumstances I feel myself justified in conceiving it originated in the jealousy of other bankers, and the extravagance of the public prints - and I trust from the evidence this day given on the part of the prosecution, your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, will coincide with me in this opinion and that nothing has appeared to constitute forgery or fraud, but what may be completely done away by the evidence hereafter to be produced in my defence. - I therefore crave the indulgence of the court, by no means to form their judgment until the whole of such evidence on my behalf is finished and gone through - leaving my fate to your lordship, the court, and jury, and to my defence hereafter to follow, I bow with submission, waiting most anxiously for the decision, which I doubt not will be an acquittal.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live at 14, Walmer Crescent, Notting Hill—on the night of 9th December, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in the Lancaster Road, Notting Hill, going home; the two prisoners came up to me, and asked if I would give them 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for a bed—Daniel spoke first, but they both stood together as they are now, and I believe George said they were hard up—I gave them 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put my hand into my pocket with my silver and gold and coppers together—I was going on, and Daniel asked me for another 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took out my money to give them the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when Daniel struck me in the breast, and knocked me down, snatched the money from my hand, and ran away up the road—I got up as quickly as I could, leaving my hat on the ground, and ran after him, and I saw the constable catch him, without losing sight of him—the other prisoner ran in another direction directly I was knocked down.</p>

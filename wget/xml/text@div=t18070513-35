No, not till the next morning about three o'clock; it was about eleven or twelve when it happened, and at three o'clock the danger was perceived.

            . - Mr. Knapp. What are you, sir - A. I am a surgeon. On Wednesday the 15th of April, between eleven and twelve, I was called into the deceased; I found him sitting in a chair, supported by a female; upon examination, I found a wound on the right side of the head, about an inch and a half in length.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the wound, did it appear to be done with a sharp or a blunt instrument. - A. It is impossible to say; the wound corresponded with the extremity of the saw, with which it is said to be inflicted; (the saw produced); on examining the saw, after I had dressed the deceased, I found on the end of it a drop of blood; at that time there was no certain appearance of danger; I saw him repeatedly afterwards, till he died, he got worse and worse; I saw him in the evening when he was perfectly sensible; I asked him several questions respecting his head, and respecting some medicine I had given him; all which he answered rationally; this was the last visit. On the 15th, the day of the accident, the next morning I was sent for, before my usual time of going out; upon enquiry I found a sickness of stomach had come on about three o'clock in the morning; this convinced me there was some injury of the brain. I pointed out the necessity of an operation, and recommended to them to have a consulting surgeon, Mr. Luxmore was called in, 27, at St. Mary Axe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find upon examining him, the brain was injured. - A. Yes, we found a detached piece of bone,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130022"></xptr> which had been forced through the membranes into the brain; he appeared very little better for the operation, and continued gradually to get worse till he died.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death. - A. The wound in the head, the fracture in the scull; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>MR. LUXMORE. - Mr. Knapp. Do you, sir, agree with that statement. - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please you, my lord, the blow which I received on my back overcome me; upon which I slung my hand back with the instrument I had got in my hand; I got out of the shop as well as I could and as soon as I could, and when I came to the yard door it was fast; I was terrified for fear my master should come after me. I looked for something to open the latch with; in the mean time my mistress opened the door. I went home and shewed the blow which I had received to my father; my father advised me to go to the office to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you receive the blow with. - A. With the but-end of a gun; when I came to the office the clerk of the office would not grant me a warrant. From that time till Monday last I have been with my friends. I surrendered myself to the office.</p>

I saw the prisoner again with another person coming towards East Acton—he turned his head from me, when he got close to me; he looked towards the fields—I was passing in my cart, and I stopped my horse and watched him—he and his companion separated near Mr. Lewis' house, the Horse and Groom—the prisoner went in that house, the other man went down the green—I did not see them together again—I went and told the barmaid, and I went away about my business.</p>

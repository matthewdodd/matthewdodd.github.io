                  </hi>. I am a farmer, residing at Greenford. On Thurs-day, 1st Feb., I was at the White Star public house there, to pay the taxes—I saw the prisoner there in the early part of the evening, the latest time I saw him was about 6 o'clock—it is about half a mile from where I live—I left as near 9 o'clock as possible; I went straight home; I had got to my gate, and the prisoner or some other party sprang out on me in the snow, put his hand at the back part of my neck, and the other round my wais—he found he could not throw me in that way, and he tripped me up and I fell—he then put one hand over my mouth, and the other in the pocket where my purse was, but I think he tried the other one first—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a canvas bag when I left the public house, he got that away—the prisoner is like him, but he had a sort of handkerchief over the lower part of his face up to his eyes, and he would not speak a word—I have known the prisoner, and heard him speak frequently—I think I should have known his voice, if I had heard it—the handkerchief over his face prevents my swearing to him positively—I had my hands engaged in keep<lb></lb>ing my pockets; his finger accidentally came into my mouth, and I bit it; severely I thought—he went through the gate, and turned in the direction of his own home across the field.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew him, and he knew you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is a person of the same name as him that keeps the public house—I went to the public house about 6 o'clock or a little past, it was not exactly dark—the prisoner was there when I went in—I had a little to drink, but was as sober as I am now—I very seldom go to public houses; if I do go I do not get intoxicated, or seldom; I do not go to public houses above twice or three times a week, if I do that—I cannot say that I get intoxicated two or three times a month, I may twice in the year—on that night I had a pint of beer in the tap room, and two small glasses of brandy and water, but you must understand that the spirits are not very strong in country villages—I had nothing else after that—I walked straight home till I got to the church, when I overtook Mr. Sayer—I cannot positively swear that the prisoner is the man who robbed me, but strangers are very rare indeed in that part of the country, and therefore I consider that it must have been somebody who knew me—I considered at the time that it was the prisoner, by his height and size—there is nothing extraordinary about his size—after I was robbed, I went to the public house to see if the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—I had an opinion that I knew the person at the time I was attacked; I did not address him further than saying, "What are you going to do?" or, "What do you want?"—it was spread in the neighbourhood that night that I had been robbed, and the next morning the prisoner came down to my house, and told me that the <hi rend="italic">peelers</hi> had been taxing him with robbing me—he said, "You have been spreading a fine tale about me, say<lb></lb>ing that I robbed you last night."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you reply, "I did not say any such thing about you, I did not know who it was?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say I did not know who it was; I told him I said no such thing—I did not add, "I did not know who it was"—I swear that—I said, "It was a man with a white smock, with a handker<lb></lb>chief round his face"—it was what you may term a white smock—the gate of my farm house does not lead across the fields, it is close by the road side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260093"></xptr>
               <p>—the man did not go along any public path, he went through a gate which was standing open, into the field—that gate is ten or twelve yards from mine—he went towards Cawson's-lane—I mean to represent that that is in a direction from my house to his—it is not the other way—his father's house is on one side of the road, and Wilson's farm on the other—he went towards Wilson's farm, and his own house too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the rector of Greenford. I received information of this robbery on Thursday, 1st Feb., as near as I can guess, about half past 9 o'clock—I immediately went out with my gun to the gate leading into the prosecutor's premises, and traced footsteps from there towards Cawson's-lane, for about three quarters of a mile, across the fields—there were no other footsteps about—they went into Cawson's-lane, and from there I traced them to a footpath, and could trace them no further—that footpath leads into the village, almost direct to Hunt's house—they led to several fences, which had been got over, and I traced them up to this lane—I did not trace them up to a wall—I informed a policeman of where I had lost the track—that was less than a quarter of a mile from the prisoner's house—there was a place at Mr. Woodman's gate where the snow had been trampled down, about twice the size of this table, as if there had been a scuffle; and a little beyond that the snow was trampled down, as if a man had been standing behind, the hedge—the footmarks in the snow were quite recent, and not at the ordinary distance, but very long steps, as of a man running—Mr. Wilson's is just opposite the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You traced the footsteps until you lost them by a wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I traced them up to the footpath, which was trampled on, and there lost them—as far as I did trace them it was in the direction of the prisoner's house, but avoiding the lane until he crossed the road and got into the footpath.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and live at Greenford. On the night in question, about half past 9 o'clock, I was near the Rectory gates, and heard a person cry, "Murder!" several times—the sound proceeded from down the road leading towards Harrow, in the direction in which the prosecutor iives—his gate is about 200 yards down the lane—I went down, and, just before I got to the gate, Mr. Woodman came up, and said that he had been robbed—I went to his gate, and had some conversation with him—he said that the person went over Bennett's field gate—I traced footsteps in Bennett's field—they went through the field for some distance, and then through a hedge, and towards Cow-lane—I traced them up to Cawson's-lane, and afterwards informed Mr. Middleton.</p>

On Thursday evening, Feb. 1st, about 10 o'clock, I was going up stairs, looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner coming from the field—I knew him well—Mr. Woodman's gate is about a mile from our house—if a person went round in the direction of Cawson's-lane, that would be in the direction of our house—the distance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260094"></xptr>
               <p>from the prosecutor's gate to Cawson's-lane, and round to our house, would be about a mile altogether—there was no footpath in the direction in which the prisoner was coming—he was going fast—he got out of the field by breaking down a fence and getting over the hedge into the paddock—there is no footpath there—he had no business there—I said, "You are trespas<lb></lb>sing," and he crouched down, and went in a stooping position to the wall—I then went to another window, and saw him near the wall on the same side—I did not see him get over the wall, but there was only an interval of a second between my seeing him on each side of it—he could not go round the wall; there was no way but by getting over—I afterwards saw him go to his father's house, which is opposite ours—the field where I saw him is at the back of our house—a person could come from Cawson's-lane by crossing that field—that would be the shortest way—I saw no other person about that night—I could not see as far as Cawson's-lane; it was a very light night, but the distance prevented me—the moon was very nearly full.</p>

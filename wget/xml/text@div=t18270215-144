            . I live in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's, and keep a sale-shop. On the 17th of January the prisoner, William Spicer, brought me these candlesticks for sale - I asked how he came by them; he said "Never mind, it is all right" - he said his name was William Spicer, of No. 7, Grub-street, which I put down; he wanted 4s. for them - I told him to come again in half an hour, and if it was all right I would give him that - I sent for an officer, who went to Grub-street; the two prisoners ran into the shop some time after, and George put his hand over the wooden guard and took hold of five of them - I caught hold of him as he was going out, and held him - the officer came and took them both.</p>

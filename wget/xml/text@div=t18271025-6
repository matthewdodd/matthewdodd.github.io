            . I am a labourer, and live near St. Katherine's Docks. I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and a parcel of people round him - he got up, and said he was robbed of his watch; he ran after the prisoner, and I ran also - I saw him stopped; I never lost of him till he was taken - I am sure he is the man who ran immediately from the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Botolph Without, Aldgate. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about half-past eleven o'clock at night, quite out of breath - I asked him what he was; he said a hatter, and that he lived at the west-end of the town - I asked him where there; he said at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been ill for nearly five months; on the evening in question I had been to the Borough for a bottle of medicine - I met a friend, which kept me later than I should have been; as I came over Towerhill, I saw three or four men hustling together; I was four or five yards from them, and heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! I stepped quick to get out of the way, and was taken - nothing was found on me but the medicine; the witness told the watch-house keeper that he saw me knock him down, but he told the Magistrate he did not see me knock him down, but saw me run away; the prosecutor said I was the man who knocked him down, and held him down - that I tripped him up, and knelt on his breast; the Magistrate asked if he saw me kneel on his breast, he said No, he did not: it is not likely I could knock a man down and rob him, being in the state I am: when he came to the watch-house, he was in a heavy state of liquor - he admitted to the Magistrate that he had been at a raffle, and drinking beer: my friends are not here, not expecting I should be tried so soon.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GARDE. I had been at a raffle, and drank my share of two pots of beer among fourteen or fifteen persons - I was as sober as I am now.</p>

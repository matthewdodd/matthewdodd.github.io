In the Royal Artillery: On the 13th of March, I accompanied Mrs. James to see her children, and Miss Clark was with us, she is here, Mrs. James is confined to her bed; we went to Mrs. Balam's house at <placeName id="t18000528-67-crimeloc376">Enfield-chace</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. During the time he lifted up his crape had you an opportunity of observing his face? - A. I cannot be positive to any thing more than his chin; he was not content with what he had got, but said, don't hesitate, I shall be troublesome, or I shall shoot, or something to that effect; I saw your watch, give it me; the ribbon hung out, upon which I gave it him, and he rode away.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was it? - A. I am not positive, I was so intent upon the man, I did not observe the colour of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your way to town, did you give an alarm at the turnpike-gates? - A. At the desire of the ladies, I desired the postillion to tell every person he met of the robbery, and also at the turnpike-gates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass through any turnpike-gates? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this person, whoever it was, be with you during this transaction? - A. The transaction could not be more than two or three minutes at the utmost.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280064"></xptr>Q. How long was it before you saw the man now at the bar in custody? - A. It was nearly a month, or, I believe, it might be nearly two months, I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; the man who stopped us was a man about the same height as the prisoner, his hair of the same colour, very dark hair, and a very great resemblance of the chin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. It was two months before you saw the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him without a crape? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a pistol that man had who robbed you? - A. He had a small brass mounted pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the crape was divided into two pieces or one? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the crape at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose that crape to have been the same? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. James was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the able to swear to the person of the prisoner? - A. I do not think her evidence was stronger than mine.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live near the gate at Enfield-chase, two of Mr. James's children were at nurse with me: On the 13th of March, Mrs. James came to see her children, with captain Owen and Miss Clark, and left me a little after two by my watch; before they got into the chaise, I saw a gentleman walking his horse; the wheels of the chaise had not got through the gate, when I saw him go up to the post lad, and bid him stop, he said to captain Owen,"Sir, it is of no use your hesitating, but give me your watch immediately, or I will blow your brains out;" then he gave him the watch, and left the chaise and came off towards me; I saw him pull off the crape, and put it into the crown of his hat, and went off by me towards Enfield, and the chaise towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you had a view of him from the time he put the crape inside his hat? - A. He walked his horse from the gate, and put up his crape into his hat, and then he went off at a great pace; I then saw all his head and face as you see mine now. (Pulling off her bonnet.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and see if you can see the man? - A. Yes; that is the gentleman. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. At this time, had you any body at home with you? - A. None but the two babies.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you might have a view of his face without any crape over it? - A. A very few minutes; our house is as close to the gate as it can be, it is not further from the gate than that white wall. (Pointing to the side of the Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you ever see the same person? - A. Yes, I saw him twice after; I saw him to the best of my knowledge, about three weeks or a months, I was all alone by myself; I saw him after that again, I cannot say how long after, I saw then alone, I saw him both times go through the same gate on horseback; I did not see him again till the day my husband took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the horse? - A. The horse that he robbed captain Owen upon, was a little dark chesnut, cropped.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice whether, at the other times that you saw him, he was upon the same horse? - A. No, upon a different horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you knew him again, not by the size or colour, or the circumstance of the horse being cropped, but by his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that common a convenient common to ride off, after having committed such an offence as this? - A. There are a number of turnings all manner of ways, to Potter's-bar, and different places; I told my husband of what I had seen directly as he came home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did your husband take him upon your description? - A. Yes, it was three weeks ago last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband with you at the time you saw him? - A. No, he came home; after I had seen him, my husband was in view, and the prisoner was in view at the time; I saw him on the day that my husband took him.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Had you known the person before the day on which he committed that robbery? - A. No; I said, Balam, there goes the gentleman that robbed captain Owen and my mistress, Mrs. James.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where your son was at that time? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again, and tell me if you have any doubt whether that is the man? - A. That is the man that robbed captain Owen, and took his watch, and put it in his right-hand waistcoat pocket to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of his hands did he take the watch with? - A. With his right-hand, and the bridle in his left.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he any whip? - A. He had a little came tucked into his boot.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his pistol at that time? - A. In his left hand with the bridle.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you observed the person twice, between the time of the robbery, and the time of the prisoner being apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no man in the house at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses near your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you alarmed your neighbours, and desired them to pursue him? - A. No, I did not; if I had seen any body on horseback come past, I should have alarmed them.</p>
               <p>Q. There are several houses in your neighbourhood? - A. Not close by.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was a chance whether you might ever see him again, and yet you gave no alarm? - A. I told several people, but he had got by so far, they could not have pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you did not go to your neighbours to give the alarm? - A. No, I have not time to gossip.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you, the second time, alarm your neighbours? - A. All that I have to say is, he is the man that robbed captain Owen.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not put yourself in a passion with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never heard of a reward of forty pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you expect, or your husband, to get forty pounds if that man is convicted? - A. I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know, that your husband will have forty pounds for apprehending him? - A. I have heard gentlemen say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you expect it? - A. To be sure, we shall have something, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to have the forty pounds? - A. Yes, I dare say we shall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you have given the same account to day, that you gave at Bow-street, when you were first examined? - A. I dare say I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if you have given the same account now, that you gave that day? - A. He is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you given the same account? - A. It will be found I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, at Bow-street, that he walked his horse back wards and forwards at the gate? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house immediately adjoining the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there a garden before your house, twenty or thirty yards? - A. There is only a little bit of a path.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. About as long as this board.</p>
               <p>(About a yard and a half.)</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was an extrordinary thing to see a man walking backwards and forwards? - A. No, I did not; I just saw him before they got into the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man you had never seen before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard all the conversation? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, he said, he would blow his brains out, if he did not give him the watch; upon your oath, was that the expression that was made use of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if it has been sworn, that the expression was, I will be troublesome to you, it is not correct. -</p>
               <p>Court. That is argument rather than question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were these very young children? - A. One about two years old, and the other a baby of twelve months old to day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go across the common and leave these two children? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not assert, at Bow-street, that the man that robbed captain Owen galloped past you, with a crape over his face, and that the wind blew it on one side? - A. No, I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am herdsman and common driver to the parish of Edmonton, my business is about the common from morning till night: On the 9th of May, I was coming home from Barnet, and when I got on to the common, my wife held up her finger to me, and beckoned; I touched my horse, and was home in a minute, she clapped her hands together, and said, good God, Joe, here is the highwayman that robbed my mistress, Mrs. James, and Miss Clark, and captain Owen; I said, give me my shoes and my stick, and my bill, and I will pursue him, and take him, please God blesses me; Mr. Franklin was in sight then, and no other man but Mr. Franklin; I pursued him, I in my cart, and Mr. Franklin Jogging along upon his horse; I pursued him nearly a mile, and then I got nigher to him; there was a load of dung coming, and I put with my hat upon my stick, for the men with the dung to stop him, but they did not; I drove down to the gate that parts Enfield-common and Edmonton-common; I then stopped down in my cart, and took up my stick and my bill, and got down out of my cart, and sprung at his horse's bridle, and caught it; I up't with my hand, I told him, he was the man that robbed Mr. James, on the 13th of March, he hesitated a little, and said, it would not do; I told him it should do, it was either him or me, it is either your life or mine; says I, I will take you; he immediately flew from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280066"></xptr>his horse, he went off on the off-side of the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By the off-side, do you mean the right-hand side or the left? - A. The off-side is the right-hand side, and the near-side is the left-hand; I was standing on the left-hand side of the horse, he got off from the different side to what you would get up on horseback; Mr. Franklin then flew from the hind part of the horse to make for the Chace, and so did I, caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run far? - A. No, we both joined like at the hind part of the horse; I had hold of the shirt of his coat, then we scuffled till we tumbled into a great muddy ditch together, luckily, it was my fortune to be at the top; I squeezed him into the mud; I clapped one hand upon the nape of his neck; and my knee on his loins, and said, where is your pistol, it is in my waistcoat-pocket, he says, I turned him a little on one side, and took the pistol out of his pocket; my son then came up, and I desired him to take hold of one of his hands, and we pulled him out of the ditch together; we then took him into my son's cottage; he said, do not beat me, for I am fairly taken; we got him into the cottage, and he begged some water and a towel to wash himself, he was dirty from being in the ditch; after he had washed himself, and refreshed a little, he made a very great plunge in the house, with a deal of resolution to try to get away to make his escape; then I set at him with a deal of resolution, and down with him in the house, and when he fell down, his hat fell off, and his crape fell over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not his hat fell off in the ditch? - A. No, his hat fitted on very tight this black thing; there are two pieces of lead, one at each corner of it; I then tied his hands behind him, and put him into a one horse cart that I had at the door; I took him to Mr. Gundry's just by, and from there I took him to Bow-street; my son went with me to London, Mr. Bond examined the pistol at Bow-street, and it was not loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear from your wife, of Mrs. James having been robbed? - A. They had been gone with the chaise about ten minutes when I came home, and then my wife told me directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. All that you knew of this man before you took him is what your wife told you? - A. Yes, I had seen him on the Common several times, I opened the gate to him one morning and pulled off my hat, I thought he was a gentleman; I saw him stop a chaise near Mr. Kingston's gate.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no robbery committed that day that you took him? - A. No, nor since.</p>

            , Jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the son of the last witness, I live on Ednonton-common; I saw my father get out of the cart, with his bill in his hand, close to the house where I live; I saw my father go up to the prisoner, that is the man, (points to the prisoner;) when my father laid hold of the prisoner's horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far does your father live from you? - A. About a mile and a half; I heard the prisoner say, it will not do; I heard my father say, if he moved his hand, or offered to put his hand to his body, he would chop it off, then the prisoner flew from his horse, and tried to run away, my father was close after him, he had hold of the flap of his coat, and there was a bit of a boggy place, a ditch, or what you may please to call it, and there the prisoner was taken, and my father got across him, and pinned his head down to the ground, and I came up and assisted, he laid hold of one side of him and I the other; he asked the prisoner where his pops were; he told him it was in his waistcoat-pocket, but not loaded; then we got him upon his legs, and took him into the house where I lived; then my father told me to get a string to tie the prisoner's hands; then the prisoner resisted very much and tried to get away, and the force of us all struggling with the prisoner, burst the door-way open, we tied his hands, and put him into the cart; in the struggle his hat came off, and the crape fell down over his face, we did not examine his pockets; this is the crape, it had two pieces of lead to it; we put him into the cart, he wished to be released, for his hands were tied behind him, and he was in very great agony; we stopped at the Cock, at Bowes-farm, and he called for one shilling's worth of brandy and water; he pulled out some money to pay for it, and said, that is all the money I have got, he had eight or nine shillings and a half-guinea; I said, it was a very bad day for him, and he said, it was a very good day to him, for he was tired of his life; then we brought him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The post-boy is here, I shall not examine him, but I will call him, if my learned friends chuse to examine him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know whether the horse he rode was a cropped horse? - A. I cannot say I know, it was thin of hair at the tail.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not captain Owen bid you push on, after he got into the chaise? - A. I did not hear him.</p>

               <p>Q. After the robbery, did you take the nearest road to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I cannot swear that, captain Owen desired me to stop at a house on the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop at that house? - A. Yes, afterwards, but I went a little way out of the way, because I understood him I was to turn to the left, and I went a little way out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go out of the way? - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drive them from London to this lady's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have known your way back again? - A. Yes; but when the gentleman told me to stop at the house on the left, I thought I should turn to the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was only a quarter of a mile out of the road, did you not drive three quarters of a mile out of the road? - A. No, not so far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the direct turnpike road to London after that? - A. Yes, the same way we came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Who was your guide upon the road? - A. The ladies pointed to me, I did not know the way; I looked back, and when I came to the turning, the ladies pointed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, how often have you seen him in your life? - A. I do not know that I ever saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never saw him before the day you drove the ladies? - A. I may have seen the man, but never to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear you never saw him before the time that the ladies were robbed? - A. To the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I hardly know how to express myself upon this dreadful occasion; I am a very unfortunate man as well in health as pecuniary circumstances, and it is a very improbable thing that a man like me, who has a very bad rupture at this moment, and which I have had for a number of years, should attempt such an offence as this; I have had the honour of serving in the navy, as a <rs id="t18000528-67-deflabel377" type="occupation">midshipman and captain's clerk</rs>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

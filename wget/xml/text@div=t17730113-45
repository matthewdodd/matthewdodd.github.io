At first I would not shew it her; in about two or three minutes after, on her asking to see the watch again, I shewed it her; she snatched it out of my hand and put it into her bosom, and told me I should have it again; on demanding it, at last, she said she had it not, but another young woman had got it. When I first saw her (not at the time we went into the house) I asked her where she was going; she said to the one Tun; upon which I told her I would follow her there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have it?</p>
               <p>Harris. The owner broke it; I was to put a chain to it and to get it monded.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner have the watch in her hand; she put it into her bosom; they staid and drank a pint of hot, and seemed to be very agreeable, and in about a quarter of an hour went out together; they sat there a quarter of an hour very sociably together, after he said she had the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Glavin. On the afternoon of 27th Dec. I was going through Judd-street and saw a crowd—I had one half-crown, fourteen shillings and sixpence in my pocket, in a printed paper—I took it out, sat down on a step, and put my money in my lap while I undid my boot—while I was sitting down a lad and a woman walked against me—when I had put my boot to rights I got up and walked on a few steps—I then missed my money—I heard a lad call out, "Mistress, you have dropped something," and a gentleman at the next door asked if I had anything in paper—I went after the lad but he got away; who he was I don't know—it was my husband's money.</p>

                  </hi>. I was going through Judd-street about three in the afternoon of 27th Dec.—I saw Mrs. Glavin sitting on a step of a door—I saw her get up, and I saw a parcel lying on the step where she had been sitting—I suppose it must have dropped out of her clothing as she got up—I saw the prisoner pick it up—I knew him by sight—he must have seen Mrs. Glavin sitting there, he was close by her—I called out, "Mistress, you have dropped something"—she turned round—the prisoner walked a little way and then ran, and I lost sight of him—there was a woman with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Judd-street. On the afternoon of 23d Dec. I saw Mrs. Glavin stooping down to the step, and a small paper parcel lying by her—I saw two women and a lad standing just against her when she was stooping—I saw the lad pick up the parcel and put it in his pocket—he turned to the two women who were standing on the pavement—the prosecutrix turned and missed the parcel—I saw her looking about for it—I spoke to her, she did not understand me—she went towards the New-road—the boy who picked up the parcel stood with the two women—they then parted, he walked with one of them a few yards and then left her and ran away.</p>

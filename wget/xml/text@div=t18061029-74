             sworn . Q. You are a journeyman to Mr . Newbury, a baker, in London Wall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday the 16th of October, do you remember her coming to your house. - A. Yes, she asked me for a twopenny loaf , then she asked me for a stale half quartern, I put one down to her, that came to sixpence halfpenny , she put down a shilling, I was going to give her change in copper, she asked me to give her sixpence in silver; I gave her sixpence out of my right hand and with my left hand I picked up the shilling from the counter, instantly as I picked the shilling up Mr. Ankers and Mr. Jenkins came in, they asked me what money I had taken of the woman (she was present), I told them that shilling that I had in my hand, Mr. Ankers said look at it, I looked at it and refused it, I said it was not a good one; Mr. Ankers looked at the shilling, saying, that he had one before, he had rubbed it, he said that is not the shilling, she has that shilling upon her now he believed; Mr. Ankers then ordered the constable to search her, she put her hand in her pocket and laid half a guinea on the table, she said she had no other money, they believed that to be a good half guinea; the officer turned her pockets out and found six sixpences and thirteen or fourteen pennyworth of halfpence; she took the half guinea from the counter and put it into her mouth, the officer forced it out, and then three shillings came out of her mouth; they appeared equally as bad as the other shillings .</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ANKERS sworn . I keep the White Hart, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening that we have been speaking of the prisoner came to your house. - A. Yes, she asked for a glass o gin, she tendered me a shilling, which I discovered to be a bad one, I laid it on the floor and rubbed it with my foot and spoiled it, then she offered me half a guinea, I told her I I could not change it; she told me she had taken the shilling of a butcher in Leadenhall Market, she would carry it back and get it changed; I followed her into London Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. In going there did you see Jenkins, the constable. - A. I desired him to go with me, I followed her into Mr. Newbury's, I saw Spall, I asked what she gave him, he said a shilling, he sounded it on the counter, he pronounced it a bad one, I then immediately gave her in charge to the officer; he searched her and produced some halfpence and six sixpences out of her pocket; the sixpences that were taken from her were good.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came from my work on Saturday I had about seven shillings, I had a half crown piece and the rest sixpences and halfpence; I was going to market and to my sister, I have had a little boy of her's a year and a half, I went to her to receive half a guinea for the child's two weeks; as I came from there there were some Jew boys playing before me, I kicked this paper before me, which contained the five shillings; I went into Mr. Anker's for half a quartern of the best gin, I thought if one was bad the others might not , I told him I had taken it at the butcher's; I thought if I had said that I picked them up he would have said that I stole them.</p>

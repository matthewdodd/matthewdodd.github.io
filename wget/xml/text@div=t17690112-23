On the 31st of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in a back room-joining the shop. I heard the door open with great quickness, and something go in and come out again in an instant. Upon which I imagined somebody had been in and stole something. I went into the shop, and had not been there above two or three minutes, before my shop was surrounded with people, and a neighbour came in with the prisoner and my bundle of muslin. I asked the prisoner if he had any accomplices? He made no answer. I took him before Sir

I crossed the way, and laid hold of him; he slipped through my hands: I catched him again. I saw he had a bundle in his hand as he came out. Another person took up the bundle he had dropped. I took that and him into the shop. We took him before the Justice, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>I live at Pancras, it was the 16th of November, I and my wife had been to see an acquaintance, and coming home from Long-lane, Smithfield, five men overtook us a little beyond the new cut going to <placeName id="t17841208-25-crimeloc143">Battle-bridge</placeName>

               <p>What did you lose? - I had about two or three shillings in my pocket, and some halfpence, a particular rule with tables upon it, and two glass drops in my pocket, one of which was off; there was an old knife, and there was a paper of tacks, and a particular bad half-penny, there was a piece of the side of the woman off the left hand as she fits, it is a base metal half-penny; I had a little favourite dog followed them, and kept barking at them, and I told my wife I would follow them; I pursued them fifteen or twenty yards distance, and kept sight of them, they kept together and kept the foot path, and I heard them at last say hush, and several little trifling words; after sometime following them softly, I heard the patrol, I saw three men meet him, I heard one of the patrol whom I know by the gruffness of his voice, say who are you? I then went up and said, you are the man that robbed me; I then told the patrol to hold them, and they took them to the public house and searched them; and Tabbs said to me, when they were taken, we did not use you ill, did we, I told him not so much as he might think of, for my wife was almost dead; then they were searched, and upon Shaw there was the bill of a sale, part of it, and it seemed as if it had been torn, and the bad half-penny; on Tubbs and Buttledoze, I believe the rest of the property was found, but I was not in the room while they searched them.</p>
               <p>Then by your account, these men kept together, and never were out of your sight till the patrol stopped them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did these persons overtake you, or meet you? - Overtook me when they were coming down the hill, they were coming the same way that we were, but walked very quick, we were going from town to Pancras.</p>
               <p>I was a very hazy night you say? - Not very, it was rather darkish, we could see the lamps, Tabbs first laid hold of me, I know Shaw's face, for he on a white drabish coat.</p>
               <p>If you had seen the parties, any of them next day, should you have known them? - Yes, if I had seen the faces of them I might; but I did not see the faces of any of them when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>It was about ten? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many of the Bagnigge-wells people were on the road I suppose? - I met the foot patrol a few minutes before, I saw no other persons.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect to a certainty, the number of persons that were about you and your wife? - Yes, I should think there must be more rather than less.</p>
               <p>And you ventured to follow these five fellows, whosoever they were, that robbed you, at the distance of fifteen yards? - I did, my wife at the same time said to me, they would turn round and murder me, I said, if they turned round I could run faster than they.</p>
               <p>What for the sake of two shillings? - Perhaps to have them punished for frightening my wife, for she has since had a dead child on the occasion, I did not lose sight of them at all.</p>
               <p>It seems you was under some suspicion from the patrol yourself? - I have come that way late.</p>
               <p>They never took you to any place of safety? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Did any of them attempt to escape of this cluster that you followed? - No, they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080073"></xptr> all close together, they made no attempt to escape, they had no notion of my being so near them, I saw no other persons coming on the road.</p>
               <p>If any person met them, could you see through them? - They could not meet them, because I was so close to them, none of them were out of my sight.</p>

               <p>I have lain-in three weeks next Tuesday,</p>
               <p>Do you know any of these men? - Gentlemen, I perfectly well know all their faces, but I cannot swear to any particular, but I believe all of them to be the same; they were never out of my sight, I was about two or three yards at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Was you, who was behind your husband, near enough to see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they ever get out of your sight before the patrol met them? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they keep all together? - They seemingly kept together, they were very merry and jovial till the patrol met them, and my husband said, that he heard one of the patrol's voices, and he immediately ran after them.</p>
               <p>Did they remain so in your sight, that you could see whether they continued in the same party, or whether some went off and others came? - No, they all continued in the same party, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have only a general recollection of their faces? - No more.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing any persons cross over the way, about the time that the patrol surrounded the parties that you followed? - No.</p>
               <p>To your knowledge or observation, did any person meet them, or in any direction come near them? - No, Sir, none that I observed, not one.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol, I stopped these men near the Bull, Battle-bridge, near the rope walk belonging to Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>Did you meet them, or follow them? - Met them, we had just come down from Pancras, there were four of us, and we four met them five; there were three first, and two directly after them, not five yards from them, partly altogether, as they could come along upon the foot path; we suspected them, we immediately surrounded them, and took them to the Bull, at Battle-bridge, and searched them; but before we got to the public house, up came Mr. and Mrs. Francis, and said, they had been robbed, I searched Buttledoze, and on him I found this knife, under his stockings and breeches; the prosecutor owned the knife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you take Buttledoze? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. This seems to be the very knife I used to have in my pocket, here is a very trifling mark at this end, I have taken notice of the knife; I found it going to Pancras, and I had a thought of engraving my name upon it, but I do not attempt to swear it, it is only like that which I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take notice of that flaw at the end of it? - I think I did, to the best of my knowledge, and I have known it for three or four months; I think I might, but I will not be positive, I took notice of no mark on the blade of it, I cannot say positively, but to the best of my knowledge it is mine.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November last, I and three more of the patrol met the prisoners at the bar all together, as close as they could walk; we surrounded them and took them, and just as we had taken them, the prosecutor and his wife came up just behind them; he said, hold them fast, they have just robbed me and my wife; we took them into the Bull, at Battle-bridge, and I searched Tabbs, and found this rule and two drops, and two papers of little tacks, which the prosecutor swears to be his property; I searched Harris, there was nothing found upon him that the prosecutor owned.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This particular rule I know to be mine by the tables, a pence-table, a multiplication table, and a numeration table; I never have seen another like it, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080074"></xptr> makes me think it is mine, there may be others like it, but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. This is not so uncommon as the knife by far, there are hundreds such as that; from the general appearance of it, do you believe it to be your's? - I do, these two glass drops, one of them has a little eye off it, we were working at them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not find any offensive weapon on Shaw? - No.</p>
               <p>Or any knife? - No, only a common walking stick.</p>

               <p>How many sticks had they got among them? - Two or three.</p>
               <p>Court to Francis.

               <p>Is that the paper? - This is the paper, I can swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Benshanm Road, Thornton Heath—about two years ago I made the acquaintance of Kettle—I knew him as a stockbroker, at 18, Austin Friars, trading under the name of Kettle and Crowe, that was in October, 1877—I knew Kettle there up to June, 1878, when I left—I was employed in the office—there were two rooms, I sat in the outer room, Kettle occupied the inner room, and Mr. Crowe when he was there—the name of Kettle and Crowe only remained up for about two months, not longer, certainly; it was then painted out—while that name was up Crowe came frequently—he came less often after the dispute arose—there was some litigation between Kettle and Crowe, and then Crowe ceased to come but seldom—he resumed coming about February, 1878, and then con<lb></lb>tinued to come from time to time until June, when I left—sometimes he would call every day. and sometimes it would be two, three, or four times a week—he would remain perhaps half an hour or an hour in the inner office with Mr. Kettle, and sometimes in the outer office—after the name of Kettle and Crowe was painted out the name of Robinson and Co. was put up, that was myself—that name remained up to June—I think it was the end of June when I left—I think I saw Crowe a day or two before I left—my salary was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known Kettle from about the commencement of 1877, probably it might have been the end of 1876—I knew him for six months before I knew Mr. Crowe—I went to Austin Friars in October, 1877—they were both present when I was engaged—Kettle engaged me and paid me my salary—the business carried on was the stockbroking business—Kettle was the stockbroker—the name of Kettle and Crowe was painted up the day I went there; Kettle gave the order for it to be done—I kept the books—there was an account entered to Mr. Crowe of the transactions that occurred—they were transactions of the same character as those of any other customer of Kettle's—there were about four or five other customers I think that used to come to the office, not more—I posted the books as the business was done—my connection with the books ceased in June—I did not make out the accounts to Kettle's estate—the customers who came to the office were Mr. Ince Hardy, Henry Hardy, and Hulford—Power was not a customer, nor Wheatley—there was an account in the name of Bailey, but I never saw him to my knowledge—there was an account entered in the name of Golding, but I never knew anybody of that name coming to the office, a youth named Giles used to come—I did not know Buscheck—they would come to the office to see Kettle; sometimes they would stay nearly all day—some of them used to come every day, those that did transactions—I think Mr. Henry Hardy was there most often—I should say he was there a great deal more than Mr. Crowe—Mr. Ince Hardy was there, but not so often—I think it was about Nov. or Dec., 1877, that the dispute arose between Kettle and Crowe—I think the transactions which Kettle had done on behalf of Crowe had invariably resulted in a loss to Crowe—at the time of Kettle's liquidation, in May, 1878, I believe that loss amounted to 725<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a writ was issued by Kettle against Crowe—I don't know anything about a debtor's summons, I know there was litigation between them; an action was brought and Mr. Crowe resisted it; it was eventually settled, I cannot tell how; they told me that it was settled, that is all I know—I don't know anything about the liquidation, I had nothing to do with it—the name of Robinson and Co. was put up when the dispute took place with Crowe; Kettle said, "I won't have Crowe's name up any longer, I will have your name put up"—I cannot tax my memory with the date exactly; it was about two months after I went there to the best of my recollection—Robinson and Co. was put up by Kettle's order—Crowe used to come to the office occasionally after that—I did not do any business, the business was all done in Kettle's name, not in mine—there was no business done in the name of Robinson and Co. at all—some transactions took place later for Mr. Crowe, in the fore part of 1878, I think in May or June, by Kettle—I was in the office at that time—I was not a partner with Kettle—all transactions were done in his name; he was the only sworn broker, I was not, nor were either of the Hardys or Crowe—there was never any balance-sheet struck between Kettle and Crowe, no partnership accounts of any kind, all separate accounts.</p>

The signatures to these two cheques (J. and S.) are Crowe's—the body of them looks very much like Kettle's writing—I believe Crowe filled up his own cheques—I cannot say whether these are like his writing—they look more like Kettle's writing to me—I should not like to swear to it.</p>

P. and Q.) were not written by me or by my authority—they are very good imitations of my writing—neither of these two cheques (A. and C.) were written by me or by my authority—they are very good imitations—all five appear to be of the same character—I first discovered these forgeries on Monday, 7th October—they amount to about 14,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing of the prisoner—I knew Kettle; he had been a porter at the Bank of Commerce, of which I was chairman.</p>

On 27th November I was in the Liverpool Street station, the prisoner arrived there by a country train—I said "Your name is Crowe"—he said "No"—I told him I was a police officer, and I should take him into custody for being concerned with a man named Kettle in a forgery on Williams and Deacon's Bank—he said "You have made a mistake; I know nothing about it"—I took him to Bow Lane station—on the way there he said "My name is Crowe"—I said "You might as well have said so at the first"—I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

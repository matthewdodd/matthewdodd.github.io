             sworn. - I know no more than what Tanner has said; Hillair said he would not join a foreign enemy; I did not perceive that he was very much intoxicated, but I have heard since that he was for he had been drinking gin, and I cannot tell what.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BROOKES sworn. - I was sent for to Mr. Tanner's and there was Bonnein and Hilliar there: Tanner gave me charge of them; they were both in as great a state of intoxication as ever I saw men.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlement of the Jury, intoxication is certainly no defence; but if you think that this was a drunken conversation, they not knowing what they said, you will acquit the defendant; but if you think this man was of a wicked disposition, and wishing to overturn the Government, to be sure you will find him guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. On the 7th of April I stopped the prisoner coming out of the docks, and found on him this bell-pull, door-handle, and half-pound weight—he said they belonged to his master, and he had been at work on board the <hi rend="italic">Parsee</hi>—as I was taking him towards the <hi rend="italic">Parsee</hi> he said it was not the <hi rend="italic">Parsee</hi>, it was the <hi rend="italic">Gustee</hi>—as we were coming along we met the mate of the <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi>—he said, "There is the mate I have been at work for"—I asked the mate if he knew the articles, and he said yes, they belonged to the ship.</p>

Hagan and Co., of Dock-head—I have the care of the property on board, and am answerable for anything that is lost—John Hart is the captain—he is in the country—I know these things to belong to the vessel—the prisoner had no right to take any of them—they were taken from the cabin which he was painting—I had missed the copper in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was sent on board to do some glazing; my putty-knife fell out of the stern window; I went on to the beach to get it, and found these two pieces of copper, which I put into my pocket; next day I found this brass weight and knob in the dust-hole—as I was coming to dinner Trotter stopped me, and asked what I had; I said, "Nothing that is any secret, I will show you," and I gave them to him.</p>

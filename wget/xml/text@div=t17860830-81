               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you the Gentlemen of the Jury, this indictment charges the gentleman at the bar with a capital offence; and when you see such a prisoner, standing in such a situation, I have no doubt but you expect that there is something peculiar in his case; and if you do form at this moment such an expectation, with respect to this case, I do assure you, you will not be disappointed; for it will call for your most serious and careful determination; you have just tried and convicted a man * upon a constructive felony, a felony committed by a stretch of ingenuity: Gentlemen, the present case is a clear and plain felony, about which the law is clearly understood, committed however by a stretch of ingenuity not very different from the other; for the other was the stale practice of ring dropping, and this is the stale story of playing at A. B. C. Gentlemen, you will have no question at all to try in the result of this business, but whether the prisoner now at the bar is the person that committed the robbery imputed to him by the indictment; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300114"></xptr> that the felony has been committed, and that it has been committed under the circumstances I shall state to you, will be beyond all possible question, and the only question for your determination will be who committed it. Gentlemen, the prosecutor of this indictment is a Mr.

B. C. Gentlemen, this sort of game called A. B. C. is shortly this, one party marks a letter under a pot or bowl, or something they are drinking out of, that is covered, and you are to guess; the poor gentleman, the prisoner, he lost all his money had but very few good guesses; upon which, he went out, staid a few minutes, and came back again, and then lost all that; then he applied to his new friend, the Major, to lend him a little, and he lent him thirty-two guineas, out of thirty four, that was soon gone, and he applied again; the Major had only two left, he took them, and held them in his hand looking at them; they were his two last guineas; says he, these are all I have got, no, I cannot spare these; upon which the prisoner at the bar (which makes this a capital offence, as my Lord will tell you) snatched these two guineas from him, swept the other into his hands that lay on the table, and he and the other man ran away: Major Welch immediately said, he had been robbed, and wanted somebody to assist to pursue them; the Major knew nothing of this town as we do, for you seldom get much assistance in those houses to which the sharper himself conducts you; however, in short, Major Welch saw no more of this man at the bar for a considerable time, four or five days, but when he did see him, he saw him under these peculiar circumstances; he had not compleated all his business at the Treasury, and he was attending there again, and he saw him sitting in an outer room; he will tell you upon his oath, that he instantly recognized him, he spoke to him, and charged him with the robbery, but the prisoner was very angry at the charge, and they went before Sir Sampson Wright, where the Major positively persisted in making it. Gentlemen, as far as the Major's positive testimony can go, there can be no doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, as far as human recollection can go, whatever may be his character or appearance otherwise; and I shall also call to you General and Major Cunningham, and they will tell you whether they know the prisoner again, and it seems they took some notice, because one said to the other, I wonder who Welch has got with him. Gentlemen, if it should appear to you on the evidence that I have stated this case too strongly; if I have stated to you one fact, or half a fact that cannot be proved to your satisfaction by witnesses, you will not take any thing for proof merely because I have stated it; but you will try this man as you do all others, by the evidence and not by any thing that we say to you; if you find him guilty, you will pronounce him so; if you have any doubt about his guilt, you will acquit him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What is your profession? - I am a private gentlemen; I was a Major in the North Carolina regiment; I have been in England since last January; I have been soliciting in the Treasury for three or four months, that occasioned me to attend there very frequently; I used to attend in the outer hall, which is the same hall where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300116"></xptr> I saw the prisoner; General Cunningham is likewise an American General; he and the Major had likewise business at the Treasury, and used to attend frequently there also, almost day by day; I had received three hundred and four pounds from the Treasury, and I lodge at No. 4, Clerkenwell Close; General and Major Cunningham lodge in the same house.</p>
               <p>How lately before the 10th of August, had you received any of that money? - I really cannot recollect the day, it was about a fortnight before I was preparing to leave this country; my family lives in the Bahama islands, in New Providence.</p>
               <p>How soon was you to go? - In a few days.</p>
               <p>Had you taken your passage? - I had, in the ship Lightening.</p>
               <p>What happened to you on the 10th of August? - I had been out bargaining for some clothes and things for the use of my family, as well as I can recollect, it was about six o'clock; I was returning to my own lodgings, and I met with this gentleman, he called himself Mr. Miles at that time.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - It was Thursday, the 10th of August, I met him just at the corner of Mutton-lane, adjoining to Hatton-street; Sir, says he, I think I have had the pleasure of seeing your face somewhere; I said perhaps you might; the next thing he said was, how is General Cunningham, and Major Cunningham; I told him they were very well; says he, I have had the pleasure of dining with General Cunningham in New York; says he, he was with Lord Cornwallis in America; I told him he was; says he, will you take a walk somewhere, and drink a glass of something or another to a public house; I told him that I was very sickly, and I did not wish to drink any thing; but he says to me, if you will go and drink a glass of something, I will go with you to see Major Cunningham; by his being acquainted with General Cunningham, he over persuaded me to step over with him to a publick house, opposite to Hatton-street; it was along Hatton-wall; I do not know the name of the house; there were coaches stood in the yard; there we had sixpenny-worth, or a shilling's-worth of rum and water; while we were drinking that, a stranger came in, and pulled out some papers, which seemed as if he had some intention to game, but I did not pay the least attention to what their game was.</p>
               <p>Did they converse together? - Yes, they did; then we walked away.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain what you mean by it seeming like gaming? - There was money produced from their pockets at the table.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the fact, whether they had any money there besides the paper? - Yes, they had.</p>

               <p>What sort of money was it, that was produced? - It was gold.</p>
               <p>Was it produced by one or both of them? - By both I believe, but I am not sure; I am sure it was gold.</p>
               <p>Why did it appear to you, that there was gambling going forward? - I really looked upon it, that they might have been acquainted for any thing I knew.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by either of them, that induced you to suppose they might have been gambling? - No, Sir, but by their actions, pulling out papers and gold.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by papers, bank notes? - They did so appear to me, but I did not take one of them in my hand; it appeared to be bank notes.</p>
               <p>Then when you said paper, you meant bank notes? - Yes, Sir, it appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass in conversation, that induced you to think they were gambling? - Nothing that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long did you continue in conversation after the third came in? - A few minutes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be there together? - About ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Mr. Bachellor; I asked him his name at that time, and he told me it was Miles; his being acquainted with General

             made me ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300117"></xptr> his name, to tell the General that I had seen an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the liquor? - Why I really think he did.</p>
               <p>You did not? - No, I did not; we went to my lodgings, No. 4, Clerkenwell Close; he went to see General Cunningham; when we came there, just as we came to the door, the General and the Major were going to take their evening's walk; we met them right upon the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner speak to his old friend the General? - No, he spoke to me, says he, as long as they are going to take their evening's walk, I will not interrupt them; they went out, and we two went in together; I went into the room to get a little money to pay for some things I had prized in Holborn; the prisoner went in with me; I took the money out of my chest; the prisoner saw me; it was in a purse; I have the purse in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell the prisoner what sum of money you was going to take with you? - No.</p>
               <p>You told the prisoner you was going to take some money? - Yes, to pay for something I had priced; I took thirty-two guineas in one purse, and I had two guineas in a leather bag; the purse with the thirty-two guineas was in my chest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner see you take this money out of the chest? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you count the money? - No, it was in the purse.</p>
               <p>Then if I understand you, the prisoner saw you take the purse up, and put it in your pocket? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might you continue in the room? - But a few minutes; we went out, I was in a bad state of health, I could not walk, upon which the prisoner said, let us call a coach, there is a stand of coaches on the green; and he called a coach, and we both got into the coach; the prisoner told the coachman to drive to the old Bell, in Holborn; there we got out; I was going into Holborn to pay for the goods; the prisoner paid the coachman; then the prisoner asked me to walk in, and drink a glass of something with him; we went into a little room on the ground floor; it was a little room across a little court.</p>
               <p>What side of the gateway? - It was the right side of the gateway; he called for sixpenny-worth, or a shilling's-worth of rum and water, I do not know which; while we were drinking that, and after we had been in the room a few minutes, in came this same man that was with us at the first house, or another.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say it was the same man or not? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you think? - I rather think it was; when he came in, the two gentlemen got to gaming; they had chalk, and a mug, or a quart pot.</p>
               <p>Who had the chalk? - I really cannot say which, it was in his pocket; they made A B C, under a pot; it was not the thing that we had our drink in; I am sure it was a pot, about a quart pot.</p>
               <p>Court. How did it come there; was it sent for by either of them? - I really do not know; they took the pot, and they set upon a particular letter.</p>
               <p>Who made the letter? - I am not positive which of them made the letter.</p>
               <p>What letters were made? - A B C.</p>
               <p>Where were these letters made in chalk? - They were on the table; then they pulled out their money, and were gaming; and they put the pot on one or other of the letters; and the other party was to guess what letter it was, if he guessed right, he was to win so many guineas; if he guessed wrong, then he lost.</p>
               <p>How many letters had they on the table at one time? - All three.</p>
               <p>Were they to guess as to the whole three, or one at a time? - One at a time.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, they were to shift the pot from one letter to another, and if they guessed the right letter that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300118"></xptr> was under the pot, they won? - He that put the pot down was not to look till he guessed.</p>
               <p>Was he to turn his back? - He was to turn his head away on one side, and not to look till he had guessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the same man always keep the custody of the pot; or did they alternately change the pot and guess? - The prisoner was always on the losing hand; there was six or seven guineas at a time staked; then they doubled their stakes; he still continued losing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see money pass between them, when they lost? - Yes, their money constantly lay on the table.</p>
               <p>As the betts were made and lost, did you see the money constantly paid? - Yes, it was always paid.</p>
               <p>Did you always see the prisoner pay the money to the other? - Yes, Sir, he moved it from his heap, to the heap of the other.</p>
               <p>How long might they go on at this rate? - It was but a short time.</p>
               <p>How long? - I do not think it was above eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they double their stakes every time they played? - I cannot say that, but I am positive that they doubled them towards the last; the prisoner, as I observed, was always on the losing hand; he lost all the money he apparently had about him, and he went out of the house for two or three minutes; when he returned, he produced guineas in plenty, twenty or thirty, or more; when he came in this time, he lost that at two or three guesses, at the letters again; he then asked me to lend him some; I lent him the thirty two guineas at twice or three times, as he asked me; that was all that was in that purse; he lost that, and says he to me, you have some more money; then I took out this little leather bag out of my pocket, and I told him I had but two guineas in it.</p>
               <p>Did you take it out of the bag? - I took it out of the bag, to convince him that I had no more; he snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did you lend it him? - No, I refused it; says I, Sir, this is all I have, and I cannot spare it; he snatched it out of my hand; says he, this will do; there lay all the money on the table, that they were both gambling for; then he swept all the money off the table into his hand, and put it into his pocket; I am sure it was the prisoner that did it, and they both made to the door together; they went out to the door; I stepped to the door as quick as I could; I met with the landlord at the door; his name is Garwood; I asked him which way those men went; he said, he saw no men; that was instantly after they went out; I told him I was robbed; I never stirred any more after him that day; it was very late.</p>

               <p>Court. How late was it? - I really cannot recollect, it might have been seven, or half after.</p>
               <p>How long do you think you was in the company of the prisoner? - I dare say, first and last, it was an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity during that time of observing his countenance and person? - I had certainly; and riding in the coach, and going to General Cunningham's together, and in the house where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see him? - I gave information next day at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - I searched after him on the Friday, and the Saturday; and the Monday following I had occasion to be at the Treasury to see my agent; I was just going off there, I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>In what circumstances, and where did you see the prisoner on that day? - I saw him in Whitehall, in the Treasury office, in one of the outer rooms; I stepped away to him; I immediately knew him as soon as I saw him; I spoke to him, Sir, says I, I have seen your face before; I am acquainted with you now.</p>

            's; I informed Sir Sampson how the matter stood, and he took bail for his appearance on the Wednesday following, at eleven o'clock; we met there; then the prisoner came, and then he was bailed to take his trial here.</p>
               <p>Be so good to look at him, and tell us upon the oath you have taken, whether you have any doubt that that is the man that got your money? - Not any at all.</p>
               <p>Have you ever entertained any doubt? - Not at all, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, prisoner's counsel. When you came to the Treasury, you went up to Mr. Bachellor, and told him that you knew him, and you took him on one side, and told him, if he would return the money, you would say no more about it; he told you that would not do for him, he was in the employment of government, and he had some business with Mr. Rose; I believe he was pretty riotous, and insisted that you should go to the Justice's? - He was very willing to go.</p>
               <p>Did not he insist on your going to the Justices? - He said he would quit the business with Mr. Rose, and go to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Did not he insist on going? - He seemed very willing to go.</p>
               <p>Did not he take you by the collar, and desire his friends to assist in taking you to the Justice's? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Who went to the Justice's, you and he quietly? - There were two other gentlemen went along with him, and two of my acquaintance followed behind.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you that his reputation was at stake, and he insisted on going before the Justice, to clear that character up? - No, Sir, he did not mention any such thing to me.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, Mr. Major. - He said, I will let my business alone, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300121"></xptr> drop my business with Mr. Rose, and will go to the Justice's with you.</p>
               <p>Why you know it was his offer, not yours; you would have dropped it? - No, my dear Sir.</p>
               <p>Do not call me dear Sir, for I hate the expression. - I would not have dropped it, we got to high words, then he said, I will quit the business I have with Mr. Rose, and we will go to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>You told the story exact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean accurately to say, that that man was bailed? - He was bailed.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to entrap you, now I will caution you. - He was bailed to meet on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Court. What was done that time? - There were gentlemen that came and bailed him before Sir

               <p>Mr. Silvester. You perfectly understand what I mean by being bailed, I mean persons giving security for his appearance: do you mean he gave security for his appearance on the Wednesday following? I think I cannot put it plainer. - Sir

               <p>Then how came you to tell this gentleman, that it rested on your evidence singly? - I mean my acquaintance that were on my side.</p>
               <p>What business might you be before you was in the army? - I was a gentleman always, I had a fortune.</p>
               <p>Was you any business? - No: I meant on my side of the question, I did not mean of the prisoner; I went for the waiter on the Monday he was examined.</p>
               <p>What did he say?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to what he said.</p>
               <p>Major Welch. Sir Sampson asked me if I knew of any body, and I said the waiter; he sent me for him.</p>
               <p>How came you then but a few minutes ago to tell these gentlemen there, that there was nobody examined on Monday, on your part? - I fetched the waiter, and produced him as a witness to prove whether he knew him or not.</p>
               <p>How could you tell these gentlemen, that there was nobody examined on your part on Monday? - I understood or meant by it, that there was none of my friends or acquaintance examined at that time.</p>
               <p>How came you, but two minutes ago;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300122"></xptr> to say there was no man examined on your part? - Because there was none of my acquaintance; this waiter was a stranger to me, Sir Sampson Wright sent for him, and I went for him.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was about six, I think you say? - Yes, Sir, as near as I can tell, or between six and seven, I am not positive, I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that man before in all your life? - Yes, I have, I think.</p>
               <p>You did not know where Mr. Miles lived? - I did not ask his name when I saw him in the Treasury-office, but I did when I met him.</p>
               <p>How came you to lend him thirty-two guineas? - Upon account of his being acquainted with General Cunningham, and dining with him at New York, and his being a particular acquaintance with Lord Cornwallis in America.</p>
               <p>It is very odd you did not introduce your good friend Mr. Miles to General Cunningham? - I thought he was better acquainted with him than I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not reckon the waiter a witness on your part? - No.</p>
               <p>That was what you meant, when you said there was no witness on your part? - Yes: I did not fetch him of my own head, the Justice told me: I had seen the prisoner at the Treasury before he accosted me in Mutton-lane.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am positive of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I commanded the militia as General; I bore that rank in the provincial army.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Major Welch? - In the year 1779: we have both been some time in England, and had business at the Treasury, and lodged at the same house. On Thursday the 10th of August, about five in the evening, I met them at the door, as I was going to take a walk with my cousin Major Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Who did you meet? - Major Welch and another man; Major Welch turned about, and spoke some words, the stranger spoke nothing; I cast my eyes steadily on the stranger, I saw something lusty and brave in the man, which drew my attention and after we went out of the door, I said to Major Cunningham, what good looking man is that with Major Welch? and we took our walk, and returned in the evening; I saw Major Welch that evening and on the Wednesday following, I waited on Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body at Sir Sampson's that you believed to have been at your quarters? - Yes, Sir, I saw the prisoner; he was not pointed out, but I cast my eye round, and said to my cousin, that is the man that was at our quarters.</p>
               <p>Will you be so good as to look at the prisoner, and tell us now whether you have a recollection of his person? - Why certainly he has all the appearance that that man had that passed into my quarters; but the time was so short, I think I must reflect on myself, if I should so far fix it, to ground a charge improperly against a man; but he has certainly all the appearance that that man had.</p>
               <p>Then I am to understand that you do not swear positively that he is the person? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it? - In my own mind I certainly do; one man cannot appear to me so like another as that person does; he had a hat in his hand, I did not see whether it was a round or a cocked hat; I did not see him more than two or three seconds; the Magistrate to the best of my recollection did not swear me, but I gave the same evidence as I give to you.</p>
               <p>You was not bound over? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was near five? - Yes; I cannot say whether it was half an hour before, or half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where is your relation the major? - He is at home sick, he does not know the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Do you remember his complaining he was robbed? - He said he had lost some money.</p>
               <p>Was that room a part of your dwelling house? - It is.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. What was it that Major Welch said? - He asked me where those two men were; I told him I did not know; he told me then that he had lost four and thirty guineas.</p>
               <p>What were the words that he told you? - That he had lost four and thirty guineas: I said to him, Sir, if you had made the least resistance in the world, there was people enough in the yard would have assisted you.</p>
               <p>Is this room, where Major Welch was, a part of your house.</p>
               <p>Yes, it is in the yard, where passengers go in, it is a part of the dwelling house on one side of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You told him there were several people would have assisted him? - Yes, there were enough to assist him, there are nine or ten coaches go from my house; I did not serve the people with liquors, I came out of the cellar fetching up some liquors, and I saw him in the parlour, and he called me in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Can you recollect the hour? - As near as I can guess, it was near five, or thereabouts, more or less.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you sure it was not fix? - No; it was on Thursday.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Major Welch being at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - A lustyish gentleman came in with him; the gentleman called for a shilling's-worth of rum and water; when I took it in, there was a third, he paid me for it, and I came about my business: I saw no more of them till they went out; they came out into the yard and parted.</p>
               <p>Who came out and parted? - The last man and Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Where was your master at that time? - In the opposite room.</p>
               <p>They shook hands and parted, did they? - Yes, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Who was this lustyish gentleman? - They call him by the name of Horne.</p>
               <p>You know him, do you? - I have seen him before.</p>

               <p>Does he frequent the Bell? - No, Sir, not often: the other gentleman's name is Wright.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him often there? - No, Sir, I cannot say I have.</p>
               <p>Have you seen them there together? - I have.</p>
               <p>What did you see on the table when they were all gone? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Any chalks? - No, Sir, there were no chalks.</p>
               <p>Who paid the reckoning? - That third person, I told you.</p>
               <p>You do not upon these occasions trust? - We do as we please.</p>
               <p>What became of the third gentleman? - I do not know, I did not see him go at all: Major Welch spoke to my master; in the course of five minutes, Major Welch returned to the room, after he had parted with that gentleman, then he turned about, and came to the door, and as he was standing at the door of the room, he beckoned him over.</p>
               <p>You was examined in Bow-street? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did they take your examination in writing? - Sir Sampson took the whole of it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are the waiter? - I am.</p>
               <p>You know the two men who were with Major Welch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon the oath you have taken, was that gentleman, Mr. Bachellor, one? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Look at the gentleman. - I have looked, and I am ready to take my oath that is not the gentleman, nor he never was in our house before, nor I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300124"></xptr> saw the gentleman till he sent for me about this affair at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is not at all like Horne perhaps? - Not at all in person, nor like the other man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What o'clock was it? - To the best of my remembrance it must be about five.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to take up the attention of the Court a single second longer than is necessary; but being placed at this bar in the situation I now stand, charged with a fact I am not guilty of, I hope I shall have the indulgence of the Court and the Jury, and I have not the least doubt but I shall receive that justice which I shall be found to deserve. I shall be much obliged to your Lordship to order me a little wine and water, I am very faint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If you are faint, the Court will order you a chair.</p>
               <p>(A chair ordered for the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>- BEAUFOY, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was with me from about half after four till five, on Thursday, the 10th of August; I am clear in my recollection of the day, because it was the day for the election of directors for the newly incorporated society for directing the fisheries: being myself a director of the society, and having taken in parliament an active part in the business of the fisheries, I arrived in town about eleven on that morning, Mr. Bachelor called upon me on business of a public nature: I told him, I could not attend to him at that time, as I was preparing to go out, but I should be glad to see him at half after four; I was detained by the society till a quarter before four, I returned to my own house about four, and went to dinner, and I had nearly finished my dinner when Mr. Bachellor came; there was a gentleman with me at the time, who was secretary to the society, his evidence and the evidence of my servant, will, I should suppose, corroborate my own.</p>
               <p>Jury. We do not put the gentleman on his defence, we are all satisfied.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. ROSE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff Watson. The Jury have given their verdict now, and I think it is but a justice due to the prisoner, to say, that Mr. Sheriff Sanderson, who knew him well, has taken the pains to write to me on the occasion, and he informs me that he has known him long, and many years to have been a <rs id="t17860830-81-deflabel407" type="occupation">Brewer</rs>

            . I was the officer on duty that night, and they called me up; I took the prisoner, and found two shillings and some half-pence in his right-hand pocket; the prosecutor stated that the prisoner had dropped the sixpence - the house was not half full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the Theatre, and the stairs were all full; I went up, and there was a great pressure at the top; the prosecutor turned round, and said"I have lost half-a-crown, and you must be the person who took it;" I said, "I have two shillings and some halfpence, that's all;" what he thought was a sixpence was a button - a woman took it up, and showed it to the Magistrate.</p>

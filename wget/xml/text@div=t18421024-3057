                  </hi>. I live in Kent-street, Borough. On the 18th of October, after twelve o'clock at night, I was going along Kent-street—I was a little in liquor—the prisoner tripped me up and threw me in the kennel—be stooped down, but I did not observe him take the money—it was in my waistcoat pocket—my coat was open—he left me instanta<lb></lb>neously, and when I got up I, missed my money and likewise the pad of my wooden leg—I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings and sixpences—I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the person—he did nothing to me while I was on the ground—he left me directly—he stooped down—I afterwards gave the prisoner into custody in consequence of something told me by the witness Barrett—I am certain he is the man—I had never seen him before to the best of my knowledge—I did not notice out of which house he came—it was quite dark, but it was light enough to see him—there was a lamp not far off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge in Kent-street, in the same house as the prisoner. On Tuesday night, the 18th of October, after eleven o'clock, I heard the prisoner ask the deputy who takes care of the house if she would trust him for that night's lodging—she said "No," and he walked out—he said he had got no money—I went to bed about twelve o'clock—he came in between one and two, and slept in the same room as I did—next morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw him with a pad in his hand—he went out and brought in a young woman with him, and took a lodging for her—I saw them go out together and they came in with a new pair of shoes, a hat, a new pair of stockings, a pair of trowsers, and a coat—he had gone out in an old jacket and cap about nine o'clock—on the Friday night I saw him at the door in his shirt sleeves talking to the young woman—the prosecutor, his wife, and child passed by the door and the prisoner began to laugh at him, and said that was the man he had knocked down in the kennel off the footpath, and that he took the pad from under his knee, that he might not follow him—the woman pushed him into the house and told him to hold his tongue, as he did not know who might be listening to him—I was afterwards going up the same side of the way and met the prosecutor and his wife—I spoke to him, and he gave me into the custody of the police—I went to the house—the prisoner was having his supper with the young woman, and the policeman took him into custody—the pad has not been found.</p>

The prosecutor gave Barrett into my charge—on her statement of the transaction, I went with her to a lodging-house, in Kent-street—she went in, came out, and gave me a description of the prisoner, and the part of the room he was sitting in—I went in and took him into custody—I brought him out—there was very little light where he stood, and the prosecutor said he thought he was not the man, but afterwards, when I took him into the house, where there was more light, he identified him, and gave him in charge—he made no answer to it, but said he thought he was taken for a robbery, which occurred with some girls, a few nights previous—the prosecutor pointed out to me the spot where he was knocked down—it was not more than eight or ten yards from the house where I took the prisoner—there is a lamp directly in front of the house—there was sufficient light to recognize any one—more so than where the prisoner stood when the prosecutor could not iden<lb></lb>tify him—the light from the lodging-house window throws a better light a little way off than close to it, and there is a gas light to a public-house adjoining—when the prosecutor expressed a doubt, I said, "Come into the house and look round, there are plenty of them here"—he came in with me and looked round, and after scrutinizing the prisoner more, he said he was the man.</p>

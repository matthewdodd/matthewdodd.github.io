             (Police-constable B 135.) On the 14th of December I saw this copper in the possession of a man named Plummer, in Sloane-square, Chelsea - he went into the Star and Garter public-house; I went in, and asked him where he got it - he said at a marine-store shop in Queen-street, Pimlico; I took him there, and found Mrs. Martin - I took her and Plummer to the station, and then Martin went with the serjeant, and found the prisoner.</p>

            . I keep a marine-store shop, at No. 7, Queen-street, Pimlico. I bought the copper of the prisoner; I had seen him before - he lived in the neighbourhood - I bought it about half-past five o'clock in the evening of the 12th of December, for 7s., at the rate of 6d. a pound; I asked whose it was, and he said it was all right - I sold it for 11s. on the 14th, to Plummer.</p>

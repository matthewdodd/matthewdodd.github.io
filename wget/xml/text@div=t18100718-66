               <p>Court. What time of night might this be - A. About half past ten, the prisoner appeared to be coming from the King's New road, he met me very near the pound, as if he came from the King's New-road, he seized hold of the lappels of my coat violently; he snatched from me my watch, and then the first words that he said was, give me all the money you have, I gave him all the money I had in my pocket, amounting to seven of eight shillings, I cannot say the exact sum but not less. He immediately looked at me very hard in the face, and said I have seen you somewhere before in Parliament-street, and I know you to be a b - r, if you do not promise to behave to me as a gentleman I will have you in the pillory in less than a week for sodomy. He desired that I would meet him the next morning at the same place where I then was and give him five pound, I told him I would do so, he persisted in his threats that if I did not behave to him as a gentleman he certainly would appear against me for the crime which he charged me. I told him that his accusation would not avail, as my character would bear the most minute enquiry, and I had the most respectable connections. I then told him who I was, I said, my name is Mr. Price, and that my brother was physician to the York hospital, Chelsea. He said, he did not believe me, he immediately locked my arm in his, and took me over to a public house just by, he took hold of my arm and hurried me over where he called for something to drink, he took a candle off the bar and looked me in my face. When the prisoner had taken a glass of liquor he handed a glass of brandy and water, which I tasted, we came out together, I parted and went home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Now Mr. Pride at the time that he seized you by the lappel of your coat had you ever seen or known the prisoner before - A. Never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever spoken to him before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Now after he had got your watch and your money it was after that he made this threat - A. It was after that he made this threat.</p>

               <p>Q. After he made that accusation and threat were you under considerable alarm - A. I was under a considerable alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you prior to that been in a good of ill state of health - A. A very ill state of health.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he took you over to the public house, and at the public house to your parting with him, did you continue in that state of alarm - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. While you were in the public house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Why did not you at that time make any alarm - A. I considered myself at the mercy of the prisoner, I did not know with whom he might be connected, and that he might have persisted in carrying into execution the horrid charge of accusing me publicly with a crime which my nature shuddered at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him the next morning - A. I did</p>
               <p>Q. This was Friday night, the 6th of July - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time that you saw him again - A. On Wednesday morning the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him again - A. The most renger that attends at the medical board told me that a person wanted to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day might that be - A. I should suppose about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what he said did you go down stairs - A. I did, to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you saw the prisoner at the public house with the candle there, are you sure that the person you saw at the door then, was the prisoner and the man that attacked you on the Friday night - A. I am sure; the first words he said was, I wish to speak to you sir; I walked out with him a few steps, he said to me, you have not performed your promise by meeting me at the place appointed and desired me to give him five pound; I told him that I had not five pound in my pocket, he desired me to meet; him the same evening at seven o'clock, and to give him five pound; I promised so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at this time, and you say it was the same man were you alarmed - A. I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you were talking in the street - A. I should suppose ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you conscious that your countenance was at though you were under great alarm - A. I am conscious of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He went away after some time - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time why did you not cause him to be apprehended - A. I did not wish to throw the department into confusion on my account, I did not wish to develop my own name on the occasion; and not having mentioned the circumstance to my friends, I did not know how much the prisoner might have the advantage of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him that night - A. I did; he took me to a place near the end of Berkley-street, and desired me to go with him into that passage which leads from Berkley-street, into Cousin-street. When I came there he accosted me, he said, sir, have you seen the newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it - A. Seven o'clock. He said, Sir, have you seen the newspapers in which there is an account of several persons having been taken up for a certain crime; those are the words he made us of; I told him I had, he said, he did not mean to take the advantage of me, and that if I would behave like a gentleman he would never mention my name upon much a subject. He asked me if I had brought him five pound, I told him I had; and I gave him the five pound. He said, sir, I have pawned your watch, but I will tell you at once what I mean to have of you. I want fifty pound, in order to enable me to procure my discharge from the Guards; I have been a serjeant in the guards, and am a <rs id="t18100718-66-deflabel398" type="occupation">deserter from the regiment of Guards</rs>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180046"></xptr>Q. Now Mr. Price, when he asked you whether you had read the newspaper, what crime did you understand - A. I understood it to be a crime too shocking to mention; I was even as much alarmed then, as I was at the first, perhaps more; we parted, and the same night I communicated it to my brother, doctor Price.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you, during the whole of this time, not to communicate it to your brother - A. It was a subject I was loth to communicate.</p>

               <p>Q. What to your own brother - A. It was a painful thing then.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On Wednesday; I waited on my brother after I had left the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You went there the next day accompained by two officers, Foy, and Craig - A. I did, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you marked a two pound note - A. My brother marked his initials first, I then put mine, and the two officers put theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there on the Thursday evening - A. At seven o'clock; I saw him at the end of Berkeley-street, the same place he met me before; the officer's I left a few paces behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him what did he say to you - A. He said, Sir, you hardly know me, I suppose, I am so very smart. He had equipped himself in new clothes, to what I saw him the last time; he asked me to walk down the same passage with him, where I had been with him before. He said, Sir, I am a gentleman, and mean to behave to you as such. Pray have you heard of the story of a certain nobleman, whose name he mentioned, who has been obliged to pay a thousand pound for concealment; I told him I had not; he said, if you will give me an hundred pound, I will never trouble you again, as that sum will enable me to return into my own country, where I have an estate; I told him that was a great sum, and that I did not think it possible that I should be able to pay him all that sum; he said, then give me twenty pound to night, and bring me the remainder to morrow; I told him that I had only a two pound note with me, which I put into his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same note that had been marked - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you went there this night, it was purely for the purpose of apprehending him - A. It was; I was keeping my eye upon the officers, I saw them when I gave him the two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. When he mentioned the thousand pound that was given for the purpose of concealment, what did you understand by it - A. The same crime. When I put the two pound in his hand, the officers came up and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When he seized you the first night, and took your watch from you, had you ever seen this man before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And the reason that you did not give the alarm then, and at other times, except the last time, you went for the purpose of apprehending him; I will now ask whether it was not under the terror of that charge that you did not apprehend him - A. It was, and from no other cause.</p>
               <p>Q. And your reason for not communicating it to cause but have given his Lordship, the nature of the accusation against you - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he seized you by the collar and took your watch, before he made any threat, were you under any alarm - A. A considerable alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had your watch again - A. I have not, that I positively swear.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. Upon the virtue of your oath, where was the first place you met me - A. Upper Eaton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet me on last Tuesday night was a week - A. I did not meet you.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the virtue of your oath, did not you make me a present of two pair of cotton stockings, and did not you make me a present of the watch - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put your hand into your pocket and give me a dollar and two shillings - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never extorted a shilling from Mr. Price, as I am to dye, he gave me five-pound; we walked round Berkley-square, and came down St. James's-street. He said, meet me to morrow, I will give you money to go to the salt water, He laid hold of me by the private parts, took cut his own, did not you do that at the chapel, at the five fields; did not I tell you I never was accustomed to any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I deny it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not go into the Wheatsheaf along with me as the clock struck ten - A. I was obliged to go in with you, you robbed me and took me in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you have a glass of cold brandy and water, and I had a glass of gin. Did not you tell me you would get me a situation under government; I gave you my hand writing - A. No, never.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Thursday night, the 12th of July, I went with Mr. Price, and Foy, we were in disguise. I first saw the prisoner in Landsdowne passage, in company with Mr. Price; I was stationed at the end of the passage, in Berkeley-street; I went up to him in about five minutes, they were standing conversing together; Foy went first up the passage, I saw Foy pass him, I was some paces behind, I went up; Mr. Price, said, this is the man; I laid hold of him by the right hand; in his right hand was this note, I asked him what it was; I do not know, said he, it is something that gentleman has given me. I took it out of his hand, and at that time Foy came up on the other side of him; he turned round when he saw Foy, and said, Mr. Foy, this is a bad job, or a bad thing, or words to that effect. Foy asked him what he had done with the gentleman's watch, he did not see any chain about him; he said, he had returned it to him. last night. I answered, that Mr. Price had said to the contrary, that he had never had his watch back. On our way to the office, he said, he was awkwardly situated, that if he should dye he should be innocent. Foy asked him where he lived, he said, somewhere in St. Giles's, he had a fresh lodging every night, he could not tell the house or the street.</p>

On the evening of the 11th, my brother called and made this communication to me, and then my brother did not give a verbal communication, he wrote me a letter and gave it me, he said, there is a business I cannot detail to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother at that time in a state of alarm and agitation - A. He was, I advised him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother had been ill before - A. Yes, I attended him with the surgeon of York hospital; he was in a state of extreme ill health.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Price met me when I was pumping cold water on my legs, he frequently walked with me; he brought me to the five fields chealsea and brought a young woman there, he wished me to have a connection with her; he asked me if I was large, as Irishmen were in general; I asked him where she was, he then said it was dangerous; he unbuttoned my small clothes and took my penis out in his hand; I told him it was not a thing that I was accustomed to; it is a shocking thing, he said, say nothing about it, now my life is in your hands, now I will ever be a friend to you as long as I live; he walked down with me as far as the wheatsheaf, he had a glass of brandy and water, and I had a glass of gin; he met me on the Tuesday and gave me three shillings, he told me to call on him at the office of the medical board, I did, he came and gave me a dollar and two shillings. On Tuesday evening he gave me a five pound note to pay my lodgings; he told me to go down to the salt water, and if I should go to Colchester, where he came from, he would get me the best connections that he had. In Albermarle-street, he brought me down there, he put in my hand a two pound note; I told him I did not want that, but to get me a situation, and to go down to the salt water. I own that Mr. Price gave me the money, I never extorted a shilling from him.</p>

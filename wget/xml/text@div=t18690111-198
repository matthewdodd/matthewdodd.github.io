                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Flitton, of 23, Spurston Road, Hackney—on Thursday night, 17th December, about 12 o'clock, I was awoke by a strong smell of fire—I got up and opened my bedroom door, and saw my son's room apparently in a blaze—it is the room adjoining mine, and was occupied by my son when he was at home; he was not at home then—the door was half open; I had shut it on going to bed—when I went into the room, I saw three distinct fires blazing on the bed—I put the blaze out by doubling the things up together, and burnt my hands in doing so—I then went up stairs, and awoke my daughter, who slept in the room over mine, and she assisted in putting out the fire—I then went to the prisoner's bedroom; she slept in the second floor back—she was my servant, and had been with me about six weeks—I had given her notice to leave on 1st December—I found her lying in bed and awake, although she pretended to be asleep; I could tell that from her manner—she had her night-dress on, but, in my opinion, she was partly dressed under it—I did not see that she had her things on, but I saw no stockings or underclothes about the room—she usually kept her boots, jacket, and bonnet in the kitchen; I noticed that they were in her room, and her box had been moved out of its usual place, and the cord put by the side of it—I said to her, "Sarah, what have you been doing?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "Mr. Charles' bed is on fire in three places, and I think you did it"—she said she did nothing of the sort—I took away her candle and matches, and sent for my son in the morning—I heard her deny it strongly to him, at first—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE KEATING</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the statement of the prisoner, after this observation, was not admissible</hi>)—my son afterwards gave her into custody—there was no other servant in the house.</p>

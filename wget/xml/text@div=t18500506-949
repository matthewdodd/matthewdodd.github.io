                  </hi>. I am a purser, of the Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi> on the last voyage to the Gulf of Mexico—we left Southampton on 2nd Feb.—before we left, I had changed two separate checks—I have one of them; the banker's clerk has the other—one of them was for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—for that, I got a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060069"></xptr>
               <p>and I had a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, that I received for a check—the prisoner came on board the steamer as a passenger on 19th March, at Vera Cruz—I had a cabin to myself in the vessel, and in that cabin a writing case, in which I had the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about 1lb. 2ozs. of gold-dust—I cannot tell the weight without referring to a paper, which is not here—I remember on weighing it, and referring to the account, that it was 4 ozs. 5 dwts. deficient—I had weighed it two or three times before I discovered any deficiency—it was in my cabin—about five days before we arrived at Southampton I left my keys in the cabin-door when I went to wash my hands; when I returned they were gone—when I came out of the cabin to go to dinner, I saw the prisoner; I asked him if he had taken my keys—I thought he might have taken them in a joke—he said he had not—we dined at four o'clock, and I was invited by the prisoner, and another passenger, and the surgeon, to take some mulled claret—I joined them for that purpose, about half-past nine—the prisoner complained of being sick or unwell—he requested to leave the cabin about ten—he was absent about half an hour—we broke up about eleven, and I retired to my cabin—I then found my keys on the deck, near the door of the cabin—I had searched the cabin before, and looked on the floor for the keys, and could not find them—I did not go to my writing-case, as I thought I might have laid the keys on the table, and they had fallen down—I did not take further notice—nothing else passed about the keys while on board—we arrived at Southampton on 21st April, and the prisoner left that day—I had had some conversation with him about the property—he required some stick<lb></lb>ing-plaster on one occasion, and I opened my case; he saw the notes there; and requested me to let him see a Bank of England note—I showed him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and told him it was a note for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Bank of England—he might have seen the other note also—we had talked about gold-dust, but never about my gold-dust—on 22nd April I took my writing-case to my lodging, and opened it to get some money, and I missed my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I did not weigh my gold-dust again; it was weighed in the bullion-office at the Bank of England; I was not present—I came to town on Friday, 26th, and next morning went to the party from whom I received the check, and requested him to give me the number of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I went to the Bank and found that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note had been paid—I gave information to the police.</p>

               <p>come on board with scarcely any clothes, and at Mobile he wanted to buy some, and I gave him five or six of the doubloons, and he got the rest at the Havannah—he produced the paper which I gave him, and I gave him the balance—I have not that paper now; it was destroyed—he talked about having gold-dust, and I told him I did not believe he had any, because he could not show it—I said I should like to see what it was like—he said it was a fine specimen—gold-dust does vary in quality considerably, some is in dust, some in lump—there is always more or less alloy with it—there is sometimes silver in it—I have seen him with a machine for lighting cigars—I have it—I have not it here—it is merely a steel, mounted in gold—I had a gold thing to hold cotton, and we exchanged—he proposed to toss for it—I said I would play at ecarte, and whoever was the loser should pay a doubloon—I lost, and paid the doubloon—he said he would not play at ecarte, and we tossed—I have played with him at ecarte—I think he won from me as much as I won from him—we paid each other—we struck a balance after leaving Bermuda, to the best of my belief—the balance was not in writing—he owed me ten dollars, which I had lent him to go on shore at Bermuda, I had to pay the doubloon for these little things, and there was six dollars beside, which left a balance of a few shillings, which I handed over—no one saw me hand him the doubloons at the Havannahs or at Mobile, that I am aware of—on board ship we sometimes play at whist, and sometimes at ecarte—the after-deck and fore-deck passengers all meet in one saloon in the evening—I have only played with him in the evening—the <hi rend="italic">Clyde</hi> steamer came into Bermuda at the same time we did—Mr. O'Meary was the purser of it—he applied to me about some doubloons—I said, "I cannot give you any, I have none; here is a passenger here has got some; I dare say he would be glad to get English money for them"—the prisoner came into the cabin; and I asked him if he would change his doubloons, and he would not—I said, if he sold them at a shop in England, be would get but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them; and if he wanted English money, it would be an advantage to change them there; but he would not—I have got a gold rosary: it did belong to Mahomed Benani—I bought it for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner gave it to him for some attar of roses—Benani said it was not worth so much as the attar of roses; and I said, "To save any dispute, I will buy it of you"—I believe I gave 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I will swear I gave more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I think it was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I met the prisoner on 30th April, about ten o'clock in the evening, in Finsbury-square—I asked him if his name was Debrio—he said, "Yes"—I told him I belonged to the police, and I had received instructions to take him into custody, for robbing a gentleman, on his voyage from America to England, of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and some gold-dust—he said he was a stranger, and ignorant of the laws of this country—he asked for my authority—I said I had none but a verbal authority from Mr. Strutt—he said, "I know nothing about it, and Mr. Strutt durst not come forward"—I took him, and found on him this watch and gold ring, and a piece of paper relating to the gold-dust in his pocket-book, with other papers—I found a trunk of his at the Bull Tavern, in Bishopsgate-street, with clothes in it—I inquired at 10, Moorgate-street, and was not able to find the prisoner, or any trace of him—(<hi rend="italic">on the back of the</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-<hi rend="italic">note was written, "Martinez Debrio,</hi> 10,<hi rend="italic">Moorgate-street."</hi>)</p>

            . The prisoner came to me one day, and said, We both want money and watches, and said he could put me in a way to get money: he ask'd me if I had any ordinary rum; he could sell it for 2 s. a bottle; he brought a bladder on the Sunday morning; I could not come at any; so I put about a quart of porter in it, and he took it away. On the Sunday following he came again; I got him two bottles of wine; he put them in a bag that he had, and carried them away. On the Monday he gave me two bladders in a bag; I put about a gallon of rum in one, and a quart of brandy in the other. He came on the Sunday morning following down into the cellar, and took them away in a bag. On the Sunday after, he said his mother was very ill, and wanted a little rum: after that he said she was no better, and she liked Old Hock or Madeira. On the Wednesday night he came, and I gave him some Madeira through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not first put this to me, and I never ask'd you?</p>
               <p>Barrow. I never did propose such a thing to him.</p>

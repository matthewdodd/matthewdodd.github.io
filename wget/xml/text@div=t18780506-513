                  </hi>. I am a financial agent, of 1, Lancaster Place, Strand—on 10th November the prisoner came to me after banking hours with a person named Ruddock, and brought me this cheque, purporting to be from G. Harrison, and was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he wanted the cash—I told him it was after banking hours and I had got no money by me—he said he could do with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I have got a friend in the Strand I can go and borrow 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of"—I went out and got him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he endorsed his name on the cheque—I asked the prisoner who Harrison was—he said he was a potato salesman carrying on a large business at King's Cross, and lived at 17, Mildmay Park—I know that neighbour<lb></lb>hood and have relations living there—I went there afterwards to inquire and saw a Mrs. Burton living there—I also inquired at King's Cross—I had endorsed the cheque and sent it to my bank, the London and County, and it was returned with "Number of account required" written on it at the bottom—I have been paid nothing on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>: Ruddock brought Johnston to me, who showed me the cheque and endorsed it in my presence—I could find no Mr. Harrison at King's Cross, and I was referred to Mr. Harrison of Tooley Street—I went there and he told me it was not his writing, and he did not know such a person—I did not employ a directory—I did not succeed in finding Mr. Harrison—I lost three or four hours at the Birkbeck Bank—the gentlemen there Were very courteous, but they could not find such a signature in their books—I have asked the prisoner several times where Mr. Harrison is to be found, and he has said he could not tell me—I told him several times I could not find him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prisoner endorsed the cheque at my request—I said "Perhaps you will put your name on it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Brown-bear-alley, East Smithfield—on the 2nd of Nov. he came home between five and six o'clock in the evening—I had pledged a pair of his shoes that day, and acknowledge I did not make good use of the money—I went drink<lb></lb>ing with it—he called me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> account, and I allow I provoked him with my bad language; and he beat me with his walking-stick, which he uses, having a bad leg—he beat me in various parts of the body—I was beat all over, pretty well—the stick broke, and I ran, and took the poker up to use it, and he took it out of my hand—he struck me with it, and I believe but one blow—(I have said before that I took the poker first)—he had given me a great many blows with the stick—it was not very large—he struck me on the left breast the night before, with a carving-fork, and I believe that was done by accident—I am quite sure I took hold of the poker first, to strike him with it, but he wrenched it from me, and struck me on the head—I was taken to the doctor's—we had frequent squabbles, but I believe it was brought on by my misconduct, when I was the worse for liquor—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me out with the poker—I had his hat and handkerchief in my hand, as I took it up in my confusion unconsciously—I had no intention to steal it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the workhouse, but lived in the prisoner's house when this happened—he came borne, complaining of missing his shoes and a shirt off the line—he asked his wife about it—she did not give him satisfactory answers—he began to beat her with a stick—I do not think it was broke in striking her, but on purpose—he knocked her down with his fist—I then saw them both down together, and when they got up she took the poker, and he got it out of her hand—she ran out of doors, and he after her—I saw no blows—I did not follow, but heard her cry "Murder," in the yard—I afterwards saw her head bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Upper East Smithfield. On the evening of the 2nd of Nov. the prosecutrix was brought to my shop with a contused wound on her head—it was bleeding profusely in consequence of a small artery being divided—it was lull an inch in length—it might be rather more—I did not</p>

               <p>take particular notice at the time—it was very much swollen all round, as if there had been repeated blows in the same part—she was bruised all over the body, but they were so frequently in the habit of quarrelling and fighting I cannot say that it all occurred at that time—in fact, in examining her body, I found she had been stabbed by some sharp instrument, which she I said was a fork—I have attended her on a great many occasions—about nine months ago she came to me with her arm broken—all wounds on the scalp are dangerous, erysipelas being likely to follow—I did not apprehend any danger from this wound—it healed by the first intention—it was a serious wound—I do not know whether a stitch was put in it or not—her constitu<lb></lb>don is seemingly good—such a blow on an unhealthy person, in all proba<lb></lb>bility, would produce erysipelas, and perhaps death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was a mere hurt of the scalp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It divided the integuments, and went to the bone—a stitch might sometimes cause ery<lb></lb>sipelas—I recollect now that I did not put a stitch to this—I have teen her many times when she has received mischief, when she has not been drunk, and sometimes when drunk—I have known her ten or fifteen years—I have attended her twenty or thirty times for these accidents.</p>

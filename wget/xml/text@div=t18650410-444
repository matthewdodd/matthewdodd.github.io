                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employment of Messrs. Bennoch, silk warehousemen, 80, Wood-street, Cheapside—on Tuesday, 8th November, at a quarter-past 6, I fastened up the premises—I locked the doors—nobody sleeps on the premises—on the morning of 9th, I returned at 10 minutes past 8, and found the lock off the door—it was broken off and thrown on the mat inside—the door was partly open—from the appearances it had been opened from the inside—seventy-six pieces of silk were missing, which were safe on the premises the evening before when I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived some time back at 1, Providence-place, Market-street, London-road, and am a widow—I remember one of the prisoners calling on me on. Lord Mayor's day last year—that was 9th November—it was the one by the name of "Carrotty Fred"—it now seems his name is Wilkinson—it might have been the beginning of the week of 9th November—he called once or twice, if not three times—he asked me if iny son was in—I said, "No"—my son's name is Thomas Edward Evershed—he said he wanted to see my son; he wanted him to do some work with the horse and cart—he said he wanted it for Mr. Bennoch—he came again,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100071"></xptr>
               <p>and my son was not in then—he said he wanted him to go and do some work for him, and be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Velvet Ned</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bill Barrett</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, and after that he came again—the prisoners are very differently attired now to what they were—I see <hi rend="italic">Velvet Ned</hi> here now; be is the one nearest to me (<hi rend="italic">Brewerton</hi>)—I don't know Caseley—there is <hi rend="italic">Carrotty Fred</hi>, 1; <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Brown</hi>) 2; and Barrett (<hi rend="italic">Jeffery</hi>,) 3—I think on the Monday or Tuesday following Lord Mayor's-day, Wilkinson came and said they had got the silk; that he went inside and packed the silk up, and the others were outside; and he said if he had not been short of money be would not have done it, for they were almost quarrelling with him—my son had a horse and cart.</p>

A.</hi> In Providence-place, Market-street—I am quite sure about that—I was not living at 4, Salisbury<lb></lb>place, Walworth New-town—I have only lived there four weeks—my son never lived there—my grandson lives with me, and did on 8th November, at 1, Providence-place—I lived with my son to take care of his wife, who was dying, and she did die—I was there in November—I was there for four or five weeks—my son does not go by any other name than Evershed that I am aware of—he did not go by the name of Gront—he has been convicted of felony, and has got ten years' penal servitude—he got that at the Sessions on 6th February (<hi rend="italic">Set Vol. lxi., page</hi> 111)—I don't know the date of the offence with which he was charged—I think it was in December—it was not at the time I was in hishouse that he was accused of it—I knew nothing of it—Alfred Evershed is my grandson—I remember histaking a sovereign once off the mantelpiece—I took it away from him—he had it in his pocket—I spoke to the police about this matter a week after the Sessions, which were on 6th February—I called on Mr. Potter, and I met him at the Clerkenwell Sessions-house, and he asked me where I lived, and I told him I was going to move, and I would tell him next time I saw him—I met him, I believe, the next day—he said, "Good morning" and said, "Well, I met Hurley yesterday in the Mile End-road"—I said, "I wanted to see him"—he is one of the prisoners—Mr. Potter said, "Why did not you come up for your friend as you ought to have done?" meaning my son; "he has had a bad name; he ought to have twenty yean instead of ten"—I said, "Oh, has he? If that is so, I will tell you who has done them," and I gave him the names of these prisoners—at that time there was a horse and cart in the possession of the police belonging to my son—there was also a watch and chain and one ring—I have got back all the things since—I know a person who went by the name of "Hannah"—I was never accused of receiving stolen goods from her—I dare say she is where she lived before—she lived in John-street, in the "Cut"—I was in business—we bought lead and melted it, and sold it again—there was not a burglary at that place after I left, as I know of; I am quite sure of that—my son was never accused of breaking into the place we had formerly lived at—I never sent my grandson to Wilkinson to tell him my son was taken up—he knew where Wilkinson lived; he could go on his own account without me sending him—Velvet Ned mentioned Mr. Bennoch's name when he came and asked for my son—he said he wanted a cart to go to Bennoch's in Wood-street—it was in con<lb></lb>templation weeks before they did it—I think it it was on the Monday or Tuesday after 9th November that he came, and said he had got the silk, and he packed it up, and he was saying how much it would realize, and how much they would sell it a yard, and the quantity of it—I don't think that was the next day or the next day but one after 8th November—I don't</p>

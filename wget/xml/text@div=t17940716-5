            When did you next see the things? - I went and had a warrant taken out against the prisoner, and found the duplicates in his pocket; he was second coachman along with me about two months before; but he was then out of place.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the other things found? - At the pawnbroker's; I went with the man who went after them; two coats were found at Mr. Mulcaster's; these that I now produce were found at the landlord's house where he lived; it was one of our servants who first found my trunk broke open.</p>

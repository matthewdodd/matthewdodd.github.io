                  </hi>. I am the son of David Daniel Davis. The prisoner was in his service one moth before the 25th of January—that is the second time he had been in our service—on that day, he came into the drawing-room, about ten o'clock in the evening—he was not sober—he wanted his wages, and threatened to smash my head—my father said he would not give him his wages then, because he was not in a fit state to receive them—he told him to go down stairs and go to bed—after some piece of work, he went to the door, took hold of the handle, and told him to go—he told my father he had better kick him down—my father told him to go down—I know my father's great coat was hanging on a peg in the hall that evening—the prisoner left the house—I had seen the coat hanging there in the afternoon—I did not see it any more till Tuesday evening, when it was brought from the place where he took it to.</p>

                  </hi>. I go to Dr. Davis's occasionally to do needle work. I was in the kitchen on the evening in question—the prisoner was not sober—he went into the drawing-room he came down, and swore in a violent manner—he went up the kitchen stairs, and said he would have something—he went into the inner part of the passage, and took Dr. Davis' travelling coat—he took no other coat—he had his own livery great coat on, which he generally goes out in, in wet weather—he went out with Dr. Davis's great cost on his arm.</p>

On the 30th of March a great number of coachmen were at my house, early in the morning - we had been endeavouring to clear the house, but could not, it being a night house - we had refused them any more liquor - it was about two o'clock; I did not see the prisoner there, but I was given to understand he had been there, and he was brought back with the remainder of the bottle - it had been on a shelf by the side of the counter, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050033"></xptr>had a cordial in it; it was a large Scotch bottle, and I missed it when the prisoner was brought in - it had been quite full; I suppose there were three pints of liquor in it.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker. I was at the house, waiting for a lodger, who was out; I saw a number of hackney-coachmen there, and the prisoner among them; there was a great disturbance, and the landlord said he would not serve any more; the prisoner said he wanted to go out, and asked who would let him out - I said I would, and I saw him pushing something under his apron; I went out, and saw him running - I pursned, and cried Stop thief! the Policeman pursued him- he fell down, and the bottle broke; I saw part of the bottle picked up, and the officer showed me the spoon.</p>

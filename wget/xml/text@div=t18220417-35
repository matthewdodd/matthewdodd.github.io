            's waggon came by, driven by the deceased, while the coach stood there; the waggon passed the Gosport Coach, and then the Malborough Coach came by; the waggoner's right hand was near the horses; the Malborough Coach was on the right hand side of the road; the Marquis of Granby is on the left, coming to London; the Malborough Coach passed on the right hand side, the deceased was passing on the left side of his horses, close against the body horse; the waggon was about three yards from the foot path; when the Malborough Coach drove by, the prisoner started directly on the left side, between the waggon and the left side, and as his coach passed the waggon, the box of the coach's hind wheel and the box of the waggon, came in contact together. The coach was going on faster than it ought; it got by the waggon somehow, and then the waggon horses set off full trot. The waggoner caught hold of his own trace harness, to prevent the coach going over him, and then the horses set off at full trot. The waggoner fell down, and his fore and hind wheels went over him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there was only three yards between the waggon and the foot-path, did the coach go on the foot-path - A. No, it went very near it. I did not see the coach or horses strike against the deceased. The coach passed by my window, just as the boxes touched, I hollowed out very loud,</p>
               <p>"Coachman you must stop, or you will run over the man." I ran down and stopped the waggoner's horses. He laid at the White Bear ten or twelve days and then died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The waggon had to pass the Gosport Coach on its way to town - A. Yes, the road is wide enough for four or five to go abreast; the waggon was far enough out in the road. My window is about seventeen yards from the Granby; the left hand is the near side; the waggon had quite cleared the Gosport Coach before the coach started; the accident was about thirty-eight yards form the Granby; the coachman had passed the body of the waggon when the man fell, but not the horses. I did not see the waggon leader make a sudden start to the near side. I looked more to the waggon than the horses; I know the waggon leader is rather skittish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The deceased caught hold of his trace harness - A. Yes, my Lord; he was pulled down. I saw him fall just as the coach passed him; I think the coach would have touched him, if he had not got close to his horses; he stepped half a yard out of the way; his own waggon ran over him, not the coach.</p>

            . I keep a Grocer's Shop at Hounslow. I stood at my door, which is seven houses from the Marquis of Granby, in the town, on the same side of the way. I saw the Gosport Coach at the Marquis of Granby; the driver was taking up a lady and gentleman. I saw the waggon come up to my door, and the Malborough Coach passed it very clear on the other side. I did not observe that it made the horses turn out of the way. At the time it passed the Granby, the driver of the Gosport Coach got on his box, and drove very fast indeed, on the left side, between the waggon; and as the waggoner was bearing very near towards our side, the coachman persisted in passing; and when they came opposite our door, the kennel being very low, I thought the coach would be over, as the waggon was so very near, there was scarce room for the coach to pass; the coach wheel went into the gutter, and made the coach leau over much towards my house; the waggoner got a little from my house, and how the accident happened I did not see. The body of the coach did not entirely pass the body of the waggon till it had passed my house; the coach being then between me and the waggoner, I could not see him. I afterwards saw him lay nine yards off. The waggon had then gone over him. There was room enough for him to have driven straight, and then it would not have happened.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say the coach was so near the side, you were afraid it would be over - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Marquis of Granby. I was at my lodgings, and saw the Gosport Coach at the Granby; the prisoner drove it. I went and stood by the horses, on the public house side of the way. I saw the rein of the Gosport Coach under the near leader's tail, and attemped to take it away, but the coachman started so quick before I could take it; he hit the wheel horse, and started at a goodish pace, not much faster then he ought to go, but coaches do go at a good pace. The waggon seemed to be over right the leaders head, but being afraid at seeing the rein under the horses tail, I did not take notice, fearing the leader would kick, and cannot say whether it could pass the waggon without danger, but it could not without the coach wheel going into the gutter. As it passed the waggoner, he went up scrambling to his horses traces to save himself, to get out of the way of the coach; then his horses took fright, and two of them turned right across the road, towards the Malborough Coach; this was before he fell; I cannot say whether the coach touched him or not; I saw him thrown down. The Malborough Coach being on the right side, I suppose turned the horses back again nearly straight; I think if the prisoner had gone on steady it would not have happened; or if he had gone on his right side of the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the prisoner off the box - A. No, the waggon had not quite cleared the coach when it was about to start; the waggoner was bearing on his left side, to let him pass on the right; he fell at the time the Malborough Coach passed; he laid hold of the traces, and I suppose was pulled down by the horses pulling on; the body of the coach was about ten yards from him; when he fell his left leg was behind his right, and he fell under his middle horse.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When his legs were entangled, was he falling - A. He was holding by his traces; the prisoner started with the leading reins in his hand, but they could not be strained so as to have a full command of his horses. He could not be off seeing the waggoner.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. I was on the Hounslow Road, on horseback, passing on my own near side, which was the off side of the waggon; and as I approached the hind part of the waggon the prisoner appeared to have his horses in confusion. I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170019"></xptr>whether he was on the point of starting or not. He had drawn his horses up. He appeared to me to be intending to turn to his own side, which he ought to have done, being behind the waggon; but he turned his horses between the waggon and the curb on the left. I saw nothing afterwards, till I saw the man on the ground. His thigh was broken. He was taken away on a shutter. It gave me the impression that he was knocked down by the head of his horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the whole road open to the waggoner when he passed the Marquis of Granby - A. I did not see him pass. He was in his right place, and there was room for the prisoner to pass on his right side.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow, and was examined before the Coroner. I was at Mrs. Ogleby's, and saw the coach pass close to the path. I saw the waggon fore-wheel knock the man down. The Gosport Coach had then passed about two lengths from the waggon before he fell.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the coach pass the waggon - A. The Gosport Coach had passed two lengths before I looked. He fell with his feet under the waggon. He was hitting the coach horses. Q. I thought the coach had passed before you looked. How could you see him hit the horses - A. The coach was more by the side of him at first. There was room for two persons to pass between the coach and waggon, at the time he was striking the horses. He was walking very slow when the wheel knocked him down; and his horses went slow.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Marquis of Granby. The Gosport Coach just passed to take up a gentleman and lady. I stood to see the lady into the coach. The coachman was getting on his box, and the moment the passengers were in, the coach started. I saw the waggon on the other side of the coach. There was room for four to go abreast. The bodies of the coach and waggon were very near together. When it started there was room for the waggon to go further from the coach. I saw the coach pass the waggon about two yards off, and saw the waggoner catching at the chains of his waggon; and his horses began a trot. This was after the coach passed - I saw him fall. I think his foot slipped as he caught at the chain apparently to stop the horses. His leader had turned towards the coach as it was going by.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say when the coach started the body of the two were abreast - A. I think they must. There were three horses to the waggon, and only two abreast to the coach; I think I saw Simpkins there. I think the reins had caught. The waggon had not passed the body of the coach then. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. Q. Then it is not true that the waggon horses were walking slowly, and the waggon knocked him down - A. No, it was trotting. The wheels knocked him down. There was room for the coach to pass; for it did pass. There was no danger - the coach went slowly at first - it neither galloped or trotted.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. It started slow. How far did it go before it got into its usual pace - A. About twenty yards.</p>

            . I am horsekeeper at the Marquis of Granby. The coach stood there about half a yard from the footpath. The waggon came along very near it; there was plenty of room - three or four carriages might pass. The first horse of the waggon was before the coach when it started; the waggoner was walking on the near side of his horses, and the waggon body was opposite the coach fore-wheel. The coach set off very slow, at a shuffling trot; and after it passed the waggoner he laid hold of his chain - crossed his legs, and fell down. There was about a yard and a half, between the coach and waggon, when it passed. I should think there was four or five yards between the waggon and the curb.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see Simpkin - A. Not till after it was over. The coach went about ten yards at the shuffling trot. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. The Gosport Coach was ten or fifteen yards beyond the waggon when it happened. The waggon was bearing on the coach, and I suppose the coachman hollowed out to him, and then he turned his horses out again. I was standing behind the coach.</p>

            . I am an ironmonger, and live at Maidenhead. I was a passenger on the Malborough Coach. Just as we got opposite the Marquis of Granby the Gosport Coach set off. The waggon was by the side of it. The bodies were nearly abreast, and I saw the deceased either strike, or attempt to strike the Gosport coachman with his long whip, and in consequence of the smack of the whip, as I suppose, the waggon horses went on a trot. I saw the deceased attempting to hold the traces of his waggon; he fell and both the waggon wheels went over his legs. The Gosport Coach was then several yards before the waggon. Our coach was beyond the waggon, and the Gosport Coach was before ours.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you sit - A. Outside, in front, on the near side, with my face towards the horses' heads. The coach started just as we got opposite it. There was no racing. I am positive the waggoner attempted to strike the coachman. Just as it was setting off he was near his hind horse. I have seen coaches pass well in less space, and without danger.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. There was room enough to pass without danger. Quite sufficient - if he had been an active man he could have got out of the way.</p>

            . I came up just after the accident, and helped to take the man to the White Bear. He said he must die, and he believed his own horse knocked him down.</p>

            . I was standing at the door of the Marquis of Granby when the coach started. The waggon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170020"></xptr>was then a little behind the coach. There was something the matter with the reins, which detained the coachman a few seconds; and in that time the waggon drew up, and rather drew on him. The coachman was deprived of the reins of the near side. Somebody extricated them. He was then in the kennel, by the footpath - the waggon having drawn nearer on him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Daddy or father, hold off a bit." He held off, and then the coachman pulled his horses out of the kennel further into the road; and just as he got past the waggon horse, the waggon leader horse shyed towards the side of the Marlborough Coach. I believe the horses got right of themselves, and went away in a smartish trot. It shyed at something on the off side. I saw the man with his legs crossed; he appeared feeble. I said,</p>
               <p>"that man will be under the wheel" - I saw him catching at the chains; and it had such an affect on me, I closed my eyes for a few seconds, and then saw him fall on his left side. I don't attribute the accident to the prisoner's coach. I ran to the man's assistance, and assisted the medical gentleman as well as I could. When he was collected, I asked how he came by the accident. He said, his daughter told him, before he left home, he should die; that he knew his death was come; that he was knocked down by his own horse, and run over by his own wheels; that it was an accident, and could not be helped.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell the Coroner all this - A. I was not suffered to speak, or any one else, scarcely.</p>

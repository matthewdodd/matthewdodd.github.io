               <p>Q. Was he at large? - A. Yes, he was walking up King-street; I took him before a Magistrate, he did not give a satisfactory account how he came at large, and Mr. Kirby identified him. - Here is the certificate of his conviction, (produces it); I saw Mr. Shelton sign it. (It is read).</p>
               <p>EDWARD KIRBY sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was tried here in September Sessions, and ordered to be transported; I delivered him on board the Captivity bulk, I think, on the 9th of October last.</p>

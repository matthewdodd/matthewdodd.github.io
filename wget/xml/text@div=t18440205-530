                  </hi>. I live in Dorset-street, Salisbury-square, St. Bride's. The prisoner's mother lodged with me, and he lived with her—they had the two attics, which are front rooms—the prisoner slept in the room furthest from the stairs, his mother and sister in the other room—I was in bed on the 31st of Jan., when he came home; but at two o'clock in the morning I heard some women screaming in the street, and cries of fire—I got up, looked out of window, and saw flakes of fire falling from the rooms above—they appeared to come from the further room—the policemen were let in—I went up with them—when I got into the further room I felt in the bed, and found the prisoner, laying there—it was too dark to see anything—I took hold of him by the</p>

               <p>throat, and, with assistance, we pulled him off the bed—I called him a rascal—he said, "Take care, look about well; there is plenty of fire yet, and you will be burnt out"—some of his sister's clothes had been burnt in the mo<lb></lb>ther's room, and a quantity of water thrown over the floor of that room—the room he was in was in a state of confusion, and a coverlid, which I believe belonged to the mother's room, thrown on his bed was burnt—there was such a smoke in the room I do not think any one could have lived there ten minutes—the bottom of the door of the mother's room and part of the floor was par<lb></lb>tially burnt—it was the door from the passage into the mother's room—the sister's gown and apron were laying against the cupboard, by the side of the fire-place, burnt—he laid on his bed without any clothes over him—they were thrown aside, but not burnt—the coverlid which had been thrown on his bed had been burnt, and outside, in the gutter against his room, were some burning bed-clothes—the door was burnt about twelve or fourteen inches high—I did not observe any part of his own room burnt.</p>

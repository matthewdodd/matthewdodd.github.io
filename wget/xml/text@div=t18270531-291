On the 28th of March I received 355l. 16s. 2d. at the Bank, by an order from the Court of Chancery, a suit having been decided in my favour - the prisoner went with me to receive it - I got five 50l., five 20l., five 5l. notes, and 16s. 2d.; it was between eleven and one o'clock, and the prisoner received 77l. on the same suit - his brother and brother's wife, his sister's husband, Mr. Gregory, and his clerk, were with us; I put the notes into my trousers pocket, all in a lump together. I went to Mr. Hill, my lawyer, in Welbeck-street, and paid him two 20l. notes, and he gave me 5l. in change. I walked a little way; we then all got into a coach, I think the prisoner was on the box - he waited at a public-house while I went in to Mr. Hill's - I then went there to him, and was intoxicated - I did not come to my senses till next morning, when I was at my own house, in Draper's-buildings, London-wall - I missed three 50l., and one 20l. note; the others were still in my pocket, but rather open, not wrapped up as I had put them in - I went to the prisoner's house at Paddington, in two or three days, with an officer twice, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. There was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310112"></xptr>large party of you? A. Yes; after receiving the money we went and dined at a public-house, opposite the Mansion-house - I took out a 20l. note there, and paid Bell 18l., and I lent Mr. Heck a 20l. note; I was intoxicated; I remember coming out and saying, "Oh! come, I am trumps - I have lent him the money" - I lent no other money - I have found out Heck's lodging, and they tell me he has not been at home for some weeks.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Gregory, the solicitor - I went with them to the Bank, and saw the money paid, and from the state the prosecutor was in, I was afraid he might be robbed, and desired the cashier to give him five 50l. notes, as they could be better traced - he put his money into his trouser's pockets - we went into the Mansion-house public-house - Mr. Gregory wished us to stay by him, as he owed him 18l. - we had 3lbs. of beef-steaks and some porter - he put a 20l. note on the table, and I desired the persons there to mind that it was a 20l. - the prisoner was one of the company - I took the note (Heck then called him out) - I think he put his notes back into his pocket - we took a coach in Cheapside, and I went with him to Welbeck-street (the prisoner was on the box) - I saw him take out the notes, which were wrapped up closely - he there paid two 20l. notes - I then went with him to another public-house, staid a few minutes, and then left them, exactly at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Heck called him out, did you go with him? A. No; when he came in he said he was trumps, and had lent the money - I have heard that Heck is absent - the prisoner is a letter-sorter.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY. I am an ironmonger. I was with Bell - his account is correct - I left them at the Mansion-house public-house.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 29th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop with two men and two women, who said they wanted some boots and shoes, and could I give them change for a 50l. note, or they must go into the City - I fitted them all but one man; a young man who came with the prisoner paid me a 50l. note - I asked for the name and address - the prisoner himself wrote in it, "Jones, Bank of England, Prade-street, Paddington," and I wrote "March 29, W. M." I gave the change to the young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a foreigner there? A. Yes; he came in after the note was produced, I think - when I asked for the address, one of the women said to the prisoner, "Put your name and address."</p>

            .

               <p>- BLACKMAN. I remember some persons coming to my shop - I cannot say the prisoner was one - I received the note, and paid it away to Messrs. Leaf and Severs, Old Change; he mentioned the name of Bishop - I put my initials on it, when I paid it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear to that note? A. Yes - because I had no other at that time; I paid it away eight or nine days after - I had no other 20l.; I only know I paid them the same note; I sent it by my man; I have not been to see if Bishop lives in Cromer-street.</p>

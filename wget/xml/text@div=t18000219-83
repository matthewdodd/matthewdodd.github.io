             sworn. - I am a factor in Basinghall-street; going along Newgate-street, past Mr. Waithman's door, I saw the prisoner just coming out, and she was pushing a black cloak under a red one she had on; I immediately suspected she had stole it, from the manner in which she brought it out; I watched to see where she would take it, and she went into Ludgate, the next gateway to the door of the Compter; Mr. Waithman's is two or three doors round the corner; as soon as I saw her there, I though she was safe, and then I went to the shop, and enquired whether it was bought or not, they said, it was not; I told Mrs. Waithman, if she would come along with me, I would shew her where the woman was that had it; I went to the corner to watch, whilst Mrs. Waithman got a gentleman to go with me after the woman; I then saw her come out, and she was walking up the street; I kept my eye on her, and followed her till the gentleman came up; then we both went up to her, and found the cloak upon her.</p>

             sworn. - I am a glover, and live next door to Mrs. Waithman, who came and beckoned me in a violent hurry; I ran out, and she requested I would go up Giltspur-street, and a gentleman would point out the person who took a cloak; I did, and Mr. Gill pointed out the prisoner; I went and laid hold of her; I saw part of the cloak hanging from under the red one; we kept her till Mrs. Waithman came up, she took it from her; I have had it in my care ever since.(The cloak was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming along Newgate-street, I met a woman, an acquaintance of mine I had not seen for some time; she asked me if I would drink, I did so, and living very low, having three small children, it took a great effect on me, and as I was going along, I imagine that cloak fell down from the door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190063"></xptr>I picked it up: I was not quite sober to know what I was doing.</p>

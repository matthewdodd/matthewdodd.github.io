               <p>What time of the night was it when you was near the house kept by Mr. Browne? - I was coming by, I believe, about twenty minutes after twelve, and found the door open.</p>
               <p>Where is Browne's house? - Between the cheese-warehouse and the grocer's.</p>
               <p>In what street? - In <placeName id="t17790404-21-crimeloc124">Wapping street</placeName>

               <p>At this time was there any appearance of fire? - There was no appearance at all of fire. I found his door open, and the key on the outside.</p>
               <p>Was the house open, or only the key on the outside. - The door stood a-jar, and the key was on the outside. I saw dirt in the entry.</p>
               <p>Did the door stand so much a-jar that you could look into the entry? - Not a great way; only about the space of a foot. I demanded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040035"></xptr> to know who was there; a man answered Browne.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body there before you asked who was there? - No; I did not see any body there. I called out before I saw anybody. The door was a-jar. A man answered me his name was Browne. Seeing the house dirty, as if the goods were removing, I said that would not do for me; I must see the master or mistress of the house. With that the man came to the door to me; he told me that he was the master of the house, and his name was Browne. I said, Sir, you will excuse my making myself so busy; but, finding the key on the outside, made me so particular to see the master of the house. He made answer again his name was Browne, and he was master of the house. I said the key was on the outside of the door. He said, is it? and seemed not to know it.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the man? - Coming to the door, I observed he was a lusty man; he had a brown coat on loose. I did not take notice of the rest of his clothes, nor his face. I went to my brother watchman, and told him. He said, all as is you must mind there are no goods brought out of the house. I returned to my box again.</p>
               <p>How near was your box to his house? - Fifty or sixty yards from his house. - Going past the door, I struck my staff against the door, and it was fast. I looked up at the windows, and saw no light. I returned again in about twenty minutes, and the door was fast then, and I saw no light.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody come out of that house? - Only Mr. Browne; he came out and locked the door, and bid me mind my own business.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The first time.</p>
               <p>Tell us how that was? when you told him the key was on the outside what did he do? - He came out, locked the door on the outside, and bid me mind my own business.</p>
               <p>Did you observe which way he went? - No; seeing he was a gentleman, I took no more notice.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his voice? - Yes; he had a course voice, spoke short, and seemed angry with me for making myself so busy.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the alarm of fire? - It was mean half after two o'clock when I first heard the alarm of fire. The alarm was given when I was in my box. I came out and saw the flames above the houses.</p>
               <p>Which house did you see first on fire? - I cannot say; it was one of the houses near on the spot where I first spoke to Mr. Browne.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the house on fire was there any more than one house on fire? - I cannot say; I believe there was only one house on fire.</p>
               <p>How far was the front of this house from the back? - I cannot say; I never was in the house.</p>
               <p>How far is the back from the river? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was you before the justice when this matter was enquired into? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody there charged with this offence? - I saw the man I spoke to, Browne.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his voice? - I took him to be the same man by his size and his voice.</p>
               <p>Did you take any other observation of his person to make you think he is the man? - I took no observation of his features.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his person that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you take notice of his features? - No.</p>
               <p>Then if two hundred men had assembled you could not have picked this man out? - No further than I thought he was the man by his size and voice.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman.</p>
               <p>Where was you the night of the fire? - On board a vessel called the Falcon. It lay on Mr. Smith's Quay, close to Mr. Browne's back door.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Browne's house? - Yes; vastly well.</p>
               <p>What did you observe first of that house? - A fire came out of the back side about ten minutes after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you awake? - Yes; I was obliged to be awake to haul the ship too for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040036"></xptr> caulkers to work her next day. I was obliged to be up on account of the tide. About ten minutes after two o'clock the fire came out of the back premises of Mr. Browne's house.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by back premises? - The back warehouses.</p>
               <p>It runs a great depth from the street to the river? - Yes; I suppose near fifty feet.</p>
               <p>Are the warehouses timber buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The fire came out of those warehouses? - Yes; the lower part of the warehouses.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any fire any where else? - No; the fire was very small then; I suppose it was a tar-barrel on fire by the blackness of the smoke; there was a cloud of smoke as if it came from a tar-barrel.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How many warehouses were there at the river-side, on this spot where the fire happened? - Every premise had warehouses.</p>
               <p>Did the warehouses and fronts join together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there landing-places at the back of these warehouses? - Some warehouses have; but there is a wharf to the next house but one to this which was on fire.</p>
               <p>Who did the wharf belong to at the back of Browne's house? - There was no wharf there.</p>
               <p>Was there a communication from Browne's house to the river? - Yes; the back door, where he ships his goods. The water flows up quite to the house.</p>
               <p>You think the alarm was about ten minutes after two o'clock, what kind of a morning was it? - A very fine morning.</p>
               <p>Was it moonlight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was in a situation that you could see the progress of the fire? - I was so nigh that it burnt the hat on my head, and the handkerchief on my neck.</p>
               <p>Did you stay on board the ship? - Yes, to endeavour to save it.</p>
               <p>Which way did it spread? - Next the grocer's took fire, then Smith's wharf, it is a sand wharf, and then the wind turned easterly. There was a squall of wind. It took upwards, towards the Hermitage, and burned both ways at once.</p>
               <p>Had you such an opportunity as to mark the course and progress of the fire, that you can speak with certainty to the place where it broke out. - Yes; I was obliged to clear the fire from the ship; it was on fire three times; my hat was burnt on my head, and my handkerchief on my neck.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Hadden, cheesemonger. I was alarmed about twenty-five minutes after two, on the 16th of March. I was up when the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>Do you live at the next door to Browne's? - No; at the distance of eighteen or twenty houses. Not being in bed, I went down the street immediately with Mr. Mitchell, and some other gentlemen. I thought the fire was at Mr. Keating's, or Mr. Browne's premises. When I came there I was confirmed in it, for Mr. Keating was running out of his house in his shirt, (he is a grocer next door to Browne's) and there was a person throwing some bedding, or something out of a one-pair-of-stairs window. I observed the fire burning very rapidly backwards. I thought Mr. Hadden's house in danger.</p>
               <p>We do not want a history of the fire. Did you make any observation of Browne's House? - I could not tell where the fire began; it was at the back of the houses. I was alarmed for Mr. Browne's family. I recommended the door to be broke open; it was broke open, and I immediately went in, and endeavoured to alarm the family by calling Mr. Brown by name. A person told me I need not trouble myself, for Mr. Brown was removed to Bethnal-Green. Browne's house was very much on fire backwards.</p>
               <p>Was his house at last burnt down? - Yes; it was.</p>

               <p>I was out in the street at the time the fire broke out. I went down to Mr. Browne's house, and saw the fire at the back part of it. I could not be certain whose house it was that was on fire then. When I had been there a little time, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040037"></xptr> the next door neighbour throw some things out of the house, sheets, and some other things. Thinking Mr. Browne was in danger and asleep. I broke the door open, and found the fire had made a great progress in the house; I suppose halfway into the house from the back part.</p>
               <p>Was there any other house on fire at that time? - Not that I could see.</p>
               <p>When you broke the door open could you see that the fire was confined to Mr. Browne's house? - I thought the fire began at his house, because it was burning in his house.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that it had reached other houses? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Did you see any furniture in the house? - There was none that I saw; I cannot pretend to say whether there was or not; I did not take notice of that. When you first go in, there is a passage, and then a room. I did not go in; the fire had burned I dare say half way into the house.</p>

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Browne. I was alarmed about half after two o'clock, as near as I can recollect, and got up in my shirt and looked out at the back window, and saw a reflection of fire on the opposite ships. My warehouse was lower than Mr. Browne's, I could see over it. I ran forward; I saw no fire in the street; I went into the street and took an observation of the fire over Mr. Brown's house. I went back to my warehouse, which was not then on fire, but in three or four minutes after the fire burst through the side of it, next to Mr. Browne's; the blaze rose from Mr. Brown's warehouse, and over-topped mine; I saw there was danger. In about three minutes it struck into mine.</p>
               <p>Did the fire communicate to your warehouse from Mr. Brown's? - It did.</p>
               <p>How far is Mr. Browne's warehouse from his dwelling-house? - There is a communication between the dwelling-house and warehouse; the dwelling-house is brick, and the warehouse wood. I saw then I had no remedy left, not being insured. I stood some time amazed; I ran up stairs and called for assistance, and threw what I could out of the window.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell that the fire had not began beyond Mr. Browne's? - From the observation I made, I could not see that there was any fire beyond Mr. Browne's warehouse.</p>

               <p>I live at the Camden's-Head, Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Wapping? - About a mile and a half or two miles. Mr. Brown has a house in the gardens, where I live. On the night of the fire he was in my house between eight and nine o'clock; he ordered a pot of beer home for him and his old woman to drink before they went to bed, he said.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any more that night? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might he be in your house? - About half an hour; I believe he went away between eight and nine; the beer was sent.</p>

               <p>I know Mr. Brown; I saw him on the evening the fire happened, at his own house, in Camden's Gardens, a little after nine o'clock; he said he had been at Bullen's and ordered a tankard of beer; I told him I intended to call him up early in the morning to do his garden. I locked the garden-gates. and went to bed. I waked him the next morning early; he looked out of the window in his shirt and night-cap, that was about six in the morning; there is a strong fence with spikes upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Is there no gap in the fence? - There was a gap but not big enough for a man to get through; a child might. Since he has been in custody the gap has been made bigger.</p>
               <p>How high are the pails? - About seven feet, with iron spikes on the top.</p>
               <p>How had the gap been made bigger? - By shoving some of the pales down.</p>

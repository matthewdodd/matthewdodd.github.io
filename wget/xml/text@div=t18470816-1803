                  </hi> I am a baker. The prisoner was in my service for four or five months—he had a large fustian coat with large pockets, and I noticed that they had a bulky appearance every time he left the premises—in cones<lb></lb>quence of that, when he passed through the shop on the 15th of July I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and charged him with having bread in his pockets—he said he had not got anything—I said I should be much obliged if he would let me see, as I was sure he had got something that did not belong to him—he then took a piece of bread out of one pocket and a cake out of the other—I said this was a sort of game he had been carrying on for some time, and I would give him in charge to the first policeman I met—I did not meet one, and I went to the station with him—the officers there searched him, and found another piece of bread on him—the cake was made with my materials, but not by my order—I had frequently seen these cakes in the bakehouse, and on one occasion I found one between the bed and the sacking.</p>

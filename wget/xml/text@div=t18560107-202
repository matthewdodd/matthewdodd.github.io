                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 208). On the evening of 21st Dec, I was on duty in plain clothes at Deptford, and between 6 and 7 o'clock, as I was passing the shop of the prisoner Noble's father, I saw the prisoners in the shop—I looked in at the door and saw something wrapped up in an apron on the weighing machine, which is not on the counter—the three prisoners were standing round it—they were in the shop about two minutes—I saw Noble take the bundle and carry it into the back room—I then went in, followed by Turner, who was with me—I asked the lad Noble to produce that bundle which he had just taken into the back room—he brought it to me in the same state in which I had seen it in the scale (he had some communication with his father, who was fitting in the back room with a friend)—I asked him how he got it—he said that two of Mr. Smith's men, the contractor for the Dockyard, brought it—I opened it, it contained 55 lbs. weight of composition nails, and 7 lbs. weight of old sheet copper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—these nails bear the mark of the broad arrow—there is the head of a nail in this copper, which has the mark of the broad arrow—this other piece of copper also has it—the nails are some of them marked on the shank—I asked Noble if he did not know that it was government property—he said that he did not, for he had not examined it—I told him he must keep it till I had made some inquiries about it—next day I went to Deptford Dockyard and saw Field with Mr. Smith's cart—I apprehended him, and told him that he was charged with taking a quantity of nails to Mr. Noble's shop on the previous night, in company with Fitzgerald; he said that he did so, and it was a lot that he had picked out of the dust from time to time, threw it by under Fitzgerald's horse's manger, and took it there to sell—I took him to the station—I intimated to Noble that his attendance would be required at the police station, and he attended voluntarily.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was with Chapman on this evening—I looked into the shop, and saw something on the weighing machine—I saw several persons in the shop, two or three of whom were females, and after a bit Fitzgerald came out, and after him, Field—I saw Noble at the right side of the weighing machine, and the other two prisoners on the left, but was not near enough to hear any conversation between them—two or three minutes elapsed before they came out—I then followed Chapman into the shop, went up to the weighing machine, and Chapman, and Noble, and his father, were conversing—Chapman said, "You must know it is all Government metal"—Noble said that he was not aware of that—Chapman asked Noble what he had given for it—the father said, "We have not given anything for it yet, but we are to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—on the following morning I went to the Dockyard at Deptford, saw Fitzgerald, and asked him what account he had to give of that metal which he had taken to Mr. Noble's the night before—he said, "It is a lot which we have been saving from time to time up to Christmas, to get us a Christmas box; I had not a great deal to do with it myself, but I was there, and assisted in taking it to the shop"—I took him into custody.</p>

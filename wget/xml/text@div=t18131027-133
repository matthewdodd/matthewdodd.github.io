               <p>Q. Did you, on the 24th of October, lose a three-shilling bank token, one eighteen-penny bank token, a ten-pound bank note, and a one-pound bank note - A. Yes; it was last Sunday week, between two and three in the morning; I was sitting in a public-house, in the <placeName id="t18131027-133-crimeloc794">Kingsland-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - A. I did. I lost my pocket-book and money. The prisoner and another man were sitting in the same box with me, in one and the same seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the nearest to you - A. I do not know. I was troubled with the tooth-ache; I was laying my head down. They were in the box when I first went into it. I sat at the end of the box, and they set on my right hand side. I am sure I had my pocket-book, I had just put it in my pocket a little time before I sat down there. I set in the box with them about half an hour; then they both went out together. In about a quarter of an hour after they were gone, I missed my pocket-book; I have never seen my pocket-book since. I told the persons in the house that my pocket was picked. The prisoner came into the house as I was going to bed; when he came in I told him I suspected he had taken my pocket-book and notes; he denied it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner about half past nine in the evening, on Sunday, the 24th of October; I took him to the watchhouse; he was charged with robbing this man of a pocket-book, bank notes, and money; I searched him; I found no money upon him. He had on a jacket, a new hat, and a new pair of trowsers; I asked him how he came by them; he said, he bought them. I locked him in the cage until the next morning. I then told him I had seen Gladman, that he had owned to the robbery; he said, b - r him, has he; they will not twist me, will they; I said, no. He then said, they will lag me, but I have got but one fin; they will make a fine of me. The prisoner has got but one arm.</p>

I was robbed of half a guinea, I don't know the day of the month nor day of the week particularly, it was about three o'clock in the morning; I light on a friend at the sign of the Feathers, a man that came out of the country, an uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are these Feathers? - In Westminster. At eleven o'clock I was getting into the street and wanted a bed, and this young woman said that she could help me to one; I was at the Feathers about ten o'clock at night, I left him about a quarter after ten, after that I went to the Barracks, I was too late, and then I went to search for a bed; I could not get in at the Barracks, I was locked out, I met with this girl, and she said she could help me to a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet her? - I don't know, I was a stranger to the town then, it was eleven o'clock. I went with her to her home, to her lodging, it was across the sign of the Bell, in High-street; I gave her six-pence; I asked her what she must have for the bed? she said a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110032"></xptr>shilling; I said I would gave her sixpence, which I gave her, and went to bed; I had this other young fellow, another soldier with me; I was in bed an hour and a half, then the girl came up stairs and she got my breeches up, and I asked her what she did with them? they were put by the bed side, I was undressed in bed; I called after her; she left the place, and took the half guinea; the half guinea was in gold, I had no other money in my breeches besides that; then she ran down stairs, and said she would come back with the change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your half guinea last before this? - I saw it when I got into bed, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking with your uncle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a new half guinea or an old one? - It was a new half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a spade half guinea? - I did not take particular notice, only the mark on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring back the change? - No. The next morning I saw her in the public house, about seven o'clock, the sign of the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the house you slept at? - No, it was the other side where we slept opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the woman you saw at the Bell, was the same woman that recommended the lodging to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the half guinea since? - But I never had it; I see it in the constable's hands the next day but one after I was robbed; I could not swear to it, it was like mine; when I laid it on her she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take this woman to bed to you at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no connection of any kind? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Elliott, did not you ask me to go down for a pint of gin? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give me the half guinea out of your own hand to get change? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober enough to know that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier; I was with this young man at his uncle's; we left his uncle about eleven o'clock, we went to the Barrack, and we were locked out, they are at the top of St. James's-park; we walked about a good while before we could find any thing likely for a lodging, at last we went into a public house, in a street in Westminster, to ask the landlord if he could tell us where to get one, and this woman we went with her; she said she would find us a good bed for a shilling; the young man said he would give her six-pence; we went into the room, and got into bed, and she left the room; after we had been in about half an hour she came into the room, and took this young man's breeches up and put her hand into his pocket, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the half guinea? - No, I did not see her take any thing out. As she was a going out of the room, this young man hallooed out to her to leave the half guinea, that she had no business with it; she went down stairs with it, and said she would go and get silver for it, but did not return with the silver, and we got up, then I went to my duty, and left the young man to look after the half guinea; I returned again there in about an hour, and he had found the woman quite in liquor in the public house opposite where we had the bed, and he desired her to give him the half guinea; she said she had none; after that she said that he gave it to her to go and get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110033"></xptr>change. The young man finding that his half guinea was nearly gone promised her something if she would give him the rest; and she replied that she would not; the young man after that proferred to let her off stealing the half guinea if she would pay a quart of gin; she said she would not; he told her he would send the constable and take her up; she told him he might fetch one, and I went for one, and the constable came and took her to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the half guinea in the hands of the constable, that he has been talking about? - It is the half guinea produced that she paid for the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he had a half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as to the half guinea that she paid at the bar, you did not see it paid there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether you did not see him give me the half guinea to get change? - I did not; I saw him give her six-pence before we got to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give her the half guinea when she came in afterwards? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of you any connection with this woman? - Not while I was there.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Bell; the woman lodges almost opposite my house; this woman came in about six o'clock, when the constable took her out of my house; I says to her, Bet, what might you want? she makes answer, nothing; I said to her, you had better go to bed, you are in liquor; she sat down in my tap room near seven o'clock; the soldier came in and says, damn you, you bitch, where is my money?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you that morning any half guinea? - No. By and by, when the soldier could not get the half guinea, he says to her, give me the change; he says give me three half crowns, and if you cannot give me three give me two, and so he came to a quart of gin; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any thing on her? - I produce nothing. The prisoner told me that she had got the gin at the Angel, at Mr. Stamp's house, and she had spent the half guinea; so I concluded that was the proper place to apply to see whether the half guinea would answer to what was lost.</p>
               <p>Court to Stamp. You produce the half guinea that a woman gave you? - I have got a half guinea, but I am not sure it is the same.</p>

I paused a little and then I said I would for a shilling; they said they would give me six-pence; we agreed for a shilling; when I came up stairs they gave me half a guinea to change, to get some gin; the soldier gave me one six-pence, and pulled off his waistcoat and shirt, and laid it on the chair, and wanted me to take them till he gave me the other six-pence; he got into bed and set up in the bed naked as he was, and gave me the half guinea, and I went down and got the gin, and I came in about six o'clock in the morning and gave him the change, and went out again, and when he came to ask for the change I had but two-pence in my pocket; the half guinea he gave me, and that was the way the change went; he told me if I would give him three half crowns he would let me go, and then he came to five shillings and then to a quart of gin. But the next day, when I came to him, I wanted to give him five shillings, but the other would not let him take it.</p>

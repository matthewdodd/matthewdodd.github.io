                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Jarratt, of Uckfield.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230007"></xptr>
               <p>—he gave me a parcel in Blackman-street, to put into the van—I had not then put the round frock containing the bag in, and I gave it to him to hold while I placed his parcel in the van—he had it about a minute or a minute and half—I then put that in—no one but he, the guard, and I were near it—the guard is not here, he did not see me put it in as he was alongside the horses—when I got to Croydon I misted the bag—I suspected the prisoner had taken it, came back directly, and gave information to inspector Waller immediately—I went with him to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodging, and found the bag and money in his pocket.</p>

The prosecutor complained to me of his loss, and 1 accompanied him to Chapel-court, Finsbury-square, where the prisoner lodged, about eleven or twelve o'clock—I opened the street-door, and knocked at the side parlour door, which was opened by the. prisoner's wife—I asked if George was at home—she said, "Yes"—I walked in—he was sitting by the fire-side—I asked if his name was George—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he was down on the Croy<lb></lb>don-road that evening—he said, "No"—I asked if he was along with his brother-in-law as far as the Elephant and Castle—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He charges you with robbing him of a bag of money"—he said, "He is a foolish man, I know nothing about it"—I then called Gaston in, and asked if he was the man—he said, "Yes"—I asked him to stand up, and I saw the end of the bag hanging out of his waistcoat pocket—I took it out—Gaston said, "That is my bag"—in his waistcoat pocket I found this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Gaston said, "How could you be so cruel to rob me after the friend 1 have been to you?"—he said, "If I had not robbed you some one else would, in the careless way you put it."</p>

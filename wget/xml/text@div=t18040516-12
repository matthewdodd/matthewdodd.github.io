Old Lee; the young one had the bag; they were both together, the father and the son; they said they had been on the other side of the water, and were going to work at Tottenham; when I examined them I thought they were all stolen; Payne and I took them both to the watch-house; we went to Mr. Hobson's brick-field, where I thought they belonged, and there I found the staple drawn from the sand-house.</p>

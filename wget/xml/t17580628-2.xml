He was soon stopped, and my handkerchief was found on the ground near him, and delivered to me, ( producing a silk handkerchief.) This is my property, here is the mark my daughter made upon it.</p>

               <p>Walker. I keep a brasier's shop at the corner of Field-lane, Holbourn, and was standing at my own door at the time I first saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the shepherd of George Johnson, of Bar<lb></lb>king-side—he had two hundred sheep there—I saw them all right on the evening of the 1st of September, about six o'clock—I counted them next morning about eight, and missed one ewe—I searched for it, and found the skin in the lower part of the field, and the head attached to the skin, with the entrails, liver, lights, and feet close by it—I saw some mutton in the hands of the police next day—it was fitted to the skin, and I am sure it belonged to it, it fitted completely—I am certain it was the ewe I missed—there were no marks on it, but it was one which we had bred ourselves—it was two years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 2nd of September, I went to the house of William Biggs, who is the father of Daniel Biggs—he was not at home—I searched the premises, and found the mutton in a tub under the bed—there were no stairs to the house—it was the whole of the carcase of the sheep—there was a tub full—there might be some pieces missing—the shoulders and legs were cat as a butcher would do it, but the rest was in smaller pieces—I compared it with the skin produced by Fletcher, and it corresponded.</p>

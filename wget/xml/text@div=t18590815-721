               <p>August, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was concealed in the wine-cellar with Scott, another officer—the prisoner came down stairs and unlocked the beer-cellar door—he unscrewed the connecting pipe of the beer-barrel—he then kneeled down and drank from the tap—he then fixed the bucket and drew it three parts full of beer—he took it into the outer cellar and went and hid it behind some barrels at the farther end of the cellar—he came back, locked the cellar door, and went up stairs—I followed him and called him into the bar parlour—I asked him what he had been doing in the cellar—he said he had been to put on the beer—I asked him what he drew a bucket of beer for—he said he had not—I told him I had seen him draw a bucket of beer and secrete it in the cellar—he considered some time and said he had not—I told him he had, and I had before seen him take seven buckets and fourteen bottles—he said he had never taken anything before, and what he drew the beer then for was to dissolve the sugar in the bucket, and in the morning he intended to put some water to it and put it into the barrel—I said, "Why did you take it out of the cellar?"—he said he did not know—I asked him what he had in his cupboard—he went in the tap-room, took the keys out of his pocket, unlocked his cupboard, and took from it a box of cigars and a bottle of brandy—I asked him to account for how he became possessed of the cigars—he said when he went to Whitbread's brewery to order the beer they gave him an order to go to the tap, and he went to a cigar shop opposite and had one or two cigars—that he had part of the order in beer and part in cigars in a cigar shop—I took him to the station and found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I examined the bucket of beer—there was no sugar in it whatever—I had seen him use that same bucket three or four times before.</p>

I was sitting at my door at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, on the 14th of June; I went into my parlour to light my pipe, and when I returned I missed the chair from my door - the prisoner was stopped with it, in about five minutes, at the corner of Great Alie-street, by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Had you shut up your shop? A. Yes; I do not think it was later than twelve o'clock; he was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you stop him? A. Yes; with the watchman; he had put it down then, and was resting his elbow on it - he was sober - there was a man and woman with him, but no one sitting in the chair. He was alone when I met him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Alie-street on the night of the 14th of June, calling the hour of twelve o'clock, when I saw the prisoner with his arm on the chair, in Little Alie-street, and hearing of Mr. Sheen losing the chair, I stopped him; Mrs. Sheen came up, and said it was hers; I took him to the watch-house - there was a man and woman alongside of him - he said he took the chair from a tall man. Mrs. Sheen said "You are the man who took the chair under your arm."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the other man? A. No; there was no charge against him; the prisoner complained, in going to the watch-house, that he had lost his hat - first he said in a row, and then he said he had lost it in Rupert-street - he then said he had left it at home - he did not seem at all tipsy.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to me with the chair - he did not appear to be drunk - when I went to him in the morning, he said "I am not drunk now - I can answer for myself."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him any questions the night before? A. No; I do not know what he meant by the expression.</p>

               <p>JURY to SAMUEL SHEEN. Q. Was the street light or dark? Q. Quite light - he could not have stumbled over the chair - it was beside the step, and before the shop window - the pavement is seven or eight feet wide.</p>

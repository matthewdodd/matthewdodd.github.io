                  </hi>. I live in Richard—street, Portman—market. I am in the employ of Mr. Marshall, who is building some houses in Camden—town—the prisoner Stammers is building some houses adjoining Mr. Marshall's—before the 22nd of Aug. I had seen bricks drawn to Stammer's premises by Mr. Perkin's carts, which excited my attention—the carts were driven by Unwin and Fisher, and Stammers was there to receive them—I cannot say how many times I had seen the carts deliver bricks, and Stammers there to receive them—I saw Unwin driving a cart of bricks there on the 22nd of Aug. in the morning, and Stammers was there to receive them—he was always there—I went up to the wharf in the Hampstead—road—it is on the side of the canal—I do not know the name of the wharf—I believe it belongs to the Birmingham Railway Company—I saw Unwin and Fisher at work there, loading the bricks in the carts and driving them away—they each took one cart—they drove them towards the road where they always did, but instead of going towards Chalk—farm, they went down another turning right down to where Stammers and our master was building—I went and got my victuals, and when I came out they were by the side of Mr. Stammer's buildings—I saw Mr. Stammers there—he and Fisher walked together, Stammers gave him something, but what I cannot say—Unwin went away with the carts, and Fisher staid behind—the bricks were out of the carts—they had been shot out and laid on the ground—I saw Stammers before they van shot—I saw him point to where they were to be shot, on some more bricks—I had seen the other bricks shot—one load was shot in the morning—I know good bricks from bad ones—the usual mode of taking bricks out of carts it handing them from one to another—shooting them out would be likely to damage them, without they were good hard stocks, and then it do not hurt them—they are counted into the carts—they are very seldom counted when they are taken out—I saw Stammers give something out of his hand to Fisher—I heard it chink, but I do not know what it was—Fisher then went away—I had some conversation with Stammers after this—I was telling him he had a good deal of stuff brought home there, and I asked whether he was aware where it came from—he said he did not know where it came from—I said to him the next day (that was on the Thursday, I think)," The bricks do not seem to come in to—day as they used to do, "and I told him they belonged to the Railway Company I believed—he said he did not know, be bought them, he did not know where they came from—I told him if he was not aware, I knew he never bought them fairly—he said I was to mind my own business, he did not know where they came from—I told him I believed they were stolen property—he said he did not know, and to mind my own business.</p>

Fisher and Unwin were in my employ on the 22nd of Aug.—on that day they were employed to cart bricks from the wharf to the station, Fisher for half the day, and Unwin for the whole day—it was their duty to take them to the Camden station—they had no authority to go anywhere else with them—I do not know Stammers—I never had any dealing with him—the other prisoners had no right to be at all on his premises on that day—it is from 500 to 700 yards from the wharf to Stamraers's premises—it is not above a minute's difference between that and the Camden station—Stammers was bailed on the first examination—after he had been bailed, he called on me at my house one morning—I walked into the parlour, and there he sat—he said, "What is to be done in this little affair?"—I said, "It is not a little affair, I think it is a very serious affair; you don't take it in a right light; don't say anything; don't tell me anything; I can say nothing;" and he walked out—bricks are sometimes shot out of a cart—we generally stack them.</p>

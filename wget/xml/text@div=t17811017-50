             was then gone to bed. I let my master in then: I had shut up the shop that night at about eight o'clock; there are inside shutters to the counters; the shutters were all done up in the windows; there were shelves to put the hats upon; we kept in the window hats loose and in boxes, and there were hat boxes about under the counters: it is a very small shop. My master went out about eleven in the morning, and had not been home all day; upon my letting him in at eleven o'clock, we went up to bed. My master went down into the kitchen, but came up after me immediately; he undressed himself, and got into bed; I was undressing myself. I heard a kind of cracking noise; I said, Here is our old man a coming, (for we had frequently heard a noise before, and we had been used to say, the house was haunted;) I heard it more and more: my master said, Put out the candle; he was got into bed; I said, God! here it is coming, (for it seemed nearer, as if it was coming up stairs;) then I jumped upon the bed; I was frightened, and meant to get my breeches off as fast as I could, to go into bed with my stockings on. As soon as I got my breeches off, and was going to put them under the bed, I heard a knock very hard against the street door; my master jumped out of bed, and took the candle up, and cried out, I am ruined! I am ruined! he said that before he went out of the room, and at that time he could not see the light of the fire; but there was a great noise in the street, and I had not heard at that time the cry of fire: he took the candle, ran up stairs, and cried out, Fire! Fire! and called out to Mrs. Crawford. Our chamber door was, I believe, shut; my master had shut it after him; I had not perceived any smoke, but directly as the room door was opened there was a smoke almost enough to strangle one: I got out of a back window, and made my escape from the fire. I gave an account to Mr. Saunderson, a neighbour, when we were going to be examined, at the White Hart; he seemed very angry with my master: my master said to me, Sure you have not been saying any thing to Mr. Saunderson? I said I have told him you had been down to wash your hands. My master said, Why did you say so? Why did not you say that we both went up to bed together?</p>

               <p>Had there been any material alteration either in the quantity of houshold goods, or of the stock, since you have been in the house? or have they remained nearly the same? - There were, I believe, more hats in the house at the time of the fire than there had been for a great while before.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross-examination he said,</p>
               <p>'That</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prisoner. The apprentice shut up shop, and went out at eight o'clock. My master came home afterwards, to some of his company who were waiting for him; he supped, and went out. Claxton came in at eleven o'clock; I went to bed, and left him to sit up for his master. When I let Claxton in, every thing appeared safe in the shop. I had not got into bed when I heard my master come home; I got into bed, and put out my candle: in a quarter of an hour's time my master burst open the door, took hold of me, and helped me out of the window. I left the house in nothing but my shift and cap.</p>

He said, he knew no more than the child unborn. I asked him in what part of the house the fire broke out? he said, in the shop. I asked him who was the person last up in the family? he said, the Old Woman. I had not any suspicion that the fire was occasioned otherwise than by accident.

Mr. Talboys asked him who was the last person left up in the house? and he said the Old Woman.</p>

               <p>About half after eleven o'clock I came through between the New Church and Holywell-street to the Talbot Inn; some little matter of curiosity attracted me; I went down a passage about seven or eight yards. I passed the house of Mr. Ballard; I then saw nothing of the kind. I staid in the passage about three or four minutes; then I heard a girl squall. I ran out; before I had well got to the top of the passage a watchman swung his rattle; that was repeated by several more, and before I had well got across the way five or six people were at the door. There was an amazing cry of fire before there was any pummelling at the door. The watchmen came up, and with their staves beat at the door, and some women with their pattens, and there was a very great cry of fire. I stood rather within the middle of the road. The fire was in the left-hand side of the shop: it appeared to me just as I came, which was momentarily from the first cry, as if it was the light of a strong candle; and it seemed to be very near the wall, because the smoak in particular I saw at the top of the cieling, before I saw the flames come; it encreased in a most amazing manner in half a minute; the smoke seemed to bear very strong towards the door. There were, I think, holes in the shutters, and a light over the door. When they broke open the window shutters, the first burst of the flames reached as high, I believe, as the two pair of stairs window: just at that time I saw two or three people come out of the garret window, in their shirts or shifts, and go over the houses: it then wanted about twenty minutes of twelve. It was not above two minutes and a half from the time of first seeing the light till I saw the people come out of the window. I was yesterday in conversation with Claxton, at the Swan with two Necks, St. John's street; he told me there, that he believed his master was innocent.</p>

            , a surveyor to the Sun Fire office, deposed, that he collected the persons together who had insured at their office; that the prisoner's apprentice gave him exactly the same account then as he had now done in court.)</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in his defence, said he had been on board the Nottingham East-Indiaman, with a gentleman and two ladies; that they had dined and drank tea there; that when he came home to his company in the evening, who had got to his house before him, he found his shop shut up, and the apprentice gone out; that they supped together, and at a quarter past ten they went away, and he went out, and staid at a neighbour's till past eleven. When he came home, he was let in by his apprentice; that he bid the apprentice go up to bed; that he himself went down in the kitchen to wash his hands, which were very sore with rowing; and immediately followed the apprentice: that when he had been in bed about a minute, and the apprentice was undressing himself, he heard a noise at the door, and people hallooing out, Fire! fire! that he jumped out of bed, and opened the door, but the smoke put the candle out; and then he said he was ruined. That he ran up stairs, and alarmed Mrs. Crawford, and then they all escaped out at the window.)</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of goods were deposited in this warehouse. - A. A great number of chests of congou tea; it is a tea warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing - A. I did; between nine and ten in the morning I saw him pulling away the paper that covered the tea, under the lid; that was the first I saw. Afterwards he dipped his hand in three times; he kept shuffling it under his apron, under his great coat; that is what I saw him do. I was not positive whether he put it in his small clothes pocket or no; that was after ten o'clock. I told the commodore what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the chest of tea. - A I did; it was fell of tea; I looked after the tea was taken away; I saw the toutenage cut sufficient to admit a man's hand.</p>

I saw him out a chest open. About a quarter before eleven I saw the prisoner at a chest, he was at work with a knife, he cut the tutenage; he spilt the tea down on the floor; he stooped down, took a handful of it, and put it in his pocket; I informed the elder of it.</p>

Immediately Pocock told me he saw him take some tea, I told him he was wanted in the accounting house; he was searched in my presence; there were fourteen ounces of black tea found upon him, loose in his left hand coat pocket; he said he was very sorry, and I believe he said he did not know what induced him to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of this fourteen ounces. - A. About five shillings.</p>

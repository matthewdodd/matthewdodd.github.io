               <p>Q. What time did you go there. - A. It was after twelve that we went there, after the second fire, as soon as it was put out; the second fire did not begin till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the first fire begin. - A. Before twelve; there were two fires, one up stairs and the other down.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did the first fire begin. - A. In a closet in the laundry, and the second fire was in a closet in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the first fire put out. - A. It was, and after that there was a second fire in the closet in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What was in the closet in the parlour. - A. The table linen and the plate was in that closet, the linen was below and the plate was above it.</p>
               <p>Q. That second fire was put out. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. That led you to see whether the plate was safe. - A. Yes; when the fire was out we were gathering up the things that we missed out of the tray.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you miss out of the tray. - A. We missed out of the tray a number of things, the plate, in short all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030041"></xptr> Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner relative to these things, or did any thing pass between you and the prisoner. - A. After the second fire was put out we went to collect the things together; the tray in which the plate was there were a great many things deficient. I enquired where they were of the prisoner, she said that she had put them in the back closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before. - A. I had seen many of them in the course of the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the soup ladle. - A. No, we had not occasion to use that. It might be some little time before that I saw that, they were all under her care; when she was going to be taken away by the constable she begged that I would not let her go to prison.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Knapp. We understand that you are one of the partners of this banking-house. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner said any thing to you, had you made her any promise, or did you threaten her. A. None whatever. On the morning of the 16th of November, the morning after the fire, this is the memorandum of the articles she confessed (witness holding a paper in his hand); I took them down exactly as she told me. On the morning of the 16th after the fire I was called up. I went immediately to the office No. 2, White Hart court; I there found the family in very great confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. The family in what house. - A. Mr. Scorer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you call it Mr. Scorer's house. - A. Because he occupies the upper part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any family live there but himself and family. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that every one of the other parties have other dwelling houses. - A. Yes, we have.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any of the clerks belonging to the banking house sleep in the house. - A. One only.</p>
               <p>Q. Now come to the conversation of the prisoner. - A. On the morning of the 16th of November between two and three o'clock, I charged her as to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the fire been out then. - A. It was entirely out before I was alarmed. I heard that there were several articles of plate missing; she confessed to me to the following articles.</p>
               <p>Court. Now Mr. Maud, before you proceed I wish you would tell me what you mean by her confessing to you, what did she say. - A. She told me that she had been insuring in the lottery, that she had borrowed five pound of the cook; from that conversation I asked her where the person lived that she insured with and what was his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go on to state what she said relative to that paper in your hand. - A. I asked her what be came of the plate that was missing; she fell on her knees and said that she was the most wicked wretch alive. I then asked her what she had done with the plate, she said where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what were her words. - A. I do not immediately recollect what her language was, she said that she had taken the soup ladle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where she had taken it from. - A. No, not from what part of the house; with that she went on to enumerate the whole - a soup ladle, a gravy spoon, a tea spoon, two table spoons, six desert spoons, one sheet and two shifts; I then asked her where they were pawned, she answered at Barker's in Hounsditch in the name of Barnes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In consequence of this information who went to Barker's. -</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The marshalman went to Mr. Barker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (to Mr Maud) She told you that she was a most miserable creature, and that she had insured from time to time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you that she had pawned these things and that it was her intention to redeem them. - A. She never mentioned a word of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any porter that lives in the house. - A. We have a porter, he does not sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. The expences of housekeeping are not paid by the firm. - A. No.</p>

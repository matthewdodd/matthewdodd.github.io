On the 13th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went to bed, and saw that the doors and windows were fastened. Between three and four o'clock, my husband got up to go to work - I got up, and fastened the door after him, went to bed again, and got up rather before six o'clock; it was then light. I did not go to the washhouse when I let my husband out, but at six o'clock, I found the wash-house window broken, and the door open - somebody must have got over the gate to get to it; it is a sash window; a person could put his arm through, and unbolt the door; there are no shutters to it - I missed a pair of breeches out of a washing tub, a shirt, a pair of stockings, four odd ones, and a pocket handkerchief. I had them to wash, and had left them in water the night before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 14th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming from Edmonton, towards town, with with a bundle under his right arm, and asked what was in it; he said a shirt and a pair of breeches of his own; that he brought them from Harford. I examined them; the breeches were clean and wet - I took him to the watch-house, found another shirt in his hat, and a white bag, and some stockings in his pocket.</p>

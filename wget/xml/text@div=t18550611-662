                  </hi>. I am a miller, of Nine Elms Mill, Battersea—Kingshott was my carman. On the evening of 15th June, my attention was attracted to a sack of oats, covered up under some refuse straw in one corner of the stable—the sack was totally concealed—it contained six bushels of oats—there is a hutch in the stable, in which it is usual to put the oats required for the horses—it will contain about a sack—when the prisoner required oats for the horses, it was his duty, to ask the foreman of the mill for a sack of oats—he had no authority to ask for more at one time—I got a constable, Dendy, who mixed some pieces of paper in the sack, in my Pre<lb></lb>sence, and replaced it in its former position—he afterwards cut a comer of the sack—next evening, Friday, I found the sack removed from the corner, and concealed nearer to the door, in a better position for removing—King-shott was to take a load of flour to Bromley, in Kent, about eleven miles off, on the Saturday morning, and was to leave at four o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, with the waggon—I observed the waggon that evening, it had two nose bags strapped to it, each of which would hold about a peck—no other food would be required for the horses on that journey—this hay is similar to mine, and is bound in a similar manner, and these oats are of a similar kind to mine, of which I produce a sample—the officer put his initials, in pencil, on some of the papers, but I did not see him find them—these sacks are mine, they have my mark on them—Kingshott had gone that journey for me for three weeks before.</p>

               <p>miles from me, and would not be an improper place for him to stop and rest the horses—he is usually gone a little more than twelve hours—he his been in my service twelve months, and was with Mr. Hutton, who occupied the mill before me—he continued with me when Mr. Hutton left—he is married, and has several children—my attention was called to the sack by another of my servants—my foreman is not here—I cannot tell whether this was not one of the sacks of oats which had been given out by him for the horses—I put my hand into the nose bags when they were strapped to the side of the wagon—I should not have objected to his taking more food, if he thought it necessary—he would not take hay with him; the hones never have hay, it is always cut up into chaff—I or the foreman get up about or before 6 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I accompanied the prosecutor to his stable on Thursday evening, and under some litter he pointed out a sack contain<lb></lb>ing four bushels—I took this handful of oats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of it—I also marked seven pieces of paper; some I put my number on, and others my initials, and placed them in the sack as far as I could <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> my hand down, about a foot and a half—those produced are some of them, here are my initials; I found them in the sack—I went again on Friday evening, and found the sack removed nearer to the door—I cut this corner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off it, it quite agrees—I went to the house about 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and about half past 2 o'clock saw Kingshott come into the yard—I could see all over the yard where I was—he unlocked the stable, went in, and then came out; went to the shed where the waggon was standing, then returned to the stable, took out a sack apparently full, and went to the yard where the waggon was standing; he then came back to the loft, threw out two trusses of hay, and took them to where the waggon was standing; he then came out of the stable a third time, with a sack containing about a bushel and a half, and took that also to the waggon—at a little before 4 o'clock I saw him drive off—the waggon was covered with a tarpaulin, and was drawn by two horses; I could not see what it contained—I acquainted the master, and then went into the shed where the waggon had been, but could not find any corn or hay—I followed Kingshott till he came to the King's Arms, at Southend, near Bromley, seven or eight miles from the prosecutor's—he drew into the yard, and I went on to the police station in Bromley, it was then about half past 8 o'clock—I remained there till I saw Kingshott pass, about an hour afterwards—I then followed him till he came to the place where he had to unload, and when he had unloaded I stopped him on his road back, told him that I was a policeman, and should charge him with stealing a sack of oats, and two trusses of hay from his master's stable that morning—he said, "I know nothing about if—I searched the waggon, and found this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the corner cut off, which had been cut off by me, it was empty—there was no hay in the waggon—I took him into custody, handed him over to another constable, and gave informa<lb></lb>tion</p>

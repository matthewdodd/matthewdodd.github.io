            . I was set to watch this building of Mr. Callen's; I saw two men in company, one of them went up and threw the lead down, then he came down; they parted it, and took up each some, and were going away with it; I went after them, then they threw it down, and I took the prisoner, who was one of them, the other got away; this was on the third of March, about one in the morning; I took the prisoner to the watch-house; he was taken before the Justice, and sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell; there was upwards of an hundred weight of the lead.</p>

            . After Hildey had taken the prisoner, he called for assistance, he had the prisoner by the collar; we took him to the place where he had dropped the lead, which was about 20 yards from the building; he denied knowing any thing of it.</p>

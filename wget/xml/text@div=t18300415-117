            . I am the prosecutor's niece. I was in the parlour, and saw a man in the shop - I looked up, thinking it was a customer, and he ran out with two umbrellas in his hand; I ran after him - he was running as fast as be could; they cried Stop thief! and he dropped the umbrellas; a person took them up, and gave them to me - the person who dropped them ran away, and I did not see him stopped; there were several pursuing him - I took the umbrellas and went in: I think the prisoner is the man who was in the shop, but I cannot be certain - I saw him in custody five or ten minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the back parlour? A. Yes; the shop is not very large - the door from the shop to the parlour was open; I was sitting with my face to the shop, and was working.</p>

            . I live opposite the shop. On the 24th of March I saw the prisoner go into the shop - I am sure he is the man; I saw him come out with two umbrellas on his arm, and run away with them - I was running over, and saw Stoddart when I got on the curb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How wide is the street? A. I think about twelve yards; our house is directly opposite: I swear the prisoner is the man - I do not know that I had seen him before.</p>

I was in Back-lane, near Ratcliff-highway, and saw a great number of persons mustering; I went up, and found the prisoner, who had dropped down, surrounded by the people - I took him on the place, and brought these umbrellas; I found nothing material on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had not the umbrella in his possession? A. No; I understood he had dropped them, but I did not see that.</p>

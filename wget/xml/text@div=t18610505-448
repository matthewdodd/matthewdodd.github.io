                  </hi>. I live at Barnes'-alley, Deptford, and am a labourer—on Tuesday night, 5th March, I went to bed about ten minutes to 9—I live with my uncle and his wife and family—they did not go to bed till after that—I was awakened between 10 and 11 o'clock, by a loud noise of kicking at the street door—my uncle opened the window—the prisoner asked for one Sullivan, or Barret—my uncle told him there was no such party there, and that if he did not leave he would give him in charge to the police—the prisoner said that if it was his fortune to come down, he would lay hold of him and knock his brains against the wall—the prisoner was breaking the door—I got out of bed, came downstairs, opened the door, and said, "Is it not a shame for you to be making such a noise at such an unreasonable hour of the night as this; would not it be better for you to be at home and in bed like a decent boy"—the words were scarcely out of my mouth when he struck me in the nose with his fist—my nose bled—I laid hold of him and knocked him through the passage—I knocked him down and fell a top of him, and then he struck me with a knife, here, in the belly—when I found the knife going in, I cried, "Uncle, uncle, take me up"—my uncle was in the passage then, and laid hold of me by the waist and pulled me in doors—the prisoner then made three attempts with the knife at my breast; he struck me with it in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I put up my hand to save myself, and he cut me slightly—I got faint and weak then with loss of blood, and did not know anything till the following morning—I was sent to Guy's hospital—I went there on 6th March, and left on 19th April—the prisoner was under the influence of liquor—I had not had any quarrel with him before that—he was not drunk; I could tell that he had been drinking—I knew him by sight before, but had had no conversation with him, except twice; once last September, and once either before or after that, I do not know which—I saw him there once when my uncle was there—when I found the knife stuck in me at first, I pulled his hand away, and in coming out the knife scraped me slightly towards the hip.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you feel the blood coming from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I felt the blood coming down my thigh—I do not know much what occurred after my uncle pulled me up—the night was dark—there was no gas near the door—I did not bring a light down with me; I came down in my night shirt—it was light enough for me to distinguish who was there; I am sure it was the prisoner—I knew him by sight before—I had seen him frequently, though I had only spoken to him twice—I knew him by his person and voice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Barnes'-alley, Deptford, and am a labourer—the last witness is a nephew of mine—he lodges at my house—on the night of 5th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prisoner came to No. 2, Telegraph-court—he was knocking at the door; I did not know who was outside or what it was about—I raised the bed-room window, put my head out, and asked him what he wanted there—he said he wanted Michael Sullivan and Barret—I told him they were not in the court at all, and to go away from the door and not to make any more noise, and that if he did not go away I would call out for a policeman and give him in charge—with that I hallooed out for the police as loud as I could ten or eleven times, and as I hallooed he hallooed out the same as me to bother me, so that the police should not hear me—he said that if he found me down he would knock my brains against the wall—I did not see any other person—Michael Collins got out of bed in his shirt, and so did I, and came down after him—the door was locked when I got down—Michael Collins was at the door first, inside; I was just behind him when he had the door open—the knocking continued all through—I saw the prisoner strike Collins as soon as he went outside and asked him to go away from the place—after he struck him Collins caught hold of him, just by the door, and knocked him down, and then Collins hallooed out, "Oh, uncle, he has a knife and he has stabbed me in the belly with it"—he had nothing on then but his shirt, nor had I—I got him in and pulled him up, and the prisoner kept hold of his linen smock which he had outside his shirt—I was outside trying to pull my nephew up again, and I caught hold of him in my arms to get him away—I turned and locked the door and put the bolt firm on it, and then went upstairs and lit a candle—I had then got my nephew in doors, and took him upstairs with me—when I saw the state he was in, the blood running about the room, I got a handkerchief and tied round him, and put him into bed; and I made two attempts to turn round to the clock to take one of the weights off, to knock the prisoner's brains out, but God Almighty put it into my heart not to do it—the prisoner was then outside the door—I did not put him out—he was outside when I got my nephew away and locked the door—he did not go away—there was a water-pail outside the street-door, and he began to knock at the door with it—it had three iron hoops on it, and an iron handle—I wanted to go down then, and Michael Collins hallooed out and said, "I have no one but myself, and you have a family," and he bade me stop in doors, and I did so—I went to the police-station before 7 o'clock in the morning—when the policeman came back with me, my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> had been picking up the staves of the water-pail, which the prisoner had broken in pieces, and she said, "Oh! here is the knife that done the injury"—I saw the policeman take it out of her hands—it was all full of blood, both the blade and the haft.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this a dark night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew his person very well that night—it was not too dark for me to know his face—it was light enough in the passage, or at the doorway, for him to have seen that my nephew was only dressed in his shirt—I am sure of that—it would be a very dark night if I could not see a man with his shirt on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on 6th March, between 10 and 11 in the morning, Collins was brought there in a depressed condition—he had a wound on the belly about half an inch long and quarter of an inch wide—he was in a dangerous state, and remained in the hospital till 19th April—wounds of that description rarely prove fetal, but they are dangerous—he may have a rupture there, but I do not think he will—it would have been highly dangerous if inflammation had taken place, or if he had not been taken proper care of.</p>

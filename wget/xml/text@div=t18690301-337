                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the deceased—on this Wednesday night, just before 9, my mother was out, and I went out to meet her—I met her coming across the road, and walked across with her—when we got about the middle of the road I saw Mr. and Mrs. Blanch going along on the pathway, about three or four yards from us—I did not know them then—I had never seen them before—I said to my mother, "Mother, how high that person holds her clothes"—I did not intend them to hear it—that was all I said—my mother replied, "That gentleman at the side is the one that beat your little brother"—he is thirteen—I said, "He would not have done it if I had been there"—that was all that passed between me and my mother—we came up to the gate, and as mother turned round to open the gate Mr. and Mrs. Blanch were there, and began using very bad language—Mrs. Blanch then came and pushed open the gate, and struck mother two or three times on the side of the head, I think it was on the left side, with her fist—they were hard blows—my mother fell up against the wall which divided the two houses—Mrs. Blanch then struck me on the face; she gave me a good knock—I don't know why she did it, I suppose it was because I took my mother's part—I stood before her—my mother then came outside the gate and asked her what she did it for—the prisoner then Dame up—Mrs. Blanch sent for her—someone went for her—I heard Mrs. Blanch call somebody, and she immediately came, and Mrs. Blanch said "Give it to them Amelia," using a very bad word—she said, "Give it to the b—Amelia"—she and Mrs. Blanch then caught hold of mother and beat her, and threw her against the iron railings—they beat her on her head and shoulders and face—they beat her violently—I got my mother up, she was on the ground, she had fallen from the blows; I got her up—father came out then, and the prisoner struck him with something that she had in her hand—I can't say what it was—it was something black—she struck him in the right eye—my mother was standing just by—I was standing with her, close to father—I told father that Mrs. Blanch had hit mother, and he went to her and Mr. Blanch—the prisoner came up to mother and said, "I will do for you;" and she caught hold of mother and struck her violently again, and threw her down on the pathway, and she rolled over on to the kerb—that was</p>

               <p>outside our gate—she struck mother somewhere against the ear—she had something in her hand then, the same as when she struck father—I am quite sure of that—I saw the same round black something in her hand—I got mother up, and she fell on Mrs. Clark's, a neighbour's shoulder—mother said. "You wicked creature, you have given me my death blow"—and she said, "Yes, you b—r, and here is another one for you:" and she struck her again with her fist in the face as she laid on Mrs. Clark's shoulder—she appeared very angry while she was doing all this—I and father then took mother indoors, and gave her some brandy—she said she felt very bad, and said, "I don't believe I shall ever go outside again, my head is so bad"—we put her to bed—about 2 o'clock I was called by my little brother, and went to my mother—she was then insensible—I gave her some water, but her teeth were closed, and she bled at the mouth, and her eyes were shut—she never spoke after she went to bed, and never opened her eyes—she died at 7.45 in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Neither you nor your mother used any bad language at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we were not in the habit of using bad language—I had never seen them before—I used no bad language—it was about three doors from our own gate that we passed them, and about seven from Mr. Blanch's—neither I or my mother said, "There goes the stinking b—h; I sup<lb></lb>pose she is going to a penny <hi rend="italic">gaff</hi>;" what I said was, "Oh, mother, how that person shows her legs!" I did not know who she was then—mother said it was Mr. Blanch, that hit Georgey, and I said, "He should not have hit him if I had been there," because I would have taken his part—that was said just as we passed—it was all done in a few minutes—Mr. and Mrs. Blanch turned back, and came after us—we saw them when we went to shut our gate; we were both inside the gate—Mrs. Blanch did not say, "I want to know how it is you are so constantly insulting me in this way"—my mother did not say to father, "Here is the b—pensioner that struck our boy, and who you have been waiting to see for some time;" she did not speak, she was too bad, besides, she would not use such language—it did not take place, as I know of, and I was there all the time—father did not rush out of the gate and commence sparring at Mr. Blanch; he came out quietly to see what was the matter—he did not strike a blow at Mr. Blanch which hit Mrs. Blanch—after Prosser came out, my father and mother and I did not rush at her, and drag her to the ground, and punch her—I did not touch her, nor did mother strike her at all, nor did father strike her so that she went into the road—I never saw her go into the road—she did not fall into the road, she was on the pathway—I never saw her on the ground at all—I did not see anybody strike her; she did not give anyone a chance of striking her—before Prosser came out Mrs. Blanch had struck mother several blows on the head, hard blows, with her fist, on her head, face, and shoulders; and she also struck me—she gave mother two or three blows first, and then she struck her again—that was before Prosser came out—I stated so before the Magistrate (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, did not contain that statement.</hi>)—I was so excited, mother having died that same morning, and I was never in such a place before, and I did not state it all at Worship Street.</p>

               <p>of their hearing it—they did hear it, I suppose, or they would not have come back—I had only come home from service on the Friday before—I can hardly say what it was that Prosser had in her hand; it was black; it seemed more like iron than anything—it was round her fingers, as if she had got her fingers through it, like a ring—it went on two or three fingers, by what I could see of it.</p>

I will do for you!" and both she and Mrs. Blanch rushed at Mrs. Glover, and dashed her against the iron railings—she fell with her head against them—Mrs. Blanch said to Mrs. Prosser, "Give it to the b—r, Amelia"—before the woman could scarcely get up on her feet they dashed her to the ground again, both of them—I am quite sure they both struck her—Mrs. Blanch was the first one to strike her—they struck her all about the breast, face and all—Mrs. Glover said, "You cruel creature, you have given me my death blow"—I did not stop any longer after that.</p>

I am a surgeon—I was called to the deceased between 2 and 3 o'clock on Thursday morning, 4th February—she was lying on her back, totally insensible—her skin was cold and clammy—her pulse slow and laboured—the pupils of the eyes were fully dilated and could bear pressure with my finger, showing all the marked symptoms of compression of the brain—she died a few hours after—I made a <hi rend="italic">post morten</hi> examination, externally, and found two large bruises over both thighs, one on the left breast, and a puffy tumour over the right ear—on removing the scalp, I found that inside the puffy tumour there was a large clot of blood, which terminated on the peritoneum—on removing the skull-cap, I found from six to eight ounces of clotted blood on the surface of the brain—the right ventricle was empty, the other contained a clot of blood weigh<lb></lb>ing from two to three ounces—the other organs of the chest were healthy—the left lung showed recent signs of congestion—the left kidney was ex<lb></lb>tensively</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010031"></xptr>
               <p>diseased—my opinion is, that the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the surface of the brain, and in the substance of the brain—I should say caused by a blow or fall—there was nothing in the chest or kidney to cause death—she had been under medical treatment at the London Hospital, and had been evidently treated for spitting of blood occasionally—there was marked disease of the kidney, but nothing to cause immediate death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the extravasation be caused by a single blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say, positively—in all probability a single blow would cause a rapture of the vessel—any violence to the skull to produce extravasation must produce a rupture of the vessel—if the vessel ruptured is small, death would be much slower than if it was a large one.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 83, Devonshire Street, and am clerk to a colonial broker, in whose employ I have been twelve years—on Wednesday evening, 3rd February, I went out with my wife—when we had proceeded a little distance from our house we met the deceased and her daughter—as they passed, one of them said, "There she goes, the stinking b—h, I suppose she is going to a penny gaff"—my wife turned round to me and said, "Those are the Glovers, that is the way that I have been insulted for some time past, and I think it only right that you should ask what they mean by it"—I turned back with my wife, towards their house—when we got to the gate the mother was inside the gate, and the daughter was out<lb></lb>tide—the mother appeared very excited, and pulled the daughter inside the gate and slammed it—my wife said, "What do you mean by insulting me in this way continually"—the deceased called out to someone inside the house, and Mr. Glover came out and commenced fighting, or endeavouring to fight me—he aimed a blow at me, but it struck my wife—as he struck her, Amelia Prosser, my servant, returned the blow to him; she came from the house—the father, mother, and daughter immediately fell on the ser<lb></lb>vant; the deceased caught hold of her by the hair, and she was dragged forcibly by the three into the road; she was on the ground, the husband was kneeling on her chest, and the mother and daughter were standing over her, pommelling into her—the only remark my wife made was, "Amelia, Amelia, for God's sake come away, this will be the death of me"—she did not say, "Give it the b—," or, "Give it to her <hi rend="italic">Mill</hi>, give it to her"—she never used any such words, she did not in any way incite the prisoner to strike the deceased, she never raised her hand throughout the whole affair—while they were upon the prisoner my wife caught hold of the first person she could, and it was the daughter, by the net-work which she wore round her pelorine, I believe it is called, and in endeavouring to pull her off I believe she tore it—as soon as we had removed the daughter we caught hold of Prosser and dragged her forcibly into the nearest house that was open, which was a beer-shop; the skirt of her dress was torn and covered with mud—I have it in Court, in precisely the same state; her hair was hanging all over her face—there were two scratches on the side of her face, and she complained of being very much kicked—I and my wife's brother went out to endeavour to find a policeman, but were not able to do so—we were out five or six minutes, perhaps ten, and returned—I saw the whole of what took place from the commencement to the end—my wife did not strike a single blow, or use the expressions imputed to her—the prisoner had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010032"></xptr>
               <p>nothing in her hand—the only thing I saw the prisoner do was to strike Mr. Glover in return for the blow that he struck my wife; I honestly believe that blow was not intended for my wife, I believe it was intended for me—the whole affair, from my wife going up to the gate to the time of dragging the prisoner away, was not more than about three minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are no pensioner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not see Mrs. Glover leaning on the arm of Mrs. Clarke, she might have seen, my eyes were in the direction of the servant, not in the direction of Mrs. Glover—on my oath, I did not see the prisoner strike her while her bead was resting on Mrs. Clarke's arm—if it happened I should imagine I should have seen it, but I cannot swear it—I think it is very improbable, as I kept a sharp watch on the prisoner throughout the whole time—I did not see Mrs. Glover taken into her house—I did not see her fall against the garden wall, or hear her say, "You have given me my death blow"—I should imagine I must have heard it if it was said, I was so near—I hand nothing of the kind—I boxed her boy's ears on Saturday, 2nd January, I found him and my son fighting in the street, I pulled them apart and boxed both their ears, and pulled my son indoors—I was before the Magistrate when this charge was made, but was not called—I have not talked this matter over with my wife a great many times—the subject has been mentioned—I was examined before the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on the night in question I was going out for a walk with my husband, and met the deceased and her daughter—I did not recognize them except by the remark they passed, "There she goes, the dirty stinking b—h, I suppose she is off to a penny <hi rend="italic">gaff</hi>—the deceased said that—in consequence of that I made a remark to my husband and turned back—the deceased slammed her gate and spat in my face before I reached as far as the gate—she called her husband, and he came out and made use of very bad language, and threatened to strike my husband—I was between, and tried to prevent it, and the blow struck me on the left side of my head—I sent for Proaser—I saw her strike Mrs. Glover—that was instantly after I had been struck—the deceased, her husband and daughter, then all attacked Prosser—the deceased took hold of her by the hair of her head, and the man struck her violently, and likewise the daughter, and they all fell into the road—Prosier was underneath—I called to my husband to get her out or she would be killed, as the man was kneeling on her chest, while the others were beating her, and I called to Prosser, "Come out of the crowd or I shall fall dead;" but she was not able to do so, as they had her by the hair of the head—I did not at any time strike the deceased a single blow, or raise my finger—I never said, "Kill the b—," or any such expression—the daughter did—I did not say, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">Mill</hi>, give it to her"—the deceased said, "Give it to her, let her have it;" and the daughter instantly kicked Prosser in the face, and in what she termed the <hi rend="italic">guts</hi>—I did not see the deceased in the arms of another woman, with her head resting on her arm, nor did I see Prosser strike her while she was on the woman's arm—she was in the road, with all of them fighting her—I first got the daughter away, and, by that means, managed to get hold of part of my servant's clothes, and my husband assisted—after the men had lifted the man off her chest, we dragged her to a beer-shop, the nearest place we could get into, she was almost naked, she was naked halfway down to her stomach, her frock was smothered with mud, her hair had been greatly pulled out, we have only a</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose you were as calm and quiet as you are now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not, I was very much agitated and frightened—I did not make use of a word of bad language—Prosser came up at the time I was struck—I sent for her before I received the blow, because I saw the man was determined to use such bad language, and to fight—I sent for her to fetch a policeman—I did not call out for her—I sent a lad, a neighbour's son—I did not say to her, "Give it her, kill the b—, Amelia"—I posi<lb></lb>tively swear I did not—there were not many persons round at first, there were a great many after—I know Mrs. Stretch, from living opposite—I know Mrs. Clarke is a neighbour; I did not see her there that night—I did not see the deceased resting her head on Mrs. Clarke's arm, I never saw the deceased after they all fell in the road—I do not attend singing halls, never in my life—I have three children living—I live two doors, I think, from the Glover's—I did not see anybody strike Mrs. Glover—I heard of her death next morning—I was very much surprised indeed at it, and wondered what caused it, when I saw her fighting as she was the night before, although I knew she had been ill some considerable time—she was a thinner woman than me and rather smaller—I did not know her at all—I never spoke a word to her in my life—I believe my husband spoke to her one morning, when she attacked him with a broom, that was nearly two months ago—I believe the Daniels are neighbours—I never saw them, to my knowledge, before I was taken on this charge—I was charged separately from Prosser; her case was heard first, I believe—I did not go as a witness for her—this is the first time I have been a witness—I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Willingale, an omni-bus driver, and live at 78, Devonshire Street, nearly opposite the deceased—about 8.30 on this evening I was at my gate—I did not see Prosser come out—the first I saw of her was in the middle of the road, Mrs. Glover and her daughter fighting with her, and Mr. Glover kneeling on her chest—I saw Mrs. Blanch put her hands together, and heard her say, "Amelia, for God's sake come away or I shall drop dead," and she dragged her by her clothes—at that time Glover's daughter was kicking Prosser, while she was down—I saw Prosser taken into the beer-thop—I know Mrs. Clarke, I did not see her there after that; I saw her against her own gate before, I did not see the deceased in Mrs. Clarke's arms—I did not see Prosser strike the deceased at all, or hear her use any bad language—I did not hear Mrs. Blanch say, "Give it to the b—," or words to that effect, I heard Glover's daughter say, "I have kicked her in the b—guts, and in the jaw"—I know the Daniels—I did not see them there until it was nearly ended, and then I only saw the boy—I saw him come up to his own door with a truck-load of furniture when the matter was nearly ended.</p>

I sleep at my mother's in Wilson-place, Gray's Inn-lane. On Saturday night, the 8th of December, my master paid me two shillings, a sixpence, and sixpence in halfpence, for my wages - I was going home about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, and had it in my breeches pocket; when I got into the fields, which I had to cross, I saw the prisoner sitting on some stones, and another woman higher up, about two yards, by a gate - I knew the prisoner by sight before, having saw her five or six times in the neighbourhood, and am quite sure she is the person; she came up to me, and asked whether I had got any money - I said I had not; she said, "If you do not give us the money, I will throw you into the ditch;" we were about twenty yards from the <placeName id="t18280110-25-crimeloc127">Fleet-ditch</placeName>

Yes; the fields were about one hundred yards from the house; it was about twelve, when it was all over - I told my master; she had a kind of light spotted gown on- I am as certain of that as I am of her person.</p>

            . My father keeps the Bagnigge Wells. The prosecutor was waiter there. I paid him, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, two shillings, a sixpence, and 6d. in copper - I do not know what time he left; this field was his nearest way home; he described the woman to me next morning, and stated what had oc<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100023"></xptr>curred - I went down immediately, met Roberts, the officer, and described her to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, on Monday evening, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, from Thorogood's description - I took her on the spot where the robbery was committed; the prosecutor was with me; he said the prisoner was the woman, but the other was not the one who was with her - I found two halfpence, some duplicates, and two purses on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of a night was the night of the robbery? A. I think rather light; it was about the first quarter of the moon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say anything? A. When I took her, she said it was not her, it was another one; and as I took her to the watch-house, she said she had a half-crown given to her that night by a baker, and 6d. by a gentleman: that she left it on the bank where I took her - I went next morning, and found it.</p>

            . I am a laundress, and lived in the same house with the prisoner, on the 8th of December; she came home that night, at half-past eleven o'clock, and had a reddish cotton gown on; it was rather light; it was a light red flowered gown, more pink than red - I am sure she was at home at half-past eleven o'clock - I know Samuel Hood; he had an opportunity of seeing her that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you let lodgings? A. No; the prisoner rents a room in the same house as me - I looked at the clock when she came in, and it was half-past eleven o'clock - I do not always look at the clock, but I happened to look at it then; she was always early; she lives with a man who is a pensioner; he supports her as far as is in his power; she was at home at eleven o'clock the night before - I did not look at the clock, but I heard the watchman cry the hour; my house is in West-street; you can walk to these fields in ten minutes, or less; she has different coloured gowns; she wore a red flowered one that night; she wore one rather darker two nights before - I cannot tell how she gets her living; she keeps company with no one but the man she lives with.</p>

            . I am a salesman, of Fleet-market, and have known the prisoner three years - I lodge in the same house with her. On the 8th of December I saw her at home before a quarter-past eleven o'clock, by that and half-past.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her at half-past eleven o'clock? A. Undressed in her room, sitting in her chair, ready for bed - she had had her supper; she had her shawl over her shoulders; she had the same gown on as I had seen her with in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what part of her was undressed? A. Her stays were loose - she had a light gown on - I did not look so close as to tell the colour; I am sure it was half-past eleven o'clock, for I had to close the door for the night, as the landlord was ill in bed; I inquired if every body was in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you come home? A. At a quarter-past eleven o'clock; I remember it, as I was done very soon at market; I had a glass of liquor, and came home; she was undressed when I came home, all loose, ready to slip off her things, and her shawl was over her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know she had a light gown on? A. She has a red gown - she had a light one on this night, not the red one - I cannot tell what time she came home on the Thursday or the Wednesday; she is an unfortunate girl - her door being open that night, I made bold to go in, which makes me remember it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What makes you so exact to the time? A. Because I got home so soon, and gave my wife my money; I always look at my clock, which is in my room; the prisoner was at home before me, and had had her supper; she could not have come home at half-past eleven o'clock, for I got home at a quarter-past, and she was then undressed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear the watchman crying the hour? A. He cried half-past after I got home.</p>
               <p> - HOOD. I am the wife of the last witness; I will take my oath the prisoner was at home, in her own room, at half-past eleven o'clock, on the night of the 8th of December, because I had just come from market, and my husband at the same time; my husband had to lock up the house, as the landlord was ill; the prisoner came home at half-past eleven o'clock, rather sooner than later.</p>

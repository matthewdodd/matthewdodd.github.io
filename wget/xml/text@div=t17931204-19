After I had done my work I went home to supper, an order came in that he was to go and buy a horse at Hackney, and he immediately said to me, that his wife was taken ill, and he would be very much obliged to me if I would go and buy the horse in his stead; I said I would go to serve him in any respect whatever; I went and bought the horse; coming along this place there was a gentleman on the other side of the way came over and catched hold of me by the collar; I asked him what he wanted with me? he immediately replied you are one of the persons that has robbed my shop; he had me in custody for the space of five or six minutes, he wanted to take me back to the place from whence he came, and then he turned back, looked over his shoulder, let me go, ran away from me round the corner of the street; knowing myself innocent, I never stirred from the place where I was left; he ran back again and said, you are the person, and I have got you; immediately a gentleman came up and asked what was the matter? I says, I don't know what is the matter,for this gentleman has taken me by the collar, and says he has got me. The prosecutor made answer and said directly, are you a constable? yes, says he, but I don't belong to the office; he says, that don't signify, I give you charge of him, and we went into the office directly; we were near Marlborough-street. I have got no witness. My fellow servant's wife is very ill, and he was obliged to attend his wife, and my mistress is subject to the rheumatism in her arms, and cannot come.</p>
               <p>Court to Skelton. Where did you get them from after they were thrown away? - They were given me by the servant of Mr. Northcote.</p>

I was coming home in the evening, I heard the cry of stop thief, and when I came up to the person, Mr. Skelton had hold of the prisoner, and I took him by the collar, and went to the opposite side of the way, where we got the bundle out of the area. The prisoner was never out of my sight, after the cry of stop thief. There were two others running. I did not see him with the bundle in his hand.</p>

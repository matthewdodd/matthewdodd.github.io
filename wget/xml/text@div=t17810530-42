I told her she must come along with me. She was willing to come. She fell a-crying as soon as she saw me. She was taken before Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Was her examination taken in writing? - I cannot be positive whether it was or not: I heard her say she was but four or five months gone with child.</p>
               <p>Did she say in what manner she had been delivered? - She said she was upon the necessary, at her mistress's house, and the child dropped from her. I was immediately dispatched from the office for a nightman: this was about one at noon. I went with the nightman to search the necessary. We pulled the flooring up. He went down, and brought up a female child.</p>
               <p>Could you see the child before it was fetched up? - We had looked with a candle, but could not see it. The nightman washed the child.</p>
               <p>Was any after-burthen found in the necessary? - Nothing else but the child was found at that time.</p>
               <p>Was it a wet soil or otherwise? - Wet; the child lay under what they call the crust.</p>
               <p>After the child was washed, did you make any observation upon the body? - The child looked fair and white: in an hour after it changed. It had been in the privy from Friday till Tuesday.</p>

I said she would not disturb me. We both went to bed together. I went to sleep. I awaked, and asked her how she was. She said she was very ill. Some time after I asked her again how she did.

               <p>Was there any external appearance upon the body? - There was some little blow, or black appearance upon the back part of the head.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell how that was occasioned? - It is impossible for any person to say: it might have happened upon falling into the necessary, or an accidental pinch upon the body. It did not appear that any blow had been given.</p>

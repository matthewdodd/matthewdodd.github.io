                  </hi>. I live at Old Ford Lock-cottage, Bow, and am a house and estate agent. On the night of 3rd March I was returning home, about a quarter or half past 12 o'clock—I was near North-terrace, Victoria-park—that is adjoining the Old Ford-road, just before you come to the park—it was on my way home—I was alone—when I had passed a short distance up North-terrace, I was taken by the collar by the prisoner, and tripped up by his foot—he came from behind me—I know it was the prisoner, because he did not escape from me—he was seized by the policeman—I did not know him at the time he seized me by the collar—I never saw him before—while I was on my back he thrust his finger, down my neck tie, and tried to throttle me—I said to him, "Don't take my life away, for the sake of my family; what I have got you are welcome to"—as soon as I uttered those words, a policeman came up very suddenly, and turned on his light—the prisoner let go, jumped on his feet, and said, "All right, officer; it is a friend of mine; it is Mr. Forrester"—I immediately got up, laid hold of the prisoner, and said to the officer, "I am not Mr. Forrester; he is your prisoner," and he took him into custody—he was not out of my sight from the time he laid hold of me till the officer took him—I was wearing a watch and chain—the prisoner was standing over me, in the act of undoing my coat, at the time the officer came up—it was buttoned up as it is now—I had been drinking, but was not drunk—I knew what I was about as much as I do now, and signed my name to the charge—I had been superintending some repairs in that locality, and called in, and stopped there several hours—I cannot say how much I had been drinking, but I could walk steadily.</p>

               <p>seeing him at all—the first I saw of him was his coming up and seizing me—I had not any money with me—I asked Mr. Beale, in the public house, to lend me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said, "You can have as much as you want"—the other persons were near enough to hear, and must have heard, if they had been paying attention—I cannot tell whether my coat was buttoned at the public house, but it was when I was thrown down—I had a watch and a silver chain washed with gold—I have got it now—it received no damage—I had a great coat on, which was buttoned—I wore it at the public house—I had been drinking—I was not drunk—I knew how to transact business.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 363). On 4th March, about a quarter pest 1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Bethnal-green, and heard some persons talking—shortly afterwards I heard some person fall to the ground—before I arrived at the spot, I heard a person say, "You are welcome to take all I have got, but do not take my life, for the sake of my wife and family"—I went up, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, on his back, and the prisoner laying hold of his coat collar or stock—I showed my light, and the prisoner let go his hold—I said, "What are you doing with the man?—he said, "It is a friend of mine—he called him Forest, or Forrester, and told him to get up—he told me that he was going to see him home, as they had been drinking together at Mr. Beale's public house, Church-street, Bethnal-green—the prosecutor then got up, seized the prisoner by the bosom of his shirt, pulled him towards me, told me to take him into custody for knocking him down with intent to rob him, and said that he did not know him at all—I took him to the station—the prosecutor had been drinking, but was quite capable of what he was doing—he walked by himself, and walked steadily—he perfectly knew what he was about—he seemed agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that he had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From his appearance, he seemed much agitated after getting up—he was rather hoarse, but I could understand every word he said—I thought he had been drinking because he seemed nervous—I do not know whether it was from the fall or from drink; he was shaking rather—the prisoner did not appear to have been drinking at all—they were in the path over the side of the road—there is no step from the footpath into the road, the path is a little higher, but there is no kerb stone—he was about the centre of the path, and the prisoner was nearer to the wall, but was not down, he was only stooping—the prosecutor was on the ground—I was fourteen or fifteen yards from them when I heard the conversation—I could not hear what they were talking about—I heard the fall not more than two minutes after the con<lb></lb>versation—it was a dark night, and I could not see how they fell—the prisoner seemed perfectly sober, and so he did at the station—when the pro<lb></lb>secutor said, "You are welcome to all I have; do not take my life, for the sake of my wife and children," the prisoner did not answer; there was only one voice.</p>

               <p>On Monday night, 3rd March, the prisoner was at my house, and the prosecutor also—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge; they were both there at the same time, an hour and a half or two hours—they were in each other's company, and occasionally drinking together—I am quite sure of that—there were two or three females, and one or two males at one time, and ten or twelve at other times—the prosecutor was drinking indiscriminately with anybody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prosecutor was drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was a little drunk, but not so bad as the prosecutor; you could see it by his appearance—I saw the prosecutor leave, the prisoner had left three-quarters of an hour before that—he could have been there without my see<lb></lb>ing him, as I was not always at the bar; my daughter was there—I shook hands with the prosecutor when he left—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had a dog on the counter, and I told him I did not allow dogs to show tricks on my coun<lb></lb>ter—the dog kept jumping on and off, exhibiting tricks for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was licensing day, and I had to go away—when I came back I found the prosecutor there, he was in a very merry mood and was treating everybody, but had not much money with him.</p>

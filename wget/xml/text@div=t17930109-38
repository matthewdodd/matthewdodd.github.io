               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I produce a tea caddy; I stopped the prisoner at the bar with it on Tuesday the 18th of December between seven and eight in the evening, she brought it to our house to pledge; I had information that such a thing was lost, and I stopped it; I asked whose it was? she first of all told me it was her husband's; I told her I had a suspicion it was stole in the neighbourhood, I told her I would send for him, and she would wait till he come; she then said, she would tell me the truth, it belonged to a lodger of her's. I have kept it ever since; I have known her some years, and always thought her a very honest industrious woman.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a very good character, but believed she was unfortunately married.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Albert Street, Highway, Shadwell, and am a prostitute—the prisoner slept with me last Thursday night—he gave me two silver shillings in English, and one Spanish shilling and he told me he should have no more till Saturday, when the captain paid him, when he would give me some more—I saw him on Saturday, about 10.35—he came into the Prince Regent public-house where I was, and asked him first for a drink—he said he had no money, and then said he had a shilling, and told—me to get a drink with that; I asked him for the money he promised me on Thursday, and he said he had none—I asked him what made him promise me on Thursday, that he would give it me on Saturday, and he said something in Spanish, that I did not understand—I walked alongside of him a little way along St. George's Street, and asked him again if he intended to give me my money, and with that he pushed me and I fell down and got up again, and he pushed me down again and kicked me in the eye and on the body—I caught him by the collar of his coat and called "Police"—he put Ms hands to my throat to choke me—a female coming past took his hands away from my throat—I then saw the blade of a knife in his hands, and I went to flinch back, and as I fell I found I had got a cut over the eye and he made off and I saw no more of him—I was taken to the hospital—I could not swear to the knife if I saw it, it was in a dark place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Albert Square—last Saturday evening the prisoner and the prosecutrix in the Highway, Shadwell, at about 12.5—when I went up the prisoner had the woman by the throat—I I asked him to leave go of her throat, and he did after a little while, and he struck and kicked her, and she fell down, and she got up and took hold of him by the collar of his coat, and asked him to give her the money he owed her, and he might go where he liked—I could not understand what he said to her—then he knocked her down—that is all I know of it—I observed some blood about her when she was picked up—I helped to pick her up—the blood came from a wound in her forehead—I did not see a knife.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on board the Calderon, Spanish steamship, and told him the charge—he said the prosecutrix caught hold of him, and he pushed her down—that is all I could understand him to say—he produced this small knife from his pocket on my asking him if he had a knife about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there a short time after 12 o'clock on Saturday last—I examined her and found her body bruised, first on the side, and secondly on the head in two places above both eyes, more especially on the</p>

               <p>left, that being the more severe—there was also a laceration, or incision I should say—it had very clean edges and was perfectly straight—it was deeper immediately above the eye than it was higher up—further above the eye it became shallow—it would be caused by any sharp material—the knife produced is quite capable of causing such an injury—it might because a fall on some sharp material, but not on the road unless there were some sharp flints there; not a kerbstone—any sharp stone would produce such a wound—it is very difficult to say that it was done by an instrument, because there were bruises—I should not like to say—more likely by a knife than a stone certainly—it was not a punctured or a lacerated wound—the edges were so clean that they have already healed.</p>

All that the prosecutrix says that happened at first in the street is perfectly true, but as to kicking her on the ground or having any weapon about me is altogether a falsehood. The last time that she came and caught hold of me was when my witness at the police-court came up and separated her arms from me.</p>

I had no illwill against her, and had no knife about me, it was on board ship; a knife I use for cutting stiches when repairing or cutting tobacco; it is rusty, and I never use it for any other purpose.</p>

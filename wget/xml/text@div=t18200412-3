On the 26th of March, about ten minutes past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was near the pantry-door, I went up to answer the bell, and as I returned, I met a man in the servants' hall, just coming out of the pantry - he was a short young man, had an apron on, and had a dark handkerchief in his hand, which he held against his body. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am a fishmonger." I said,</p>
               <p>"Go into the kitchen." He then said,</p>
               <p>"Is this Mr. Thompson's?" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, it is not." He said nothing else, but ran into the area directly. I then ran into the pantry, and missed sixteen silver spoons, which I had left there ten minutes before. I immediately pursued, and saw the same man at the top of Bolton-street, and pointed him out to

            . I am a baker. On the 26th of March Grant pointed out a man to me in a fishmonger's apron, the man had passed me. I pursued him to Pall Mall, and only lost sight of him in turning the corners - he might have been out of my sight two or three minutes; another young man joined him, and ran just before him for a short time. When I came to Waterloo-place he crossed me - I thought he wanted to knock me down. I still pursued the prisoner towards Molteno's print-shop, and observed him throw a dark handkerchief down the print-seller's area - somebody immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Here is the silver spoons thrown here!" I still pursued, and saw him pull his apron off, and throw it down another area. I at last secured him near the Opera House, and am certain he is the man I pursued from Bolton-row.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many corners did you turn - A. I cannot say. I lost sight of him at every corner. It was on a Sunday - it rained very hard. He is the man that Grant pointed out to me.</p>

            . I am a music copyist. I met the prisoner running in St. James's-square; he had an apron on and a brown coat - another man was before him. I stopped the prisoner, and asked him which was the thief? he appeared confused, and said he did not know, I therefore let him go. I afterwards pursued, and saw Ede secure him - I am certain he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You stopped him, thinking he was pursuing the thief, and let him go - A. I certainly did. I saw he had a bundle in a blue handkerchief - I afterwards took the same handkerchief off the area railing - the handkerchief and one spoon were left on the railing. I threw the spoon down myself that nobody should get it, as the area belonged to a respectable house. I asked which was the thief, as an ill-looking man was running before him.</p>

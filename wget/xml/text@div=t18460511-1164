                  </hi>. I belong to the Royal Artillery, and am a farrier—on the 26th of April I was in my room in Rushey-grove, and had a watch on the mantel-piece at seven o'clock when I went to the stables—I did not miss it till between six and seven next morning—I was going to my work in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and the prisoner called to me—I turned back, and stood until she came up to me—she told me a very mournful story about missing her passage to Scotland—that her husband and two children had gone away before she had got to the boat—I told her to go to the adjutant, perhaps she could get a passage for herself and children—I missed the watch when I came home, and suspected her—I went after her, and accused her of it—she denied it, and said, I was going to take away her character for such a thing—I said, I was very sorry, but I suspected her—I asked her where she stopped during the night—she refused to tell me—I afterwards gave her in charge.</p>

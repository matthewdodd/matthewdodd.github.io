                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 113). On 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Oct. I was on duty in Holborn, and saw the three prisoners together come out of Little Turnstile—when they got into Holborn, Phillips went first and the others followed close behind—I knew them, and followed them—they followed Mr. Maddan—I watched and saw Phillips take this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of Mr. Maddan's pocket and pass it to Bunney—I ran up and seized Phillips, and told Mr. Maddan he had lost his handkerchief—Bunney then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the handkerchief away, and he and Gazeley passed up Holborn—I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

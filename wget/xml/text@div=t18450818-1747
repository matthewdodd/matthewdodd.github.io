I am a wholesale coal-merchant, and live at Coombe Hill, near Cheltenham—I have carried on business there many years—on the 16th of Sept., 1844, I was taken in execution at the suit of Eliakim Jones—I was taken to Mr. Sheldon's, and from thence to Gloucester gaol—I remained there till the 14th of Oct., which was twenty-eight days—I was liberated by paying down 501<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sorry to say Eliakim Jones is a brother of mine—I did not owe him a halfpenny at that time.</p>

               <p>cause that was hanging over my brother's head, for stealing a warrant out of an officer's pocket at Cheltenham—I most solemnlv declare that was the only subject matter on which lie professed to come to me—I had this inter-view with the prisoner on the Sunday, and in consequence of that I inter-ested myself to save my brother from the consequences of that action, and paid out of my own pocket to save him, twenty-seven sovereigns—on the 31st of March I was not served with any notice of declaration either per<lb></lb>sonally or left at my house—I never had any cognizance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Up to the time you were taken in execution, as though judgment had passed by default for non-appearance, had you the slightest idea or notion that there were any proceedings against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I most solemnly declare the first I knew of it was the sheriff's officer coming and carrying me off to prison—Coombe Hill is twelve miles from Beckford—the 31st of March, 1842, was on a Thursday—it is Cheltenham market-day—I was attending the market, as was my practice, on that day, and was there the whole of the day.</p>

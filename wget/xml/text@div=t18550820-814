On 25th July, at a quarter before 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Bedford-square, Stepney—I saw the prisoner come over the wall of Mr. Nathan's premises—I followed him, and took him into custody—I took him to the station and found he had five shirts on besides his own, one over the other—this child's frock, and this cape were wrapped round his body—these cruet tops were in his pocket—he had some lucifer matches on him—I went back to Mr. Nathan's house—I found the back window broken open, and the window lifted up quite enough to admit a man—the window opens to the back wall, over which the prisoner came.</p>

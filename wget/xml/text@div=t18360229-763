                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Vincent. He keeps a beer-shop in Copper Chapman-street, St. George's—on the 11th of February the prisoner came to the bar and asked for a pint of four-penny ale—I knew before, I served her—she then asked if I would allow her to go into my back kitchen to leave an old saucepan and pillow which she had in her hand—I gave her leave—my servant had just washed a silk handkerchief,</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cornwall-street, St. George-in-the-East. I have known the prisoner for the last four years—on the 11th of February she came to me, and stood before my fire, and dried a wet silk handkerchief—it appeared just washed—she said it belonged to Mr. Dix, and would I have the goodness to pawn it for her, for she had no money—she said she was to meet Dix in the afternoon, and he was to give her a sovereign, and they were going to live together again—I know they had lived together for many years—she said she could not pawn it herself, because Mr. Dix had advertized in the public papers for nobody to take any thing in pawn from her—she pleaded such distress to me that I left my work, and went to pawn it at Hawes's, in Ratcliffe-highway, where she told me to take it, and put it in the name of "T. Howard 2, Turner's Folly"—I did so—on Sunday morning my daughter and I were at breakfast, when Clements came and gave information about a handkerchief—I went over to the prosecutrix and told her where the handkerchief was—I had pawned it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and delivered the ticket and money up to the prisoner—this is the handkerchief.</p>

I am sorry to see a woman stand there and swear every word that is false—in the first place, she says I brought her the handker<lb></lb>chief and asked her to pawn it, as my husband's property, and that I said I did not like to be seen at pawnbrokers' shops, because my husband had gazetted me in the papers, and denied pawnbrokers taking things of me—every word is false—I told her I had found a handkerchief, and instead of my asking her to pawn it, she asked me to let her pawn it—in the ness place, she told me to pawn it when it was mangled—she mangled it herself, and it can be proved. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

               <p>Q. What has been his way of life. - A. He was a <rs id="t18071202-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">fellowship porter at Billingsgate</rs>

I bought the poney of him on Thursday the 22d of October; I was coming out of Oxford-road into Tottenham-court-road; I was riding on a mule. The prisoner called after me; I turned back, and the prisoner came up to me on the poney that I bought of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured poney was it. - A. A roan colour, with a white blaze down its face, about twelve hands high; it might be an inch or two more; he asked me to have something to drink; we had a quartern of rum at the Cock public house, Tottenham-court-road, he asked me to buy the poney there, I said I do not know that I shall buy it, I have four by me now, and I have some out to grass, they do not sell very well. I then got upon my mule again and was riding down Tottenham-court-road; facing the Bull's Head in Tottenham-court-road, he said I am going in here for a pair of boots; he told me if I would go into the Bull's Head he would not be gone two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the Bull's Head. - A. I did; he came to me with the mare, and rode under the gateway into the yard; we had there two pints of beer, and in the mean time he said, Newman, will you buy the mare of me; I asked him what he asked for it, he said will you give me ten pounds for it; I said no, it is a good deal more than its worth; I told him he knew horses at this time of year were very cheap; I said it was not worth any more than six pounds to me; I gave him six pounds, and he gave me a shilling back; I paid for one pint of beer and the prisoner the other; the prisoner rode the mare home to my house and left her there with me, and left a bridle and a saddle. I went with him; he said he would call for the bridle and saddle; he did, and my wife stopped him:</p>
               <p>Q. When did he call. - A. On the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time you heard something about this horse. - A. The very next day after I had it, it was owned in Smithfield market. I was in trouble for a week about this mare. I keep Smithfield market every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you gone down with that mare to sell her at Smithfield market - A. Yes, with other horses; I went to Smithfield market on the 23d; the mare was owned that very day by

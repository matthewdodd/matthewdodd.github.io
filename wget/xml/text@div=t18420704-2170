                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman. I became acquainted with the prisoner, and he lived with me about three weeks at my lodging, in Pearl row, Blackfriars—I did not particularly desire to part, but we did part on Sunday fortnight, and next day, Monday evening, I went to the Sarrey theatre with a female acquaintance—after the theatre was over we went to the Oxford Arms, in the Westminster-road, to take some refreshment, and the prisoner came in—he did not speak to me—about a quarter past twelve o'clock, as I was leaving the house, some one took me round the neck, but I did not see who it was—I then found I was stab<lb></lb>bed, and my arm bleeding—I was wounded through my clothes, at the bottom of my belly, but very slightly—I did not speak to the person, and did not push him from me—I thought it was in a joke—I was very tipsy at the time.</p>

I live in Pearl-row, a few doors from the prosecutrix—the prisoner lived in the same house as I did—he brought his boxes to my house on the day he left the prosecutrix—he told me he never could be happy with any other female but her—on the day that this occurred I was with him the whole day—he wanted to get a board to get hit living by selling things—we got the board, and made it, and in the evening the prosecutrix went out with another female at six o'clock—they promised to meet me and the prisoner at eight o'clock—we went, and could not find them—we went again at nine, and could not find them—I was with him at the Oxford Arms, and the prosecutrix came in—the prisoner did not speak to her there—he came out with me, and she came out after—they spoke together a few words, and she said, "I am stabbed"—there were several persons close to her—I crossed over, and assisted her to the surgeon—I do not know what became of the prisoner—I did not look after him—I had seen him with a knife in his hand shortly before while we were talking, he was picking his nails—a person asked him for some tobacco, and he cut off a piece.</p>

               <p>on the lower part of the abdomen—they were about the width of the blade of a penknife—the wound in the abdomen was slighter than the one on the arm; it was rather deep, and was attended by inflammation—a wound in the abdomen is always dangerous.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labourer in the East India Company's tea warehouse; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17910608-12-deflabel71" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

On the 28th of May last, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080017"></xptr>saw the prisoner put his hand twice into the chest, and take tea out, and put it under his coat; I gave Mr. Wilson information, he sent for the prisoner to the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. In what situation was the prisoner? - In his working clothes.</p>
               <p>You had access to the teas whenever you pleased? - We had been nailing the teas up.</p>
               <p>Court. What is it the labourers do about these teas? - The teas are stowed before the sale, the brokers come, and the chests are opened for them to take samples, and then a sheet of paper is put over to cover it, and lead over that, and then the wooden lid put on, and then that is nailed down; that is the duty of the labourers.</p>
               <p>- HOWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer, I searched the man, and found the tea in a pocket patched to his breeches behind. According to my best recollection there was no hole behind.</p>
               <p>(The tea produced.)</p>
               <p>Was that tea such as they had on shew at this time? - Certainly it was, but I cannot swear positively it is the Company's tea, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say positively you cannot say whether that is your tea or not? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a common side-pocket on the breeches? - No, it was a patch behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was this patch to mend the breeches? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did it look like it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say that it had the least appearance of a patch to mend the garment, or was it a pocket fastened on the outside? - To the best of my recollection, it was a pocket or a patch, outside of the breeches.</p>
               <p>Did it appear as if it was to mend them? - All I can say it, it was sewed outside of the breeches.</p>
               <p>With all these number of ounces of tea in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- WILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an elder; I look over the labourers. On some information I received, I sent for the prisoner to come down to the counting-house, I asked him, Martin, have you got any tea about you? not to my knowledge, says he; on which I desired him to walk further into the counting-house, and desired Mr. Howell to rub him down, and he could not find any, on which his countenance seemed to clear up; (they are commonly rubbed down by their sides) I desired him to examine him again, and he did; and in coming round the second time, he found it; says he, here is a bulk; on examining this we found a large piece of leather sewed to the waistband of his breeches, sewed quite round, separate from the breeches, and open on the top of the waistband, and in it was that tea: on this he said he was sorry for what he had done, and it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Had you at this time any tea of this sort on shew? - A great number, some thousands of chests; it was part of the prisoner's employment to nail up the chests where this sort of tea was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there nothing passed of holding out any favour to the prisoner at the time, to make him confess? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>The pocket, whatever it was, was open for any one to see? - No, it was not, till the skirts were taken up.</p>
               <p>How long had this man been in the warehouse? - Three years.</p>
               <p>I would venture to ask you this question; whether during this time, you had ever reason to suspect him before? - I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>He had been three years however? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he on when he was brought down to the ware-house? - He had a coat and a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to the Court. My Lord, we have not had the fact proved, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080018"></xptr>ware-house was the property of the East India company.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is not a single witness, my Lord, that has not stated it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Knapp. Under circumstances of this kind, I think it has been proved; but if it appears a doubtful question, and you wish to ask concerning the fact, let Mr. Tadmire stand up.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Tadmire. From what warehouse are we to understand that the tea was taken; did it belong to the East India Company? - It did.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of putting it in, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

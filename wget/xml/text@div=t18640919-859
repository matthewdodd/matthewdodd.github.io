                  </hi>. I am a waiter at Mr. Pritchard's refreshment house, 83, Long-acre—on 9th September, the prisoner came for a basin of soup, which came to twopence; he put down a shilling, and I gave him tenpence change—about two minutes afterwards another customer came, to whom I gave the shilling from my pocket, and found it was bad; there were only two six<lb></lb>pences and that shilling in my pocket—next day the prisoner came again for a basin of soup and put down a shilling—I tried it with my teeth and found it was bad—I saw that he was the same man, and said, "This in a bad shilling, and you passed one to me last night"—I gave him in charge—he offered to pay me with a good shilling—I kept both the shillings, and gave them both to the constable—I also saw a shilling picked up at the shop where the prisoner sat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Pritchard—I went into the shop on the 10th when the prisoner was sitting there—he was left in my charge while the policeman was sent for—I heard something drop, and when he got up I looked under the seat, and found two bad shillings wrapped up together—I gave them to Mr. Pritchard.</p>

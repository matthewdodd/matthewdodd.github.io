               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw the coat at Staines? - A. Yes; and I saw it when my master got out at Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it, that you can positively speak to having last seen three great coats? - A. At the watering house at Turnham-green.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you recollect that, on this side of Temple-bar, you had the three great coats? - A. I cannot positively swear that I had them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrole and an extra constable of Castle-Baynard ward: As I was going towards Paul's Chain, I observed three men with a parcel; I followed them to the corner of Carter-lane, and there they stopped to examine it; I put my hand upon my sword, and said, don't stir, for if you do, I will cut you down; they then threw down the great coat, and all ran away; I called out, stop thief, and he was taken by a gentleman; I came up, and took him to the watch-house; I am sure the prisoner was one of them, I saw them distinctly when they were examining the coat; they all three had the coat between them, facing the Horn Tavern; Mr. Reynolds is out of town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When a man draws a sword upon an unarmed man, is it unnatural that he should run away? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing his face? - A. Half a minute; I was in a great flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear positively to the prisoner? - A. That is the man, I am positive; I had the lamp over me; he was dressed in a blue coat, a striped waistcoat, a round that hat, and a dark-coloured apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in half a minute, you being flurried, and with a sword in your hand, mean to swear, that that is the man? - A. That is the man, I was close to them when they dropped the coat; I saw the chaise come past, and I saw them coming from the Chaise.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you observe the dress of the other two? - A. Yes; there was one, with his back towards me, wore a long brown surtout coat; I did not see his waistcoat, nor his face, expect the moment that I came up, and then he turned his face away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Could you swear to his face, do you think? - A. Yes, I could; the other man was dressed in a blue surtout coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see his face too? - A. Yes, I saw all three of their faces; I should know them all, if I saw them.</p>
               <p>- HATERD sworn. - I am a constable of Castle Baynard ward, (produces the coat); I received it from Mr. Copper's maid; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. This is the same coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is a common driving great coat; is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Falkner. This is the same coat, I know it by the straps, the buttons, and the collar; and I have had it in my hands so often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it not a common drab-coloured great coat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not two Mr. Reynolds's acquaintances of your master's? - A. Yes; they are brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never see the other Mr. Reynolds in a drab great coat? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Going along Carter-lane, I heard some men talking very loud, and I stopped, out of curiosity, to hear what they were talking about, and the patrole came up, and said, he would knock them down, if they attempted to run away; they directly ran away, and a gentleman caught hold of me, instead of one of those men.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- DEWELL sworn. - I am a painter in William-street, Bridwell Precinct: The prisoner left his work on the Tuesday night, between six and seven o'clock; he has worked for me three months, and always conducted himself with honestly, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

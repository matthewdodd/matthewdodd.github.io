               <p>Porter. The Constable was here just now; and had the Moidore sealed up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been at a Chandler's-Shop in Red Lyon Court , for a Pennyworth of Bread and Cheese, and a Pint of Beer, and met the Prosecutor; said I, Will you go and drink a Dram? He turned about, What, Nanny! said he. Yes, said I. He asked me where I liv'd, I told him at the Corner of Playhouse-Passage. Said I, You are grown so poor, I did not know you. Said he, Will you treat me with a Dram? If you have no Money, said I, I will; says he, you are a good Girl, I will give you one. We agreed to toss up Heads or Tails, who should treat: He tossed up the Moidore, and I took it up, and said, there was neither Head nor Tail upon it; so he carried me before a Justice: I went on my own Accord, without any Constable. I had the Moidore in my Hand all the Time. <rs id="t17421208-36-verdict192" type="verdictDescription">

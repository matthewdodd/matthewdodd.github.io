                  </hi>. I live at No. 90, Drury-lane, the prisoner is my hus<lb></lb>band. On the 20th of May he came there with a stick in his hand—he held the stick over his head to strike me—I rose from the bed I was on, I laid hold of the stick, and Phœbe Morgan and I got the stick from him—he then took a knife off the table—I went into the bed-room and shut the door—he forced the door open, and rushed into the room; he threw me down first, and then stabbed me in the back of my head with the knife—I held his hand with both my hands, and he could not get his hand away, and he screwed my face round with the nails of his other hand—he scratched me and hurt me terribly—he heard some footsteps coming, dropped the knife by the side of the bed and left me—Phœbe Morgan stopped him from going down stairs—he went up stairs, and was taken on the top stairs of the house—he was quite sober—we had been parted twelve months—he had threatened the day before that he would come with a knife.</p>

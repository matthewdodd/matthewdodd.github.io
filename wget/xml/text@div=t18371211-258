                  </hi>. I am a Custom's gate-keeper at the London Dock. On the 6th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I stopped the prisoner at the Eastern gate of the Lon don Dock, inside the gate—he was coming out—I searched him, and found this spelter concealed under his frock—I asked him where he got it—he said he had picked it up in the Eastern dock, supposing it to belong to nobody—there was none in the Eastern dock—I asked how he came to do it—he said he had a wife and three children, which caused him to do it—it is marked in red ochre "D," and stamped on the edge W H"—he said he had worked in the docks for a few days.</p>

I have seen this spelter before at the police-office—there was spelter similar to this under my care, marked precisely the same—I examined the piles of spelter, and have every reason to sup pose three plates are gone—some were gone marked similar to this—the top of the pile was clean, and the other piles were dirty, so that some had been recently gone—it was lying on the quay—anybody could get at it.</p>

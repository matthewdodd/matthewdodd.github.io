                  </hi>. I keep a shoemaker's shop. The prisoner was in my service as journeyman for some years—my shop is in one of the rooms up stairs—I had information that he had been taking away boots and shoes for some time—he worked in my house—I suspected all was not right on the 14th of November, and he was out all night—in the morning I said, "Robert, what did you do with those boots you made yesterday?"—he said, "I did not make any "—I said, "One pair, I believe "—he said, "Yes, they are up stairs, I will go and fetch them "—I said, "I will go with you "—when we got up one pair of stairs, he said, "It is useless going any further, I made away with them; I wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to lend a friend"—these two pairs of uppers I found at the back of a pair of drawers that he used himself.</p>

               <p>five or six years, off and on—he went and set up for himself, but found that did not answer, and came back to me—these two pairs of uppers were behind some drawers, inside the back of the case—I know them to be mine—I cut them out myself—I did not give them to him—I had seen them on the evening of the 9th of November—I had not seen them between the 9th and 14th—he had them for no purpose of business on my account—five other per<lb></lb>sons are employed on the premises besides himself, but only one in the room where he worked—the drawers were not locked—any pa son searching would find them.</p>

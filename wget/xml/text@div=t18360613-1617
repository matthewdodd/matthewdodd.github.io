                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Royal-hill, Greenwich. On the 21st of May, I was in the Eight Bells there—I had been in the house but two or three minutes—I went in between two and three o'clock in the morning—a man challenged me to fight—he broke the glass I had with some bran day and water in it—there was no place to sit down—I took off my coat and lost it, but I do not know who took it—I put it on the counter of the bar—we did not fight—the man ran away, and I ran after him—it was not the prisoner but another man that wanted to fight me—I missed the coat before he ran away, and I suspected he was connected with the parties who were there—there were seven or eight persons standing together when I went in—they appeared to be conversing about different subjects.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner in the Royal Hospital, and I sell coffee in the street. At a quarter past three o'clock, on the 26th of May, I was selling coffee about three yards from the door of the Bells—I saw the prisoner come out with a coat under his right arm—he went about two yards—there was no body with him—he took and shook it, and folded it up, and clapped it under his left arm—he went round by the church—it was quite light, I could see the dial—he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 103.) On Thursday morning, at twenty minutes past three o'clock, Mr. Fagan told me he had lost his coat, and Mews told me something—I went after the prisoner, and found him near Greenwich church about twenty minutes past three—I asked if he had got a coat belonging to any one besides himself—he said, no, he had not—I did not search him—I asked him a second time, and he again denied it—I then said I should take him into custody, on suspicion of hav<lb></lb>ing stolen one—after we had walked four or five paces, he said he had a coat in the boot of his coach—we turned back again towards the coach, and he pulled this coat out from the boot of an omnibus coach, and gave it to me—this is it—I do not know whether he was the driver of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—he is foreman of Mr. Wolfe's omnibuses—I was with him that morning, and we had a pint of half-and-half together—I saw a fight with the prosecutor and another person—the prisoner left the house first, and I followed him—there were about ten person in front of the bar—when the prisoner got out I saw him shake this coat—he said, "I have got a coat of Somebody's—I picked it up on the threshold of the landlord's door"—it was all over dust—it had been trodden on in the room—he said, "I am going to put it into the boot of the omnibus, and when the owner comes he shall have it."</p>

               <p>GEORGE BAKER. I am a journeyman to Mr. Griffiths. On the 27th of January, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in company with a woman pass the shop several times; at length the woman and this boy parted; I had suspicion of them; I went into the passage to watch; I heard the woman say to the boy come along; immediately the boy came leaned over the steps, and took the shovels now produced; I pursued the prisoner, and took him with the shovels on him; the woman was in a gateway, a few doors from our shop; I sent a man after the woman, they were both taken in custody.</p>

I was coming along from my work, about four o'clock in the evening, I met this woman as I came from my work, she said, she would give me a penny if I would take the shovels and bring them to her a little higher up; the gentleman came and took me; this woman ran under an arch way; the woman told me to deny that I knew her, which I did.</p>

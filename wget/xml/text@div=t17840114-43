               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prosecution. Had you lately before the robbery seen that door was shut? - It was a pannel broke out of the door, it is a side door that goes into a passage, a door we do not use.</p>
               <p>Was you alarmed at all in the course of that night? - Yes, about one a servant man called from the room adjoining where I lay, and told me there were people breaking into the house, I got up directly, we went into the maid-servant's door, and as soon as I entered in at that door, they had just forced another door of the same room, and were coming in.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe when you went into the room? - The people that were in the house heard me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the people? - No, there was no light, I heard somebody say we will blow your brains out, immediately two pistols were discharged, either in the room, or in the door-way, we found a slug in the room, it went just over the door that I came in at.</p>
               <p>With a direction to have hit you then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards see any of the persons go out? - I saw one go out as soon as they fired off the pistols, we immediately made back into another room and hallooed out of the window, and then I saw a man go away in front of the house, the door they came in at; I could not see him come out of the house, but I saw him walk from the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - Yes, Sir, there were some things taken out of the house, but they left a great deal behind them.</p>
               <p>From what part of the house were the things taken? - From the parlours, I am not sure of any of the things, I have seen some of the things, my wife knows them.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a pocket book? - Yes, I saw it at Bow-Street, it was my mother's, she had such a one, I cannot swear to it, there was a buckle found in the room, and it was produced at the Justice's in Bow-Street, I left it on the table, I should know it again, I think the prisoner was present then, he said he know nothing about the matter, the evidence owned the buckle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know my face? - No, only I saw you at Bow-street.</p>

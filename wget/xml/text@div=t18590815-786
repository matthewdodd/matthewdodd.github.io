                  </hi>. I reside at No. 9, Montague-place, Clapham-road; it is the duty of my servant to close the house at night, but I invariably look round the premises—on Saturday night, 5th March, I saw that the doors were all fast, and the windows shut, and everything secure; I went to bed about 12 o'clock, and on Sunday morning between 4 and 5 o'clock I was roused by the police-constable, and on coming downstairs I examined the doors and windows; I found an iron bar had been wrenched from the pantry window, and the window lifted up; the pantry door was cut through and a piece taken away; the door had been unlocked from inside, the drawers and cupboards opened, and two pairs of boots had been stolen; the door at the top of the kitchen stairs leading to the hall had been forced open. I missed some spoons from downstairs, and in the dining-room the tea-caddy had been forced open and the spoon taken from there; some napkin rings were taken away, and several boxes broken open—it was just becoming grey dawn; we could just see without a candle—these boots (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) were worn by my son—I have not the slightest doubt about their being his.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman,</hi> 420 <hi rend="italic">P</hi>). I was on duty on Sunday morning, the 6th of March, in Clapham-road, near Mr. Shakespeare's house—I was passing his house at 20 minutes before 5 o'clock; I observed a light over the kitchen door, and coming towards the house I saw the figure of a man through a glass panel of the door which leads to the kitchen—he stood looking into a cellar, a kind of coal cellar, I believe—he stood between the kitchen and the door—I got over the area-gate—I saw the figure draw the top bolt of the door, and he stood and unlocked the door—he then stooped and drew back the bottom bolt: I got three yards from the door; he opened the door as soon as he saw me, and said, "All right, policeman"—I said, "I don't think it is exactly all right;" he then shut the door, turned the key, and made his escape through the kitchen; I sprang my rattle and ran down the Clapham-road; I knocked up Mr. Shakespeare—I went into the house through the front door, I found the back kitchen wide open—I am certain</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At twenty minutes to five you saw a light and a figure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I first caught sight of the face of the figure about ten minutes to five—I was ten minutes observing the figure—I was looking at the face of the figure at the time he had the door open, somewhere about half a minute—I saw him again, I think, about 18th June—the figure was not at any time out in the area—the glass was water-waved glass that I saw him through—it was over the door that I saw the face for half a minute—I did not apprehend the prisoner—I don't know Jones, who produced these boots to Mr. Shakespeare—I saw these before at the Wandsworth police-court—when I saw the prisoner at the house, the sun had not risen; the stars were going in.</p>

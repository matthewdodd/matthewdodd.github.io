                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 52, Redhill Street, Regent's Park—on 18th September, between 7 o'clock and 7.30, I was crossing St. Pancras Road from Brewer Street—it was a very dark night, and it was very dark under the arches—I saw a woman crossing the road in the same direction as myself, and a few paces in front of me. (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the position upon a, plan.</hi>) She was going towards Battle Bridge, and was about 3 yards from the Obelisk—I had just put my foot on the kerb as she stepped off—I saw a Hansom cab coming on its proper side of the road at about six miles an hour, and it knocked the woman down—I ran to her assistance and got behind the cab and said "Cabman, you have got a woman under your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260091"></xptr>
               <p>horse"—he said "Nonsense, hang on behind and the horse will get up"—I assisted the woman up and took her to the hospital—the prisoner was the driver—I cannot say whether he had a lamp on his cab.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The horse fell after the woman was knocked down—there were a good many tram trains about, one had just passed it and carried a light which would, I think, come before the cabman—I do not think the prisoner was in fault—it must have occurred—I should have stopped till the horse had passed, I mean that she ought not to have gone ever—he might not have seen her, because he might have been turning his head at the time—the woman wore a dark brown dress—I was about 4 or 5 paces from her, and about the same distance from the horse as she was—the pri<lb></lb>soner was a little the worse for liquor—I know that by the way he spoke when he got down—he said that he did not believe there was a woman under the cab, and when he saw her he seemed to be taken all over at once with excitement—I swear that he spoke thick—there is a kerb there—there is another obelisk where you cross to go to Camden Town, it was not there.</p>

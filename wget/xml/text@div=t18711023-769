                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of John Street—on 20th October, in the afternoon, I had six coats, in a parcel—I sent them by the boy Dean, and walked behind him—the prisoner and another young man walked with him, and when we got to the first house past the public-house, the prisoner struck Dean, and got him down, and got the bundle from him—I rushed at him, caught hold of him from behind, and got the bundle away—he struck me several times, and would not let go of me—my friend went for a policeman—the prisoner ran away, when he saw a policeman, but he was taken—I got the parcel.</p>

I received information, went into Fashion Street, and saw the prisoner struggling with the prosecutor—the prisoner was very drunk—there was another man, who ran away—I afterwards saw this bundle of clothes, and he was given in custody for attempting to steal it—I could not see the bundle on the pavement at first, for the mob.</p>

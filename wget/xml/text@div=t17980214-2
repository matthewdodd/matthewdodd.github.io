             sworn. - I am the son of the last witness: I received information that the gelding was taken away, on Thursday night, by the Ongar coachman, at the Three Nuns, in Whitechapel: On Friday noon, I went into Smithfield-market, I had not been there a quarter of an hour before I saw the prisoner, Carter, upon the horse; I looked about for an officer, I could not find one; I saw Mr. Pope, and asked him to lend me assistance; we went and cheapened the horse, and asked him, where he brought it from; he said, he brought it from Hampshire, he said, he had had it four months upon his hands, and two months he had sent it to the Straw-yard, at Kensington Gravel-pits; we then asked him the price; he said, 10l.; he said, he had been used for plough and cart; we pointed out the blemishes, and then left the man upon the horse; while we were cheapening the horse, the other prisoner came up, recommending the horse, as knowing the horse, and man likewise; we then got two officers, and sent them to the Crown public-house, in the Market; then Mr. Pope fetched the two men into the public-house, as if we had thought better of the horse, and intended to buy it; we then asked him about the consitution and ways of the horse; Carter gave the same account as before; Peatty gave no account, only that it was a good horse, and he knew the horse and the man; we asked Carter several questions, and found he prevaricated very much in his answers; I then charged him with taking it from my father's stable, and we found him change colour, and not say a word against it; I gave them in charge to the two officers, and they were taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this pass in the hearing of the other man? - A. Yes; I sent the horse by another constable, to Mr. Pope's Livery-stables, in Little Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the horse? - A. Yes; he was a gelding, lame of two feet, and the hoos broke away from the off fore foot; the horse was brought to market with a leather halter, the same as he used to wear in the stable; I had not seen the horse, I believe, for a month before; I cannot swear to the bridle, it has had the winkers cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scott. Q. About what time was it that you met this man in Smithfield? - A.About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the halter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear that that is a halter from which the winkers had been cut off? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Peatty at all in possession of the horse? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. That is more than any man who had stolen it would have asked? - A. It was too much a great deal.</p>

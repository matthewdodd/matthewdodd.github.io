I received some informa<lb></lb>tion, in consequence of which on Friday, 7th Feb., I watched the prisoner—I began to watch him about a quarter to 6 o'clock—he was near the Bricklayers Arms public house, in the Old Kent-road—he was in company with another person—I followed them along the Old Kent-road through the toll-gate—they separated, and the prisoner remained behind the other some fifty yards, I think, walking steadily behind him—that happened two or three times—when they came to a turning leading to Smyrkes-road, they sepa<lb></lb>rated, and afterwards joined again, and I saw them go into No. 32, Smyrkea-road, both together—there were other persons in the neighbourhood to whom I gave information—I then returned, and continued watching the house—in about five or ten minutes they both came out again together—I will not be positive which came out first—they both came out at the door together—I believe the prisoner was first—he had his hands in the pockets of his over coat; they were front pockets—as soon as he came out I laid hold of his left arm, after he was two or three yards from the gate—Inspector M'Kenzie was with me at the time, and Mr. Moore close by—I said, "I must see what you have got about you," or some words to that effect Mr. M'Kenzie laid hold of his right arm, and went to put his hand into his right hand pocket—I told him that I had seen him in company with another man who had been into the house, and that I had been watching him some time—he denied being in company with another man, and also denied being in the bouse—he said he had just come up the street—M'Kenzie laid hold of him, and I saw him draw his hand from his pocket, and drop an envelope on the ground—the other man was, I should think, about two yards away from him at that time; Mr. Moore was close to the other man, and I believe had got hold of him—I saw the prisoner drop the envelope on the ground, and I saw Mr. Moore pick it up—we then took him into a shop in the neighbourhood and searched him; I found 13*. on him—as we were taking him to the station, one of the officers said to him, "Mr. Robert Cummings," or "Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Cummings," or some words to that effect—the prisoner did not say anything on that—I believe he saw Moore pick up the parcel—he did not, to. my knowledge, make any ob<lb></lb>servation.</p>

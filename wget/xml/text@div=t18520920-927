                  </hi>. I live at Kingsbury reservoir, and am working there. On 28th Aug. I was at the Hive beer shop—I stayed from about half past 8 o'clock in the evening till about 10—the prisoner came in—I never saw him before—I had no conversation with him—when I came out to go home, I found him outside—I do not know what he was doing, but as soon as I came out he started striking me—I had not interfered with him in any way—I struck him again—that striking did not last above two or three minutes—at the end of that time the policeman came up and parted us; he pushed one one way and the other the other—I said, "That man has stabbed me"—I found the blood trickling down my right thigh—they took me to a house to see whether I was stabbed, and the policeman took the prisoner directly—I have my clothes here, which were cut through—I bled much, and was taken to a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was at Mr. Brittnei's beer shop on the night this happened—the prisoner was there, and the last witness—the prisoner was quarrelling and kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he was turned out about half past 10 o'clock—Freeman was inside—he came out directly after the landlord turned the prisoner out—as soon as be came out the prisoner struck him—he had not interfered with the prisoner at all, and he did not drink with him—when the prisoner struck Freeman, he turned in his own defence—the striking only lasted a very little while—they bad a <hi rend="italic">round</hi> or two outside—the policeman came up and separated them, and Freeman cried out, "I am stabbed! I am stabbed! the blood is running down my leg"—I took him into a house—the policeman followed me, and saw he was stabbed, and he went out and took the prisoner—when I got Freeman in the house I could see the</p>

On that Saturday night I was on duty dt the Hive, in the Edgware-road—I heard a noise at the beer-shop, and hastened to the spot—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor grasping together—there were more persons there, but none near them—they were outside the beershop door—I saw them grasping together—I took out my staff, and said, "The first man that strikes a blow, I shall interfere with him"—I put my left hand towards Freeman, and, on pulling him back away from Farrell, I found my left hand all covered with blood—Freeman called out directly, "I am stabbed, policeman!"—he ran into a house next door—I looked after him to see if he was wounded, and I then immediately turned round and took the prisoner—I took him to the station—he was very violent on the way, and said, "By God Almighty, if you let me go, I will murder some of them!"</p>

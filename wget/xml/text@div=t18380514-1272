                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Messrs. Grissell and Peto, I live at No. 5, Horrox-street. I was aware, in March last, that Mr. Cur<lb></lb>nock's carts were employed in taking bricks from the wharf to Westbourne-green—on the morning of the 6th of March, I left my house to go to work, about ten minutes past six o'clock—the prisoner keeps a stable in Horror-street—I have to pass that stable as I go to work—that is the same stable to which Mr. Laughton afterwards went with me—I knew Townsend and Scott, both, and I knew they were employed by Mr. Curnock to draw bricks to Westbourne-green—as I went to work that morning, I saw Townsend first—he pulled his horse's head round, and shot out the load of brick's in his cart against Sid well's stable-door, and then he turned to assist Scott to shoot his—they were shot in the same place—I am accustomed to bricks—I know that they are taken from a cart by the hand, and piled up—but these bricks were shot out—the tail-board was taken out, and the cart tipped up—that attracted my attention—directly after I saw the second load shot, I took up one of the bricks and saw the letter A marked upon it—I did not see Mr. Laughton on that Tuesday, but I saw him on the Wednesday after, and told him of it—on the Thursday morning, as I was going to work, I saw two other loads of bricks shot, in the same place went with Mr. Laughton and Maw that morning to Horrox street, I Found some bricks outside the stable—Mr. Laughton left Mars at the stable and went to Sidwell's house—I was looking about to see if I could see any thing</p>

               <p>of Sidwell, and I saw Sidwell's carter come up with Sidwell's horse and cart—he began to load the bricks—Sidwell came up in seven or eight minutes, and he assisted the man to load the cart—I do not know what became of the cart, it was loading when I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of Thurloe-place, Brompton—I was called on to inspect the body of this child at the Mount-street workhouse on 21st April—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 25th—I was quite unable to form an opinion of the cause of death—the appearances were consistent with death by suffocation or drowning, what was the actual cause I cannot say—it was quite bloodless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suffocation and drowning would be the same thing would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if there was drowning there would be suffocation—there were no symptoms to lead to that conclusion—there was an absence of symptoms of all kind; when I say the child was bloodless I mean that the organs were so bloodless that I could come to no conclusion—there was blood, but in such a small quantity—the child was scarcely emaciated enough to say that it died of inanition, with a scarcity of blood there would be other symptoms—I don't think the other circumstances in connexion would warrant me in saying the child was about five or six weeks old—if it had been thrown into the water alive, the water would have been absorbed in the meantime—if the lungs were full of water in twenty-four or forty-eight hours it would disappear, and leave no traces of suffocation—I should have expected to find traces of suffocation, but those traces were lost because</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour after it was taken out of the water, from half-past eleven to twelve on Friday, 21st April, it appeared to me not to have been above one or two hours in the water—I did not get the Coroner's order to make the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion until five days afterwards; so that there was time enough for all the appearances to disperse—externally, the skin had not the appearance of having been in the water above one or two hours—if it had an ordinary quantity of blood in its body when it was thrown in the water—I could not account for the blood leaving it—there was no wound from which it could have escaped—I believe it must have been in that comparatively bloodless condition when thrown in—if it was alive at the time it was in a very weak condition from want of blood.</p>

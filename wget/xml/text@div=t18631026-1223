                  </hi>. I lived with the deceased Joseph Holland, of 2, Smith's-buildings, Bishopsgate-street-without—the prisoner lived in the same house—a few days before 11th October, I had a quarrel with her; she threw some water over me—On Saturday, 12th October, about 12 o'clock, I was with the deceased in my room; the prisoner was going up the passage, and she said she would give it to me when I came out again—the deceased came out to stop me from quarrelling with her, and the deceased struck him in the chest with her two fists, and forced him against a table—she then laid hold of my hair—I got from her and went into my room—the deceased was put indoors after the prisoner had struck him—he was trembling, and said he was very much frightened—he was very well before the prisoner struck him—he was twenty-seven years of age—he was a glass rougher at Messrs. Defries—he went to work next day; when he came back in the evening he was very bad; he was brought home by two men—he said he had thrown up some blood—I did not see him do so—I took him to Devonshire-square Hospital on Monday—he died on the Thursday morning afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased, and live at 2, Smith's-buildings—my room is opposite the one occupied by the last witness—on Saturday night, 10th October, I saw the prisoner going through the passage to go up to her room—Allington came out, and the prisoner said she would pay her—the deceased came out and said he would settle her another way, by obtaining a warrant for her—she up with her two hands and crushed him in the stomach, and sent him backwards against the table, and tore his shirt—he came out of doors and was all in a tremble—I said, "What do you tremble so for?" and he said he did not—he looked as white as a corpse—I did not see him strike the prisoner at all—I next saw him on Sunday night, brought home by two men very bad—he complained of pain in his stomach, and had been vomiting blood—no medical man saw him till Tuesday—he brought up blood on Monday night—he was in very good health before this blow.</p>

I am a labourer of 2, Fountain-court, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—on Saturday night, 10th October, I was at the door of the deceased's house when this first happened—Allington was going through the passage into the yard—the prisoner came through and said she owed her something and she would pay her—she went up stairs and came down again and pitched into her—the deceased came out to part them, and the prisoner deliberately made a blow with her two hands, and hit him in the chest, which knocked him down by the door—I picked him up and put him indoors—I then went outside and saw no more—I heard a row inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Bishopsgate-street—on Tuesday, 13th October, I was called to attend the deceased at his own residence, 2, Smith's-buildings—he was in bed, propped up—he was in a state of collapse from the loss of a large quantity of blood—I did not see him throw up any, but there was blood hanging about his lips, and there was a large quantity in the chamber utensil by his bedside—I attended him until his death on Thursday morning—I attended the post-mortem examination—from what I heard at the inquest, and from the appearances found after death, my opinion is, that in all probability the blow on the pit of the stomach was the exciting cause of the hemorrhage there from—the appearances were such as a blow would produce—there was a visible rupture, or rather an exhalation from the whole surface.</p>

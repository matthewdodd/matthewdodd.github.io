An ass was lost from his premises, on the 23rd of June, at night, or early in the morning of the 24th; it was a valuable ass, and a favourite animal; it was in the paddock when I saw it last; the paddock was perfectly secure. The gate must have been broken open; the ass could not have got its own accord. I saw the ass again on the 7th of July, in Fitzroy-market; I saw

I heard no more of it until Mr. Perks and Mr. Bye came and claimed the ass. When they came to me I did not know that the ass was stolen. I went with them to Bow-street; there I gave the same account that I have now given, and these two men were taken up.</p>

            . I apprehended the two prisoners. I told them what I apprehended them for; they said, they bought the ass of a farming man, in Holborn; there was tied to a waggon two asses. I think they said, the waggon belonged to a man of the name of White, he lived a good way off in the country; they did not say what town or place. I have seen the prisoners before; I know no harm of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am an officer. When I took Mr. Payne into custody, he very readily took me, and he and his wife pointed out the prisoners. I asked him what conversation took place when he purchased the ass; he told me. The prisoners said, they brought the ass from Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. to Payne. Did the prisoners tell you where they got the ass - A. They said, it came from Hampstead; they had not had it long; they said, they bought it of a gentleman at Hampstead; they did not say whom.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners joint Defence read in court. My lord and gentlemen of the jury; as we were walking down Holborn, we saw a man riding upon a mare ass, and a colt; we bought the ass, and sold it to Mr. Payne; we did not know it was stolen. We told Mr. Payne where we lived. We were apprehended for stealing the ass. Since we have been in custody,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060059"></xptr>we have tried to trace the man; we have advertised the ass, and offered a reward for apprehending the man, and if you will find us not guilty, I do assure you, if ever we find the man, we will take him into custody.</p>

Yes, at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane; I cannot say the day of the month, it was about a week or a fortnight before the prisoners were taken into custody. I asked the man with the asses, the price of them; he said, three pounds. I bid him two-pounds for one; he said, that would not do.

             sworn. I live at the corner of Downing-street, Westminster; I am a <rs id="t18060416-11-viclabel62" type="occupation">soldier in the Guards</rs>

On Friday the 14th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming from Tottenham Court Road, where I had been to see a friend of mine, and it was rather too late to go to my lodgings, they always shut up at eleven o'clock; I met the prisoner at Charing Cross.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160015"></xptr>Q. You was rather in liquor I presume. - A. I had been drinking a drop; I went with the prisoner to <placeName id="t18060416-11-crimeloc63">Simon's Buildings</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep there. - A. Yes; I had my watch when I went to bed with her, I took it out of my breeches pocket and put it in my waistcoat pocket, I slept in my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor at that house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any by the way. - A. No; I gave the girl a glass of gin at Westminster Abbey. I bolted the door when the prisoner and I went to bed; about seven in the morning I missed my watch; the prisoner got up before that time and went to bed again, I had two half guineas in my pocket, a seven shilling piece, and some silver and halfpence; I missed none of my money. I promised the prisoner half a guinea if she would let me have it. When I awoke in the morning I observed the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given her the watch. - A. No, I gave her two shillings, I never saw the watch again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man was very much intoxicated in liquor when I took up with him, I never saw him have a watch; when he came into the room I saw he had gold and silver in a purse, when he gave me two shillings.</p>

On the 18th of May the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a nail of silk velvet, at 8s. a yard - there were twenty-four yards of silk laying on the counter, and I went round the counter to look for a piece of velvet: I was stoping to get some, and saw him stoop at the same time - I told him we had no velvet at that price; he was then going out, and I saw some silk under his arm - I ran after him, but there was no one in the shop, and I did not pursue him; I came back and missed some silk from the counter - I waited till some one came into the shop; I then went after the prisoner again -I stopped him, and when I took hold of his coat he dropped this silk; I took it up - it had been laying on the counter, and is worth 4l.; I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You saw the silk under his arm? A. I pursued him within three minutes - he had got about sixty yards; I did not call to him to stop when he went out - he had a great coat under his arm: I saw him drop the silk about where I stopped him in St. Martin's-lane - he did not drop it till I took hold of him: he was walking fast.</p>

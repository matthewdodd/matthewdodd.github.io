               <p>You saw him in the road talking with a woman? - Yes; I saw the trunk lay in the ditch, about seven yards from him; I got off and seized him, and let the horse go immediately.</p>
               <p>What did you charge him with? - I had a suspicion he was the man that cut the trunk from behind; he made a piece of work, and said it was not him, and he would give me a punch in the head, and such like as that; a gentleman came up to my assistance, and laid hold of one side of him, and we insisted on his coming with us; I saw a man go over a gate in a blue coat, before I saw the trunk, about three or four yards from it; the prisoner was nearest to the trunk.</p>
               <p>How came you not to suspect the man that went over the gate? - Because he ran across the field, and my horse could not go there.</p>

               <p>About two o'clock I was walking out, on the 12th of December, I saw the prisoner take a trunk from behind a coach, roll it on the road, then put it into the ditch; I saw him take it from behind the coach.</p>
               <p>How far did he carry it? - It might be a yard or more; he rolled it on the road, and put it into the ditch; there was a man with him in a blue great coat; then he came over to talk to me, and asked me if I wanted any thing, I said not with him, at the same time Mr. Larkin's man seized him.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after he took it from the coach the man came up? - A very few minutes; I was walking with a child that walked very slow; I told Mr. Larkin's man as soon as I saw him; I said I saw the man take the trunk off.</p>
               <p>Court to Wheeler. How came you to tell me nothing of what the woman told you? - When I came up the fellow was talking to her; she did not tell me just directly; she was in the road, he was nearer the trunk, she was in the path; when I came up to him, a gentleman and lady came up, he came to my assistance, and she told me then she saw him take it, and put it in the ditch.</p>

               <p>She says she saw me roll it out of the road; says she saw that young man take it out of the road, and put it down there in the ditch, and as soon as that man came up to her, I went up and asked her if she wanted any thing, as I thought she might have heard something of it; she said no; I stood there, it was twenty yards from the box she says, and it was not seven yards; she told him at first she saw me roll it out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090024"></xptr> of the path-way, then said I put it in the ditch. I have no witnesses; I did not see the box at all till I came close by Stamford Hill; the box lay in the road, I rolled it on the path-way; this woman coming along I asked if she wanted any thing, she said no, nothing of me; I thought she might have heard something of it.</p>

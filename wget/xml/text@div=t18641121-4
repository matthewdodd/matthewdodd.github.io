                  </hi>. I am an estate agent at Chesham, Bucks—on 14th November, about a quarter to 9 in the morning, I was in the Old Bailey—I had a gold watch in my waistcoat-pocket underneath two coats, which were buttoned up—I was standing still—there was a rush made and my hat was knocked off, but it was chucked up about a minute afterwards—I felt as I thought two hands at my waistcoat-pocket, my coats were torn open, and my waistcoat-pocket torn out—I had but 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there, and that was taken—I had nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about me, but fortunately they did not get that—I had not gone to see the execution, I was only passing—when I felt the hands at my waistcoat-pocket, I looked down and Chips had the key and part of the chain in his hand—I caught hold of the chain and it broke—I had one part and he the other—they then hustled me and knocked me down; there were a great many in it, no doubt—I saw Chips and Hart, and Rayner stood by the side of me—when they knocked me down they got hold of my person, and I was never in such pain in my life—Rayner was on me when I was down—I said, "For God's sake let me get up, or I shall be murdered'—I was quite helpless—the prisoners kept close to me—I sang out "murder, police"—two constables ran to my assistance, and when I got to the barrier Rayner pretended to be my friend, but it was only a piece of hypocrisy on his part—they all attempted to run away, but the police got hold of them.</p>

               <p>opposite the Governor's house—I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I made the best of my way through the crowd to the spot, and saw the three prisoners together—I attempted to take Rayner into custody—he tried to escape by getting under one of the barriers—I took him to the station-house with great difficulty—he made several attempts to get away—other parties tried to rescue him—I found on him eightpence halfpenny in money, two common keys, a small piece of chain, and a purse—this piece of gold chain I received from the prosecutor—I did not find the other part.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rayner's Defence.</hi> I assure you I am entirely innocent of the charge; I know not these men; I was in the crowd; I assisted the prosecutor all I could when he called out; I pushed him under the barrier, and he turned round and thanked me for it; about five minutes afterwards the policeman seized me; I went voluntarily to the station and gave my name; if it had not been for me the prosecutor would have been dreadfully ill-treated.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to that; this was for a bill in the year 1783? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And as you recollect paid by you in the year 1784; when for the first time did you hear any complaint of payment from Mr. Rust? - Never.</p>
               <p>Have you dealt with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you paid him the last bill? - No, there was a dispute about it, and Mr. Disney had that bill of me to set to rights.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I think it was the beginning of this year.</p>
               <p>Then since spring 1784 have you not paid Mr. Rust any money? - No, Sir; none at all.</p>
               <p>He was pretty universally taken for Mr. Rust's son? - It is likely he might.</p>
               <p>He used Mr. Rust's name? - I never heard him call himself so.</p>

            ? - No; I took it to be his receipt.</p>
               <p>You never heard any complaint of this receipt? - I was never called on by Mr. Rust; Mr. Rust called upon me, not to pay the money, but to ask me if I had paid the bill; it was about the beginning of this year.</p>
               <p>You never heard this young man while he conducted the business of Mr. Rust's, called by the name of Disney? - No, never, he afterwards informed me that his name was not Rust, but Disney.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was in conversation at Mr. Rust's shop, I should rather suppose it to be at the latter end of the year 1784.</p>
               <p>At that time I believe the young man at the bar had left Mr. Rust? - No, Sir, not at the time he told me.</p>
               <p>How soon after did he leave him, and enter into partnership with another person? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Is it two or three months since he left Mr. Rust? - I do not know, I think it was in the beginning of this year.</p>

               <p>Then during the time he continued in this employment, he continued in the name of Rust? - I think it was before he left Mr. Rust that he told me his name.</p>
               <p>Did you know, when he told you that, that he intended to leave Mr. Rust, upon your oath; what is your name, is it not Brownrigg? - Yes, Sir, and I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>I do not blame you, nay I will add to it that you was very honourably acquitted from that bar by that name, however that is your name, and you was very honourably acquitted by that name.</p>
               <p>Court to witness. Have you in business been known, and passed by the name of Brown? - Yes, these ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. That is the name that you have constantly given up and passed to the publick as your name? - Yes, and I am well received by my friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect any conversation between the prisoner and you at the time you paid it, about the date? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire the prisoner to antedate it in order to avoid the payment of the stamp duty, and that is the reason it is torn off? - No, Sir, I do not; there never was a stamp to it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with old Rust about it? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then you had no conversation with him about this? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect having any conversation at all about his name? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know him by the name of Rust at any other time than when he signed this paper? - He told me in his shop that his name was Rust, I always considered him as a son.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My Lord, on the 17th of February last, the day that this note appears to be due, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner in company with another young fellow, came into my office, he said it was due on that day, and he wanted me immediately to proceed against Mr. Rust, the person who was to pay it; I told him, it was only due that day, and that he must wait till the morrow before I took steps with it, that it would be sent for payment, if he chose it; the young fellow that was with him, said, you had had better leave it with Mr. Herne, and let him send one of his clerks with it.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Fielding, counsellor for the prosecution, just entered and opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am to beg your pardon as well as my Lord's, for being rather later than my time; you have heard the indictment read, and you all very well know how extremely important to public justice it is, to be as active as possible in the suppression of the crime of forgery, and how necessary that punishment should follow on such convictions. This young man at the bar had for some time lived as an apprentice with the prosecutor, he had an opportunity of knowing his master's affairs; the master, who will appear before you probably, (though I know not that he may, from a circumstance that will perhaps impede his attendance) he is extremely infirm, and a very likely subject of imposition; this young man had an accident of a fortunate kind happened to him; after which, instead of the industrious apprentice, he became an extravagant young man, conceived some objection to the behaviour of his master, and had taken such a dislike as to threaten him with vengeance of a a particular kind, I shall not open that to you, if the witness tells the story, I make no doubt but it will have its proper, and only its proper impression upon you. This young man living in the character of a journeyman, carried a draft, supposed to be drawn by his master, a promissory note to him for 350 l. to Mr. Herne to procure payment; now to be sure upon the very outlines of the case, it must appear strongly impossible, that the master should be indebted to him in that sum; what could induce the master to give him such a promissory note, I cannot say; he carried to Mr. Herne, an attorney, this promissory note, purporting to be a note from Mr. Rust to him, promising to pay him 350 l. he gave Mr. Herne very singular directions upon it, desiring him to go on to recover the money; Mr. Herne being a gentleman of very considerable reputation, told him, there was no room for all that acceleration of the business, that he might wait; that he should first of all apprise him of the business; and when Mr. Herne came to Mr. Rust, telling him of the note, he was perfectly astonished, declared at that time, that he never had given such a note as this, but that it was a forgery; the young man came a second time to Mr. Herne, who told him he must go to Sir Sampson Wright's; but an acquaintance of the prisoner's thought it better to go to my learned friend here, Mr. Garrow, and to him they went. Gentlemen, the case is very particularly circumstanced, and it will require a very serious consideration from you; for as the law stands, this being Mr. Rust's note, purporting to be drawn by him, and bearing his signature, he is a man interested in the event of that suit, and cannot be a witness; then, how is it possible that he should establish the criminality of this young man, Mr. Rust cannot be a witness; you will then have to go another degree of proof, for whereever there is a criminality existing, it behoves the laws of the country to sift out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260160"></xptr> the criminality, and if one degree of testimony is cut off, you must resort to another; remembering, however, that unless the matter in issue should at the last convince an honest and intelligent jury of the guilt of the prisoner, the man will go acquitted. In most common transactions we are obliged to resort to probability, and it will be for you to put all these circumstances together, to weigh them well, and consider whether they furnish that result in your minds, as shall honestly and fairly convince you of the guilt of the prisoner; if there be any doubt, you will let him go acquitted. This being the case, and as I am free to confess, I shall be cut out of the advantage, and the public also of receiving the evidence of Mr. Rust; I must trust to the circumstances of this case: the first circumstance is the situation of this young man, in the employ of Mr. Rust, a journeyman, not having it in his power to advance money, not requiring any particular act of bounty, whether it be probable his master should give him this note, is for you to determine. I shall lay before you this sort of evidence from those people that have frequently seen Mr. Rust write, and are confident of his writing, that it is not his hand; I shall prove that this young man one day, a little before the execution of this instrument, had bought a couple of stamps, and was writing on one of them, and manifested confusion, on being discovered of what he was writing; but I wish not to catch your passions, nor to inflame them; I wish that the evidence may come seriously before you, that your minds may be as free from passion and prejudice as possible; if you should be of opinion that the probability of the circumstance furnishes a degree of testimony, which shall in your breasts, and as you think to all others, furnish the evidence of demonstration, it will be your duty under the consideration of what you owe to your country, to find the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Herne. He left the note with me at that time, but on my turning to the back of it, I saw it was not indorsed; I told him nobody could recover it; he did not seem to understand what indorsing was; I did not enquire that young man's name, I should not know him again; the young fellow said he was a shoemaker in St. Martin's-lane; I asked him who recommended him to me; he said, a Mr. Mell.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not seem to be well acquainted with the nature of notes or bills? - He did not seem to know the nature of indorsements; but at the desire of the young fellow, he wrote his name very well on the back.</p>
               <p>Did you hold any conversation with him at this presentment of the bill? - I was going out in a great hurry at that time, therefore nothing passed; he desired I would send one of my clerks; I went up to Islington, and it struck me it was a very extraordinary circumstance, a young fellow coming so soon after it was due, to arrest him; I went the same day into Butcher-row; I called upon an opposite neighbour, and went over to Mr. Rust, and presented it to Mr. Rust, and he refused payment.</p>
               <p>Did, at any future time, any conversation pass between you and the prisoner? - The prisoner said he would come at eight that evening, but he did not; he called several times at my house, and I did not see him; he called on me one morning, in company with another young fellow, not the same that came before; that was after the warrant had been issued for his apprehension; I believe it was five or six days; he said, have you got me the money? I said, Mr. Disney, you have got me into a fine scrape, you must go with me to Sir Sampson's; why, says he, where is my note; what, will he not pay me my money? No, says I, he says it is a forgery; he said he would go directly; he appeared no more confused than I was; the person that was with him said, you had better not go to Sir Sampson's; do not let us go into the lion's mouth, says he, we will consult Mr. Garrow; and the prisoner afterwards said, why then, we will go to Mr. Garrow, and call on you, Mr. Herne, in the evening; and away they went, and I never saw him any more.</p>

               <p>Was he known to you? - I thought I knew him; he told me he lived at No. 9, or 11, in St. Martin's-lane, and was a shoemaker; I do not know that of my own knowledge, but I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>He left the note, without any caution on the business, but to get the money as fast as you could? - Yes; he wanted to have him arrested that night; I have no concern whatever in this prosecution, I attend merely as being bound over; he wrote his name on the back of the note,

I do not believe this is Mr. Rust's handwriting;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260163"></xptr> for he writes in a more full hand than this; I have seen the prisoner at the bar write, and he writes a more light hand than this.</p>

               <p>You have seen him write many times? - I have; I do not think it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you, Mr. Smith? - A leather-factor.</p>
               <p>Have you seen much of his hand-writing? - A good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Have you at this time a promissory note of the prisoner's? - I have.</p>
               <p>And from your knowledge, you do not think this is the prisoner's hand-writing? - I do not, really.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - About fourteen years; he lived with Mr. Rust, he was his apprentice, and afterwards his managing man; I never saw Mr. Rust before yesterday; I never went to the Justice of Peace, nor the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it yesterday, when he applied to you? - I saw him in the early part of the day.</p>
               <p>Was you here yesterday; when we had Mr. Brownrigg? - I was not in court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rust shewed you this, did not he? - I saw it at Mr. Herne's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rust told you it was a forgery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you it was a forgery, and wanted you to prove it? - I would have trusted the prisoner at the bar with any property.</p>
               <p>I ask you, because I know you are an honest man, and have a good opinion of the prisoner, he told you that it was not his hand-writing, and that it was a forgery? - He did so.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. Herne shewed it to you in the presence of Mr. Rust? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What marks did he point out to you, by which you might know it was not his handwriting? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>By which you might think about it? - I am not at a certainty about it.</p>
               <p>What mark did Mr. Rust describe to you by which you knew it was not his handwriting? - I do not say that it is not his hand-writing; Mr. Rust asked me if I thought that was his R.</p>
               <p>I knew it was the R he had fixed upon? - I do not swear neither one way or the other.</p>
               <p>He told you at first it was a forgery, and that it was not his hand-writing; what stroke of the R was it that he pointed out directly? - I think just the same as I said before; Mr. Rust writes much larger.</p>
               <p>What state of health was your neighbour Mr. Rust in about a twelvemonth ago? - I believe he was in the country, as near as I can recollect, about that time; I do not recollect his being very ill; he went into the country for his health.</p>
               <p>Is not he a very infirm old gentleman? - I look upon him a very hearty man of his age.</p>
               <p>Not an infirm man? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that he told you at Mr. Herne's, about the blemishes at the top of the T? - There was not a word mentioned about the T; there never was any thing mentioned, but about the R.</p>
               <p>What was the particular observation that he mentioned to you? - That it was too light for his hand-writing; I have known this young man for fourteen years, and if he was to come to my shop to-morrow, I would trust him with fifty pounds; he had the management of the business.</p>
               <p>He was called his son? - I never heard that before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Did you look to him as the young man that was likely to succeed to the business? - I did look upon him so.</p>
               <p>How long was it since Mr. Rust's wife died? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that this young man had the fortunate accident to get something in the lottery? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Have you had much dealings with Mr. Rust? - He always paid me ready money.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Rust deal in country-made shoes? - I believe he does.</p>
               <p>We all know that the country shoemakers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260164"></xptr> very often bring up very good bargains to town? - Certainly they do.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Rust was in the luck of buying a good many bargains? - Not to my knowledge; I have seen country made shoes in his shop.</p>

               <p>Do you know the hand writing of Mr. Rust? - Not well enough to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him write? - I have often seen him write.</p>
               <p>Can you say, when you see his name to any instrument to which Mr. Rust's name should be wrote, that it is hand writing? - I think it is not his hand writing, but I cannot swear it, nor do not pretend to swear it.</p>
               <p>According to the best of your belief, is it, or is it not his hand writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You believe from your recollection of his hand writing that it is not his hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - I am a butcher in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Then you have had once a year, or once in every half year a receipt from Mr. Rust for shoes? - Once a month.</p>
               <p>Is your knowledge of his writing, or is it not, formed from a comparison with those receipts? - I thought it was not his hand writing when I first saw it.</p>
               <p>How did you first see this note? - I saw it at Guildhall; I went with Mr. Rust; Mr. Rust had told me of this forgery, and that it was not his hand writing; Mr. Rust never pointed out any thing particular of the letters; he put the note into my hand, and asked me to look at it, and to give my opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Wherein does it differ? - I think the R. and the Thomas is not so like.</p>
               <p>In what do they differ? - I think he writes a lighter hand, not so heavy a hand at the word Thomas in particular.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you can write? - A little.</p>
               <p>I dare say it has happened with you to begin with a new pen, and at first it writes ill, you never taught writing? - No. I teach writing!</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose this note now had been for five pounds instead of three hundred and fifty, and it had been brought to you to discount it, was it so unlike that you should have refused it? - I do not know that I should, but I should not think Mr. Rust ever had a note out; I should have thought it was not his hand writing, because I should have thought he had no note out.</p>

               <p>That is quite a different thing, if you can separate in your own mind the impression under which you first saw this note, which was the impression of its being forged; now supposing you had seen it without that, if you had seen these words

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Pring is a relation of Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What relation are you to Mr. Rust? - I married his niece.</p>
               <p>Has he any children of his own? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the young man at the bar? - Ever since he came there, he has been with him all the time, from his first going there till lately; he was a great favourite, I always looked upon him so; a very good servant.</p>
               <p>I believe it was pretty generally understood, that this young man would succeed to the business? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe he was so great a favourite, that it was understood if there was any fortune he would get that too; you hoped not, I know? - Mr. Rust told me he had left him sixty pounds; I never heard this young man called by the name of Rust; I visited there many times.</p>
               <p>I believe this young man had the good or ill fortune to hit upon the expedient of making boots without a seam? - Yes, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Now you have heard this, that for that same boot of his without a seam, he should have a seam round his neck, that he would hang him if he had twenty lives? - I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260165"></xptr> heard any expression from Mr. Rust of that sort; I heard him say if he had continued with him till Christmas, that he would have given him his business; but he would not stay any longer than Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>You heard so from Mr. Rust? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was very ungrateful in Mr. Rust's opinion? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has he never said it was a very shabby and scandalous thing? - Never.</p>
               <p>He praised him for it may be? - Not to me, I had no conversation with Mr. Rust about it.</p>
               <p>Yes, you had; was that all he said, did he not accompany it with any blessing or benedictions on the young man? - I heard nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has taken his son since apprentice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What age is your son? - Between fourteen and fifteen; he went apprentice just about the time of his leaving him; he was with me before.</p>
               <p>What business did you intend to put him to? - No particular business; when this young man was gone, I applied to Mr. Rust to take my son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you know any thing of his intentions to this young man more than his suceeding to the business? - I heard him say he had left him sixty pounds in his will, and letting him succeed to the business.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was not since last Sunday? - No, I believe it was before last Sunday; Mr. Rust called upon me, and asked me if I would attend in respect of a note that was drawn on him for three hundred and fifty pounds; that it was not his hand writing, and he would be very much obliged to me to attend; I saw it at the attorney's about Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Rust there at that time? - He was there.</p>
               <p>What was it in the capital R. that he pointed out to you that was not his hand writing? - It is rather not done strong enough.</p>
               <p>It therefore appeared to you to be done twice, that the principal thing, he marked it out to you, you thought it very singular he should give a note for three hundred and fifty pounds? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he at any time in October send you to a stationer for any thing? - About a month before he left St. Martin's-lane, to the best of my knowledge, that day week that the warrants were out, he left St. Martin's-lane; about a month before he left St. Martin's-lane, he sent me to the stationer's in St. Martin's-court for a shilling stamp, and a two penny stamp, I took them in to him, and came out of the parlour again; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, I went to go into the parlour again; as I had just opened the door Mr. Disney put his hand upon the door and would not let me come in, and on one of these stamps he was writing, but I cannot say which; to the best of my knowledge, it was between seven and eight in the evening; then when he left St. Martin's-lane, I used to go backwards and forwards to him when he was at hide and seek; I went to him at Mr. Lord's in Gracechurch-street, and he said to me one morning, when I saw him at Mr. Lord's, says he, the lawyers have been here, and I only wish I could get a man to swear that he had seen Mr. Rust put his name to this note, then he said, you can swear that you saw Mr. Rust put his name to it.</p>
               <p>Was it in answer to any thing that you said? - No, I said nothing.</p>
               <p>What answer did you make? - I told him I did not like to do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between you before you left him at that time? - No, Sir, not at that time.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again after this? - I do not know that I saw him again after this at that house.</p>
               <p>Well then at any other place? - About a fortnight after he sent a young man up to me.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that message did you see him at any other place and where? - I went to an empty house, Clerkenwell-green, Alyesbury-street; that night he sent me for some bread and cheese; and then he said, the only way to do Mr. Rust over is to set his house on fire, and burn him in it; says he, I will tell you how it is to be done; there is a hole just where the scraper is at the shop door, and by putting some links in there it may be done; there was nothing more passed that night, we went to bed together; I was with him all day on Sunday; he was there unknown to any body.</p>
               <p>What did he say on the Sunday? - I do not know, for we slept all the day away almost; I left him on the Monday morning, I went to him again towards dinner time to the same place, I fetched him two rolls and treacle.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you aboutthe note? - He told me he would be d - d if the signing the note was his writing, meaning himself; I had told him if he was taken that the Judge and Jury would think within themselves that Mr. Rust being a man of property would never go to be indebted in such a sum to a servant; then I told him again, says I, the Judge will ask you how you came by this money; then he made answer to me, and said, what is that to them; then I left him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any more after this time of parting, before he was apprehended? - I saw him the next day, and he was talking about a young fellow he was very well acquainted with; I was saying what a fearful man he was, and he said, yes, he was very fearful; and I think to the best of my knowledge he was one of them that was concerned; I do not know any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more before he was taken up? - He went away from that house on the Saturday, and he went down to his sister's, and he told me to come on Sunday to his sister's, in Church-lane, Rosemary-lane, and he said, do you know a man that is very much like me, says he, I wish I could get a man to go and surrender<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260167"></xptr> himself for me, and take a trial for me, and then, says he, after he has had his trial, he can say, he is not the man, and I will give him fifty guineas, or fifty pounds, I am not sure which he said; then I left him, and he said, there are two or three brothers of the name of Withers, and he said, that is the hair-dresser, that is very much like me, I wish you could go and see if you can find him, I am told, says he, he lives in Leather-lane, or somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you know this young man when he lived at Mr. Rust's, before he left him? - Yes, I lived twice at Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>What appearance had he of property? - No appearance at all of property but wages.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Fielding. You forget your own opening, you stated that he had property, and became very extravagant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was in Tothill-fields Bridewell, what was the name of that woman you robbed? - I do not know her name, she accused me wrongfully.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - Fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Therefore you would have us believe that since that robbery you have been an honest lad? - No, Sir, nobody has found me out.</p>
               <p>How long did you lay in gaol on that occasion? - Till sessions, and when sessions came I was turned out.</p>
               <p>When was it that Mr. Rust said, that you was a loitering, lurking, half hanged rascal, and should never come into his house, you was his apprentice? - No, I went of errands.</p>
               <p>So this Mr. Disney, who is supposed to consult some counsel, consulted you as his counsel? - There was no counsel nor attorney.</p>
               <p>So you stood in place of counsel, and attorney, and judge? - No, I do not put myself upon a footing with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lord was present at this conversation? - Mr. Lord never knew to my knowledge what Mr. Disney and I was talking about.</p>
               <p>You never had any conversation with Mr. Lord upon the subject? - No, nothing in particular as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Cannot you recollect whether you had any conversation at all with Mr. Lord upon the subject of this business? - I will tell you the conversation in a minute.</p>
               <p>Give an answer? - He was used to ask me if I saw Mr. Rust, or the like of that.</p>
               <p>What might you answer? - I told him, whether I had seen him or not.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mr. Lord about that? - Mr. Lord was talking to me once about the note, and he said, did you ever know Mr. Disney lend Mr. Rust any money, and I told him, yes, two and three guineas at a time; but to my knowledge always paid him again very soon.</p>
               <p>Now that was exactly what you said? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I shall brush up your memory before I have done with you; was not there a little conversation about Mr. Rust's signing a note in the shop ha! look at this gentleman and give your answer? - Yes, I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear what that conversation was? - Upon my word I cannot recollect to my knowledge what it was.</p>
               <p>Why could not you recollect when you said yourself, as well as the story of the links and the scraper? - I am very dull of apprehension.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never tell Mr. Lord that you saw Rust sign a note in the shop, to the prisoner Disney? - I might say so, or I might not.</p>
               <p>You may or you may not be hanged, but I ask you what you did say; I apprize you that Mr. Lord is here, and I shall call him?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say so, or did you not? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>Now as you had some talk about Mr. Rust's signing a note to the prisoner, upon your oath did you say what that note was given for? - It might be two hundred, it might be three hundred, I cannot possibly say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260168"></xptr> it was three hundred and fifty? - Upon my word I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you, or did you not say so? - I do not know to my knowledge, whether I did, or did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say at the time that it was for three hundred and fifty pounds? - No, Sir, I cannot swear that I did not, nor I cannot swear that I did.</p>
               <p>What sum did you name? - I do not know that I mentioned any sum in particular, I might say two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that to the best of your knowledge and recollection you did not name any sum? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, that you heard Rust say, it was for 350 l. do you believe you did say so? - I might say so; but upon my word I can't say.</p>
               <p>Did you say so, or did you not? - I cannot say whether I did, or did not, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, did you, or did you not tell him that you heard it was 350 l.? - Upon my word, I cannot particularly say, whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Come, try once more, you know what you said yourself, as well as what the prisoner said; did you tell Mr. Lord, that you heard Rust say that it was for 350 l. did you say so? - I do not know upon my word.</p>
               <p>Did you you tell Mr. Lord when the note was signed? - I told him it was signed in February; but for what sum I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>February, in what year? - It was either in 1783, or 1784.</p>
               <p>When did you go the second time to Mr. Rust? - In January, 1785.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell Mr. Lord, that you knew this note was signed in February 1785; because it was a fortnight after you came back to Mr. Rust's? - I do not know upon my word; but had I known what would have happened since, I should have remembered.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not say that? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is of no use to go further; I think it is impossible that such a young villainous testimony can have any weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will go on with it.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him over and over again, that you knew the time when you saw the note signed; because it was a fortnight after you went to Mr. Rust's the second time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to make an affidavit of it before any magistrate? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>With whom did you live these last three or four weeks? - These three or four weeks past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Aye? - I work for Mr. Rust.</p>
               <p>Have you lived with his family? have you eat at his table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you slept in his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much money have you received from him? - I never received but one guinea of him, and then he paid me for what work I had done.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, for what did you receive that one guinea; come, I know it, and I shall state it if you do not, and I will make you state it too; what did you receive that one guinea for? - Because Mr. Disney was taken.</p>
               <p>At the time you have stated that you saw Mr. Disney; did, or did not Mr. Rust know that you was going to see him? - I do not know that he did know it.</p>
               <p>You mean to state that answer? - I do.</p>
               <p>Where was he taken? - He was taken in a court in Church-lane, Rosemary-lane, at his sister's.</p>
               <p>Who shewed the officer where to find him? - I shewed the officer.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you go to him by the desire of Mr. Rust? - I told Mr. Rust so far as this, that I knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him that you was with him frequently? - Since he has been taken, I did.</p>
               <p>How often have you held conversation with Mr. Rust about him? - I cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260169"></xptr>Did not Mr. Rust ask you every night whether you had seen Disney? - I did not see Mr. Rust every night, I never was in Mr. Rust's house to board and lodge before Disney was taken, I went backwards and forwards there for work.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you at all these times converse with Rust about Disney? - In fact, I never did go backwards and forwards to Mr. Rust's till Disney was taken, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>With whom did you make the bargain, that you should receive the guinea from Mr. Rust? - I did not make any bargain with him.</p>
               <p>How long before Disney was taken, did Rust promise you the guinea? - It might be a week or ten days before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Now, in that time, how often have you seen him? - I might have seen him three or four times.</p>
               <p>Was it not ten or a dozen times? - It might be ten or a dozen times.</p>
               <p>When was it you told Mr. Rust about the links? - Not till Disney was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Speak out, till some judgment strikes you dumb, you have kept it snug, perhaps you intended to do it yourself, you thought it would be a snug thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Lord present, when Disney told you he wished somebody to prove Mr. Rust's signing? - He never shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Did not he at that time shew you the note, in this way, holding the paper; here is the note of the old rogue's writing, if I could get some person to prove his hand writing; why, you could prove it? - He did not shew me the paper.</p>
               <p>When did you tell the prisoner, you should not like to go before the court? - I cannot say, whether it was before or after; I was not a witness to Mr. Brownrig's prosecution.</p>
               <p>How much money has Rust promised you, in case Mr. Disney should be hanged? - He promised me no money, he only promised me work.</p>
               <p>Have you dined at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. From the time Disney left St. Martin's lane, who did you work with? - I did not work for Mr. Rust then.</p>
               <p>Who did you work with? - I did not work with any body then, I was expecting to get a place.</p>
               <p>Who did you apply to for work? - I spoke to several people, to people that I knew.</p>
               <p>What people; name any one, except Mr. Rust, that you applied to for work, and that person shall be sent to? - I used to go backwards and forwards to Mr. Lord's, after Disney left Saint Martin's-lane, Mr. Disney told me he should speak to Mr. Lord about a place for me.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you that? - After he left Saint Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>How long after? - It might be a week after, I did not get any work from Mr. Rust till Disney was taken, I do not know to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now, that you may not be caught, I will read you what you have said already; you have said, Mr. Rust has paid you a guinea, besides paying you for your work, and that was a week or ten days before the prisoner was taken. Now do you mean to say, that you had done no work for Mr. Rust then? - Yes, Sir, I had worked for him then a little.</p>
               <p>Before that time, before he promised you a guinea, how long was it after he left Saint Martin's-lane before he was taken? - It might be six weeks, or two months, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Now, how long of that time had you worked at Mr. Rust's? - I might have worked for him two or three days, or a week.</p>

               <p>You had better speak the truth? - I said, he promised me a guinea when Disney was taken, I could not say that.</p>
               <p>You have said it, and you may contradict it now? - It was about ten days; because I remember meeting Mr. Rust.</p>
               <p>Court. You may go down, but not out of court.</p>

I told him no, none to my knowledge; he then mentioned it again, that I should tell Mr. Rust, and I made answer and said, I suppose Mr. Rust knows what money you mean, and

               <p>You have had an intimate acquaintance with him? - I was introduced to him four or five years ago, I made an intimate acquaintance with him, I always believed him to be exceedingly honest, sober, diligent and prudent. I have been with him in company several times, when there have been friends met together, he never was persuaded to drink above two glasses of wine; about a month, or some time before he left Mr. Rust, he applied to me for a little money I owned him, and to lend him some more, in consequence of which I did at that time, I did not take security for some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>He came to your house about some hesitation in paying a note of Mr. Rust's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mason? - Frequently, after Disney at my house; two, three, or four days; not less than two, or more than four; as I knew Mason had lived with Rust, I thought he might know something about the affair, I called him up into a room, where there was nobody but him and me; I questioned him if he knew any thing about it, he said yes, I do; I replied, what? he said, I know that in February, 1785, Mr. Disney called Mr. Rust into the shop, says he, will you sign this note, (Mason told me that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260171"></xptr> Disney said so to Mr. Rust) Mr. Rust seemed rather angry, but went to the board, what they called the cutting-board I understood, and signed it. I asked Mason if he knew what the sum was, or how much the note was; he told me he had heard Mr. Rust mention the words 350 l.; I asked him how he knew it was in February, as it was so long since; he told me it was a fortnight or three weeks, or such a time after he came to Mr. Rust's service; the last time, I said, are you sure of that? because if you are sure of it, I will be Disney's friend; he replied, he was sure, and that he would take his oath of it; I told him not to deceive me, for if he was not right, I should be very sorry to be engaged in it; he insisted upon it, that it was; I said, you may deceive me perhaps; but if you are taken before the Magistrate, or before a Court, you will be so cross-examined, that you cannot deceive them; says he, I will take my affidavit of it before any Magistrate, or before any Court in England; I questioned him two or three times on the following days on the same subject, he still persevered in the same words, or very near them, that he would take his affidavit before any Magistrate, or any Court.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Disney left your house, you still saw Mason? - I still saw Mason, and he told me he did not know where Disney was, several times he told me he could get no place, in consequence of having nobody to give him a character, for that Mr. Rust would not, for Mr. Rust had told him in Disney's shop a few days before, that he would be hanged, and that he deserved to be hanged; that was not long after the affair was first known, not long after the warrants were issued, it might be a week since Mr. Disney was apprehended, and before he was apprehended after the warrants were issued, Mr. Rust was at my house many times, and I at his house, and many times he told me that Mason was a villain, a d - n'd rogue, that he would be hanged; he called him by the name of Ned, the usual name he went by; he said, he deserved to be hanged long ago, that he would come to the gallows; this he repeated many times, and I repeated many times: Mr. Rust and I were talking at my house about the affair after Disney was apprehended, I believe it will be a fortnight tomorrow Mr. Rust called on me, and we were talking about Disney; Mr. Rust said, Disney has robbed me of what he cannot give me, for he has told of my cheating the king of his taxes: Rust was collector of the king's taxes, I understood so, that he would not have prosecuted him, if he had not told about that, if he had robbed him of five hundred pounds: Rust told me before Mr. Greenwood and some others, that when Ned (meaning Mason) came back from discovering where Disney was, Mason did offer to come into Mr. Rust's house, that he told him to go away and be hanged like a d - n'd rascal as he was, for he would come to the gallows.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot ask you any thing that the prisoner Disney said to you, consistent with the rules of evidence, but I will ask you this; did you by any means know where Disney was before he was taken? - I did not for some time; but I did know where he was before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You keep an academy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of what sort, pray Sir, how many scholars have you? - Near 130, which I raised in three years from four; I have some ushers. I have known Disney four or five years.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when he served as a journeyman shoemaker to the prosecutor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he an intimate of your's at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>In what line of intimacy at that time? - I was introduced to him at a ball, at a dance I was at with a friend of mine; in consequence of this I saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Did he dress in the style at that time in which he is now, at that time when he was a journeyman shoemaker? - He did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260172"></xptr> and he was introduced to me at a ball; at first, I did not know his business; but I understood afterwards he was a relation of Mr. Rust's; I imagine he might be dressed as he is now; I was first told he was a shoemaker; I thought he was in business for himself; I understood he was a relation of Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>Did your curiosity lead you to enquire what degree of relationship he stood in to Mr. Rust? - No, I did not; I asked him, he told me Mr. Rust was not a gentleman; he continued to dress in the same way; but when I saw him at Mr. Rust's house, I have seen him very dirty.</p>
               <p>When did he make his application to you to borrow some money? - I believe it was in August; I believe it was fifty pounds that he had lent to me; I always understood that he was a man of property, and that he had several hundred pounds of his own; I did not conceive him to be a common journeyman shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Did not you know when the business of the note was first put in agitation? - I did not; I know, when he brought the note to me after Christmas, he was to have paid me back some money I had lent him; in consequence of which, I thought he used me ill, and was rather displeated; I had written a letter to him; I had called at his house, but did not see him; after a few days, I cannot say how long, he called at my house, and there was a young man with him; he says to me, I cannot pay you the money; I am very sorry for it; but here is a deposit, I will put this into your hands as a security; the note was, I believe, for three hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Then, at that time, he was not able to make good his payment to you, and you had requested payment? - It might be about the beginning of February, I told him the note was a great deal above my demand, which then, I believe, was sixty, or between sixty and seventy pounds; I said, I did not want security, that I wanted the money, as I was to pay some; and I should be glad of a part of the money; I lent him money after the first time; I made him up the sum of fifty pounds; I lent him at one time, I believe, twenty-five pounds; I have his note of hand, payable so many days after date; I did not negotiate it; I afterwards had another note for another twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Did he give you a note for twenty pounds? - I had a note for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that this note for three hundred and fifty pounds became due? - In February; this was in February, he and the other person that was with him, which I understood to be White, took up this note; and he told me when this note became due, this note of three hundred and fifty pounds; Mr. Disney then came to me, I believe it was the 17th of February; he said the note was not paid; he said that the note was not paid, that I am sure he said; that in consequence, he had deposited it in the hands of a Mr. Herne, of Paternoster-row, who is an Attorney; I am sure he said that the note was not paid.</p>
               <p>And in consequence of that, you saw Mason after you knew of this young man being pursued by Mr. Rust? - I had that conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Mason that Disney had offered the note to you? - I had told Mr. Rust that Mr. Disney had offered the note to me several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had the note to run when it was offered to you? - It was in the month of February he offered it, to shew me there would be money to pay me soon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mason. Whose buckles are those that you have got on? - Mr. Disney's.</p>
               <p>Did Disney give them to you? - I will swear he gave them to me; it was soon after I went to Mr. Rust's; I asked him two or three times to lend them to me to put in my shoes; he said, I will, after two or three times wearing them; I swear that positively; I used to wear them on a Sunday now and then, before he left Mr. Rust's service.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, did you ever wear these, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260173"></xptr> he was in custody? - Yes, Sir, at the time he was in St. Martin's-lane I wore them.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, Rust did not give these buckles to you? - No, he did not give me the buckles I now have in my shoes, I can swear the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Was any body present? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you went into Mr. Rust's service? - It might be half ay ear or seven months.</p>
               <p>Court. What buckles did Mr. Rust give you? - I do not know that he ever gave me a pair of buckles, I have only got this one pair of buckles, I have no other.</p>
               <p>What buckles did you think the gentleman meant, or was asking you after? - I could not say what buckles he meant.</p>
               <p>What buckles did Rust give you? - He gave me no buckles to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you positively swear that Rust never gave you a pair of buckles in your life, will you swear it? - No, my Lord, he never gave me a pair of buckles. I have one question to ask if you will hear me: Mr. Lord said that I asked Mr. Rust to take me into his house; now I never did ask Mr. Rust that, Mr. Rust sent for me.</p>
               <p>Then what Rust told Lord was not true? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then Rust sent for you? - Yes, I did not apply to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much money did Mr. Rust give you to take the clothes out of pawn? - He gave his apprentice the money; they were Mr. Disney's, I pawned them, Mr. Disney told me to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Then when you took them out of pawn, you carried them to Mr. Disney? - I gave Disney part of the money and some money I got on part of the things he told me to keep.</p>
               <p>How much money did you give him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Whose name did you pawn then in? - In my own name.</p>
               <p>Where did you pawn them? - I pawned some of them by Clerkenwell Church.</p>
               <p>Was this after Disney had left St. Martin's-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when did you tell Mr. Rust that you had pawned them, was it after Disney was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you redeem them? - It was when Mr. Lord came for them.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Lord you had pawned them? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not Lord come from Disney for his clothes after he was taken? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>How much money did Mr. Rust advance to get them out of pawn? - He sent his lad to go with me, and he gave the money to the lad, he gave him a guinea.</p>
               <p>How much of that money have you given Mr. Disney? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you give him one shilling of that guinea? - I did, Sir.</p>
               <p>How much? - I cannot say how much.</p>
               <p>Did you give him one, two, or three shillings? - It might be one, two, or three shillings; it might be three, four, or five shillings, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Lord. At the same time that Rust was asking me about Mason, he was secreted in his house; Disney appeared to me in a worse situation than I had observed him, he said his clothes were pawned; in consequence of this I went to No. 62, in Clement's-lane, I enquired of Mr. Rust if he knew where Mason was; he said no, that he had seen him a day or two before, and that he might see him in a day or two again; and if he did, he would ask him for these things; in a day or two after Rust came to my house, and brought me the duplicate of these things; he said he had met Mason, or met with Mason, and that Mason had given him these duplicates. I said it was not in my power to know where they were pawned, Rust left them with me, then I called upon him in the evening with a friend, to know if he had enquired of Mason for a direction where these things were pawned, he desired me to leave the duplicates, in consequence of that, Mr. Rust sent the things to me the next day.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260174"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. How much does that young man owe you now? - I should suppose near thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Can you re collect nearly about what time it was that Rust sent you the prisoner's clothes? - It was after the prisoner was taken up, of course it was not above a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Court to Mason. Who was it that Rust sent with you to redeem the clothes? -

               <p>Look at that? - There is something, I think, resembling it, but to say positively I will not.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge you have little or great of his hand-writing, do you believe that is his hand-writing? - I cannot say; but if a note came to me signed like this, for any small sum, I should not have rejected it.</p>
               <p>From looking at such a note should you have thought it a forgery? - No, Sir, not if it had come from any body I knew.</p>

               <p>He was a collector of the King's tax, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From your knowledge of his writing do you believe and do you think that is his hand-writing; would you take that as his receipt for land-tax? - It is very much like it.</p>
               <p>Is it so much like it as it would have passed upon you as his hand-writing? - Oh, yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No, Sir, I should have had no doubt about it, it would have passed with me. I came by the shop one day, and Mr. Rust called me into his shop, it was before Disney was taken; the very next day after this was mentioned, I went in to enquire of Mr. Rust after Disney, and he said, that he had forged so and so for 350 l. I said, dear me, could it be so? says I, if I knew where he was, I would send him fifty miles further from you sooner than you should take him; that is really truth, for I could not think his story was true; says he, he has certainly done so. Then he was taken up; I came by the door, and he caught me by the hand and pulled me up the steps, he said he certainly was a bad fellow, for he had several receipts of his that he had forged upon him for different things, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260175"></xptr> he would hang him if he had twenty necks.</p>

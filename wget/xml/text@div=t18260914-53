Within the last three or four months; I did not know Dunn ever lived at Lambeth till I received information; I entered Smith's room a moment after Clements - it was about one o'clock in the day - he did not ask if she knew Dunn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she give up her keys, and say "You will find the things Dunn has given me, in these drawers? A. Yes: Clements said "You had better be candid for we have information;" and she said every thing her Henry had brought were in the drawers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Sunday, the 30th of July, I took Dunn into custody, and went the same day to Brook-street, West-square, Lambeth; I got into the house by sending somebody with beer; Smith let us in, and when I entered the parlour I told her Henry was in custody, and said "You know who I mean. Henry Dunn;" she said "Good God, what is it?" I said "I hold a warrant to search the house, and expect you will be very candid in your answers to me;" she said she had received many presents from Henry at different times; I asked where they were - she pointed to the drawers, and said "Some of them are made up in those drawers," and some she had pawned, the duplicates of which were in the drawers - that some of those pledged, were as she had received them from him, and some were made up; she then gave me the keys - I unlocked the drawers in Mr. Cross's presence, and found a quantity of goods - silk and muslin dresses, silk gloves, and a quantity of duplicates - the silk and muslin dresses were made up - some gloves were new and some worn - Mr. Cross claimed them; we went up stairs to search a bed-room with her, and there found some of the articles - she said she had received them all from Henry; I took White, the servant, into custody. I was present at an interview between Mr. Cross and Dunn, at Marlborough-street - it was not in the Magistrates' presence - I believe Mr. Cross had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>MR. CROSS. I had not seen Dunn since his apprehension, till this interview, at which Clements was present - it was on the Monday; I held out no threat or promise of mercy to him, from first to last.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say to him "You had better be candid, for I always treat people as they treat me? A. Certainly not - nothing like it; I never said I should have his parents in the country, or his relations, taken up; I said I was going to send an officer there, to see if there was any property, as I had found some letters.</p>

            . I held out neither threat or promise to him - I cannot state the conversation between Mr. Cross and him at Marlborough-street, but I saw him again in prison on the 3d of August, in consequence of finding some lettres - Mr. Cross was with me; I said "Dunn, now have you any thing to say to Mr. Cross, for we find you have been sending presents to Hull, and Mr. Cross or I must go down to Hull;" he burst into tears and said,"For God's sake do not go there, to bring my relations into disgrace, for they are respectable - let it all fall on my shoulders;" I said "Then what have you sent?" he said he had sent a piece of linen to Hull, to be made into shirts, which were sent back, and he afterwards sent his two sisters a shawl each, and (addressing himself to Mr. Cross, said) "It was only two of those marked in your shop at 16s. each and it was all your property." He said that the time he had given him to go into the country for his health, he had passed with Smith; that he frequently felt great remorse for what he had done, but whenever he offered to retract, she said to him "I will serve you as I did young Shepherd." I told him what had been found at Smith's - he said "It is all yours;" he was in great distress of mind; he said two of the parcels had gone from the shop in a peculiar way - that he had packed them up in the usual way, directed them to Mrs. Smith, and sent them out by their own porter to Mrs. Smith, in the way of trade; he said he wanted to get out of the country. I afterwards went to Mrs. Bradley of Holborn, and got from her a white robe dress and a piece of silk.</p>
               <p>Q. He acknowledged that the things found at Smith's came through him? A. Yes; Mr. Cross described them to him; Mr. Cross said "There was some cloth too?" he said "Yes, it is yours, and the silks which are pawned, are all yours." Mr. Cross mentioned some India crape shawls, ladies' collars, silks, and printed cotton - he said"They are all yours;" Mr. Cross mentioned all the property found at Smith's, and he said they are all yours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Will you swear that Mr. Cross enumerated every article? A. Yes, this conversation was in the New Prison, after he was committed for re-examination. We went (in consequence of two letters found in his box) to learn what had been sent to Hull; nothing was said about his friends being prosecated or taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You advised Smith to be candid? A. Yes - Dunn said he had sent the things to Smith, and carried some himself; we found no whole piece of goods - the silks were mostly made into dresses - there were some silk handkerchiefs; I remember nothing being said about a warrant being sent to Hull - we were to go to learn what had been received - not to apprehend any one.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever hear of any intention of prosecuting his relations? A. Certainly not. I produce the silk found at Bradley's, and the goods found at Smith's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. From whom did you yourself receive her white dress? A.

The prisoner Smith lodged with me a year and a half, till a fortnight before the 24th of June; Dunn came there very often, principally on Sundays, and for a month he was constantly with her; they co-habited together. Smith sent me to pledge several things for her - she always said Dunn had the principal management of a linen-draper's shop; I have heard him say he was always obliged to be at home before eleven o'clock, or he could not get in; and I once remember his coming back after leaving; he said the gates were fastened, and the porter would not let him in; Smith was present when he said so; Smith told me he was a great friend to her, and brought her different kind of things, and I have seen them - there were silks, stockings, lace, caps, handkerchiefs, muslin for dresses, and a great many shawls - these things came very frequently; she had shewn them to me, and spoken of them; I took a veil in myself; she said they came from her master - her Henry; she once shewed me a letter, and particularly wished Mr. Rowland to take down the direction of it, and the post-mark, but he could not make it out - she said it came from Dunn's father.</p>

I was servant to the prisoner Smith, for about six weeks; I went to her in May, and left in June; Dunn used to come and see her on Sundays; I remember when I had been there eight days, on a Wednesday, about six o'clock in the afternoon, he brought some bed-furniture - he came in through the shop up into the sitting-room, and threw them down on the table; I saw two or three pieces of printed cotton; he said he had brought them for her to choose; she seemed very much pleased - he cut off a piece to make a sofa cover; he staid a short time, and left the sofa cover behind - whether he left any more, I cannot tell - he took some away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When was this? A. In May; this was in Waterloo-road, over in Surry.</p>

            . I have known Smith four years; I lived in the same house with her three years ago, and visited her at times; I saw Dunn and her together about a month before he was apprehended, at Mrs. Rowland's, in Waterloo-road - I called there, and found them together; Dunn said he was going into Yorkshire to see his friends, but was ill, and could not go; after that Smith produced a letter to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. BUTLER, clerk to Mr. Harmer, solicitor tor the prosecution, here proved the service of a notice on the prisoner to produce the letter in question. (notice read.)</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH MILLS. She asked me to read the letter, as she could not make part of it out - I read it to her aloud; it was signed, "Your affectionate father, Dunn," and directed to Mr. Dunn, and stated that he had sent him 3l., which was all he could send at present, but he would send more in a short time; after I had read it, she said she wanted to know where Henry's friends lived, and asked if I could make out the post-mark; I said, it was faint, and could not; she shewed me a piece of Esterhasey silk once, and said it was about fifteen yards, and was to make a dress and bonnet; I knew she meant Dunn when she spoke of Henry - she said he was very kind to her, and a very good friend, and that he was in the linen drapery line - a sort of foreman at a shop; I often heard her say he could get the things at the wholesale price, and would pay for them when he got his quarter's salary; she once shewed me two or three pairs of gloves.</p>
               <p>MARIA WHITE. I live in Brook-street, West-square. Lambeth, I lived servant to Smith for five weeks, up to the time she was taken, which was in July. On a Tuesday, about a fortnight before she was apprehended, I remember a parcel coming once; she said it came from Mr. Dunn; I saw it opened, it contained two pieces of silk, some gloves, and a worked collar; I think the silk was like the brown silk produced; I was taken into custody myself, and when in Pancras watch-house, she told me she had received the property from Mr. Dunn, and did not know it was stolen; I have since been to see her in Newgate; Mrs. Bonny was present there once or twice; she said, "Bonny, you have a duplicate of nine of a piece of silk, don't you mention it to any body, for if you do it will sell me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ago was this? A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. CROSS, (examining the brown silk found at Mrs. Bradley's.) This is ours - I know it well by the selvage; I will not swear that I missed this particular piece, but I know it to be ours - it cost me 4s. 6d. a yard - it cost 54s.; the muslin dress is worth 30s., and is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. By what marks do you swear to the silk? A. By the selvage, and its appearance altogether - we had a piece of about forty yards of it - we only had one piece of this colour - it is not a common colour, and I do not believe it can be matched exactly - here are two blue cords in the selvage; Dunn told me some of my silk was at Bradley's; we allow shopmen to buy things at the wholesale price, but they should take them into the counting-house, and be debited for them by the clerk; the only charge in the books to him, is 19s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Is it not very difficult to get an exact colour, except goods are died at the same time? A. Very; I owed him the current quarter's wages; he had 45l. a year, with board and lodging - it was increased from 35l.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Dickers. On the 6th of March, the prisoner, Smith, pawned a remnant of silk for 33s., in the name of Sarah Smith; on the 11th of March, she pawned a piece of silk for 28s., in her own name, and on the 29th of May, a coat for 29s.; on the 9th of May she pawned two waistcoats and two shirts, for 21s. 6d., the shirts are marked E.H.W.; on the 6th of June she pawned a shawl, on the 15th another; on the 6th of April, two petticoats, and a remnant of linen, and some silk-hose.</p>
               <p>Several other pawnbrokers were in attendance with property, but the Learned Counsel declined examining them.</p>
               <p>Mr. CROSS. I have seen all these goods in possession of the various pawnbrokers, and believe the whole to be ours - I can identify the greater part of them; the pieces of brown silk, containing fourteen yards, I am certain is ours - it is not quite a whole piece; the piece produced by Mrs. Bradley, is thirteen yards, and cost me 4s. 6d. a yard; I have brought a piece from the shop exactly corresponding with the fourteen yards produced by the pawnbroker; I cannot identify the calico, but have no doubt of any of the articles - I know the muslin dresses; it is impossible to keep an account of my stock; the total value of the property found, is 120 or 130l.; Dunn said he had taken a remnant of about five yards of cloth from my shop, and had it made into a coat, two waistcoats, and cloth for a pair of trousers, which Smith had pawned - he described it as a length about 12s. a yard; he said this in the New Prison; I named to him the articles found as well as I could; I named the embroidered collar, a crape handkerchief, and a quantity of gloves. I gave him leave of absence about the middle of May, to go to Yorkshire, to see his friends; he told me, in prison, that he had not been, but was over the water, in Brook-street, all the time, and when he was out of money, he wrote to his friends, and a letter came containing money which she opened, and took out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When did the silk, found at Bradley's, come into your possession? A. I really cannot say, I think about three months from the time he was taken, about May or June; I told him a quantity of silk had been found; he said he knew she had silks - that some she had by her, and some were pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt but these were taken at different times? A. It is impossible for me to say - several might be taken at once, but I think all could not be taken together - I should not have missed them if they had.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep silks in pieces or cut? A. They would be pieces in our house; the quantities produced are such as would make a dress - it is rather more than the usual quantity; this muslin-robe was taken, worked as it is now - I know it by the pattern, and being soiled; I will not swear this silk has not been sold - we sold some of it. I recollect remarking that it was gone very quick, and I thought it could not have been sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you sell it to either of the prisoners? A. Never; the whole quantity of goods produced, I think, could not all be taken at once.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You have alluded to some conversation you had with Dunn? A. Yes, in Clerkenwell-prison; I told him I was going to Bradley's, as I was informed there was silk there; he said there was silk, and a white robedress - that some silks were made up and pawned, but no doubt she had some not made up; the two lengths of brown silks produced are from different pieces.</p>

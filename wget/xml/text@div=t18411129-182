                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Oxendon-street, the house be<lb></lb>longs to Mary Ann Lewis, and the furniture is hers. On the 8th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, in the evening, the two prisoners came there—they did not say any thing on coming in, but walked up stairs into the first floor front room—they remained there about an hour, and went away about half-past eight —Davis came down stairs first, and Smith came after her—when he got to the foot of the stairs he dropped a piece of coin—he looked down, and Davis went out of the door—Smith then walked along, looking down, and when he got to the door, he said, "If my lady calls here to-morrow even<lb></lb>ing, will you allow her to wait?"—I said, "What time?"—he said,</p>

The prisoners came there together on the 22nd of October, and in consequence of what passed at that house I sent to No. 16, Oxendon-street, and Elizabeth Thomas came—she saw the policeman there, and challenged them as being the parties who had been at her house, and they were taken into custody.</p>

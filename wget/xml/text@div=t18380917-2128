                  </hi>. I live in Piccadilly, and am an upholsterer. Alexander Wilkie, junior, was my foreman—last year I ordered 235 yards of gimp, of Mr. Pratt, of a particular pattern—I had used 173 yards of it,</p>

               <p>and have 19 yards left—43 yards are deficient—the 192 yards came into possession of the prisoner—whether the other did or not I do not know—the account came in about December, for 235 yards—all I ordered ought to come into possession of the prisoner—he accounted only for 173 yards, and 19 are left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Thomas Pratt, of Great Pul<lb></lb>teney-street, a manufacturer of gimp. We made 235 yards for Mr. Hughes—I caused it to be delivered by my errand-boys, at different times, on Mr. Hughes's premises—the name of one of the boys is James Clifton, he is not here—James Smart made the whole of it, as a journeyman—in con<lb></lb>sequence of the deficiency between my accounts and Mr. Hughes's, and having seen a sample of the same gimp hanging up at Mrs. Madden's, a marine-store dealer, I sent Smart to see if it was his work, he said it was—I directed him to go and buy some, and inquire if he could have more, with a view to ascertain what had become of the missing quantity—it was sent in parcels of 90, 71, 26, 43, and lastly, 5 yards—I have no proof that it got to the hands of the master, but by its being traced to the foreman.</p>

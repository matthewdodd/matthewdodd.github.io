            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of May in the afternoon were you on the river. - A. I was about five o'clock, I was in Blackwall Reach on the Kent side opposite of Black-wall. There were two Indiamen one of the name of Severn, nigh <placeName id="t18110529-82-crimeloc476">Blackwell Dock</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18110529-82-crimeloc476" type="placeName" value="Blackwell Dock"></interp>

He was on the Middlesex side, I saw him row to the stern of a lighter which laid aground on the point, he stopped there and he was out of my sight for a few minutes, I got down to him and just as I got there he had in his hand a small line apparently having something under water, he instantly dropped that line into the water upon seeing me, I had come round the craft, then I got into his boat, I found in that a piece of coire rope that is manufactured in the East Indies, and another piece weighing forty-two pounds. I then desired one of my men to put the boat hook down which they did immediately and with the boat hook they brought up a piece of buoy rope, weighing an hundred and a half, and another piece of rope, it appeared a topsail halliard, eighty four pounds, they were fast together and a small piece of line to the buoy rope, which appeared to me to be the piece of line that the prisoner dropped, I directed them to fish again, the prisoner said there was no more, we had the whole of them. This is the coir rope it will not sink. Afterwards I went on board the Severn, I found she was an indiaman. This tally was picked up in the boat and given to me in the prisoner's presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This man was in the river he had got a drag. - A. Yes, he said while he was in the boat he picked up this with the drag but this coire rope will not sink it was in his boat.</p>
               <p>LUTEN. I was in the boat with Mr. Evans, I have heard what he has said and the account he has given is correct, after we had fished them up the prisoner took a piece of canvas off one of the ropes we took up threw it down in the boat and put his foot on it, I desired him to lift his foot up and let me see what it was, he did, I picked it up and gave it to Mr. Evans, it is called a tally.</p>
               <p>EVANS. This is the forty-two pound rope and this is the buoy rope, this is the top sail halliard, and this is the small line attached to it, that is what he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of all these. - A. Five pound.</p>

The prisoner rode past my house on 1st Dec., in the middle of the day, and I hallooed out to him, and asked him if that horse was for sale; he said, "Yes," and that he had been to Russell Street, Bermondsey, with her, but she was not large enough—he said that he had come from Reading, that his father had been working the mare for it's keep, that it belonged to a poor man, and he was going to take it home, and he told him not to take it home, as he had got no work for it to do—I said, "If that horse will draw, I will try to buy it of you; what do you want for it?"—he said, "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

The next morning, between seven and eight, my servant awoke me, and inquired whether I had removed the portfolio? I said, no, and told him to inquire of the waiter, and the chamber-maid. The portfolio was not to be found by that inquiry. It was found afterwards, but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you - A. Ever since last Christmas. When I left the Indies he came to England with me.</p>
               <p>MRS. SMITH. My husband is a hair-dresser. The prisoner came to our house on Monday week. I was going to get this man to a charity-school, to learn him to read. I went with him; and as I was going with him, he took a note out of his pocket. He asked me if it was one pound? I said, no, it was a ten pound note; he folded it up. He said he had it of his master to buy some things: we returned to our house. He came again, about half after eight o'clock in the evening; he brought a portfolio, requesting it to be taken care of until the morning. We took care of it, not having any suspicion. The next morning, when I had heard what had happened, I delivered it into Mr. Beretto's hands.</p>
               <p>MARGRET SMITH. I received the portfolio of the prisoner: I locked it up. He desired me to take care of it. It is the same portfolio that my mother delivered into Mr. Beretto's hands.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - . I am a waiter at the hotel. On Monday week, as I was standing at the door, I saw the prisoner come out of the house; he had a bundle under his arm, it appeared to me to be like a book.</p>

            . I received the portfolio of the prosecutor. I went to the prisoner's lodging; I found a pocket-book, containing two 10 l. notes, and two 5 l. notes. The pocket-book was concealed in the prisoner's room, among some rubbish. There was fifty pound lost; I found thirty pound, in notes, in the pocket-book, and some silver.</p>

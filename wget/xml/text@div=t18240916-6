The prisoner came to lodge with us last winter, and continued till the 18th of August, when in consequence of suspicion I went to my cupboard to unlock a small tea chest, and found it broken open - there had been 8 sovereigns and a half in one paper there; 5 of the sovereigns were gone. I had seen that paper safe two days before; I kept the key myself. The cupboard is in the room down stairs, where we sleep - the prisoner had his meals there. I missed five or six papers of silver from the same chest - I had eight papers, each containing 1 l. in silver. The prisoner had often seen me go to the chest and put money there. He went out that morning, and I expected him back, till Anderson gave me information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not your street door unlocked several nights - A. Yes, for him and other lodgers to come in, but I lay close to the door, and nobody could come in without my hearing them. They must move a table to get to the cupboard.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 18th of August I had occasion to look for the prisoner - I met him in Field-lane, and told him I wanted him respecting the robbery at Odell's; he said he knew nothing about it. I asked what he had done with the sovereigns he had been shewing at the Bull public-house at Highgate, that morning - he said he had no sovereigns, and knew nothing about any. I and Kirby took him into a public-house, and searched him after his making great resistance, and found in his pocket two sovereigns, three half-crowns, four shillings, and 6 1/4 d. in copper. I said he had better pull out what he had got, as I was determined to see; he then pulled out a sovereign, and one half-crown (I cannot say whether he produced any shillings;) he declared it was all he had - this was before I searched him; I then found one more sovereign and the silver I have mentioned. He said he would not be taken, nor give any account how he got the money. I was obliged to go to the office for assistance before I could take him along.</p>

               <p>"Now I will quit your premises;" (I had heard him the night before ask my wife for 1 s., and say that he had not a farthing in the world) - he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out about 12 s., and said it was not for want of money that he had pressed me for his wages, for he had plenty of money. He was drunk both on Tuesday and Wednesday. He had been about a month with me, at 15 s. a-week - I paid him on Saturday night; he only worked one day that week.</p>

            . I live at the Bull at Highgate, as servant - our house is ten minutes walk from Odell's. On Wednesday, the 18th of August, about half-past 6 o'clock in the morning the prisoner came in and had a pint of beer, and paid me in halfpence - he called for half a pint of rum, and threw a sovereign on the table; I took it up stairs to my master for change; I came down, and gave him 19 s.: after that he had a pot of beer. I saw two more sovereigns in his hand. He was not very sober when he came in.</p>

The door was left open from twelve to one o'clock frequently, for the lodgers, and she told Doctor Owen, the Magistrate that she could not tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160006"></xptr>whether it was me or not; that she did not know how much silver there was, not having seen the box since the week before.</p>
               <p>MRS. ODELL, re-examined. I did not - I said I had lost five sovereigns out of one paper, and 4 l. or 5 l. worth of silver. All the lodgers were at home but him on Tuesday evening - I heard him come in in the night, but do not know the time. I go out in the morning with milk, and left my little girl in the room; he breakfasted with me that morning - I left him in the room and returned in about two minutes, then went out with my milk, and thought he was gone, as I did not see him after I left him in the room.</p>

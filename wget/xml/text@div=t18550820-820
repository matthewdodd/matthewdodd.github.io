                  </hi>. I am a boiler maker, in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway; I live at Stratford. The prisoner was in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway, as a boiler maker's assistant—he worked in the same department as I did—on 7th July I watched him in the afternoon—I followed him out of the workshop, and gave him into custody to Moon—he was taken into a public house yard, and there searched—several pieces of copper and brass were found on him, a part of which I can identify—this piece of copper corresponds with these, two pieces, which came from the Company's works—it has been broken off—the whole piece was taken from the inside of a fire box—it was taken out, for the men to repair it—I broke it into three pieces, and left them near where the prisoner was at work—I missed this middle piece—the value of it is about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this, and some more articles, were found on the prisoner—here is one which I can recognize—these others, I have no doubt, belong to the Company—the prisoner had not the least right to take them.</p>

               <p>This, and this other, which is a brass nut—these were not thrown aside as old metal—they were worked there—the prisoner was assistant to a boiler maker, Atkinson—I do not know whether they worked at home—we took no refreshment at the public house, that I know of—the prisoner had received his wages—there had not been a fire at Stratford works—there bad been one in the town, a timber yard, or something of that kind—I do not know that the men went to look at it—I did not go myself—I knew nothing of it—I put this copper close to the engine where the prisoner was at work with the other man, who is a boiler maker—the prisoner was not a stoker; he was assistant to an engineer.</p>

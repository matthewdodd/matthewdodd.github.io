                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Walker, of Portland-place South, Clapham-road, a surveyor—he is not engaged at present; he is very ill with rheumatism—on 14th November he was out, and had arranged to meet me by the Ship at Charing-cross, at 11 o'clock at night—I was passing along the Westminster-road at a few minutes before 12 o'clock; but previous to meeting the prisoner I was pushed down, which caused my nose to bleed—the prisoner came up and spoke to me, and I asked him the way to the Elephant and Castle—he took me up the Black friars-road—we went into some wine vaults there, and had half a quartern of gin and hot water, which I paid for—I gave a shilling, and received 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210095"></xptr>
               <p>had nothing, to my knowledge—we came out together, and he took me round a turning towards York-road; I think it is Stamford-street, when he struck me on my face, snatched at my chain, broke it and ran away—it was not gold, it was metal—I called, "Stop thief!" chased him till he was stopped, and gave him in custody—this chain and locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you living with your husband at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in apartments—I was in the habit of meeting him very often at night, at any part where he might be—we have only lived eight or nine weeks at Clapham—we lived at Brixton before that—we have also lived at Camber well, and on this side of the water—I left home at a quarter-fast 8, or a quarter to 9—I did not ride any part of the way—the gentleman came up to me in Kennington-road about 9—he was a stranger to me—he spoke to me, and I spoke to him—I only went into two public-houses with him—I went twice into the first public-house, but that only makes two public-houses—I did not receive half a sovereign from the gentlemen in any one of them, nor ten shillings—I had not half ten shillings on me that night at all—I do not know the sign of the public-house into which I went with the gentleman—I do not know whether the landlord is here—the gentleman did not say in one public-house, "See what I have given you;" nor did I say, "It is a sixpence;" nor did he say, "No, look again, it is a half-sovereign"—I positively deny that statement altogether—it was later than 11 o'clock when I saw this youth. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>)—I had no watch, but I had a locket, with a Maltese cross attached to it—I tell the time as near as I can remember—I was not so far stupefied by the gin and water but that I knew what I was doing—when I asked the prisoner the way, I was by the Bethlehem Hospital, near the public-house—I do not know the sign of it; but it is at the top of St. George's-road—Bethlehem Hospital is on the other side—I did not observe any gardens; it was near a brick-wall—I do not know that where I was at St. George's-road, I was very near the Elephant and Castle—I did not know my way at all up that road—I had not been so far up—I often go out to meet my husband at night—when I went out with him, or to meet him, I went down the Kennington-road, and turned towards Westminster-bridge; but the prisoner took me into the York-road—I knew what I was speaking about, but I did not know my way—I did not know where Blackfriars-road was, though it is a year and nine months since I first, went to Brixton—I did not know the other end of the York-road, or that it ran into the Blackfriars-road—the prisoner took me that way, and up Stamford-street—I did not know that it was not the York-road all the way along—I believe the public-house was in Blackfriars-road—I was not struck by the gentleman, I was pushed down by him, because he was taking improper liberties with me, which he ought not to have done, and I resisted it—I did not strike him at all—I had no latch-key in my hand—I went into one public-house with the prisoner—we did not remain more than five minutes—I drank the gin and water and went out again—I believe the prisoner to be the same young man, but he is so differently dressed, I can hardly tell him again—I think it is the same face—I received no money from the gentleman or from the prisoner—I have been married five years—I do not know where Tooley-street is, or Duke-street, London-bridge—I know the railway terminus, but never noticed a street which runs by the side—I never went by the name of "Chatham <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>"—no associate of mine is called <hi rend="italic">"Exhibition Polly</hi>," who got into trouble: I do not know what you are speaking of—I do not know</p>

"Police!" and saw the prisoner running—he stopped, walked by me, and then ran again—the pro<lb></lb>secutrix came up bleeding from the side of her face and her mouth—I ran up to the prisoner, and he was stopped by two or three persons—the pro<lb></lb>secutrix came up, but said she could not recognise him—I said, "If you cannot, I can" and took him by the neck—he then dropped a locket and chain into the policeman's hand—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

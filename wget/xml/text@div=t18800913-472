I am a Congregational minister at Acton—on 6th July Miss Smith handed me a coin in the form of a half-sovereign; it seemed light, and I showed it to Mr. Chamberlain, and after<lb></lb>wards to Mr. Jennings—I told the prisoner it was bad; I did not hand it to him, but he took it out of my hand, and rang it on the ground; it sounded flat and dead—he then took it up, held it in his left hand, and passed it to hit right, then to his left again, and took out his handkerchief, held it over hit left hand for a moment, then held it to his mouth, and Mr. Jennings said "He has swallowed it"—we watched him till a constable came—he was given in custody.</p>

I am a laundryman, of Park Road, Acton—on 6th July Mr. Adeney called my attention to a half-sovereign which was in his hand, but he did not give it to me—it looked bad—the prisoner took, it from him, and rang it on the floor twice; it sounded bad; he then took it up, passed it from one hand to the other, took out his handkerchief and attempted to blow his nose, and in so doing he seemed to put something to his mouth, and when he took the handkerchief away he seemed to have something in his mouth—I saw his mouth and throat move, and he swallowed something—he was asked for it, and made no answer—I did not see it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head of the security department of the National Provincial Bank of England—I have been there 26 years—I was at this bazaar at Acton on 26th July—Mr. Ardeney showed me coin, which I took in my hand, and from its exceeding lightness I have no doubt it was bad—I returned it to Mr. Adeney, and saw him give it to the prisoner, who struck it on the ground twice—I believe no one else had it in their hand—from the sound it was undoubtedly bad—it was the worst I ever heard—I did not see the prisoner put his hand to his mouth—my back was turned.</p>

                  </hi>. Two of the tests of a bad half-sovereign are lightness and a flatness in ringing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say on the last occasion "No one but an expert could detect it"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a light half-sovereign, but it is good—the best test is to bend it—a bad one will double up and it will not rebound—a good one if cracked would not rise at all, and would give a flat heavy sound.</p>

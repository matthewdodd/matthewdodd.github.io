On the night of the 22d of October I was at home - Lawrence and I locked up the house together; the iron door leading to the garden was locked - it opens into a kind of hall; there is a door leading from the hall to the dining-room, and another door leading to an inner hall - I saw the hall-door next morning - it was open; the lock had been picked - that is the outer-door of the house; I went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, at the same time as my fellow-servant, and about one o'clock in the morning I was disturbed, and heard a noise in the house - I alarmed Lawrence, who slept at the back of the house; he got up and got out of window - I went into his room, and assisted him in lowering himself down from the window with a gun, by a cord; I looked out of window, and saw a man run across the lawn - it was a moonlight night; my mistress occupies the house.</p>

            . I am a servant to Sarah Ann<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040024"></xptr>Mountain. On the night of the 22d of October, I fastened up the house and the door leading to the garden. Slater alarmed me about one o'clock in the morning; I got out of bed, went to the bed-room door, and heard a knocking, as if persons were endeavouring to break into the lower rooms of the house - I partly dressed myself, took a cord from my box, and lowered myself down with a gun; when I got to the garden I ran to the corner of the house, and saw four men come from within the stone hall - I told them if they did not stop I would blow their brains out; they did not attempt to stop - I pulled the trigger of the gun, but it did not go off; I pursued and overtook one of the men, hit him with the barrel of the gun, and knocked him down into the shrubbery - he got away; I pursued the other three - they jumped over an inner-fence, about four feet high; I pursued and hit one of them with the barrel of the gun - the other two ran to the front-gate; one ran against the bell-wire and broke it, and in getting over the front-gate I hit one with the barrel of the gun - he made his escape; I broke the barrel from the gun - I took up the barrel of the gun, and in striking the prisoner with it, as he was getting over the gate, I broke his arm and knocked him off the gate; he ran under a fir-tree, and exclaimed,"I will give myself up, I think you have broken my arm"- I said, "If you don't stop I will blow your brains out;" another one then got over the gate - a waggoner was coming by; I called him to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured - I found his arm was broken; on searching the premises we found two hats, a silk-handkerchief, and a chisel - the lock of the outer-door of the hall had been picked, and the inner-door had been attempted and the pannel broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You have no doubt of the prisoner being the man you struck? A. Not the least - I was agitated; I attempted to fire my gun when I found they would not stop - I saw four men quite distinctly; they only turned one corner in the course of the pursuit, and were not out of my sight; I was as close to them as a man could be - quite close to them; I had overtaken one of them before they got to the corner - I stopped to fire the gun before I turned the corner, and got up to the corner at the same moment as the last man of the four; I could see round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner getting over a gate, and on your breaking his arm he said he would give himself up? A. Yes - all the four men were dressed in dark clothes - I saw one of their faces, and I saw the prisoner's face also.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is your mistress' house in the parish of Friern, Barnet? A. Yes - her name is Sarah Ann Mountain; she is a widow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening before the robbery I went with a friend to Barnet to get a situation; on my return home I was partly intoxicated - I heard a call of Stop! several times; I was getting over the gate when I was struck with a gun, and gave myself up immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 12, Maxey-road, Plumstead—on 6th November, about 11 o'clock, I was going home with my wife—we heard some angry words near the King's Arms, and saw the prisoner there disputing with Mr. Campbell, who he said owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw him knock Campbell down, and before he had time to get properly on his feet he knocked him down again—I went up to Campbell and asked him whether he' was hurt—he told me his leg was broken—I went to the Arsenal for a stretcher, and they went to the police-court—the prisoner called on me a week afterwards, and said that he would pay for my loss of time if I would speak on his behalf.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the deceased in a fighting attitude? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there were only four people there when I went up, they are here—the language was rather foul—I could not hear what Campbell said, but I heard the prisoner use foul language, and tell him to get up again, and if he did not pay him the money he would get it out of his body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Arsenal, and live at Plumstead—on 6th November I met the deceased in the Ordnance Arms, and as we went home we went into the Queen's Arms—he was called out by some one—he went out, and I remained inside till my name was called—when I got to the door, the prisoner was in the act of taking off his coat—he said, "You b----you owe me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if I cannot get the money out of you I will take it out of your body, "and he knocked Campbell down with his foot—I went up to the prisoner and said, "If the man owes you money there is a proper way to get it, and not that"—he told me to mind my own business—I sent for a policeman, and as Campbell was getting up the prisoner knocked him down again—he could not get up, and I remained till a stretcher was brought and he was carried away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been with Campbell some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was perfectly sober—he had had something to drink; I saw him take part of a glass of ale at the Ordnance Arms—he and I were there about ten minutes—I had a glass of whisky there—he was there four or five minutes before my name was called out—the deceased did not call the prisoner a d—d rogue in my hearing—I was examined before the Magistrate—two witnesses were called on behalf of the prisoner—I did not hear the deceased use strong language towards the prisoner—the deceased was knocked down twice after I went out, but he never held up his hands to defend himself—he was a healthy man and taller than the prisoner—I know the prisoner by sight only.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—about 11 o'clock on 6th November I was passing along the road opposite the Queen's Arms, and saw three men and a woman outside—the prisoner was one, and the deceased another—they were having high words—just before I got to the Queen's Arms—I saw one of the three men fall down or knocked down—he had been there some time, and two men and a woman stood over him—they went away some distance—the other man picked him up and crossed over—Mr. Campbell was going into the Queen's Arms, and</p>

               <p>met Mr. Hay coming out—Mr. Hay said, "Halloa, what is the matter"—he said, "That vagabond has done this, "turning round and pointing to the prisoner, who made no answer then, but they all got out into the road—the prisoner said, "I am surprised at you, Mr. Hay, keeping company with such a man as Campbell, for he is both a rogue, a swindler, and a vagabond; I will have satisfaction out of him, "and he pulled his coat off, and commenced to fight with Campbell, and knocked him down again—Campbell did not strike him at all; he got up and was knocked down a third time by the prisoner—I saw him taken away on a stretcher.</p>

I have locked one of my sons up, and it would take but d—d little time to lock you up"—Godden called him a d—d rascal, and Mr. Campbell threw his fist out to strike him—I was not near enough to see whether he did, and Godden up with his fist and knocked Campbell down—he got up and showed fight, and Godden knocked him down again—I went to him and said, "Come, get up, "and helped him up—Godden pulled off his coat and showed fight—he knocked Campbell down again, a mob collected, and I was pushed out—I have seen the witness Hay—he was not in sight at the commencement of the matter—he came in among the rest of the crowd—I did not see him before—I did not see him come up—I heard Campbell's voice when he squared his fists, but could not hear his words—they were not very loud.</p>

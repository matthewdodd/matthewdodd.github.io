                  </hi>. I am in the service of Enoch Jones, a linen-draper, in Plummer's-row. The prisoner was in his service up to the 5th of October, when he left—I had sent him to Candy and Co.'s, of Watling-street, for some shawls—he brought me three shawls from them, saying that he had received them on approbation—I kept them one day, and sent him down the next day to ask if we might keep them another day—he brought me back word that we might, and next day we sent the porter down to Mr. Candy's with them, and they were refused—I sent the prisoner with them again the same evening—he came back and said their warehouse was shut Up—next day I sent him again with them, and he came back and said he had got them made returned—the parties have since sent us in a bill for them.</p>

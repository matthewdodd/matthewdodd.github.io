                  </hi>. I am a Roman Catholic priest, and live at 30, Titchborne Street, Edgware Road—on 3rd November, about 11.15 at night, I left the Roman Catholic Chapel, in Marylebone Row, all safe; I looked it up myself—next morning, about 9 o'clock, I was sent for, and found the cellar-door, and three other doors of the chapel, broken open—I went inside the chapel, and found the iron safe broken open; the front was blown off entirely, and out of it was taken a silver monstrance, a thurible, and four chains attached, and a chalice was taken from a side table—the safe, had one of Chubbs' locks—it had been blown open by means of gunpowder—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187012120004"></xptr>
               <p>the monstrance was worth nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the thurible 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chalice about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer D.</hi>) On the morning of 4th Novem<lb></lb>ber, I went to the chapel in Homer Row, I found a door leading from a school-room into the chapel had been broken open—a centre-bit and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> had been used—there were other doors also broken open in the same manner—I examined the iron safe; the door of it had been blown off by gunpowder; it smelt very strongly, and the walls about were blackened—I examined the door of the safe, and found that a hole had been drilled in it, and I found this tube that had been used to insert in the hole, and gunpowder had been poured through it—it smelt very much of gunpowder at that time, and was blackened—it is black now—the interior of the safe smelt very strongly of gunpowder—I saw the prisoners at the Walton Street Station, on a Saturday, about ten days afterwards—I told them the charge—Palmer said "We have been told before; we know all about it"—they were then taken to John Street Station, and the charge was entered against them—Palmer was then put into cell No. 2, and Jarrett into No. 4, and I went into No. 3 cell—after a short time Palmer called out "Harry, where are you?" (I am referring to a paper which I made at the time in the cell) Jarrett answered "Here I am." Palmer said "Well, we are in for it now." Jarrett replied "No, you are not in for it, but I am; they found the b——tools at my place; I should like to take eighteen months for my bit," Palmer said "What can they do with the tools? nothing at all; but I am in for it as two of them picked me out." Jarrett then said "Oh, yes they can, they will go and fit the centre-bit and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> to the marks on the doors which we broke open." Palmer said "No, they won't think of that." Jarrett said "Had I known they were coming, they never would have found the tools." Palmer said "Well, we have got enough out of the b——stuff to pay for a good mouthpiece, will you have one?" Jarrett said "No, I will be my own mouthpiece; I told you they would not think to search there for it; how will we get it to the old women?" Palmer said "The old women will bring our dinner to-morrow, and we can put it in the dirty things." Jarrett said "No, they might search them, but we can do it in the House of Detention." Palmer said "No, we can't." Jarrett said "Oh, yes, we can give the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> something, and he will pass it." Palmer said "No, they won't." Jarrett said "They would do it at Wandsworth, and I am sure they will do it where we are going. You are safe to get off, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, and if you don't look after my old woman while I am in, so help me God I shall <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on you when I am there." Palmer said "If I get off I will do the best I can for her, but what can I do by myself?" Jarrett said "Do the same as we have been doing." Palmer replied "What, by myself?" Jarrett said "Yes, or go with some of the other</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">blokes.</hi>" Palmer said "Not me, I would not trust one of them." They then paused for some time, and then Palmer again called "Harry, had we known they would have found the little b——who picked me out, we would have left him unable to say much." Jarrett said "Yes, yes, I'm b——if we should not." Palmer then said "What is the name of that church where the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> let us in? or do you know his name?" Jarrett said "I'm b——if I know the name of the church, but I know his name is John, his other name I don't know." Palmer said "Well, it's a good job they did not go to his place, if they had they would have found some stuff; but we can tell my old woman, and she will put him on his guard; she can easily find his address." Jarrett then said "What a good job they did not find any tickets, they would not think to look in the old woman's flour for them."—In con<lb></lb>sequence of what I heard them say I took Palmer out of the cell into the charge room, and searched him, and found three sovereigns in his stocking—I also had Jarrett brought into the charge room, and in his stocking found four sovereigns and two half sovereigns.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not write shorthand—I will undertake to say that I took down this conversation word for word as I have detailed it—I should say it was going on for about forty minutes—there were a great many pauses—there was very little said besides what I have stated, except a warning to each other to hold their tongues, which I did not think necessary to take down; I only took down what I thought necessary—there was nothing else said but telling each other to be silent—they did say some<lb></lb>thing else, but it is unfit to be mentioned in Court; it has nothing to do with this case—this was in the evening—there was a light in the cell passage—the door of the cell I was in was ajar—they did not hear me go into the cell; had they done so they would not have said what they did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew what the charge was against them then—the night of 2nd November was damp, but clear—I had never seen them before.</p>

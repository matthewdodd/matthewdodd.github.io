                  </hi>. I am a currier, at Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell, and have one partner. On Tuesday, 4th Feb., the prisoners, who I knew a little of before, came to our shop with Mr. Bull, who is a collar-maker, and a respectable man—Butler said, "We have brought a person to look at those hides"—he did not say the number, but they had seen twenty-seven japanned horsehides previously—they were worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had told them I would take 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hide, and told them to bring a customer—Mr. Bull asked me the price I would take for the hides, and I said I had left it to these men—they all went away together, and in about a quarter of an hour the prisoners returned, and Butler told me Mr. Bull would take one hide on trial, and if he approved of it he would take the whole, as he had had some before and did not like them—White was at Butler's side, and must have heard what he said—he approved of what Butler said, but I cannot say what words he used—they seemed <hi rend="italic">congenial</hi> together—on the Saturday previous Butler had told me, in White's presence, that White and he worked into one another's hands in doing business—the same afternoon, the 4th, Butler told me he had got au order from Mr. Plowman, who I know is a collar-maker, and a respect<lb></lb>able man, for ten hides for approval—on the 3rd, Butler had said they wanted some harness for Mr. Beale, and a horsehide to try as approval for a person, and he and White looked them out together, and they amounted to ninety-six pounds of leather—they told me Mr. Bull lived near the City-road—on the Tuesday, I left our place with the prisoners in our cart, tak<lb></lb>ing eleven horsehides, and ninety-six pounds of leather—we went to Mr. Bull's—Butler got out, took one hide, and I saw him go in with it—in about five minutes he returned, and said we were to make haste to Mr. Beale's as we were to see him at five o'clock—he had left the hide at Mr. Bull's, and said he thought it would suit him—he said he had seen Mr. Bull—White said that Mr. Beale had remarked that our hides had not suited him before—we drove to Mr. Beale's—Butler took in one bundle, and White the other of the ninety-six pounds—I did not then go in, but I did a few minutes after with Butler—he had said Mr. Beale would not be at home till ten, and Butler said, "Mr. Beale will be at home at ten," and the foreman said, "Yes"—we then went to Mr. Plowman's, in North Audley-street, and they each took in a bundle of the ten hides—I went to a public-house opposite, and in a short time Mr. Plowman, Butler, and White came, and White kept me in conversation while Butler talked to Mr. Plowman—I heard Butler say to Mr. Plowman "at eleven o'clock," and they went out—I did not go with them into Plowman's, because I did not like to interfere; it was rather a delicate question; if they were to make a few shillings by it, I did not like to take it from them—Butler returned, said the hides were all right, Mr. Plowman was engaged, but we were to call at eleven—I had got two enamel hides in the cart, and we took them to a leathercutter's in Crawford-street—White took a hide in, and Butler sat with me in the cart, and Butler went in afterwards—he afterwards gave me the money for that—we then got into the cart, and rode down Oxford-street, where they got out, and Butler said they would meet me at eleven in the morning—I said I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030067"></xptr>
               <p>rather they would come earlier, before ten; and White said, "We had better be to the time"—it was agreed they were to be at our place at nine, and I went home in the cart—I think they left me about a quarter-past eight—they did not come next morning, but in the afternoon Butler came and said he was selling leather in St. John-street, and he would call the next morning—I did not see them again till they were in custody—I have only received the 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the one hide—the one left at Mr. Bull's was 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the ten at Mr. Plowman's 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the ninety-six pounds of leather at Mr. Beale's 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen one hide since at Mr. Covey's, Little Leonard-street, which I believe to be one of them—this is a part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

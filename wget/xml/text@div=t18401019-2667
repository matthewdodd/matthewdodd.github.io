                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. William Hooper, of Frederick-place, Brixton-hill, in the parish of Lambeth. On the 11th of September, at ten o'clock at night, the pantry was safe, and the window quite shut down—there is a wire-work outside, and iron bars inside—the window opens into the area in front of the house—next morning, between five and six, the policeman called us up—it was before six I am certain—I missed the articles stated, and there was a cheese-pan broken—the pantry door was locked—an arm must have been put through the window—the pantry is part of the house—I am certain the window was shut down at night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not break in—I found the window open—I went down to sleep there, as I could not find my home in the dark—I saw the things set before the window, and put them into my bag.</p>

I found the prisoner down the area of Mr. Earl's house, No. 2, Frederick-place, Brixton-hill, next door to the prosecutor's, between three and four o'clock in the morning—I took him to the station-house, and found these Siberian crabs in his coat pocket, and some skeleton keys in his trowsers pocket—I found this bag, which he claimed as his property, with the other articles lost in it.</p>

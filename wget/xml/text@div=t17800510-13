               <p>What is your business? - I do something in the Mercery branch. On Thursday the 20th of April, as I was passing by Clerkenwell New Prison, I observed two women, I accosted one of them by the name of Betty and said Betty, how do you do? How does your brother Joseph do? I thought I knew her; the fact proved otherwise. She immediately answered she was very well, her brother Joseph was pressed over night, and was in the New Prison, Clerkenwell, but that he would be discharged the following day. And she asked me to go in and see him. I told her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100018"></xptr>I was desirous of seeing the prison, but that I was rather timerous of going in; at last she persuaded me, by telling me it was very safe. I went in, and we sat down.</p>
               <p>I should think if she had not been your acquaintance you must have found it out before you went in? - I did not find it out till the pretended brother appeared; then I discovered my mistake, and said is this your brother.</p>
               <p>Is the woman you took her to be, a woman of virtue! - She is. When we had seated ourselves the pretended brother did not appear directly. One of them wanted to drink; I offered to treat them, and ordered the liquor.</p>
               <p>Both the women went in? - Yes; when that was drunk we called for some more.</p>
               <p>What was it you had? - Spirituous liquors. The first was half a pint of rum. When the first liquor was brought in,

               <p>Did all the company go? - Yes. When they had shewed me a part of the prison; they desired to have some more drink, and we went into a shed; I went in first, the two women next, and then Patrick Madan, and

He said suppose you was in a prison, and people put something over your eyes and threw you down and robbed you, how could you tell who did it? He prevailed on me to go with him to the jail. I went and told the turnkey the matter, and then asked the prosecutor if he knew who had robbed him; he said he did not. He said there were two women he should know because they had light cloaks. I laid hold of the two women. He said he had nothing to say against them; he did not know who robbed him. He came to me the next morning, and said, he thought Madan was the likeliest man to rob him. I went with him to the prison, and the prisoners were brought out before him; he said he believed there was not any one person there whom he had seen before. A person called out

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 36, Webber Street, Blackfriars Road—on 8th June, about 12.30, I saw the deceased standing by her door—I hood never seen her before—the prisoner was talking to a person next door, and was near enough to hear what the old lady said to me, "My young woman, that woman will be my murderer"—the prisoner then came to me and said, "Don't take any notice of her, it is all false"—the old woman repeated that she would be her murderer, as if trying to aggravate the prisoner, and she kept repeating it—the prisoner took her by the right arm, with her left arm round her waist, and threw her down very violently—I am sure she threw her down—she fell on her left side—the prisoner was standing at her side—I did not see anything that she could stumble over—she fell in the passage, and the prisoner shut the door—I saw Mr. Hurst; but the prisoner did not hear what he said—she opened the door to Mr. Hurst, and he asked me if I saw her <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her down—I said, "Yes, I did," and then she called me a liar—the prisoner was sober, and so was the old lady—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed a, written statement to the Judge</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 4I, Villier's Bow, next door to where the old lady lived—I heard a noise next door, about 4 o'clock on this day, and went to the street-door of No. 41, which had just been banged to—it was almost immediately afterwards opened by the prisoner, and I said, "What have you been doing to this old lady to cause this disturbance" or something of that sort, but it is so long ago now—she said that the carried her out of the passage and put her on the bed, or tried to put her on the bed, and found her lying on the floor—I do not think she said that she had carried her out few the passage into her bedroom—I think she said that she put her on the bed—I heard the old lady crying, went into the passage, opened the back parlour door, and saw the old lady lying on the floor, on the hearth rug, with her face towards the fire-place—there was no fire in the grate—there was a bed in the room—the old lady said, "This girl has broken my leg"—I said, "No, I hope not, surely"—she asked me to pick her up, and with assistance she was put on the bed—she was too heavy for me—she was not stout but she was tall—I could not put her on the bed, and I am not astonished that the prisoner could not—Mrs. Harstell came in—I heard the prisoner say that she had not ill-used the old lady, but the old lady did not say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and act for the parish of St. George the Martyr—I have known the deceased a good many years—I was sent for, and found her on the bed, in the back room, in very great a jony—I found a fracture of her left thigh bone, and attended her for nine or ten weeks—I ultimately sent her into the workhouse, where she died, on 2nd November—I made a <hi rend="italic">port-mortem</hi> examination, but could find no cause of death—I attribute death to the shock to the system, from the injuries received.</p>

               <p>not from old age, but I could not see any cause of death—I had seen her before the accident, and she was very well, but after it her nervous system was much shaken—I attribute her death to the shock to her system.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners written statement was that she had to wait upon the deceased and read to her, but that the she was very irritable, and called her a charity brat and parish bread; neither of which were true, in consequence of which her mother gave the deceased notice to leave, which expired on the day of the acci dent, on which day the person who was to help the deceased to move was very late in coming, which irritated her, and caused her to stand by the street-deer, and telling persons outside that the prisoner would be her murderer; and upon the prisoner requesting her to come in she refused and was more noisy, upon which she pushed her into the passage, and she stumbled over the mat and fell upon which she lifted her up, and carried her into her own room; that the Magistrate had fined her</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the assault, which was paid for her by a minister; but upon the woman dying, she was again called upon to answer the charge.</hi>

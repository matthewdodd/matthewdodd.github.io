               <p>THEODORE PETER COUTURE. On the 10th of December, I saw the prisoner in Holborn, at one o'clock in the morning, with another female, and we had a quartern of gin; I went with the prisoner to her room - I had this money in a pocket-book, and some silver in my breeches' pocket; I went to bed, and left my pocket-book in my coat-pocket, and my coat on a chair - I did not awake till eleven o'clock in the day; the prisoner never came to bed at all - when I awoke, my coat was there, but I missed the pocket-book; I inquired where I could find the prisoner- they said, in Little Shire-lane; I went, and found her and two other females - I went back to the house where I had slept, with the officer, and found the pocket-book in the bed, but the money was gone.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GONOND. I am a Police-officer. On the morning of the 10th of December, the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner; she denied the charge.</p>

               <p>JOHN HOOKE sworn. - I am an engineer; I saw the prisoner on Friday evening, the 21st, as I was going from Fleet-market: I passed the cart, the prosecutor was leading the horse; I left it on the right hand side; I saw the prisoner with his left hand on the bed, and the handkerchief laying on the bed; he seemed as if he was assisting the cart up the Hill; at the same time I saw his right hand go into the feather-bed, and take a handful of feathers out, and put them into a pocket under his left arm; I stopped to look at him, as it was very unusual; I said, I think it is a shame a man should pull feathers out so; he immediately turned short off to Chick-lane, and dropped the handkerchief; I picked it up, and said, my friend, I believe you have dropped your handkerchief; he made off, and never looked back; I held it up, and says, who owns this? Daniel says, I do, where did you get it? I said, that man has just taken it from your cart, and likewise some feathers; I believe there were two lettuces, some marshmallows, and some hysop; he went about thirty yards to the Sheep-pens and set himself down as close as he could to the ground; I pointed to him, saying, there he is behind those pens; then he jumped up and began running; he turned the corner into Chick-lane; before I could get there, his coat was off, and he was in a coal waggon; I pointed out to the prosecutor, that is the person; he pursued him into Long-lane, and desired the waggoner to stop, as he had a thief in the waggon; he refused, and whipped the person who requested it; the prisoner at first took up a broom for his defence, and after that he took a shovel, and drove the people round the waggon; I did not see him do any thing to the prosecutor; he then jumped out of the waggon, and went across Long-lane to Cloth-fair; I stood to watch the coat that was left in the waggon, and then he got into Long-lane again; I procured the coat, and pursued him as far as Aldersgate-street, and caught him; I saw him stopped by the coach stand; I am sure it is the same man that took the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man all the days of my life, he might see me in Aldersgate-street, as I lived there.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a brush-maker, I was coming out of our warehouse in Smithfield at half past eight; they said, a cart had been robbed, and that the person was in a coal-waggon, and there I saw him desending himself with a shovel, that is the same man; the prisoner jumped out of the waggon, and made his escape; he turned down some street or lane on the left-hand in Long-lane, and in a little time he crossed the lane again; I followed him as fast as I could, and came up with him in Aldersgate-street; they came up soon afterwards, and said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I live in Aldersgate-street; I had been having some words with a fellow-servant, and had been fighting; a mob came round me, and I did not know what it was about any more than the child unborn.</p>

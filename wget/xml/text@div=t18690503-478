                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi> 462). On the morning of 20th April, about 6.5, I was in Temple Street, Whitefiars, watching the prisoner Dennis—I saw him go into Mr. Arding's shed with an empty sack under his arm—Mr. Macey has a stable there—he remained in the shed about ten minutes, and came out with the sack, full of something, on his shoulder—I followed him to his own stable, at New Wharf—he is a greengrocer—when I got there I asked him what he had got in the sack—he said, "Horse provender, from the wharf in Thames Street"—I said, "What wharf?"—he said, "I forget the name, but it is next to the large iron foundry, in Thames Street"—I said, "Dennis, you did not bring it from Thames Street, I saw where you went with an empty sack, and now I have seen where you come with a full one"—he then said, "I did not fetch it from Thames Street, I had it from Mr. Arding's man"—the sack contained three bushels of split beans, oats, and out hay—I said I should take him to the station for re<lb></lb>ceiving it, knowing it to be stolen—he said, "Don't look me up this time, let me go, for the sake of my wife and family"—I said, "I can't let you go, it has been going on so long"—he keeps a horse and cart—I took him to the station, and went back to the shed in Whitefriars Street, and saw Spratt, a porter in Mr. Ardley's employ—I had a conversation with him, and then spoke to Wykes in his presence—Spratt had been to the station with me—I said to Wykes, "Did you authorise Spratt to give this horse provender to Dennis?"—he said, "Yes, it is quite right, I did"—I took Wykes to the station, and he said it was quite right, that he had told Spratt to give it to Dennis, and he had a right to do so, it was what the hone would not eat—the inspector then said, "If your master knows, we can't detain you; but we shall detain the provender, to make inquiries"—they were released from custody—I made inquiries, and took them in custody again, about 11 o'clock—I produce a sample of the mixture.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Shaftesbury Street, Walwerth, and am porter to Mr. Arding—on the morning of 20th April Dennis came to me, about 6 o'clock, with a sack, and I put in the mixture which the officer found—it was food which the horse would not eat—I got it from another sack, and put it into Dennis's sack—Dennis said that Wykes told him to come down for the rough food, and I gave it to him—I had given it to him once before—Wykes gave me directions to give it him then—that was about ten days before—I had no directions to give this particular stuff—Wykes came that morning with Mr. Arding's horse, and brought some provision for the horse with him—he took part away and left the other part.</p>

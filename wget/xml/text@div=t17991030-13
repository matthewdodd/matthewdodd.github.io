I am a lamp-contractor, No.3, White's-yard, Great Saffron-hill: on Sunday, the 13th, between two and three in the morning, I was in bed, I heard somebody come in and go up stairs; I immediately got up and went to my son's room-door, he immediately got up, he said, father, I have got nobody here; says, I, open the door, John, which he did; I went in and found Stanton in bed, I told him to get up, I called the watchman and gave charge of them both; the prisoner Tyler is my own son. The watchman and I took them both to the watch-house. I then came home, went up stairs, and in the cupboard I found this rump of bees.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman upon Saffron-hill; Mr. Tyler sent for me and gave me charge of the prisoners, on Sunday morning, the 13th of October.</p>
               <p>Stanton's defence. On the Saturday night I left my work, and fell in company with this lad, who stopped late, and he told me I might go home and sleep with him; his father came to the room, and made me get up, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Tyler's defence. I went to get a pint of porter, and met with this young man; we stopped rather late; I took him home with me; I thought my father would not be angry, but he was very angry; other people had the use of the room in the daytime. I know nothing of the bees.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tyler.) You found the rump of bees in the room? - A. Yes; in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body besides your son access to that room? - A. The lodgers go in to hang up cloaths, or put washing-tubs, or any thing of that kind in.</p>

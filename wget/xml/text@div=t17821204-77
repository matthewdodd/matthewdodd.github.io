               <p>I went to a house in Thames-street, opposite Vintner's Hall; it was the 28th of October, past eleven; my brother and a little boy went with me, I found the prisoners there: we looked into the cellar, and they were at work, but they put out the candles immediately: the cellar was hung round with cloth, except the back part, which was bare; one of the candles, the wick was not out when we got down; I saw the press and a parcel of halfpence just coined off, and the dies set, and this halfpenny between the dies: in the cellar I saw Harrison, Sharkey, and Cherry, the other woman came to open the door: Cherry endeavoured to come up, and I kept them down; I found these halfpence, and these blanks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040104"></xptr> there was the press with the dies fixed in; the dies were warm, which is owing to the weight of the instrument, and the perpetual whirling; Sharkey said he was a watchmaker, and trade was dead; Cherry said the same, and that poverty induced him to do it; Harrison said she had not been at work, but the blanks were in the cellar, in her apron; Floyd said she was only a servant; there were no other persons in the house.</p>

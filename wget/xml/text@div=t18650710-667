I am surgeon at the Ear Infirmary, 10, Death-street, Soho—the prisoner is secretary to that infirmary, and had been so I think about thirty years—I have known him personally for eighteen years—his duties were to receive letters and donations, and conduct the corre<lb></lb>spondence, also to make out the accounts and submit them to the managers—he had always discharged his duty in a proper manner up to within the last mouth or six weeks—I have noticed a very considerable change in him since that; generally speaking a want of power in his recognising individuals and a want of attention to his duties; in fact, a general break-up of mind and body—I have had considerable experience as a surgeon, independently of diseases of the ear—I have noticed eccentricities about the prisoner; incoherence of language occasionally, and particularly a want of cleanliness in his person and dress—that was quite contrary to his previous habits—I have noticed fits of passion once or twice, but they have generally been curbed in my presence—that was very unusual with him—I have noticed forgetfuluess of names and great bodily debility, weakness, and falling away in his person, a lassitude with regard to his duties, and a peculiar infirmity in his walk—previous to that ho was in the habit of rendering his accounts in a proper and intelligible way, but since then his calculations have been</p>

               <p>frequently wrong, the figures were right when properly calculated for him—I have had in consideration whether he should be removed from the situation—from what I observed I think he was most likely suffering from brain disease—the obscurity is very great in such cases, but they were very much the marks of softening of the brain—I know that he had a weakness in his lungs, and generally speaking the pectoral apparatus was weak, but I did not examine him—that would still less enable him to struggle with mental disease—I believe about twelve years ago he purchased a commis<lb></lb>sion in the corps of gentlemen-at-arms—I know he belonged to the corps.</p>

               <p>fit—he jumped up and went to go out of the window—I know he would have done so if I had not caught him in my arms and thrown-him on the bed—(he went to make away with himself before by hanging himself; I saw the rope on the bed)—he wrenched my arm, and it pained me very ranch—after that he ran down stairs in hid shirt and trousers and opened the hall-door to go out to throw himself in the canal—the canal is just by the house—his things were very nearly torn off his back by our holding him in the room—the did not say anything to me about the canal—I have observed a good deal in his manner lately that was very odd, that I never knew a gentleman do—when he come to do anything he would not do it in a proper manner; he would do it quite as if he was not in his proper mind—he would go and draw up the clock, and shake the mats by the hall-door, very different to any one else—I have seen him in a depressed state, and crying, two or three times—I could not see any cause for it—he was not given to drink—I never saw him drink anything more than his beer for his dinner—he would clean the windows on a Sunday, which was not a proper thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crow-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know of any cause for his being so violent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I, never heard him and mistress have a word—I drew his beer for his dinner—it was kept in the cellar—the housemaid took it to him—there was no wine in the cellar, nothing but beer—no brandy or spirits—none was sent for—I never saw him drink any liquor—nothing was sent for, without it was a bottle of ginger-wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had considerable experience of mental disease—I have made it my peculiar study for more than twenty years—I had an interview with the prisoner in Newgate on 7th July—he did not know who I was; I wished he should not know—I heard him describing to his solicitors the nature of the offence that was charged against him, and describing much in the same way that the witnesses have done to-day what occurred—his account, though coherent, was childish in its simplicity, and it was clear to me, from the whole tenor of his conversation, that his brain was in a state of weakness, although I knew nothing of the previous history of his case; yet from the physical symptoms, from the way he told his story, and from the fact that he was unable to answer a simple question in arithmetic; such for instance the interest of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 5 per cent—I doubt whether he knew the difference between his own age and that of his brother, who is five or six years older; but he was very anxious to convince me that it was natural to him, that he was not in the least deranged—he said, "They want to say I have softening of the brain, but it is nothing of the sort"—I discovered what was to my mind indubitable evidence of organic brain disorder; and since then I have heard other physical symptoms detailed, which corroborate my opinion—he had infirmity of gait, slight stammering, dilatation of the pupil of one eye, which is a general accompaniment of incipient brain disorder, and which, taken with any delusion or eccentricity, or sudden change of conduct, is almost invariably a symptom of disease of the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would an attempt at suicide be a symptom of such a disorder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In this particular form of organic disease of the brain, almost any folly or act of outrageous stupidity would be natural enough—it is impossible to lay down any rule.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From the symptoms you observed, you thought there was weakness of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there is organic disease of the brain—there is a distinct weakness of mind—from what I have heard since, there appear to have been suicidal attempts—there is weakness of</p>

               <p>mind, such as a man of his age and position should not have—ho has the mind of a child apparenty—one-half of the lunatics that are under my care know right from wrong—no one in this world can answer the question whether a lunatic, at the moment he does a wrong act, knows right from wrong—I believe ho known it now—everybody may be labouring under some delusion or weakness—I only saw the prisoner once, and that in the presence of his two solicitors—my visit was about an hour—I afterwards met Dr. Duke on the subject, and had a conversation with him—I have seen no one else.</p>

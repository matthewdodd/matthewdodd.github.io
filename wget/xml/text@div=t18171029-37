On the 13th of October, I delivered seventy-two sheep at Mr. Kemp's field, at Holloway, in Middlesex; ten of them had a ruddled mark across the shoulder and on each hip. I saw them safe on Thursday, the 16th; I heard of one being lost on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I did not count them after the 13th, when they were delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290017"></xptr>WILLIAM FARREN. I am field-keeper to Mr. Kemp. I saw the seventy-two sheep safe on the 17th, between four and five o'clock in the evening; the next morning at half-past seven I went into the field and missed one of them; I went across three fields and found the inside of a sheep at the corner of a lane; I also found the four legs sawed off in the hedge.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WESTLEY. I am an headborough. On the 18th of October, I stopped the prisoner, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, coming across a field, which is three small fields from Mr. Kemp's field; he had a basket on his head. I had not heard of the robbery; the basket contained two hind-quarters, one fore-quarter, of a sheep, and the fat; I asked him what he had got there, he said he had found some meat in a ditch; it was hot. I told him I must take him to a magistrate to know what must be done. I took him to Mr. Wicks, and then to Hatton-garden; the sheep-skin was produced there, and matched with the meat, it corresponded; it was compared about two o'clock, it was not cut up in the usual manner-the meat was sawed; the prisoner gave me the key of his lodgings to search them; he said he lived in Back-alley, Cloth-fair; the key which he gave me fitted the door of some premises in White's-alley, Whitecross-street, where I found a saw, two knives, and a smock-frock, quite bloody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that it is the prisoner's lodging; I found 31s. 6d., in silver, and a 1l. note there; I found no knife on the prisoner - the head was in the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Is meat never cut with a saw - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GOSS. I am a headborough. On the 18th of October, I went to Mr. Kemp's field and found the skin, with the head of a sheep in it, rolled up and put in a water-pipe; I unrolled it, it was warm-the blood had hardly done running from the head; part of the neck was with the head; I looked farther, and just by the place where it was killed I found the lights, covered over with a little hay. I took the skin to the office; the prisoner delivered me a key, and said he lodged in Cloth-fair; I went there with Westley, but could not find his lodgings. I received information, and went to the place where the key unlocked the door, and found the heart and liver of a sheep there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Westley was with me. The person who directed me to the place is not here.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THISSELTON. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. After the rooms had been searched and the skin was found, the witnesses said in the presence of the prisoner before the magistrate, that they had been to Cloth-fair and afterwards to White's-alley, Whitecross-street, on the ground-floor, and found a 1l. note and 31s. 6d. in silver, which they produced, and the other things; but they did not know whether they were authorized to break open a box; the magistrate sent me there-the prisoner asked for part of the 31s. found there, and received 5s., for his support, out of it; I went to the rooms, and found a key in a table-drawer that opened a mahogany box, which contained 3l.7s.6d., in silver, and a pocket-book with a 1l. note in it; the prisoner claimed it at his second examination and it was given to him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILKINSON. (Looks at the skin), the marks correspond with those on the sheep I lost.</p>

            , re-examined. I left the meat at Mr. Kemp's after it had been compared with the skin; it was not out of my custody before it was compared - I was present when it was compared-it corresponded exactly; there was a place on the back where the skin was left on the meat, and the meat fitted that hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apothecary, of 2, Blackthorne Street, Bromley—between the 29th and 30th November, between twelve and one o'clock, I met the female prisoner in the street, and went with her to a house in Bell Court, Holborn—I had had a little drink, but I had my senses—I stopped with her ten minutes, and shortly afterwards the male prisoner came in like a tiger, caught mo by the shoulders, turned me to the wall, and held my hands behind me, while the female prisoner rifled my pockets with one hand, and held the other over my mouth—she took two sovereigus and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver from my breast-pocket—I also lost a chain, but do not know which of them took it, it was safe when I went there—I also lost my hat—I left the house, but afterwards went back—there was a kind of pad<lb></lb>lock on the door—I broke it open, took possession of the room, and remained there all night—between five and six in the morning there was a knock at the door, and it was the female prisoner—she knocked several times, but I did not open it—I then heard the male prisoner saying that if I did not open it he would open the back window—I heard the window rising, so I opened the door, and said, "You have robbed me of my money and my hat"—he said, "I have not, you are quite mistaken"—I said, "You have,</p>

               <p>and I have no hat"—he gave me this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to go home with, and told me I had better get away—we went out—he said, "I want to take a drink, you had better come with me"—I said, "No, I have no money"—he ran away and got into the room where the female was—I got a police-man, took him to the house, and charged them with assault and robbery.</p>

I met Hardy about seven in the morning—he took me to 8, Bell Court—the prisoners were both in bed—the female prisoner opened the door—I told her the charge, they both denied it—I told them to dress themselves—I found a half-crown, a shilling, and twopence on the male prisoner—he said that he had only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the female was searched at the station—Hardy was perfectly sober.</p>

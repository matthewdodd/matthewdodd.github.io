On the 18th of January last, as they were going home, I stopped them, Brown and Martin were with me, they were in the house, it was eight o'clock in the evening, which is the time they generally leave, we found twenty-five pen and sportsman's knives on Hempstead, and two sport-man's knives on Hudson, they said they were our property; they are worth 6l. 10s. Those found on Hempstead are worth 6l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I have been in partnership with Burch ever since the 20th of July, before that I was in partnership with Whitrow, that was regularly dissolved; the knives were entered into the new partnership account, they were my property before, and never belonged to Whitrow; they were not mixed with the partnership property. They have been entered into the account with Burch as our joint property. The prisoners were in the same room together. I will not swear they were not taken at different times. The prisoners had been home that day, the property was found on them at one time. The two knives found on Hudson, were taken from the same room, but not from the same parcel. After the property was found on them, they both said they were our property.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I went to Nowill's house, on the 18th of January, to search the porters, as they came out of the warehouse. I found twenty-five knives on Hempstead.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I am an officer. On the 18th of January. Mr. Burch fetched us, and called the prisoners into the counting-house. I told them their master had been robbed, and I supposed they would not object to being searched. I searched Hudson and found two knives on him. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

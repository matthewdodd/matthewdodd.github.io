               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not paid you by Manning before the crave was made? - A. No, it was not; I was paid on the day of my crave; the letter is, the Surveyor of sloops, for letters inward and outward, 9s; the next line, 12s. for one letter.</p>

               <p>Q. They contain the whole you had a right to demand? - A. I paid 1l. 5s. 2d. I craved 1l. 5s. 2d.</p>

               <p>Q. You are positive of it? - A. I am positive;(reads) Solicitor for London, inwards 2l, outwards 19, amount 4l. 5s. 2d.</p>

               <p>Q. You have the original crave that is indorsed with his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have your crave back? - A. It should have been left with the prisoner; I had omitted to enter them in my book at the time I delivered the crave, and therefore I borrowed it of the prisoner to enter it in my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever your craves were made, your letters were delivered as vouchers, for him to correct the craves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the crave was kept? - A. Yes; and the vouchers returned to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen, that you demanded or received more money than was disbursed, or appeared by the letters? - A. Never; he delivers a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150094"></xptr>slip of paper of the letters sent out, which has the mark of the Post-Office, that I deliver in; the letters inward, I deliver the letters themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. It never can happen, that the sum paid to you exceeds your craves? - A. Never.(Mr. Const addressed the Jury on the part of the prisoner; the principal ground of defence was, that his accounts were unsettled, that it was a mistake, and that he had not had time to rectify it.)</p>

I am a clerk in the Missing Letter De<lb></lb>partment of the General Post-office, London—in consequence of instruc<lb></lb>tions that I received I went down to Maidstone on Monday, 7th January—I there made up a letter, and addressed it to Mrs. Niton, 15, Kenning<lb></lb>ton Park Road, London, S. E.—I put 120 penny postage stamps in that letter and marked them with a private mark—I securely fastened the letter in the envelope with the adhesive gum seal, and posted it in the Boxley Road wall letter-box at 7. 45 p. m.—I saw the prisoner clear that box shortly after 8 o'clock—I subsequently went to the Maidstone post<lb></lb>office and arrived there about 9. 45—I saw the prisoner there in the postmaster's private room—Mr. Ransley, the chief clerk at the Maid<lb></lb>stone post-office, was present—I told the prisoner that I had received instructions to come down to Maidstone to investigate the loss of several letters which had been complained about, that I had posted a letter addressed to Mrs. Niton, 15, Kennington Park Road, London, in the Boxley Road wall box, about 7. 45, and that I had been informed that that letter had not reached the Maidstone post-office, and I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said "No"—I asked him if he had cleared the box—he said "Yes, and I brought away all the letters"—I then asked him if he had anything about him which did not belong to him—he said "No"—I asked him if he had any postage stamps about him—he said "No"—I then sent for Inspector Rhodes, and he searched the prisoner in my presence—he asked him to turn out all his pockets—the prisoner turned out his trousers pockets, and threw his coat off on to the ground; it was afterwards picked up by the inspector, who found in the breast pocket the 120 postage stamps—I looked at the stamps and asked the prisoner where he got them—he said "They are mine"—I then applied a test to one of the stamps and brought out my private mark upon it—it was not observable unless a test was applied—the stamps were all together—I then told the prisoner that I identified them as being the stamps I had enclosed in the letter which I had been inquiring about—he said nothing to that—the inspector has the stamps (<hi rend="italic">they were here produced</hi>)—I identify these stamps as those which I put into the letter, and they are the same that were taken from the breast pocket of the prisoner's coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Maidstone post-office—the prisoner has been employed for seven years or thereabouts in the post<lb></lb>office there—his duty was to clear the pillar and wall boxes of the town—it was his duty to clear the Boxley Road wall box—the time for clearing that was 8.10 p. m.—I recollect Monday evening, the 7th inst.—the prisoner came to the post-office that evening and brought his bag—I examined it about 9.15—on looking through the letters contained in that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector at Maidstone—I was called in on this occasion about 10 o'clock, when the prisoner and the previous witnesses were in the post-office—I did not hear all that passed—Mr. Horton told me in the prisoner's presence that he wished me to search him—I said to the prisoner "Baker, put out on the table all you have got in your pockets," pointing to the table that was close by—he took out money, a tobacco pouch, a knife, and a few things, and laid them on the table—he then took his pockets and turned them inside out—there were no letters or stamps found—he then took off his tunic and threw it down by the side of him—that was after he had emptied his pockets—I then thoroughly searched him all over, and not finding anything I took up his tunic and searched that, and in his left-hand breast pocket I found these 120 penny postage stamps which I have produced—there was no envelope found—the stamps were just as they are now—I saw the test applied to them in the prisoner's presence by Mr. Horton, and he identified them as stamps which he had posted in a letter in the Boxley Road wall box; he examined them and applied a test to them to bring out the mark—pre<lb></lb>vious to his doing that the prisoner said when I took them out of his pocket "They are mine"—Mr. Horton said "Where did you buy them"—he said "They are mine"—then the test was applied and Mr. Horton identified them—Mr. Horton then said that he should give him in charge for stealing a letter belonging to him out of the Boxley Road wall pillar box, and I took him into custody and took him to the station-house—during the time Mr. Horton was testing the stamps the prisoner said "I will make you pay for this"—that was said to Mr. Horton.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 72.) On the 12 of March I was in the Blackfriars-road, near Holland-street, and saw the prisoners together with another person, named Lambert, walking abreast of each other, very closely—I saw Mr. Marshall a few yards before them—as I knew them, I followed them—when they got about midway on the bridge the third person drew the handkerchief from Mr. Marshall's pocket, and turned round to hand it to the prisoners who were together behind—there was a scuffle which of the two should take it—Swells took it, and put it into his right-hand breeches pocket—I followed, and took it from his pocket—both prisoners' hands were toge<lb></lb>ther, scuffling who should take it—they were secured—the third man escaped.</p>

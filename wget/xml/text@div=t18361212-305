                  </hi>. I am the only son of Hannah Owen, deceased, she lived in Arlington-street, Lambeth. On the 1st of April 1833, my mother made a will when she was perfectly in her senses—but latterly, for five months, I have every reason to believe she was not right in her senses—I beg to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120084"></xptr>
               <p>ask whether the will may be considered legal—I do it from a point of conscience, but the will has never been proved—I had been absent from my mother nearly seven weeks before her death, and very probably there might be such a thing as that my mother might give the prisoner some things—my conscience between God and my soul, is every thing—the bar of man is nothing but the bar of God is all in all—I have see the gowns, brushes, and other things—I have great reason to believe they were my mother's—I saw my mother seven weeks previous to her death—she died the last day of November—I had not been near the house but once for three or four months—I have reason to believe she was not right in her mind—she would order one thing to be done, and then in two or three minutes she would contradict it, and such a person could not be right in her senses—all I can do is to swear to the property—I cannot say whether my mother gave her liberty to pawn them—she was in distress at times.</p>

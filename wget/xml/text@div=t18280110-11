These combs were inclosed in a glass-case in my window, on the 17th December - I was not at home when they were taken - I found the prisoner in custody with them at the Mansion-house that day - I have no doubt of their being mine, but have no private mark on them. I am in partnership with my mother; the prisoner was a stranger.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the 17th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and took the prisoner into custody, at Mr. Brock's shop - I found nothing on him but a ragged pocket handkerchief; some combs laid on the floor, and some on the counter - Lauder charged him with taking them; he said nothing to it; he had no money at all.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Brock. On the 17th of December, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went out to beat the mat in front of the house, leaving the door shut, but not latched, and nobody in the shop - I returned in a minute or two, and found the prisoner alone in the shop, in the act of putting his hat on. I had left some combs in the window, which was shut - I found the glass case open; and the combs were in his hat; he asked for some rouge, when I went in; I shut the door, and said he should have some in a minute - I secured him, and sent for a constable; he tried to get away, but I kept him in the shop; the combs were taken to the Mansion-house with him - I found several outside the case, and he had ten in his hat; he said nothing to the charge; these are the combs - I gave them to Figgins.</p>

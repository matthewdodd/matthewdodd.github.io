                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Rosemary-lane, and am the wife of Michael Mendoza. On the 2nd of March the two prisoners came to my house for two bonnets which they had left a deposit on—they had dealt there some time—I put ten shawls on the counter, and when they turned out of the shop there were but eight—I sent my girl after them, and they were brought back, but I have not seen the shawls since—I am sure I had ten shawls—we placed ten on purpose, as we suspected them—I placed a girl to watch them.</p>

If we had been bad characters why did she send the shopwoman to ask us what we wanted—she brought the bonnets down stairs, and gave one to each of us, and tied them in a handkerchief and then untied them again—on the Wednesday we went with my mother, and my mother bought a gown, and the shopwoman at the next door came in to have some things, and took three gowns out. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, she did not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I am one of the directors of the company—I know the defendant—I was present at the board meet<lb></lb>ing on 16th March, when Mr. Anstruther attended—Mr. Williamson was also present—it is not true that in my presence William Williamson in<lb></lb>formed Mr. Anstruther that the British Guardian Life Assurance Company, Limited, was in a flourishing condition—it is not true that he informed him that the company was perfectly solvent—he did not tell him that the sum of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Consols were invested in the names of Thomas Nicholas and Whitehorn Lawrence as trustees of the said company—Mr. Williamson explained to Mr. Anstruther that the money was wanted for the use of the company—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a sum which he was to deposit before he could be made secretary—he was advised by Mr. Williamson not to purchase shares in the company, for fear the company should not be satisfied with his services as secretary, but to deposit it at three months' notice, for fear he should not be pleased with the company—I cannot remember exactly, but the general import of the conversation between Mr. Williamson and him, was that the books were open for inspection, and he could make himself conversant with them—he said that he was perfectly satisfied—he had other information about the state of the company—a short time afterwards the company went into liquidation—I received before that a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court—I attended, and it was adjourned to to the following week—I attended the adjournment with my solicitor—the summons fell through—I had nothing to do with paying money to Mr. Anstruther, or in any way stopping those proceedings—subsequently, on seeing the information Mr. Anstruther had sworn, I applied for &amp; summons for perjury against him—it was granted by the same Magistrate.</p>

               <p>implication, and I believed it myself—this prospectus (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the books of the company—it was true that" 50 per cent of the premiums paid upon whole life policies is invested in the names of trustess in the British Government Securities, for which purpose there is a quarterly audit of the income account, and when the board hand to the trustees one half of the Life Assurance premium the amount is remitted to the brokers who invest the money sending to the trustees the Bank of England certificate; that the account is kept in a ledger especially designed for this system, and is so arranged that any policy holder can at a glance see his position in the company."—I swear to the best of my belief that 50 per cent was invested in Government Securities at that time—I do not think anything was invested there at that time; I was told so, but I do not know—I, believe we had out about 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we referred him to the books—the money was ready to go into Consols—it was in the managers and traveling director's hands; I suppose—it was through them I got my information—I cannot tell whether the money has gone in—the company is in liquid<lb></lb>dation; undoubtedly we had at that time as much as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent them 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. three weeks before—I do not know what became of it; that was not as far as I know the whole capital of the company—I know there was more than 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be called up—I cannot tell how much available money there was to hand at twenty-four hours' notice—supposing a life had fallen in we should have had three months' time in which to get the money to pay it—I cannot tell how much we had; I had lent them 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that is all I know of their capital—we had three winding up petitions at that time to the best of mo knowledge—I was not in the country, so I cannot tell how many—the London and County were our bankers; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not know what balance we had at the time—I should think the reserve was more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no means of knowing; I should think 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware that this table conveys a deliberate lie—I did not understand it to convey a deliberate falsehood—I believe there would have been a reserve fund if the company had gone on—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid away for debts—I was not in the country and do not know what was done with it—I made no inquiry at the time the secretary was advertised for—I do not know a gentleman named Hyman in our establishment; I never heard the name before; in connection, with the office—I do not know that he was employed there as a clerk at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I did not know at the time the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in that there was a sheriff's officer in possession of all our goods—I believe it now—I never heard that he was there for no less than ten creditors—I never heard of him before by name; I know that the sheriffs officer was there, but I never heard of Hyman—I lent money myself to the company—the company was certainly not insolvent with 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fall back upon—I have no knowledge of Mr. Anstruther wanting discount on the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never heard that he was given a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given him by the company which was dishonoured—I know it to be a fact.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I am a director of the com<lb></lb>pany—I was present at the board meeting on 16th March when Mr. An<lb></lb>struther attended—it is not true that I told him the company was solvent—I did not allude to it—it is not true that there was 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invested in consols in the name of the trustees—I never told him so—as far as I recollect what passed was this, I said "Don't take shares in the company, but leave your money on deposit that you can get it back again if you wish to leave, or if we quarrel"—his reply was that he had seen the editor of the "World," who had been writing a severe article against us, and he said "I probably know more about the state of the company than you yourself"—I never at that or any other meeting told him that any sum was invested in Consols—to the best of my knowledge there was not anything said about what the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—I was subsequently served with a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court—this is my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that personal guarantee was prepared by his solicitor, brought to us, and signed by us—it makes us personally liable to return the money if the company fail to do it—I appeared at Bow Street and the matter was adjourn<lb></lb>ed—we repaid the defendant the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and bills—I was aware that Mr. Stacpoole attended at the adjournment; I was there—we had no communication with him at all about the money—we were legally bound if we did not pay the money; that is the reason we returned it—it was no use fighting for a thing we were bound to pay—I have money in the company myself—with monies that we have paid, and are bound to pay, subject to be recouped by the company, I believe something like 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the company is in liquidation—the amount of new capital to be called up, to the best of my belief, is something like 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the debts do not exceed 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I recommended him not to take shares in the company, but to pay the money on deposit; the reason for that advice was that he might get it back again if he wished—I know we have not very much at the bankers; I could not pretend to say how much—I cannot say if I gave the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; I did not give any cheque at all—as a director I might have signed a cheque and my signature would appear to it; I have no knowledge of it—the question of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and the payment of the deposit were different—money was coming in daily and hourly—I know that Mr. Anstru<lb></lb>ther said that a cheque was dishonoured; I know no reason to doubt his statement; I did not doubt it; I do not doubt it now—I was served with a summons—I never saw the information at all, because the summons was not served upon me, it was left at the office and never delivered to me; I never saw it, I was told of it—the other directors had seen the information—I was told what I had been charged with—I had got to pay the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was legally and morally responsible—there is only one bill due and that became due the day before yesterday; I do not know where it was payable, I had no opportunities of making inquiries—notice was lying at my cham<lb></lb>bers and for two and a half days I have been dancing attendance here wait<lb></lb>ing to be called upon—I shall pay my own portion; I have paid a great deal for other things—I agreed with' Mr. Walker that he should advance my share; it was not convenient for me to pay it—Mr. Walker is one of the trustees—I do not want to borrow any more—I did not pay anything out of my own pocket—I was only bound for a rateable portion—I borrowed my</p>

               <p>due—if a claim came in, we should have got the money—I cannot say how many polices we have disputed—all policies in our company were indisputable—we never disputed—I did not know that there was, at the time we took the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. policy due, which they could not get—I will not swear that there was not—I have only joined the company since the end of 1874, and I do not know if as many as twenty or thirty polices were disputed—I do not think I have been a party to disputing twenty or thirty policies since that time—I will not swear that we have not done it for the purpose of gaining time—I am not aware of its being so—I cannot swear it was not so—Lawrence was not present; Nichols might he—I will not be sure about John Hicks—I did not say he was not—I have not seen John Hicks lately—I have not the least idea how he is—I never met him except at the board—I know nothing of him—I heard about June, that he had had a paralytic stroke, and that is all.</p>

There was plenty of capital to be got at, but not called up—by debts I mean money that is owing to the company—the capital is calculated upon a fixed principle—it is reckoned that a certain number of policies annually fall in—the policy holders do not suffer the least, because they will be taken over.</p>

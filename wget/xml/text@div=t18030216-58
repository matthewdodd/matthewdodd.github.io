               <p>Q.Where did you first see it upon him? - A.

             sworn. - John Bidgood is my partner: On the 31st of January, a little after nine in the evening, the prisoner was brought into our house by the last witness, with the cork, he informed me he had caught the prisoner, taking cork away from our door, that he followed him into King's-street, took him into custody, and brought him to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this in the hearing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I ordered the watchman to take him away to the watch-house; we had an apprentice in the house, James Withy, brother-in-law of the prisoner; James Withy shut up the shop, and was the last person in the shop, after the men were gone, my suspicions fell upon him, I asked him, if he knew any thing of that cork.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160053"></xptr>Q.Was that in the presence of the prisoner?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I can't hear it.</p>
               <p>Brown. I then sent the apprentice likewise to the watch-house, and went to the watch-house, and gave charge of the prisoner and the apprentice; the apprentice has since run away from our house, he was examined by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONWAY sworn. - I attended the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what passed taken down in writing? - A. Yes, the last day; I don't know, whether it was taken down at the first examination or not.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Brown.) What passed at the first examination? - A. Mr. Brody ordered me to take back the apprentice, that he might be brought forward as an evidence against the prisoner; accordingly I did, and about two days after, he ran away, and took his clothes; we have advertised him, but have heard nothing of him since; Lowther has had the cork in his custody ever since. (Lowther produced the cork.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brown.) Can you swear that to be your cork? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any cork at that time? - A. Yes, about that quantity, the man informed me what state he left the cork in.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONWAY sworn. - I am journeyman in the house of Bidgood and Brown; I cannot swear to the cork further than missing about this quantity; when I came to work in the morning, my master asked me if I knew how I left the cork, I told him, yes, I left it piled up behind me; when I came up stairs the cork was scattered about the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the cork in the street, there was no person near, it was twenty yards from the door.</p>

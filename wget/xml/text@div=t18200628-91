            . On the 21st of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Back-church lane, Whitechapel. I <rs id="t18200628-91-viclabel506" type="occupation">keep an academy</rs>

I went to a public-house with her, two women of her acquaintance came in. I was with her an hour or two at the Jolly Sailors, till twelve or one o'clock; it being then late, I went to her lodgings, and was there till between two and three. I locked the door, put the key into my pocket, and took my notes out in her presence, to satisfy myself that they were safe. I only took my coat off and put it under the pillow. I was awoke in about half an hour by the door opening; I then found my coat at the bottom of the bed, and my notes gone, but the pocket-book remained - the prisoner had then got outside the door. I called for a light, they said they would bring me a knife if I did not immediately leave the house - there were ten or twelve persons in the house. I was struck with a shovel in the house, and terribly ill-used. Immediately as I said I would give her into custody, the prisoner made a blow at my head, I warded it off.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Watch about 20 minutes past two o'clock, and found West at the door in a terrible bustle. I asked for a light, one was brought, he said he had been robbed of three 1 l. notes. I found the prisoner standing at the foot of the bed - she wished to be searched - I found nothing on her. Four or five men and different women were in the house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking with my child, and met him with Jones, and they took me into a house, we eat and drank there, he was very tipsy. I took my child home and returned to him, he followed me home - and when I asked him for a compliment, he charged me with robbing him of his watch - he found that safe, and then charged me with stealing the notes - he struck me with the handle of the brush. I called out Murder! the mistress of the house came up, and he charged her with it. He had been at a notorious house in the neighbourhood all the afternoon drinking with Howard, who went to the office with him. I never touched his money.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 9th of April, I went into the country, and left a Mrs. Hussey and the prisoner to take care of the house. I came home on the Wednesday, and found the maid was gone; Mrs. Hussey told me she went on the Monday. I did not miss any thing then. The next day, Thursday, about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the closet and could not at first open it; at last I got it open, and immediately missed my box of money. I then missed my handkerchief and laced ruffles, and the next morning I missed my bag with all my lace in it. I then went to enquire after the prisoner; I found she had been at Mrs. Cole's, a dyer in Ratcliff-highway; they informed me she had fetched some things out of pawn which were at a pawnbroker's opposite. I went to the pawnbroker's to know if the prisoner had fetched any thing out of pledge, and enquired in what money she had paid for them? They said all in half crowns; my money was all in half crowns, except a five shilling and three penny piece of

I then concluded it was all over, and thought no more of it. On the 24th of May a young man came and told me that the person who had roobed me was in the Compter. I went to the Compter and saw the prisoner.

               <p>Did you make use of any promise to induce her to confess this? - No; after she had confessed, I said, I want nothing but my things, if I get them I will do you all the service I can. I got a search warrant to take up Mrs. Fieldhouse. I went to Ann Fieldhouse's to look for the things, and a constable with me, as soon as I got the warrant. I believe I found my child's muslin cloak cut and part made into a cap, the remainder was there; it was a muslin cloak worked with lace all round it; I found my bag there.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there at the time? - No, she remained in the Compter; I went to a pawnbroker's and there I found five yards of my silk, and three pieces of lace; they denied every thing else. I went in a coach with Mrs. Fieldhouse to her sister's; there I found a gown and coat. The prisoner had told me that the person where she lodged had sold all the things to Mrs. Fieldhouse's sister.</p>

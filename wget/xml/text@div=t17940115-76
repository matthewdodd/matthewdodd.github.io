             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of this month I was at Mr. Lee's, a stationer, in Compton-street, the house is situated with a corner that is round, and one side of the door was shut, and the other open; I was in the back room, and standing by the fire side; a man came into the fore shop, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150208"></xptr>asked for a half pennyworth of paper, and he looked where I was, and he said, there is a dancing master; they said, no; I came out of the back room and saw a man at the door that was shut up, the side of Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he was the outside of the door next to Greek-street, behind the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

            Is the door that leads into Greek-street a solding door? - Yes. I saw the man behind the half door that was shut, as I was coming out, and so I went to come out by the door that was open, and then he fell on me, and struck me, and laid hold of the chain of my watch and threw me down, having the chain of my watch in his hand; but having a button to my fob he could not get the watch out, but he got the entire chain. It was a gold chain with three gold seals, and two gold keys; the whole cost me upwards of fifteen guineas, the chain cost me about six guineas, one seal, my coat of arms, cost me five guineas engraving, and a guinea and a half setting. I know the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that robbed you? - Being on the ground I called out stop thief! and the man was immediately taken, within two or three doors from where he committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see him before he was taken? - I took notice of him at the time that he fell on me and struck me, but not so far that I could be positive to his face, but I am positive to his dress, which was a very dark brown, and his hair was remarkable, came down half way of his face, such as he appears to be now.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any thing more with respect to the person of the man that robbed you? - No, I cannot say any thing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was it a foggy evening? - No, quite a clear night, there was a lamp at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your spectacles on at the time? - No, I can see very well, but not to read any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person who robbed you before you was pushed down? - No, I see his back, and then I thought it was Mr. Lee's man, who was there ready to open my chariot door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite thrown down? - Quite flat, and very much hurt in my knee, which I feel the pain now at this present time.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a man came in and asked if you was a dancing master? Did you make any particular observations on that man? - No, I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your carriage at the door? - My carriage was in Greek-street, but the horses were almost a head to the door; if the coachman had been in Compton-street he would have been the whole affair, but he saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What age are you? - Eighty next August.</p>

             sworn;</p>
               <p>I lodge at the house of Mr. Lee, stationer, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you happen to be in the shop at the time this accident took place? - I went to wait on Mr. Belliard out of doors; I observed a man within side of the doors; I had been called out by a little girl to come into the shop, supposing he wanted to buy something; the man was inside of the door that was shut to, in the shop, on the steps, it was a folding door one half shut; his right hand was against the part of the door that was shut, and with his left hand he endeavoured to shut that door that was open, to force Mr. Belliard out, which by the force of his pushing the door he fell into Compton-street; the double door looks into both streets, it is a round door, and one part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150209"></xptr>looks into Compton-street, and the other in Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed? - The man picked him up at the same time, and at that time, I suppose he took the chain. Mr. Belliard then said, he has picked my pocket; the man immediately ran, and I called stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing this man before you went out? - No. I cried stop thief in the street; I see his face sufficient at the time that he picked Mr. Belliard up, to know, when taken, that he was the man that threw him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the person of the man? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the person that was taken, was the man that you saw with Mr. Belliard? - I am; I observed that he was particularly pale, that his hair was at that time loose, and very low on his cheeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain that the man that was afterwards taken was the man that threw Mr. Belliard down? - I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the prisoner to be the man? - I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he is the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are positive as to the man that threw this gentleman down? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you don't know that to be the same man? - I hardly saw him enough to swear to him at this distance of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me in what time he was brought back? - In five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him then? - I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This house is round at the corner, but one side is Greek-street, and the other is Compton-street? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. So this person might have run up Greek-street, towards Soho Square, gone down Greek-street, towards Newpart Market, Compton-street, or towards Carnaby Market? - He might.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there four different ways from these houses? - There is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So that at this spot where Mr. Belliard was thrown down, they might have taken four courses? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend asked you if you observed the man do this? and the answer you gave was, no; I dare say you remember it.</p>

               <p>Court. The question was, did you observe the man in the shop? - I remember saying that the man was within side the door, but I had not an opportunity of seeing his face, because his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You said the man was within side the door with his right hand or left was it, that he pulled the door to? - With his left hand, with his back towards the counter, within side of the half door that was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on shutting the door within side of the shop he endeavoured to shut the door on himself, and Mr. Belliard? - Yes, at the same time to prevent, as I supposed, me from coming out.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain that about his hand? - The door was open on his left hand side of coming out of the shop, his right hand against the part of the door that was shut, his hand was about Mr. Belliard, and he endeavoured to shut the door on himself; and Mr. Belliard at the same time, and pulled the door to after him, there is only one step.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then what Mr. Belliard said that he was waiting outside of that part of that door that he shut at the time he got out is not correct? - He may mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Belliard is not correct that the man was outside of the door when he went out? - Not in that point.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to look to that man at the bar, I believe you do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150210"></xptr>find that his hair is not very much over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. That hair is curled, I believe you will find I shall be able to convince you that his hair is in the same situation as it always was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find that to be the case of his hair now? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that which attracted your attention to the man's person was the hair being so much over the face? - From the size of the man altogether. I see him a moment or two before he threw Mr. Belliard down, but I see his face when he listed Mr. Belliard up.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing his hair is not in the same situation in which it was on this day, he is not the man? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you was a good deal slurried on this occasion? - I was at seeing Mr. Belliard thrown down.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe so much frightened that when you saw Mr. Belliard thrown down you screamed out? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And till the man was listing Mr. Belliard up, you had no opportunity of seeing his face? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that threw Mr. Belliard down listed him up likewise? - I am sure of that</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct any body to look up that part of the street that looked towards Soho? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any passage but that one you thought the man ran by? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever search has been made after these seals and chain, they never have been found at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether the prisoner was searched in your presence, when he was taken? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Bow-street? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe in point of fact which way the man did run? - Up Old Compton street towards Princes-street.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS DAWKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a footman to the Dutchess of Bedford.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was in Compton-street last Thursday seven night, in the evening, between five and six? - I was walking very fast towards Dean-street, Soho, I got past Mr. Lee's, on the opposite side of the way I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned my head and I saw the man run from Mr. Lee's door, he might be the space of one house from the door before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going in the same line as you was? - He was, only it was the other side of the way, I ran across directly, in about five or six doors I stopped him and had him back to Mr. Lee's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the street in which you saw him? - In Compton-street, and Mr. Belliard said that he believed he was the man that robbed him of his chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lady there when you carried him back? - There was Mrs. Bemsleet; she said the believed he was the man; she said the thought it was the same by his black hair and his face being so very pale; the watchman took charge of him directly, and took him to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - When I got him and he was going along, he said he was not the man, I threw him against some shutters that jetted out at the corner, about five doors from Mr. Lee's, he was not searched in my presence, he said he was not the thief, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the man that you secured if you was to see him? - I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no doubt but what he is the man that you stopped, you had not the curiosity to look up Greek-street, whether there was any body running that way? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had past Mr. Lee's door when you saw him? - He had about one door and I rushed across, and in about five doors I stopped him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he to go any where else after that? - He was to go to the grinder's to bring some flax, to go on with his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where that grinder lived? - Edmonds's-court, Leicester-street, Leicester-fields, the bottom of Compton-street, in the parish of Soho.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150212"></xptr>We waited till five o'clock, expecting him to come to tea, I was in the room when the prisoner set out, and he worked with us all day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard of his having been taken up? - In the course of half an hour, he sent a messenger to me to inform me he was in St. Ann's watch-house; in consequence of that I went immediately to him to the watch-house, the patrole and the constable were searching of him when I went in, and he cried and said they had charged him with a robbery, and he was quite innocent, he knowed nothing of it, for he was running to the grinder's for some flax; I went up with him to the office myself, and gave the same account as I give here, to the best of my knowledge, every word. I never worked with a soberer man, or an honester man in my life, and has never been a night out of his lodging.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give that account before the magistrate, that he was going to the grinder's? - He did, and the magistrate said he was very sorry that with such a character he was obliged to commit him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any candles in the shop when you was thrown down and robbed? - Yes, there were candles light, it wanted about a quarter to six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rains to Reach. When did you first hear of the robbery? - About half after five, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am a boot-closer, in Exeter-street, I work with Roach, and the prisoner at the bar, I work for Mr. Hoby.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at work with the prisoner at the bar the day he was taken up? - I was, he left off work at dark; he said he was sorry that he had got to go out, he wanted to make another shoe that night, and if it had not been so late in the week for taking his linen, he would not have gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say his washerwoman lived? - In Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he to go any where else besides the washerwoman? - I cannot say, he did not mention, but I believe afterwards he went for flax; he was using my flax all the day; it is a custom to lend one another our flax, when our flax is out, until we have an opportunity of going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he got his flax? - No, I don't know, sometimes at one place, and sometimes at another, where ever we get it bad one time, we make a point of going to another place the next time, to see if we can get it better.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bemfleet. You did not state before whether there were any lights in the shop? - There were two candles on the counter.</p>

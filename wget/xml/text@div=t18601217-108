                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Akers, of Fox-place, Woolwich—On Saturday, 8th December, I was at Mr. Bland's shop at Woolwich about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse in my. pocket, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in my pocket—while I was in the shop I had my hand in my pocket with the purse in it—I saw the prisoner there—she was standing on the side where my pocket was—I took my hand out of my pocket when I went up to the counter—I do not think it could have been more than a, minute and a half before I felt in my pocket again on going to pay for my meat, and my purse was gone, and I looked round and the prisoner was gone at the same instant—there was a gentleman near me at the time, but he was standing on the other side of the prisoner—I gave information to the police, and about half-past 12 the prisoner was taken—I am sure she is the person that had been in the shop—I had never seen her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you state what brought me to the police-office when you made a prisoner of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Your husband had beta ill-using you, and as I was stating my case to the inspector, the constable came and told me that the woman who had robbed me was outside, and I went out and saw you there—I could swear to you by your bonnet and shawl, and by your face too—you had a faint black eye at the time you picked my pocket—I will swear you are the person that took my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Perceval, an engineer at Woolwich—I went into Mr. Bland's shop on this Saturday-night about ten minutes past 10, and saw the prisoner there—she took her hand out of toy pocket, but I had nothing in it, I had my money in my hand—in consequence of that I watched her—I saw her go up to the prosecutrix with her dress in her hand, and I spoke to Mr. Bland to keep her eye upon her—she</p>

               <p>remained at the prosecutrix's side—while my meat was being weighed, my attention was taken from the prosecutrix, and Mr. Bland said, "That woman is gone"—I looked, and found she had gone, and the prosecutrix missed her money directly—the prisoner did not buy anything in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me take the woman's money, or see my hand in her pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw your hand on her dress, and about three weeks before this you had your hand in my pocket in a shop in Powis-street, but you shammed being tipsy at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 4th February I lived at 65, Great Peter-street, Westminster—the prisoner is my husband—on Saturday, 4th February,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186002270005"></xptr>
               <p>between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I was going up Regent-street, West<lb></lb>minster, to the pawnbroker's—I heard my husband at that time crying his fish—he gets his living by selling fish about the streets—after I heard him call I went up, as I generally do, to see how he got on with his fish—he swore at me, and said he could not sell them—I only asked him how he was getting on—he did not say anything more after that—I went a little way down the street while he was serving at two places—I thought he was coming back again and I stood at the corner of the street—instead of that he went towards home and I ran after him with the key of the room, which I had—when I overtook him all I said was "You had better take the key if you are going home, because you know where I have got to go back again"—he took the key but never spoke—he then went up Earl-street—he there stopped his barrow—I saw him take something off his barrow and come towards me, but he never spoke—at first I thought it was the little board that he scrapes the fish on, but I could not see—when he came within reach he struck at me and I put up my hands to prevent it—he did not speak then—I did not speak after that; I could not—he struck me in the neck—he only made one blow at me—all I said was that he had better not do that—I felt something stick in my neck—I don't recollect anything more—when I came to myself I was in the doctor's, Mr. Pearce's in Regent-street—I was in a fainting state—they were giving me water—they had bandaged my neck up then—I saw my bonnet—I could not see my neck; the blow was quite behind—my bonnet was stained with the fish, where the knife went through the cap—the bonnet was cut—I did not see anything in the hand of the prisoner—I am blind with the right eye—the prisoner met me face to face, and I turned my head—I turned the eye which was sightless towards him, to prevent him hitting me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—it is my husband's knife.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is his fish knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was married to the prisoner in 1855—we have not lived very happily—I have left him and gone to service two or three times, and he has always made me go back to him when he has found me—I never struck him—I have been obliged to run away from him—he took my eye out with a fork—I did not strike him on any occasion—he was the worse for liquor on this occasion—he did not say many words—he only swore and said he could not sell the things—I had not just previously to that been speaking to him in very harsh language, scolding and abusing him—it is all false—I had not said a word to him, for I was frightened, I dare not answer him—at dinner time that day he took my dinner away from me—I had not had any meat all the week, and he said I should not have any then, and he tried to strike me with a knife—I did not quarrel with him at all—he had given me some money to redeem some things—that was before he left, at the time I went to the pawnbroker's, and I had to wait there a long time, and I heard him crying out his fish, and I went out to him, naturally enough, to see how he was getting on—all I said was "Owen, how are you getting on"—I said nothing about any woman—there is no truth in that—I was not for two or three days previously continually charging him with going after some other woman.</p>

               <p>—I was passing by Thomas's-brewery, in Westminster, between 7 and 8 o'clock on Saturday night, the 4th February—I there saw the prisoner and the last witness—they were both speaking at different intervals—I walked a few steps and turned round—after doing that I saw the prisoner come from his barrow—he, as I thought, struck her with his fist—he raised his arm—I did not see anything in his hand, but the next moment the prosecutrix cried out that she was stabbed—I went up to her—the prisoner walked away with his barrow—I found the prosecutrix bleeding profusely from her neck—two other men came up and took her to the doctor's, and I went in search of the prisoner—I could not find him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 45, Marchmont-street, Westminster—the prosecutrix was brought to my shop about half-past 7 on Saturday evening, 4th February, in an insensible condition—I examined her—I found her bleeding from a wound on the right side of the neck—it was about an inch long—I probed it—it was about half-an-inch deep, rather more—in the immediate neighbourhood of the wound there are many large vessels and arteries—looking at the position and nature of the wound, it was likely to have been most serious—I am only astonished that the woman was not killed—it might have been an inch-and-a-half from the jugular vein—it was within one-eighth of an inch of the carotid artery—when she was first brought in and laid on the floor I thought she was dead—she is now in a bad state of health from loan of blood—this knife is a sort of instrument which might have inflicted the wound.</p>

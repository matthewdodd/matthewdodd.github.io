               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long is it since you were confined? A. Fourteen years, and you were my Counsel- I have carried on business at this house ever since; I am certain he never gave me this money. A crucible is necessary in my trade - I have never been censured about that. The prisoner never pretended to enter this amount.</p>

            . I am clerk to Buckle, and produce his books: here is an order entered from Messrs. Ward, on the 8th of August; the goods were delivered that day to them, in Water-street, Whitefriars - this entry is in Mr. Buckle's son's writing; the amount is not put against them. Here is the cash book - it is not entered there: there is no entry of 2l. 9s. received from Mr. Ward: all this page is in his writing; it extends to the 29th of September: there is no entry at all of any money received from Ward; all the entries are in his writing, except one of the 11th of August - I do not know whose writing this is. Mr. Buckle keeps the book, and, when the money comes in, he gives the prisoner the book to enter it: the order-book lays on the desk, and the entries are made by whoever is present, but the cash-book is kept by the prisoner, as confidential clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not other people enter in it as well as him? A. I have done so; I do not know that any body else has ever made an entry in it - I am Buckle's son-in-law: the entries on one side of the book is of monies paid away. When Skinner is absent, other people enter that: I have made entries since I have been home, since October; I see no writing in it besides mine and Skinner's - it is always kept locked up in the safe: I do not know what happened before October, except from the book: the prosecutor's son occasionally entered goods that went out: he was there in August: there is no other persons hand-writing in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whose hand-writing is the side on which monies received are entered? A. That is all the prisoners, except one entry in August.</p>

            . I am one of the firm of Ward and Co., of Water-street, Bridgewell-precinct: I received some goods from Buckle in August, and on the 1st of September, the prisoner applied for payment; I was behind my desk, and gave my clerk 2l. 13s. 1d., which was 4s. 1d. more than I ought to have paid; I saw him take it round, and hand it to the prisoner; he gave me a receipt, which I produce; I believe it to be his writing - the bill is made out by him. Mr. Buckle afterwards sent in a bill, and it was charged 1d. a pound less.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner give that receipt into your hand? A. He gave it to my clerk or me, I cannot swear which, but think I saw him hand it to my clerk. I swear I saw him receive the money; I saw him writing, and the receipt came round to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was anybody but yourself and clerk in the counting-house when the prisoner received the money? A. No; my clerk was not out of my sight before I had the receipt in my possession: I have no doubt of its being his writing. - (Receipt read.) I had not dealt with Mr. Buckle for anything but these goods at this time.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a glass petition round your desk? A. No - it has open rails; my clerk is not here: I must have spoken to the prisoner myself - I heard him say he came from Mr. Buckle for the amount of the bill.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BUCKLE. When I found he had received a good deal of my property, I took him and gave him in charge - he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say nothing to him? A. I might tell him I was sorry for him; I had offered to be bound for him before I found this out, if he could get a situation; my son does not live with me; I do not know where he lives; he is twenty-three years old; he never made entries in the cash-book. I have no intercourse with him now; I do not know whether he is married - we have had words.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever make a mistake? A. I certainly have - I never omitted to enter money received.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cause of my present situation is the extraordinary manner in which my employer conducts' his business: he received money from me often, and immediately ordered me into the warehouse to pack up goods, before he allowed me to enter it. I had immense business on my hands and have forgotten to enter it, having all the goods to enter which had been sent out during my absence; and thinking he was not in the habit of examining the books, I have omitted to enter it till it has escaped my memory. <rs id="t18280221-63-verdict333" type="verdictDescription">

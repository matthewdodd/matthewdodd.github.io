                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner on a warrant on 26th July at 48, Drummond Crescent—I went into the house and said "Are you Henry George Hyde?"—he said "Yes"—I read the warrant to him—he said "I did not forge it, and that is all I know about it"—I asked him for his box or writing-desk—he said "I have nothing here; all the certificates I sent in I had from my employer; I had good testimonials from the Rev. Mr. Canning and others"—he gave me his age as 21.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Civil Service Commission—the prisoner was a candidate as subordinate officer in the prison service in June last—candidates in London go to the Home Office and fill up a form of application, and are then taken to a room before the directors of the convict prisons and they consider whether the applicant should have a nomination,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050078"></xptr>
               <p>and he is then taken to a doctor and examined—an order is sent to him and a form filled up before he attends to be examined—the prisoner was in<lb></lb>structed to attend on 23rd June—on the 21st I received this form filled up—he came on the 23rd and was examined—he came to me immediately afterwards, and I went through the form with him, asking him questions with reference to the particulars, and wrote down his answers in red ink—he produced this indenture of apprenticeship, endorsed, "We the under<lb></lb>signed can fully and confidently recommend Henry G. Hyde, our late apprentice, for his honesty and good conduct, &amp;c., &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> "Arthur J. Lusher, John Lusher," <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 2nd May, 1878—I noticed a peculiarity in the spelling, and asked him to leave the indenture with me—I received this letter, which is in the same writing as the prisoner's entries on the form—I then communicated with Mr. Lusher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I cannot say whether you handed these certificates to me, I had so many candidates before me—I do not remember whether I ever saw them, but I believe not—Mr. Davis a printer gave me a good reference, but you had only been with him a short time—we look at the indenture of apprenticeship more than anything else—if we have a certi<lb></lb>ficate of faithful service, we privately communicate with the parties.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer in partnership with my brother at Diss, in Norfolk—the prisoner was apprenticed to us in June, 1872, and left us on 28th April, 1877—the signature to this endorsement on the inden<lb></lb>ture of apprenticeship is a forgery—I know the prisoner's writing and believe it to be his—it is not a correct character—I was communicated with by the Civil Service Commissioners in June—the prisoner's mother called upon me and this letter of 30th June is in the prisoner's writing—I have no charge of dishonesty or insobriety; I was not satisfied as to his respectability—he had bad associates and I warned him from time to time—I had no idea the endorsement was on the indenture—the indenture was not given up, when he left it was in the hands of a person who held it for both parties, and I did not endorse or authorise the endorsement of that certificate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that he wrote to his friends to ask Mr. Lusher to Jill up a form for him, as he said he would give him a reference, and on receiving the reference he took it to Westminster and was not aware it was forged, and subsequently receiving a letter to sag that Mr. Lusher would not give him a reference, he wrote to withdraw the application, and heard nothing more till taken in custody.</hi>

She had 1 l. 13 s. in her box, but I cannot swear to the money; the silk handkerchief and the ring I know to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge the prisoner with taking these things? - A. I missed the handkerchief about two months ago; I asked her about it then; I called her up and asked her about it, and she denied having any knowledge of it. The handkerchief my husband took off his neck on the Sunday morning, rolled it up in his working cloath, and put them altogether on the tester of the bedstead; I missed it the same day in about half an hour afterwards, when I was putting his working things to rights, (my husband is a packer) then I asked her about it, she denied it. I found it in her trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever searched her trunk before? - A. She opened her trunk at the time she came to fetch her things away; she quitted my service on Friday, and came on the Monday to take her things away; on Friday her master and she had a few words, so she went off on her own accord. When she first came to my service she demanded seventeen shillings to take her things out of pawn, which I gave her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid her any wages? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any due? - A. I dare say there must be some trifle; I agreed with her for four pounds ten shillings a year; she lived with me about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came for her trunk what passed between her and you? - A. I told her that her master insisted on having her trunk searched; the trunk was locked; she said I might go up stairs with her and see what was in it; I went up with her, and in looking over the things in the trunk, I happened to see the silk handkerchief in an old piece of a stocking; I asked her if that was not my handkerchief; she said it was; I sent for a constable, and had her taken up; the constable searched her trunk, and found nothing else but a brass ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing said why she took it? - A. She said nothing more than that it was my handkerchief, and that she had taken it; and this brass ring, it is but a little circumstance, I do not know when I missed it; that is all that was found that I can swear to. This is the handkerchief, and this is the ring; there are two holes in the handkerchief, and it is very indifferently hemmed; a friend of mine hemmed it; I can swear to it. Directly after the handkerchief was found, I had her taken up on the Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. It seems you had been at this box before; when was it you first looked in this trunk? - A. On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell us so - where did you find her trunk? - A. In the garret; she attempted to lock the trunk, but it happened that the staple was not fastened in the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not locked then? - 
               <persName id="t18051030-6-person104">A. </persName>
            No; I left it then, and locked the room-door.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you swear that you found it open? - A. Yes; she came in my place at night; I said, Nanny, your master insists upon having your trunk searched; if you have got any thing in your trunk, you had better give it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not tell us one word about this before; you left the money and the handkerchief in the trunk? - A. Yes, I did; on Sunday it was in the place where she left it; on Sunday night, when she found my back turned, she stole up stairs in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her go up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then who went up stairs, you cannot tell? - A. I found my door burst open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after you found your room door burst open, go and look in the trunk? - A. I did, and found the trunk locked, so as I had not left it. I took the trunk directly into my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the handkerchief that you charge her with taking, left in the trunk? - A. Yes. On the Monday morning she came and demanded the things; I happened to go up with her, and she opened her trunk, and in pulling her things about, this handkerchief was pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came on the Sunday afternoon, after you had rumaged her trunk, and had seen the money and the handkerchief, how came you not to have her taken up then? - A. I would have taken her up, but she stole away from me when I was called away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her that you had searched her trunk, and what you had seen in her trunk? - A. I did not, I told her her master would have her trunk searched.</p>

            (To Macartney.) What time on Sunday afternoon was it, that you were along with Mrs. Jordan, and you searched the prisoner's trunk? - A. About two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I was helping her to lift the box up on the drawers; the lock burst open, Mrs. Jordan said here is Mary's box open, she said she had better look in it, for her husband had often told her he suspected her stealing his silk handkerchief; she looked in it, and found the money and the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take any thing out? - A. No, she put all back again.</p>

            . On the 11th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner in King-street, about three doors from Mr. Standley's, with some cotton under her cloak, which did not quite conceal it, the bundle being very large; I went to Mr. Standley, and asked him if had lost any thing; I told him of my suspicion, and went away. As I crossed Henrietta-street I saw her again, asking a woman to assist her in covering the cotton over; I went and told her she had stolen the things, and to take them back to where she took them from; she said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, never mind that, come with me, and you and I will settle it." I told her she should go with me, and took her back. She carried the bundle into the shop.</p>

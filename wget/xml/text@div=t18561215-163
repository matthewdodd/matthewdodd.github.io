I purchased at a sale at the Tower, 200 linen mattresses—on Wednesday, 26th, I went to the docks to take them away; having sent a barge there, and loaded 200 into the barge, ten at a time—they were French hospital mattresses, a large blue check, but nine of them were a smaller check—the hair was long and soft, different to what canvas mattresses have—the barges were put into my son's custody, and on Thursday, 27th, I examined them at my premises, and there were only 192—I informed the police, and on 28th saw some hair at the station very like what I had missed, and the covering also.</p>

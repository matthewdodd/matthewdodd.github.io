                  </hi>. I am a furniture manufacturer, and live in the Whitechapel-road. The male prisoner was in my service on the 6th of June, as a mattress-maker—he lived out of the house—I never authorized him to take. any carpet from my premises—the carpet produced is my property—I know it by these marks (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>)—it is put on by us—this small piece wai produced from Dowson's—it was safe on my premises in March last, and was never sold—my shopmen, Lishman and Sayer, and others have authority to sell as well as myself, but the others have left and gone into the country—they left after the 7th of June—one of them, a female, I believe assisted in stealing the property—I have lost a carpet of this pattern—this was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. yards—it was in a roll when it left my premises—it is now made into a carpet—I had inquired for it between March and June—I never in<lb></lb>quired of the prisoner for it.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">DOWSON</hi>. I keep a warehouse at Greenwich, for new property gene<lb></lb>rally—I have been a pawnbroker.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you did not buy it of the male prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Blenman always acted as salesman for himself and partner, as he represented the male prisoner—he made that representation in the male prisoner's presence in this in<lb></lb>stance—this piece is fifteen yards and three quarters—it was bought in a roll, and afterwards made up—I reckon this at about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I have my book with me—there is no name to the entry; but from the entry, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying this is the transaction—we have fifty trans-actions in a day with men who bring goods—the trade price of this is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. without being soiled.</p>

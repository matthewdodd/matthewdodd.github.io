                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, X</hi> 259). From information I received, I went on Monday, 11th December, about half-past 9 in the morning, to the prisoner's house on Uxbridge-common—I went into the bed-room, and saw two small mutton-bones, which were cooked, on the table-Henry White was in bed-1 asked him how he could account for the meat that these bones belonged to—he said that he did not know-David was out then—I went and took him afterwards—It is David's house, and the son lives with him—I then went upstairs, searched the bed-room, and found two fore-quarters of mutton and a piece of the neck, in a drawer, and a piece of lights and liver on the table—I sent for another constable to assist me, and left him in charge of Henry White—I took David about half an hour afterwards, up the George-road, a little way off—I took him to his house, and asked him how he came in possession of that meat—he said, "1 know nothing about it"—I found a pocket-knife in David's coat-pocket—It had some fresh blood on it, and some wool—I noticed blood on Henry White's trousers—I found fresh blood at the bottom of the legs, as if something bloody had been pushed against it—on the morning of the 12th, I took both prisoners' boots into the field, where the sheep had been kept—there were foot-prints in the field—I compared the boots with the tracks of two persons, to and fro—there were several nails out, and the place where the nails were out, exactly corresponded with the tracks in the field—on the same morning, I found a hurdle close to the place where the sheep had been stolen; I produce a piece of wool from it—there was an impression on the wool, that had been made by the trousers that Henry was wearing, as if he had sat on it—the prisoner's house is about 300 or 400 yards from where the sheep was stolen—I produce a skin—there is a head and neck that fits in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I had fifteen foreign sheep in a field at Uxbridge, on Sunday, 10th December I sent my boy to see them on the 9th—I had seen them two or three days before-my attention was called to the skin and entrails of a sheep which had been found in a field on the Sunday morning, as I was riding down to look at my cattle-fourteen remained; I missed one—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the skin of one of my sheep—It is marked on the head with ochre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher—I examined the neck of mutton, with the head and skin of a sheep, they tally, and are part of the same animal—I have matched part of the ribs with the skin, where a small piece of meat had been left on the skin—there is a vacant place where the neck has been parted—the sheep was not killed as a butcher would kill it—It was killed in an unscientific way—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have been used to cut across, but it is not long enough to stick him through the neck.</p>

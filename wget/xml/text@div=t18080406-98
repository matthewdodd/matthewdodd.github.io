             rented a house of me, which communicated with my warehouse and yard. On the 26th of February, on my return home at nine in the evening, I was informed by my family that my son, who had returned about a quarter of an hour before, had detected the woman prisoner. In consequence of that I heard he was in the prisoner's house waiting till my return; I went to the prisoner's house and found him there. When I got in the woman prisoner was in the lower room; she asked me what business I had there; I told her I wanted to go up stairs; she violently resisted, she told me she would stab me, I had no business there without a search warrant, if I attempted to go up stairs she would swear a robbery against me. My son, as I suppose, on hearing my voice, called down stairs for me to go up; I went up in the two pair of stairs room, where I found my son; there was a saw and small hatchet, and staves split to pieces, a great quantity of it there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many staves do you think there might be - A. About one hundred and fifty; we brought away thirty whole staves; this stick, cloth, and canvas, was laying under a bed in the same room; this stick I have travelled many miles with it; I know it well, and the flannel and the canvas.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the prisoner - A. He works on the road as a labourer.</p>

Yes; the man exclaimed, stamped his foot on the floor, and said through his bitch of a wife he should be transported for them staves; he run down stairs; I saw no more of him till Monday night he was brought to the office; this was on Friday night.</p>

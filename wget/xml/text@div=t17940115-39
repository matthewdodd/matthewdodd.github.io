On Thursday he pushed me very hard for fifteen pounds, I denied him because I thought there was something in him not right, at different times he would go and sit down in different parts of my room and fall a crying, and tare his hair, and then he would come to me and want money; we missed him on the Friday night, on the Saturday morning he came into my house about eight o'clock in the morning and asked me for a horse; I let him have a horse, he said, he would go down in the country and see his wife's relations; on the Saturday morning his late wife came to my house and asked for Mr. Spendelow, the reply I made was that he was gone out of town; my wife informed her that Mr. Spendelow had gone down to see his wife's relations; she asked whether he had a wife? my wife replied that he had been married for upwards of four years; she says I was married to him yesterday; I said I am very sorry for it, but I don't think he is right in his mind; says she, I thought so, for he pinched me here, and he pinched me here, I never was served so before; I asked her how long she had known him? She said since Tuesday morning.</p>

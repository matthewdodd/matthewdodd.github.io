                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Morris, and live in New Inn-passage, near Houghton-street. I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on the 30th of October—I returned at ten minutes before eight o'clock, and perceived my room door ajar—I had seen my property Safe before I went out, and knowing that my door had been fast before, I rushed in, and found a man—I collared him, and he dropped something—he struggled with me all down stairs—at the street door he got from me, and ran off—I ran down Houghton-street after him—I am certain the pri<lb></lb>soner is the man—there was a public-house opposite, with a strong gas light—I could see him distinctly—I lost, him turning into Clement's</p>

               <p>Inn—I returned home, and found a bag in the place where I saw him drop something—I found these goods in it, which are my husband's—the prisoner was brought back, and I recognised him immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Clement's-lane—about five minutes before eight o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran up a court, and waited there till I saw the prisoner come up Grange-court—I ran before him—he ran into my arms—he said, "It was not me"—I said, "What made you run?"—he said, "Because others ran"—I asked him what made him so far in front—he said he was afraid of being taken—I took him back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say one word before the Justices about his being in front, and saying he was afraid of being taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—what I said was taken down and read over to me, I believe—it is not put down, but I mentioned it—I heard him deny all knowledge of it—I found on him a box of lucifer-matches and two mutton-chops.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner go into the passage at four o'clock, and three more in his company—one of them said something, and then the prisoner said,? I will be d----d if I don't have something "—one of the others made use of a bad expression, and said, "I commend your <hi rend="italic">pluck</hi>"—I went up stairs, and was there three quarters of an hour—I then came down, and went out for half an hour—then I returned, and the prisoner was there again—I was going to Mr. Higgins, the schoolmaster, to know whether the family was at home—I saw Mr. Higgins come out; and about twenty minutes to eight o'clock I came down for a pint of ale, and brought down a bent sixpence—the publican would not take it, and I went back to my mother—as I came back I saw the prisoner with a bag, at the top of New Inn-passage, alone—his two companions stood at the corner of Newcastle-street—I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's door with the bag in his hand—I did not take any notice of his going in—I positively swear he is the man that went in—I saw him when he was taken—I said, "That is the fellow I have seen lurking about Clare-market for three months, in a manner he could not have been if he had been in any employment "—I went to Bow-street to ascertain if he was the same person I saw go into the house—that was before he was examined—I did not state this before the Magistrate—I was not called upon.</p>

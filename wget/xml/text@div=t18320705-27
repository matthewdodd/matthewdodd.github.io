            . I took the coach with my wife; she sat on the back seat, with her face towards the horses - I saw the purse on that seat shortly before the coach stopped; I got out first to get the door open, and as soon as my wife got into the passage, she said, "I have left my purse" - I turned to the coach, and the prisoner was then leaning into the coach, and was in the act of getting the luggage out; I told him she had left the purse on the seat - he drew back for me to look in; I looked in, and on the seat, but I saw nothing of it - I told him he must have it, and if he did not give it up I would give him in charge; he denied having seen it, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was there any straw at the bottom of the coach? A. I cannot say; there was a mat - the front seat was full of luggage; the purse might have been drawn down - the prisoner had not been paid; he offered to be searched, and unbuttoned his waistcoat, but I told him I had no power to search him - he made no opposition to my searching the coach, but he did not look into the coach after I went to him; the coach was taken to the station-house, and there the purse was found - I think we had four or five parcels.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he search the coach himself? A. No, he did not; he did not get into the coach - he said,"Search me;" I looked into the coach, but did not make a minute search.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of Police. The coach and the prisoner were brought to our station; I turned all out, and found this purse concealed under the hind seat, behind some nose-bags - it was completely behind every thing; it evidently appeared to me, that it must have been put there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That is your opinion? A. Yes, there is a board goes along the coach under the seat, but there is an open space between the seat and that; I do not think the purse could have been thrown there by taking out the luggage, or by pulling the mat up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might it not have fallen under the seat? A. It might have fallen, but I do not know where it was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When they asked me about the purse, I said I had not seen it, which I had not; the luggage was taken out - I took off the cushion, and asked the prosecutor to look in, but he said he would not till he had me taken to the station - I then pushed in the nose-bags again, and put in the cushions, but I had not seen the purse.</p>

            . Q. Was it found under the seat they had been sitting on? A. Yes, and under the nose-bags; it could not have got there accidentally - there was no luggage on the bottom of the coach; it was on the opposite seat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look on the seat first? A. Yes, then turned up the cushions, and then felt in the pockets: I then found it under the seat, and under the nose-bags - some of them had corn in them, and some were empty; it appeared to me that the purse had been thrown there - it could not have jolted there, as it is up hill.</p>

               <p>I am employed as porter to the poor-house of St. Ann's, I was carrying these shirts to Dog and Duck-lane, and I fell down, and the prisoner came up to me, and says he, old man, how far are you going; I told him; he said he was going to the Borough, he said, I will carry your bundle a little for you, he took it off the stones, and I offered to take them from him; he said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200014"></xptr> will carry them a little further, I told him I had three halfpence, and that would be a pint of beer between us; he said he did not want that: we got into Whitechapel, and crossing the end of <placeName id="t17841020-4-crimeloc17">Goulston-street</placeName>

               <p>What was in the bundle? - Two dozen of ruffled shirts, and five plain; I was carrying them home to Mr. M'Cullock's, in Dog and Duck-lane, they had been made at the poor-House, they were wrapped up in this canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Who does the bag belong to? - To the poor-house; there is St. Ann's, Westminster, upon it.</p>
               <p>What was the name of the man that came up to you when you called stop thief? - Symons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether I took the bag or he gave it me? - He took it off the stones where it lay when I fell down.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was the prisoner dressed? - A very good brown coat, very gental, like a coachman, he was neat and clean.</p>
               <p>HYAM SYMONS sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, I let him go through the square, the prosecutor could not run after him, he fell down every minute so, I thought he was in liquor; he came up to my house, he said he fell down, and the prisoner took the bag from him, and he offered him a pint of beer to carry it; I went with him through the square, and enquired about it, and I found the prisoner under a dray with the property.</p>
               <p>Did you keep your eye on the prisoner all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with you? - Nobody but the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed then? - He had a good coat on, I cannot be particular to the colour; the bundle was by him, under the dray.</p>

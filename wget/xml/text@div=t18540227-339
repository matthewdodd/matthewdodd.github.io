                  </hi>. I am master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Alcides</hi>, lying in the London Docks. On Tuesday evening, 21st Feb., I was at Mr. Law's-public house, at Wapping, about 9 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there; I came out with her; I went along the street with her a little <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, she wished for a glass of ale, and I went into a public house and gave her one; I paid for it with half a sovereign—I took that half sovereign out of a purse, there were twenty-three sovereigns there altogether—after taking out the half sovereign. I put back the purse in the same pocket; I am quite sure of that—that was the left trowsers pocket, and I buttoned it up—I afterwards went with the prisoner to a house that she called her mother's—she said nobody stopped there but her mother and a little niece; we went up stairs to a small room—that was three or four minutes after I had changed the half sovereign—there was a little girl in the house—she was not in the room when we first went in, the prisoner called her up—when we went into the room the pri<lb></lb>soner told me to pull off my trowsers and stockings; 1 did so, but I insisted on her stripping a" well—I put my trowsers on two little shelves by the window—the prisoner did not strip—she went down stairs with the girl and had some communication, and came up again, and called the girl up—she only took her shawl off—it was before she went down that I took off my trowsers—she was gone about a minute and a half—nobody came into the room while she was away—when she came up again she called up the girl to put the window blind to rights—that girl is not here; she was</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate, but she has absconded—her name is Mary Ann Harvey—the little girl went to the window, and the prisoner went along with her to the window, and took my trowsers into her hand, dropped them on the floor; they both turned, and she ran out instantly—I instantly went to my trowsers, put my hand in the pocket, and my purse and money were gone; I put my trowsers on, went down, stairs in half a second, and called out for a policeman—I was looking out for the prisoner that night and the night following with a policeman; she was not taken till the Friday night—the little girl who came into the room was a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

GEARY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What o'clock was it when you went into the first public house where you met the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half past 8 o'clock—I only took a glass of hot grog, and 1 gave the prisoner part of it—I had a single glass of ale at the second public house, no spirits—I had put the purse in my pocket when I came out of the bank, and counted the sovereigns—I paid my crew, and then counted what cash I had left—I went with the prisoner to the house she asked me to go to; I only saw the little girl there; I think that she asked upstairs for the price of the room, and I said I would pay her by-and-bye, or afterwards—I think the price was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I forget now—the prisoner then called the little girl up again to bring a cloth and wipe up some water which was spilled at the foot of the bed—she did so, and went down stairs instantly; and the prisoner directly told me to take off my clothes, which I did, of course, directly; but she was busy about something else, and did not wish to take off her clothes, I suppose; she called the girl up again, and told her to put the window blind to rights; she did so, and the prisoner went with her, and took hold of my trowsers which were lying there; they then both went out of the room together; I got hold of my trowsers and missed my money—I saw nobody when I went down stairs, the little girl was not there, I looked for her with a policeman—I did not charge her with robbing me, I had no occasion, as I had seen the prisoner with my trowsers—I did not see the prisoner take my purse, but she had my trowsers in her hand, and dropped them directly—I went before the Magistrate on the Friday; no, on the Saturday—I do not exactly know the date; it was the day after the prisoner was found—I had been searching for her every night since Tuesday, but did not mark the day I found her—the little girl went before the Magistrate, I made no charge against her—she was bound over to appear here—I have not taken any steps to bring her here to-day; but a policeman was sent down to the house to see and find her, but could not—when this took place I was as sober as I am now.</p>

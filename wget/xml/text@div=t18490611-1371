                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 89). On 12th May I took the prisoner and a woman for uttering counterfeit coin—Ings took the woman—when I was booking the charge at Rotherhithe, the prisoner continually interrupted the</p>

               <p>inspector, by calling me a b----y pig, vagabond, and rascal, and I was ordered to lock him up—he swore he would smash my b----y brains out and was struggling with my two brother constables—he threw himself down in the yard, and attempted to bite Ings in the thigh—he kicked me as I passed, and I found my arm powerless—I was in excruciating agony, and have been incapacitated ever since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 2). I was at the station-the prisoner was conducting himself very improperly—his language was very gross—he said, if he had an opportunity, he would smash in Whitlamb's b—y brains, or any other b—y constable, and if he had me outside he would do the same—two officers took hold of him—he grappled with then, and was very violent—I did not go into the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. Whitlamb called on me—I found his arm broken—he has been under my care ever since—I was at the station between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner complained very much of pain—I examined him, but found no marks on him—he was making a considerable noise.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was used most brutally; they pushed me down the steps, and we all fell together; they set <hi rend="italic">to</hi> kicking me, and kicked Whitlamb as well; the man who was locked up with me told what had happened, and about 200 people came to the station in the morning to see if I was dead; I have been laid up with a broken leg since Dec, and could not kick a mm with violence, and I had these light shoes on.</p>

The prisoner secreted himself in a back-room up one pair of stairs, on the 22nd of January. He removed a gown that was hung up to dry on a line; he took it down. My servant was going up stairs about a quarter before seven in the evening, in order to change her clothes. She found the prisoner in the back-room. She ran down stairs, holloaing out, murder. The prisoner followed her very rapidly. He was stopped in the passage. We sent for an officer, and had him taken up. I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mapp. I was going up stairs about a quarter before seven, to change my dress. I looked into the back-room to shut the window down. I saw the prisoner standing in the room with the gown in his hand. I ran down stairs, and the prisoner ran after me down stairs. A man caught him at the bottom of the stairs. He left the gown up stairs in the room.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170009"></xptr>He had taken it off the line. I am sure I saw him with the gown in his hand.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. He had nothing but a pair of breeches tied up in this handkerchief. He said, it was his own property. This is the gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken in custody was anything said about the gown.</p>
               <p>Munt. Not at that moment. The gown was brought down about two or three minutes after.</p>

            . Look at that gown - A. This is the gown that he had in his hand. I pinned it up with four pins in a back club room. I am sure I hung the gown up, and pinned it up with four pins.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the house to get a pint of beer. I asked the boy if I might take the liberty of going into the privy, and as I was just bracing myself up the girl came down stairs. I never saw the club-room, nor did I ever see the gown until it was produced before the Lord Mayor.</p>

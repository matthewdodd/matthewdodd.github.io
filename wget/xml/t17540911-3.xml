               <p>Symonds. I don't know the day of the month; but it was on a Friday six weeks ago, and in the night. We carried it in two parcels to one Cosgrave near the Victualing Office on Tower Hill to sell; we knocked and he was along time in getting up, and the watchman came and took us.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going to beat the hour one this night and past the prisoner and evidence, after which I saw them knocking at Cosgrave's door. I heard somebody on the inside unlocking the door, and turning myself saw the evidence lying on this tobacco upon the ground. I laid hold of him. When the man within heard me he would not open the door at all. I took the evidence to the watch house, but the prisoner ran away.</p>

            . I am concerned upon the key for Mr. Hunt. He and only he had tobacco that night in the place where the prisoner and accomplice say they took this from; it was rolled up under the gateway in order to be safe there till next morning, and then to be fetched away; there was a hole at the bottom of the gate where a person might creep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the duty paid?</p>
               <p>Robertson. It was.</p>

               <p>I met with the evidence going over Tower Hill. He asked me to go with him, which I did. He stopped against this door and sat down, but I did not know what he had got. The watchman came and said, Friend, I must stop you. I thought he was going to take him up for keeping disorderly hours, and so ran away, fearing he should lay hold on me; the next morning I was taken up by a warrant. I am but just come up out of Huntingtonshire, and am a stranger here.</p>

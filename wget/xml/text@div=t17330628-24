               <p>Mr. Manfield. On the 7th of June, about 11 at Night, I came from the Spaw by Islington, and crossing the Fields came into the Road to <placeName id="t17330628-24-crimeloc103">St. John's-street</placeName>

I here I was attack'd by 3 Men; one collar'd me, and another struck me on the Head with something that cut me into' my Hat and Wig. They demanded my Money; I put my Hand in one Pocket and gave them what I had there, but how much I cannot be certain. They took my Hat and Cane; but upon my a king for my Cane again, they return'd it to me. I believe they left me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280012"></xptr> sooner than they wou'd have done for fear of the Drovers, who come that Road on Thursday Nights. It was dark, and I cannot swear to either of the Prisoners. I heard of them afterwards by means of an Advertisement in a News-Paper.</p>

            . I went to see the Races at Hampstead, and there I met the Prisoners; from thence we went to the Shop on Sn-Hill, where we had 2 or 3 Pints of Beer, and staid till between 9 and 10. Then says Tanner, I must have Money to fetch me. out of Pawn. God damn your, let's go out all together; for he had stole a Haymaker's Coat in the Fields, and I had pawn'd it for him; so we agreed, and went to the Barley-Mow and sit upon the Bench. When we had waited about half an Hour, a Man (about the Size of the Prosecutor) came by. I collar'd him with one Hand, and held a Pistol in the other. Tanner stood by with a Knife; and Cecil, with another Knife, struck the Gentleman on the Head. Tanner took his Hat, Cane, and Money; I think there was 10 s. The Gentleman said we had used him ill, and cut his Nose, and desired us to return his Cane, which we did. Then we went to the Haycocks near Hoxton, and lay till Morning, when Tanner looking on the Hat said, God damn you, how came this Cut? Why, says Cecil, I did it. God damn you, says Tanner again, how could you be so barbarous? We not thinking it proper to pawn the Hat, because of the Cut, I gave them a Shilling a-piece and took the Hat to myself; and so Tanner went to fetch his grey Coat out of Pawn (he has it on now) and I went home; but we had agreed to meet again at the White Bear in Old-street Square to play at Skittles. When I came to them, Tanner had won all Cecil's Money, and then he [Tanner] said he must go home to his Wife, for she had no Money, and he would come to us again. But not meeting us according to his Promise, I fear'd he was going to make himself an Evidence; and so, to be before-hand with him, I surrender'd myself directly to Mr. Cathery, the Constable, and he advertised the Robbery in the News. I became acquainted with the Prisoners at Whitehead's, and here is a Witness that saw us together the Day the Robbery was done.</p>

            . I and Kempson took a Walk on Thursday to see the Hampstead Horse-races. I parted with him on the Heath, and taking a Turn I met him again, and two Men with him, who, by the Glimpse I had of them, I believe were the Prisoners, and especially for next Morning I went to see my S Law Mrs. Whitehead, who at Mr. Jackson's in Brick-lane, in and there I found Kempson, and I saw lurking about the Door, and says I to Kempson, There's a young Man wants you, I suppose. Why do you think so? says he. Because (I said) I think I saw him with you at the Races. Well, says Kempson, let him walk. But at last Kempson went down to him, and my Sister's Husband coming to the Door, we all agreed to go to the Races again, so we went together about 2 a Clock, and by the Way they began some Discourse about a Robbery and a Hat, and Skickle and I walking a little before, he opened the Secret to me. We robb'd a Gentleman, says he, last Night, of a Hat and 10 s. and I struck him on the Head with a Knife.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very odd that a Man should give such an Account of himself to one that was a Stranger to him. - But you made no Discovery of this Secret.</p>

            , Constable. Kempson told me, that he and the Prisoners had robb'd a Man by the Barley-Mow, of a Hat, a Came a Watch-Key, and 10s. and he told me where to find the Prisoners. We took them both on Sunday Night, Tanner in Cow-lane, and Cecil in Fleet-lane, in a House that Whitehead kept to harbour Thieves. Whitehead had other Lodgings in Brick-lane for the same Use. This Hat and Watch Key were given by Whitehead in Newgate.</p>

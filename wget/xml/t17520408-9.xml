               <p>Charles Batchelder. I was going for a bottle of water, March 23, between seven and eight at night, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar with a jarr of raisins on his shoulder, I saw him cross the way to come round to Mincing-lane, then he came back again, I went into the shop and told the people there.</p>

            . That boy came and told us a man had gone out of the collar with a of raisins, and if I would run I might catch him, I ran and went past him, he was then coming out of Mincing-lane, the boy said that is he, I said hold on the prisoner, the prisoner said he was going into White-chapel, and that he came from the water side.</p>
               <p>Q. How does this cellar door open?</p>
               <p>Holaby. It opens into the street, and was open at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the raisins and jarr were taken out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar?</p>
               <p>Helaby. It had on it the same mark as the other had which were then near the cellar door</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down to the water side to see for work, it was duskish; there was a man dress'd much like a carpenter, he asked me if I would earn 3 d. or 4 d. I said with all my heart; then he said he would pay me if I would carry that jarr to White-chapel, and said he would be there as soon as I. I came up Mincing-lane, and coming by Mr. Rawlinson's door, they stopp'd me.</p>

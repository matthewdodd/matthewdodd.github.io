On the 5th of September I had hired a horse at the Moon public-house, King's-road, Chelsea, of Mr. Steed; I returned the horse a little before nine o'clock - I staid there, and had some brandy and water; I left the house to go home about eleven o'clock - and just before some houses, which were building, a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came up to me; there was a gas light opposite Steed's door, by which I could see him - he was dressed in a rough great coat - I had said nothing to him - he came up, and said,"I should like to punch your head:" I said, "For what?" he said, "And I will do it too;" I then retreated into Steed's house - when I came out again, he was gone; I proceeded down King's-road, and down <placeName id="t18270215-51-crimeloc280">Beaufort-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you seen Steed, the publican, here to-day? A. I have subpoenaed him in case it should be necessary to call him; I had spent the day beyond Hounslow, at Mr. Manchester's - I was certainly tipsy, but had my recollection perfectly - Sleet had passed me in the road; I said he might as well walk home with me, as I knew him - I asked him to see me home; I knew him by sight, and may have spoken to him when I have met him; but merely said, "Good morning!" I considered him a respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you passed by your own house this night? A. I did, with a view to treat him at the Hole-in-the-Wall, which is nearly opposite my house; but I did not go into the house, for I was knocked down within two or three doors of it - Sleet was walking by my side, and must have seen me knocked down - I stumbled against the basket, but that did not throw me down - I was knocked down by the man who rushed out - a man named Fuller was there; I did not fight; I began to abuse him about the basket, but made no blow at any one; I believe the prisoner to he the man, from my recollection of having seen him in the rough great coat; and I saw him run away - he was taken about three weeks ago.</p>

            . I am the watchman of Beaufort-row, Chelsea. On this night, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor before this happened; I afterwards saw him with Sleet - I was two or three doors off, when I saw a man in a white coat rush out on Mr. Brill, who certainly fell from the force of that man; I am sure the prisoner is the man, for I knew him before; I ran on - the prisoner was then leaning over him in rather a stooping position - I said, "What is the matter?" the prisoner straightened himself up, hit me in the face, and then ran away; he appeared to have his hands about Brill's middle; next morning I saw Brown pick up the watch in the kennel where Brill had lain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw him, were not he and Sleet arm-in-arm? A. Yes; I did not see Sleet when Brill was knocked down, as it was a very dark night - I swear to the prisoner because he had a white coat on, and he remained there till I got up to them - I asked Brown who it was that had run round the corner, in the white coat, as I considered he ought to know as well as me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Sleet? A. Yes - after the affray; I heard of no fight - I was not near enough to Brill to tell whether he was sober; I am certain of the prisoner - there was a gas light facing him as he ran.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the 26th of January, in Love-lane, Wandsworth; he was sitting by the fire-side - I said, "Tom, I want you" - he said, "What, about that job of Mr. Brill's?" I had not mentioned Brill's name - he said, "Mr. Brill cannot make any more than an assault of it, can he?" - I said I did not know, but Brill charged him with robbing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate all this? A. No; I was not examined.</p>
               <p>W. BRILL re-examined. My watch was drawn from my pocket while I was on the ground; I had it when I stumbled against the basket, and missed it shortly after I was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer, and live at Battersea. I have known Brill about a year and a half: I saw him about a quarter past eleven o'clock on the night of the 5th of September; he said "Halloo, is that you, Battersea?" meaning me - I said, "Yes, sir;" he said, "I mean Mr. Sleet" - I said, "Yes;" he said, "I will indict you for walking so fast; why not accompany me down the road?"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150038"></xptr>- seeing him very much in liquor, I said I would - I walked with him opposite his own house, and I said, "You have passed your house, you had better cross the way;" he said, "No, I will go to the Hole-in-the-Wall, and treat you with a glass of brandy and water;" I said I did not require that, as I considered he had had quite enough - that it was late, and we should not get in; he said,"Oh, d-n their eyes; I will fetch them down - they'll serve me, I know;" and when we came to the bottom, to turn up to the door, a basket stood in the road - he tumbled over it while he held my arm, and said, as he lay down, "What the hell is that I have tumbled over?" - I said it appeared to be a basket - six or seven people stood by the public-house door, and as he got up, one of them said, "It is my basket," begged his pardon, and said he hoped it had not hurt him; he said, "D-n your eyes, you scoundrel, you put it there on purpose for me to fall over;" he collared the man, and shook him - the man pushed him away, and he would have fallen if I had not caught him - I could not keep him from the men - he said, "D-n their eyes! I will floor the whole of them;" and struck right and left at them; one of them struck him, and being intoxicated, he fell into the kennel; three or four of the party ran away; I saw nobody hanging over Brill; I helped him out; I then saw Leeper, the watchman; nobody attempted to touch Brill, till he struck right and left at them.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was Brill bleeding or not? A. He had a tremendous blow, either by falling or bitting at the men; he certainly was in a gore of blood; I gave Brill my card that night, promising to call on him next morning at nine o'clock, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your giving him your card, when you were going to call? A. He being in liquor, I thought he might not recollect, and I gave him the card to satisfy him; I was sober; I do not know the prisoner; I certainly have been to see him in prison; having been waiting here five days, I called there yesterday; I knew one Featherston, who was outside the public-house, and a baker, whose name I do not know; they both live somewhere at Chelsea; I attended at Queen-square; the Magistrate would not bind me over; I attended there by Mr. Brill's desire.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Brill accuse you of not having done your duty by him? A. Never; I stated to the Magistrate, in Brill's presence, the same as I have here; I heard he had lost his watch almost directly he got up; I was sober; I saw nobody in a white coat. to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- STEED. I am a publican. Brill was at my house on this night; he was tipsy; he subpoenaed me me here yesterday, and told me I need not come to-day.</p>
               <p>J. LEEPER re-examined. I knew the prisoner before, and knew where he lived; but did not apprehend him, as he never came in my way; I told Brill that night that it was the prisoner who ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay salesman, of Hendon—on 15th December, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the White Lion, at Edgware, and saw the prisoner there—I left between 4 and 5 o'clock, and crossed the road to the footpath, and saw two men standing there, and a third not far off—I was struck on the back of the head, and a man on each side of me caught hold of my arms; a tall man was on my right—I was pulled to the ground, and kicked, and my clothes torn—the prisoner took my money and knife from my pocket, and said, "I have got it"—Port held me while I was robbed (<hi rend="italic">The Grand Jury had ignored the bill against Port</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100028"></xptr>
               <p>—my fingers were cut, and my wrist was hurt—they then left me, and I got up, went to the White Lion, and told them I was robbed—a little before this I had lent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a man named Yeals, and I had then 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in my breeches pocket—my knife was produced at the station—it was in the same pocket with my money—I was smothered in blood, from my hat to my shoes, and could hardly get away from the station, for weakness—I had been drinking a little, but can swear to the prisoner putting his hand in my pocket—I had seen him and Port together before, but I did not know their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate that Port laid on you while you were on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he knelt right on me—I swore that before the Grand Jury—I had had a goodish bit of money left me—I told the policeman that I had been robbed of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoners—I thought I had lost a cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards I found it in my pocket, smothered in blood—I had deposited the cheque with the London and County Bank some time, and this was not a cheque, but a deposit receipt—I was not wholly drunk, or I could not have sworn to them—a man named Yeals had given me a ride in a cart, and I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was about half an hour drinking in the White Lion—I cannot say whether I had anything there, because I was knocked about so—I may have been into three or four houses before the White Lion, but not ten—I came out at 10 o'clock in the morning—Yeals' cart was outside the public-house—I did not tumble out of it, nor was I thrown out—the prisoner and Port struck me with the whip while I was in the cart, before the robbery—they wanted me to give them 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I would not; that was the first of it—I had not been in Edgware for ten years—I got out of the cart, and was knocked down and robbed about fifteen yards from the public-house, on the other side—I had been in the public-house about half an hour—I thought Yeals was coming, and got into the cart, but he was in the house—when they asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I refused, and got out of the cart, and they hit me with the whip and knocked me down, and robbed me—cannot tell you what I spent, but I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I started from home—the prisoners did not pick me up off the gravel—I have not seen Yeals since—he is a hay salesman—I do not want to see him—he has been to several places to find me, and I would not see him—I do not charge him—he was indoors at the time of the robbery—it was a very violent blow with the whip on the back of my head, and it cut right through my hat—I cannot tell how many blows I had with the whip, for I was knocked insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th December, about 4.30, I was going to my sisters', and saw Abrey in a cart opposite the White Lion—I heard the prisoner ask him for a shilling, which he would not give him—the prisoner asked him a second time, and Abrey said, "Let me get out of the cart!"—he got out, and the prisoner hit him across the back with the whip, bat not very violently—Abrey crossed the road to the bridge, and a man named Port said, "Let him alone, we will have him to-night"—Abrey went into the public-house, Robinson followed him in, and I heard him ask for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Port followed him as well—Abrey did not stay in the house above three minutes—I saw him come out again, and the prisoner then asked him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he crossed over the road, and the prisoner followed him, and wanted to get him back into the White Lion—he refused to go back, and the prisoner caught hold of his shoulder and put him down on the ground—nobody helped the prisoner—he then put his hand into Abrey's right</p>

               <p>hand trowsers pocket, pulled it out, looked at something in his hand, and put it into his own pocket—I could see that there was something in his hand—he then hit Abrey across the head with the handle of this whip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) while he was on the ground, and then went across the road into the White Lion—I did not hear Port say anything, but he picked up Abrey's hat, which was knocked off—the prisoner went in at the front door of the White Lion, and out at the side door—he did not stay in the house two minutes—he looked about, up and down the street, and then went into the village—Port stayed in the White Lion all that time—when Abrey was on the ground he cried out, "I am robbed I" and when he got back to the White Lion he told Yeals he had been robbed—he was not sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner strike Abrey with the whip on the back, before he went into the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they seemed all to go in together—after that there was the conversation about the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Abrey was shockingly drunk—I remained outside till they came out again—it is not true that Port laid on Abrey while he was on the ground—he did not touch Abrey—he only put his hat on afterwards—he did not go near him at all—I am quite sure of that—Abrey's dress was rather torn before he went into the public-house, so much so that I noticed it—from the time Abrey went into the public, until he was robbed, was about twenty minutes; and from the time Abrey, Robinson, and the others came out of the public-house, to the time Abrey complained of being robbed, was about twenty minutes, not any longer.</p>

               <p>I to pay you a shilling for?"—the prisoner said, "To pay the ostler"—Abrey said, "I am not going to pay anyone," and got out of the cart, and went to the other side of the road—I forgot to say yesterday (<hi rend="italic">before the Grand Jury</hi>) that Port said to Robinson, "Let him go, we will have him to-night,"and then Robinson stepped on the path—Abrey went down as far as the dealer's house; Yeals did not come out, and Robinson could not get him along, and Robinson and Port knocked him down on the road, and got hold of his shoulders, and knocked him up against the palings, and then Port went away, and Robinson followed him to the bridge, and knocked him down, and he fell, and got up again, and he knocked him down again—he was lying on his belly, and Robinson put his hand in his right hand pocked looked at it, and put it in his own pocket, and went away into the White Lion again, and came out and looked both ways, and ran up the town—I never saw him any more.</p>

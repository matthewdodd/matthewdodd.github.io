            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 21st of February I was in the carcase of a house in <placeName id="t18310217-260-crimeloc1507">Marylebone</placeName>

               <p>THOMAS RILEN. I have the care of the cottage. I went out at nine o'clock, leaving every thing secure - the back door was fastened with two bolts; I left a chopper in the fire-place - I went out at the front door, and locked it - I came home at twelve, found my back door open, the things strewed about, and the bed and one sheet gone; there was a square of glass out of the kitchen window, and there was the appearance of blood - he had let himself in at the window, and out at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man came up to me, and said he would give me 2s. 6d. to carry the bed to Well-street, Oxford-street - I went into the cottage the front way, as far as the back door; the man said, "You may go this way, and I will come after you."</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRIS. He was close to the cottage when I first saw him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

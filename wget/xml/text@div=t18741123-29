Gilliland—we got into the premises from next door, the housekeeper allowed us to go on the roof, and from the roof we got into Messrs. Gilli<lb></lb>land's premises through a window—upon searching the place we found the prisoner concealed on the staircase on the second floor—he had a piece of canvas over him—I asked him to get up—he did not move—I took the piece of canvas off—he had his eyes open—he was not asleep as he pretended to—I pulled him up—he said "Wait a moment, I am asleep and very queer"—as soon as I got him from behind the staircase I searched him and found in his coat pocket forty picks or skeleton keys, three screw drivers, a hand chisel, a centre punch, a hammer, a hand vice and file, a piece of candle, and a quantity of matches—on the packing case where the prisoner was lying I found this small crowbar—I produce all the things—I went into the counting house and saw that the safe had been attempted to be opened, and the marks on the door corresponded with the hard chisel—there were also marks on the wall corresponding with the tools—we got the prisoner off the premises by the way we had got in and took him to the station—I searched him there and found a promissory note for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, some duplicates, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd halfpence—the outer door was secured with a padlock and bar, and the doors inside the premise were open except one on the third floor which was locked—I found the key of that lock in the prisoner's pocket—he gave an address at Weymouth Street; Portland Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 706, Old Ford Road—on the evening of 21ST September I, my brother Henry, and a man named Hooper went to the prisoner's house—his wife came to the public-house where we were, and asked me to go there—the prisoner said "Arthur, will you listen to reason?"—I said "Yes," and while I was talking to him he asked me to go inside—I did not want to go inside, and he said "We don't want a row out<lb></lb>side," and shoved me away from the door—his wife said "Bill, that is what you want," and handed him a knife—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to hit an old man like my father, and give him a black eye—when he shoved me from the door he stabbed me—we did not have any struggle—I became insensible—I had four stabs on my side, back, shoulder, and thigh, and two more that were only like scratches—I went home—the doctor saw me—I was taken to the London Hospital, and was there a month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. My father and the prisoner had some words early that day; I sent a message that I intended to punish him unless he apologised—I only had one glass of ale at the public-house—the prisoner's wife told me he wanted to see me—I did listen to reason, but the prisoner shoved me from the door while I was talking with him—the conversation took place in the front garden about 7.45—no scuffle took place, only when prisoner got hold of me and shoved me away from the door—I did not see the knife, but my brother did—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 706, John's Place, Bow—I went with last witness to the prisoner's house—he asked us inside—we did not go in—he asked us to shut the gate, as he did not want a crowd outside—I shut it—he asked us to listen to reason—I saw a little struggle between the last witness and the prisoner—I turned round to open the gate, and saw them on the ground—I did not see a knife used—I ran to Arthur Wood, who seemed to be leaning against the wall—I cannot tell if he was bleeding when I got him to the gate—he staggered and fell, and said "I am stabbed," and he was carried away—I ran for a policeman, and the prisoner was given into custody—when the prosecutor said "I am stabbed," the prisoner said "Yes, and I'll serve the b——old father and mother the same."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not present at the quarrel between the prisoner and the prosecutor's father—what took place was inside the garden—we were asked inside the house—the first thing I saw after the prisoner's request to listen to reason was the two struggling together—that was the response to the request.</p>

I am the prosecutor's brother—I was with him when the prisoner's wife came to us, and went with him to the prisoner's house—I was standing against the wall with my hands in my pockets when the prisoner ran at my brother and made a punch at him—his wife said "Here you are, Bill; this is what you want," and he threw his arm over my head and caught my brother under the arm—he said "I am stabbed"—I rushed to catch hold of my brother, and received four stabs in my back and one in my right breast—I could see the steel, but do not know what sort of knife it was—Mr. Hooper took charge of us till the police came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I saw a fight take place between the deceased and the prisoner, at Lambeth—they fought about two rounds—the first blow was struck by the prisoner—at the commencement of the second round I saw the prisoner strike the deceased on the left side of his head—the deceased continued to fight after that blow—after it was over I observed him looking for his hat—he was standing by me, and I thought he was coming towards me, but he tumbled and fell, and pitched into the kennel on his knee—he did not speak after that, but merely gave a deep sigh—his head did not come in contact with the ground when he fell then—they had been down together in the scuffle—he had been down twice, but was not knocked down; it was struggling in the fight—they were both down together—no blow was struck on either side after the fight had ceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Cornwall-road. On the evening of the 14th of August, I was called to see the deceased—I found him sitting on the curb-stone, with thirty or forty people round him, supported by a policeman and others—I directed him to be taken to the nearest house—I felt his pulse and found it was fluttering—he was not able to speak to me—when I saw him in t. he house he appeared dead—I attempted to bleed him in the left arm—I obtained about half a drachm but could get no more—I did what I could to restore him, but could not—I examined him and could find no 1 external injury at all to account for death—I subsequently examined the body—on removing the scalp, I found no injury internal or external—I took off the cranium, and at the back part of the head there was upwards of an ounce of extravasated blood pressing on the brain, arising from the rupture of a vessel—that effusion was sufficient to account for death—that might have been caused by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140190"></xptr>
               <p>excitement, or any external injury, creating an impetus to the blood and forcing an extra rush—it might be occasioned by any additional exertion on his part, or by a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you knew nothing of him before, to lead you to suppose he was a subject of apoplexy, and saw him fighting, and afterwards drop down dead, should not you naturally attribute it to the effect of fighting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless I saw certain appearances—he was a heavy man and a complete subject for apoplexy—I think it might be produced by excitement on his own part without blows—it might easily be caused by excitement, if the extravasation of blood had taken place in his falling, ten minutes afterwards would be much about the time the effusion would take place after the blow was struck—it would not take twenty minutes for the effect to be developed—it depends on how fast the extravasation took place—sometimes apoplexy comes on slow—excitement might have caused it equally the same as blows—I found the blood on the posterior part of the brain, in such a situation as a blow might be given by a person behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It must be an exceeding hard blow with a fist in such a place to produce that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why the man was an exceeding likely subject for apoplexy—vessels so full of blood might easily be ruptured by concussion alone—I think it impossible to distinguish whether his death was caused by excitement, or irritation, or blows—I should be sorry to decide that point.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Church-terrace, Waterloo road. I saw the prisoner and deceased in the act of closing at the end of the fight—I afterwards saw the deceased looking for his hat—while he was doing so the prisoner struck him unawares at the back of his head—he had left off fighting then, and was inquiring for his hat—the blow caused him to go into the road—he being a much stronger man than the prisoner was able to put the prisoner under him—he staggered from the blow but did not fall—he caught the prisoner by the collar afterwards—I am sure they had done fighting when the blow was given—the deceased expressed that he did not wish to fight, but to keep the prisoner there to give him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to state that there was no fighting after the blow was struck on the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no fighting after—there were only two rounds—there was no other man who threw the deceased. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there no man that you pointed out as having pushed the deceased into the kennel when he fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a man—that was not the prisoner—that man was not fighting with the deceased—the deceased just rolled over—the deceased remained five or ten minutes after it was over before he fell—it was not so much as twenty minutes—the policeman desired him to go away—the policeman asked the landlord to give him into custody for making a disturbance and insisting on staying there—the deceased refused to go as he was waiting for his hat—he said he was waiting for a <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi>, and it would be a wonder if he got his hat again—this conversation was about ten minutes after he had received the blow from the prisoner—he stood against the left-hand door post of the beer shop.</p>

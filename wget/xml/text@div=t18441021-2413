                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Naphtali Hart and Co., of Cornhill, watchmakers. On Friday afternoon, the 30th of Aug., there were several ladies and gentlemen at our shop, looking at a very handsome enamelled watch—the prisoner came in, and I went to attend on him—he expressed a wish to see some gold three-quarter-plate lever watches—some were taken from the window, and put on a glass case on the counter—he took up some of them, and asked the price—he said the first lot were too thick, he wished to see some flatter—he said he wished one similar to one purchased by his bro<lb></lb>ther, Captain Edwards, he believed, of us; that his brother had it stolen from him at the Italian Opera-house—I showed him some watches—my eye was off him while getting him goods—he did not think the second sufficiently flat—I showed him some Geneva watches, which were flatter—he said he did not like Geneva watches—he placed two watches aside, and requested us to keep them till four or half-past four o'clock, when he would see his brother on the subject, and let us know whether he would have one or not—before leaving, he asked if a gold dial could be placed on a Geneva watch—as he was about to leave the shop I proposed to show him the enamelled watch, and said the Queen and Prince Albert had seen it—he declined looking at it, and appeared very much excited, so that he went to open the door at the hinge side instead of the handle, and fumbled some time there—I directed one of our men to open it—he did so—I then went to arrange the watches he had seen, and one was gone which had been on the glass case—nobody but me and the prisoner had been near those watches—I missed it within five minutes of his leaving—no one else had entered the shop, or come near the spot—it is Mr. Stanbridge's house, Mr. Hart has merely the shop—Naphtali Hart is the sole proprietor—I have not the slightest doubt about the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canal-street, Hoxton, and am a watch-finisher; I work in Mr. Hart's shop. On Friday afternoon, the 30th of Aug., I remem<lb></lb>ber a person coming there to look at a watch, between three and four o'clock—I have no doubt it was the prisoner—as I sat at work I heard him ask to see some gold watches—some were shown him, which were not sufficiently flat—he requested two to be laid aside till half-past four, when his brother would call and look at them—as he left he went to the hinge side of the door—I was ordered to open it for him, which I did, and let him out—he was very much excited before I opened the door, but not after he got out—I was sent out directly—on my return I heard of the loss of a gold watch—on the 17th of Sept. I saw the prisoner in the City-road with a female, who left him—I told a policeman, and gave him in charge—he was quite indignant, and said he had never seen me before, nor been in Mr. Hart's shop; he did not know the shop.</p>

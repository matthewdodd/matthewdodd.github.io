                  </hi>. I reside at Wednesbury, Staffordshire, and am an accountant in the service of Mr. James Russell, the prosecutor, who is a tube manufacturer there—I have been an accountant about ten years, during which period I have known the prisoner in Mr. Russell's service—he had a London house at Upper Ground Street, Blackfriars, of which the prisoner had the management—the accounts connected with that house passed through my hands—I produce the cash-book kept by the prisoner—the usual mode of business was for them to receive orders at the London warehouse, to transmit them to Wednesbury, and for us to supply those orders—they collected the money and remitted it to us at Wednesbury—we sent the goods according to instructions either to the warehouse, or to the party who ordered them—the course of business was for the prisoner to receive money and to remit it to the Wednesbury house, less any pay<lb></lb>ment for salaries or accounts that he might have in London—I produce a remittance note of 26th February, 1864, in the prisoner's handwriting—by this note he remitted 452<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The witness read the several items and the letter accompanying the remittance</hi>.)

               <p>times, but I have never been there officially to go through the accounts—I have been upon pleasure, and called at the warehouse—there is no hand-writing in this book except the prisoner's, unless it may be some of the pencil entries—the ledger clerk must post into this book—there are many items in here which the ledger clerk has not posted—the three sums I have mentioned were posted by the ledger clerk into the ledger—they would be posted to the credit of the different parties—I believe he posted all the sums mentioned in those three weeks—it was not the practice in the Bir<lb></lb>mingham house to send at stated intervals in the year a copy to each customer of the state in which his account stood—that was left to London—we have not done so from Wednesbury for seven or eight years—it was my duty to make out the accounts at Wednesbury—if the prisoner was to keep back John Smith's cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we should not know any<lb></lb>thing about it at Wednesbury—I believe there was no document of any sort or kind sent by us from Wednesbury to Mr. John Smith, by which he would see that he had not received credit for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque he had paid—there may have been an exceptional case if any inquiries were made—there was an account of money handed to Mr. Russell himself personally—that would be treated in the same way as if he had transmitted it—in the account that was just read, part of the money was handed to Mr. Russell—the letter states, "excepting the two first items, the others representing cheques and bills handed to Mr. Russell"—the money handed over to Mr. Russell is treated as remittance—there is no separate account of that—the prisoner rendered accounts to the Wednesbury house monthly—they were balanced quarterly, of course, in the ledgers—we have not had a monthly account rendered for three years—not since 1863—I have none of them here—I can't say how often Mr. Russell was in town—he did not take an active part in the business—the prisoner was at the London house two days after I came up—on the 25th June he was suspended—he was not told to go away—Mr. Baker, the solicitor, said in the prisoner's presence that he was suspended until the further examination of the books—that was on the Wednesday morning—I will swear it was not on the Monday—I re<lb></lb>member stating to the prisoner that I was about to send out a circular to the different creditors—he said, "You had better consider before you do that, for if you do I will send out a circular stating the circumstances under which your circular goes"—he also added that it should cost Mr. Russell 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more if he proceeded against him—it was said in Mr. Russell's presence that the prisoner had made improper use of Mr. Russell's money—what he said was that it was through some specula<lb></lb>tion which unfortunately had turned out wrong, but that had the tran<lb></lb>saction been successful he should have heard nothing—he did not say they were speculations of Mr. Russell's, I mean to swear that, most decidedly—Mr. Russell said he had no right to use his money to specu<lb></lb>late, and Mr. Baker made the remark that he might just as well take his money and bet on the Derby—the prisoner said they were specula<lb></lb>tions—he left the inference that they were his own—I understood that they were his own speculations of course—there was no allusion as to what the speculations Were at that time—the prisoner told me the day previous—the prisoner said, in the course of conversation, when Mr. Russell was there, that he believed to a certain extent he had Mr. Russell's authority—his words were, "I consider that I had to a certain extent your authority for what I have done"—before that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220041"></xptr>
               <p>I said to the prisoner I was very sorry to see it, but I had dis<lb></lb>covered a discrepancy of 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he said, "It was Sullivan's affair"—he said most unfortunately Sullivan's affair had turned out a failure—there were a great number of Sullivan's bills going through the accounts up to 1863—when the prisoner said, "I consider I had to a certain extent your authority," Mr. Russell said, "Show it, prove it"—he denied it—I won't say the exact words he used—the prisoner also said, "As regards Sullivan's matter, I have your letter where you give authority to the Alliance Bank to be responsible for a certain amount," and from the tenour of his remarks I concluded he referred to that as his authority—nothing was mentioned about Mr. Russell having told him to keep the matter secret from his manager—Mr. Russell was sitting beside the Alder<lb></lb>man when the prisoner was committed—the prisoner reserved his defence, he said nothing—I believe at the close of the case, that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wontner, junr</hi>.) said something to the effect that the prisoner had done what he had by Mr. Russell's authority—Mr. Russell is here to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prosecution conducted by Messrs. Lewis and Lewis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was left to them to do what was thought proper—Mr. Russell was at that time in a bad state of health, from which he has to a certain extent recovered—if an order for goods came to us through the London house we should send the invoice to the London house to be re-invoiced by them to the customer, but the goods we should send directly to the customer—the prisoner was left to conduct the London business as a separate business entirely—the greatest confidence was reposed in him, which continued up to a short time before I went to London—I said to him, "Mr. Haddon, I am very sorry to see from the cash-book, as far as I have gone, that you are 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short"—he said, "Yes, I am very sorry, it is Sullivan's affair; Sullivan has had many promising things, and amongst many other promising things which he had they have most unfortunately all turned out failures"—copies of letters were produced at that time—we may have had promiscuous bills of Sul<lb></lb>livan's since 1863—one of the letters produced was a letter proposing to guarantee the bank—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"James Russell and Sons, to Alli<lb></lb>ance Bank, Limited. Gentlemen,—We beg to say we will guarantee an amount not exceeding 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you may advance to Mr. W. C. Haddon on bills endorsed by him, presented at this bank to be discounted.")—I produced that—I was a party to that letter—the thing was canvassed over before it was done—it was done by letter, by Mr. Smith, the manager—after that guarantee a bill of Sullivan's might have come to us, a promiscuous bill, a bill bearing his endorsement—I cannot say whether Sullivan's accept<lb></lb>ances came in—there was a little confusion in the name, there being the father and the son—one was J. S. and the other J. G.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of this business at Wednes<lb></lb>bury, and at Upper Ground Street, London—rather more than twelve years ago, I think, I placed the prisoner in the London branch of the business—he was to conduct the London business entirely, to receive money, supply the goods when they were ordered, keep the accounts, and send down remittances to me—I treated London as one single customer, debiting the warehouse with the goods, and crediting the money received from there, knowing very little indeed about the customers which the prisoner had—I had every confidence in the prisoner until May this year—he had been with me rather more than 15 years—it was his duty to send down remittances as he received them, sometimes once a week,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220042"></xptr>
               <p>sometimes oftener, and to send monthly accounts—he did that for some, considerable time—about three or four years ago they ceased—I have ap<lb></lb>plied to him for monthly accounts personally—the excuse he made was that as the warehouse was treated as a debtor, in some instances some of the goods were sold for more than the warehouse was charged, and on others there were drawbacks, and he had not made up the differences—if there was an excess it would belong to my firm—the prisoner had a salary of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a house and firing—I asked very frequently for the monthly account—he should have sent nearly the whole of the cash weekly—he might have kept a small amount of cash back for the purpose of any little account that might come in, the ordinary expenses of a business—I did not know of his having received 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during the week ending 25th February, and only sending 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not in any way authorise that—I did not authorise him to keep back moneys, except in one instance some months ago; that was for him to keep a certain amount of what he collected between the time of my writing to him and going up, and it was paid to me when I went up—I knew that he had a banker's account, inasmuch as I guaranteed a bank for an amount for himself, but after transferring it from there I knew nothing more—I did not know that he paid my moneys into any banker's account—I never authorised him to do so—I gave a guarantee to a bank for discount for a person named Sulli<lb></lb>van—his father had owed me a debt—I came up to London with the accountant—on the Saturday previous I had a conversation with the prisoner, which induced me to send for the accountant—I dismissed the prisoner—the accountant said the books were very far behind, and there was a considerable balance against the prisoner, and upon questioning him he gave some very evasive answers—he ended by saying that had things gone on right he should never have heard anything of this—I dismissed him at once—I told him he was suspended—he did not say what he had done with the money—he said if these speculations had gone on right he would have heard nothing of it—I had not authorised any speculations—there was only one exception, that was the Hanoverian—that had nothing to do with the moneys of the firm—I did not authorise in any way any ap<lb></lb>plication for speculative purposes of the moneys of the firm that the prisoner had, or for any other purpose, there was a special direction—I did not give any special direction about the application of my own individual money that I recollect—I bought some shares once, at the prisoner's request, in the Petroleum Company—I provided money of my own for an acceptance, bills met the acceptance, renewed bills took up the bills, eventually I took up the renewed bills out of my own funds—the prisoner did not, as far as my authority goes, ever apply a sixpence for those bills, or for any other purpose—the Petroleum matter was in September, 1865—Sullivan's bills had been sent down in 1863 by Haddon—it was for the purpose of providing discount to assist Sullivan that I gave that guarantee to the bank—Haddon had lent him some of my money, and in order to get out of that debt he said if I would guarantee the Alliance Bank for him he would work it out in that way, and that was done—I did not know at all of any of my moneys being paid into the Alliance Bank—up to May I believed Haddon was sending down to me all the moneys that he received.</p>

               <p>in that way—it is a fact that I told him to keep back from the weekly statements the receipt of any money I so applied, in order that my manager, Smith, might not know it—that was in writing, not personally—I can't tax my memory as to the time.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought the course of business was that all money handed over to you should go into the remittance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, decidedly, but this was a special matter—it was simply because I wanted the money for my own private purpose—I did not wish my manager to know that at the time—I knew he must know it at some time—I told the prisoner I had been engaged in speculations in London with accommodation bills and various speculations—the Hanoverian Petroleum Company was one, and the Bank of New Zealand, nothing else but what is gone past—I had no interest in Sullivan's matter—that was an advance made by him unknown to me in the first instance—I believe it was a speculation in the leather trade, or something of that kind—I know it was—I don't know that the speculations with which the prisoner had to do had nothing to do with the leather trade—I know he bought and sold shares—I knew nothing about our firm supplying tubing for the speculation in question—that I swear—I was not cognisant of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just read the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Mr. W. C. Haddon. Dear sir, I wish you to take the accompanying papers and pay into the bank 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me"—that was into my own bank—now I recollect what it was, it would be, I expect, Hankey's, for some shares—"first of all putting on a receipt stamp marked"—it was a banker's receipt for a deposit—"and also adding the date on the day of application. If you can't manage it in a day or two let me know, and I will send you a cheque. P. S.

               <p>Sullivan in 1864 and 1865, certainly not—I was engaged in accommoda<lb></lb>tion bills connected with the Hanoverian Petroleum, not Sullivan—I should think Sullivan's transaction began somewhere about 1861 and 1862—it has never been wound up—Sullivan became a bankrupt, and after that I knew nothing of it for some time—I did not know that my bills were being used to work Sullivan's business until after it was commenced—I knew it in 1862 and 1863—I know the account has not been balanced—I know Sullivan's is a different business now, but I did not know it was the same Sullivan—he was represented to me as a different Sullivan—Mr. Smith is here—this is his writing—you subpoenaed Mr. Smith, and me too—when I have been at the London house I have simply asked the prisoner for money, that is all—there was my brother-in-law in the country, whom I did not wish to know about these speculations—he was the manager too—I have written to the prisoner to write to me for sham excuses to bring me up to town that I might talk to him about these speculations that I was engaged in—he was not authorised to apply any money from the busi<lb></lb>ness, and was not to take cheques for any purpose, except on such an occa<lb></lb>sion as that special one—in one or two instances when I could not take up the accommodation bills I have made up the difference from the business—I have not complained to the prisoner that he has truly entered the amount, so that my manager found out I was speculating in London, nothing of the sort—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">This letter was from the prosecutor to the prisoner, stating that he was very vexed indeed that he had referred to the bills or to the amounts in his letter to Mr. Smith, and stating that if he kept ang cheques or cash he was to debit him with the amount and let it go into the monthly statement</hi>)—with regard to that, it is very distinctly stated that I have given him permission to debit me with money—I told him to make the bills payable at Ground Street, and not at Birmingham—that was in order that they should be met there, in order to keep it from the manager, (take it that way if you like), and because awkward questions had been asked down at the bank there—I was asked by another house whether the prisoner had any authority to accept bills—I said he was authorised to conduct the whole business of the firm—I believe I have prosecuted him for forging the endorsement of a cheque received in London—that was previous to these transactions—this letter of 11th May, 1866, is in my writing.

The postscript was</hi>)—"Urge me to be sure not to be later than Monday night.

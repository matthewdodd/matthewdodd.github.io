                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I live in Brussels, and am a gunmaker. Previous to Sept., 1857, I did not know any thing of the prisoner—I never saw him at all—in September I received the letter, marked A, from Tonbridge Place, New Road, London—(<hi rend="italic">A translation of letter A was read; it was addressed to the witness, requesting to be informed of the prices of Belgian hunting guns. Signed T. Thompson</hi>)—In consequence of this letter, I wrote to the address—I started for London on 7th Oct., and returned on the 20th—this second letter arrived while I was in London; my wife sent the goods—(<hi rend="italic">Letter B read):</hi> "London, 14th Oct., 1857. Sir,—Having consulted our correspondent of Liverpool, we have the honour to inform you, that we should wish you to send us, as samples of your manufactory, two hunting guns, one of 180 francs, the other of 150 francs. We should like to receive these two guns by the steamer, which leaves Antwerp for London on the 18th of this month. We leave to you to put your name upon these samples or not. Please to take particular notice of the fact, that our orders will be of a considerable amount, if these articles answer our expectations, and offer real advantages. T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. To Mr. T. Montigny, Brussels")—On returning to Brussels, this letter was given to me by my wife, and I wrote to the address, Tonbridge Place, New Road—I afterwards received letter C—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, 26th Oct., 1857.

               <p>received the two guns which you have sent us through the medium of Mr. T. Wilson, Custom House agent of this town. In order to settle with you the amount of your invoice of the 17th instant, we will let you have our bill for the 15th November next, upon Messrs. Cassel and Co., bankers at Brussels, who are the correspondents of the house Samuel and Montague, bankers at London. Signed, T. Thompson, Davis and Co.

Sir,—We received this morning an answer from Mr. Paterson, of Liverpool, who informs us that he is very much satisfied with your samples, and that if you continue to furnish us in the same satisfactory way, you may rest assured of our future orders. The gun of 180 francs is perfect in all particulars, but that of 125 francs is still more convenient for us, because we find it very profitable. Only one observation for our future orders, this is, that it would be preferable if the cap could be placed when the hammer is at the stop. These guns, as we told you before, will be used for exportation; and, therefore, it will be necessary that they are as showy as possible. And, as these samples are about to be sent to different places in the United States, have the kindness to send us, by the <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi>, which leaves Antwerp on 1st Nov., three guns of 125 francs each, of the same kind as that which which we have received. We beg you to send them, with urgency, at that date, as the vessel which is to take away these guns sails on 5th Nov. next from Liverpool for Boston. We also beg you to address these samples direct to our office, so as to avoid the costs of custom house agent. To cover the amount of your two invoices, we will send you, at the receipt of this order, our acceptance upon Brussels, just as we have told you in our former letter. Signed, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. To Mr. Montigney, Bruxelles.")—Inconsequence of this letter I sent three guns by the steamer which left Antwerp on 1st Nov., dircted to T. Thompson, Davis, and Co., No. 8, Hunt<lb></lb>ley Street, Tottenham Court Road—I received this letter E—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Lon<lb></lb>don,3d Nov., 1857. Sir,—We received, in due time your letter of the 1st instant, by which you send us the three guns we had ordered of you. Unfor<lb></lb>tunately, the two guns of 115 francs each cannot suit us, as we find a great difference with the one of 125 francs, which we received in the first sending. What we want is, three guns of the same price, manufactory, and quality. And as you mentioned in your letter that you have some of them, but not finished, you would oblige us greatly by furnishing two of these arms for the 10th instant, the latest, because we were not able to send the others we received from you before to our correspondent at Liverpool, for the reason and excuse that they were not similar to them of 125 francs. It is quite true, Sir, what you say, that we ought to give you more time; but it is absolutely necessary that these samples should be, on the 14th instant, at Liverpool, to to be shipped on the 15th for America. We hope, Sir, that you will not fail to send us these guns for the 10th instant, as this is a matter of importance as regards the two guns. Signed, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. Mr. Mon<lb></lb>tigny, Bruxelles. Please to add, if agreeable to you, your invoice of 365 francs to this one.")—I did not send two guns in consequence of this letter—thewords, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co., importers of foreign goods, and purveyors to the Queen, were on all the letters—the address of Tonbridge Place is not on the letter of the 14th Oct.—I tore the words, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. off, and sent them to Mr. Speilman, in London—they could not find the address, and to show them that I was right, I cut them off and sent them.</p>

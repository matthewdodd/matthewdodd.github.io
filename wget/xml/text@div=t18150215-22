               <p>Q. On Friday afternoon the 20th of January, was a parcel of dollars brought by Mr. Lee - A. Yes, they were brought there to be weighed by Mr. Lee, the purser of the Bridgewater; Mr. Lee, the purser of the ship, was present, and the prisoner; the dollars were weighed, each bag separate, and returned into the bags from which they were turned out, the seven bags were weighed separate, we weighed them by troy weight, seventy-two pounds weight, odd ounces, each bags, about sixty a verdupoise, and the odd bag weighed fifty pounds ten ounces: after the seven bags of dollars were all weighed they were put into the chests in my presence, and in the presence of the purser of the ship; four bags were put into one chest, and three in the other; the chests were made secure, and sealed; on Friday it was too late for shipping; they remained until the 21st, I saw nothing of them after the 21st, On Saturday morning I went to the office, I suppose it might be twelve; I found the prisoner in the crane room, which is opposite the Bullion office; the doors and windows appeared as I left them, there was nothing to excite suspicion. About two in the afternoon on Saturday the chests were removed into the crane room out of the Bulion office; the chests were weighed by the prisoner; I saw him weigh them. The chests were then lowered by the crane into the cart, that cart had been hired by the prisoner, for the purpose. I delivered to the prisoner the usual documents for the shipping of these chests, and he went away with them as usual with the cart; he returned in about an hour, or an hour and a quarter; he made the usual entry of the delivery of the chests of Bullion in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's desk - A. In the crane room; I was present when the prisoner's desk in the crane room was searched; I saw the Police officer take out some dollars, he counted them; I think he said, they were thirty-seven, and I saw the officer discover two melting pots under the desk, on some part of the floor. The dollars found in the prisoner's desk appeared to be the same as we had weighed and put into the chest by the prisoner. The prisoner had no use for these melting pots in his business whatever. I saw some metal in one of the pots, which had been melted. The chests were marked No. 1, and 2; No. 1, contained three thousand of Captain Hughes's dollars; the prisoner marked the weight on the outside of each; the book is here; the weight of No. 1, one hundred two quarters and twenty-seven pounds was the weight of the chest No. 1; No. 2, two hundred and twenty-seven pounds; it is in the prisoner's hand-writing; these entrys are all in the prisoners hand-writing; nothing else was found that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any chissels and hammers that lay about in the room - A. Yes, to open the chests,</p>
               <p>Q. Were the chests securley sealed - A. They were, by two seals on the side of the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any appearance with respect to the top of the chest of any damages the chest had received - A. I do not know of it; the chest is here; this is the chest. The chest was nailed all round, and hoops came across. The prisoner put the Company's seal upon it, one at the top and the other at the bottom; the seal remained in my custody in the office, not in his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, when you saw this delivered the next day; if there had been any appearance of the seals being broken, it is a matter that would have struck your eye - A. It might or might not, it would have been subject to it certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had broken the seals, it would have been subject to your eye; you saw it taken from the Bulion office to the crane room - A. Yes, and I saw it drawn by the crane to the top; I was in the Bullion office the moment he took it out; then I saw it in the crane room; I saw him drawing it, I was within half a dozen yards of it when he was lowering it down in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me there are two doors to the Bullion office - A. Yes, and only one has a lock to it; it is my usual practice to see that the door that is fastened by bolts is fast; I rattle it; I invariably do it, and I have no doubt I did it that day; I may do it a thousand times, and omit it once; I believe it is my invariable practice.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it you first heard of there being any thing wrong respecting the dollars - A. On Monday. The prisoner said there had been an enquiry by some person wondering why the dollars had not come on board.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did not a person come up from on board a ship, saying, that they had received them, and that they were deficient - A. That was on Monday fortnight we received information that the dollars had been plundered; I informed the prisoner of the dollars being stolen, and another person was charged of the thing. The prisoner very readily went with me to the wharf.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames Police office. In consequence of suspicion, I searched the prisoner; I understood he had a desk in the crane room at the East India House; I requested him to shew it me; he produced a bunch of keys, on which was a small tally mark of the Bullion office, and one of these keys he described to be the key of his desk. I also found in his pocket four one-pound notes, and a letter dated the 6th of January, 1815; it was written as he told me, acknowledging the receipt of ten pounds, he had borrowed of an officer at the Treasury House. I told the prisoner to leave me the keys, as I should have occasion to look at all his drawers, as well as his room in the India House. When I went to the India House, Mr. Cobb told me he had the key of the crane room. I sent to the prisoner for the key. I searched his house; in one of his drawers I found seventy-eight or nine duplicates, of spoons, tableclothes, and wearing apparel, that had been pledged. I returned to the India House; I met the messenger that I had sent to the prisoner for the key. When I returned to the office, I saw the prisoner at night, he told me he had not given me the key, but it was hanging behind the shutters in the Bullion office. The next morning I found the key as he described. I entered the crane room, opened his desk, and in his desk I found thirty-seven Spanish dollars rolled up in a piece of an old newspaper; by the side of the desk on the floor among a parcel of paper that was laying about I found these two new crucibles, or melting pots, and I found a piece of run down metal, which I believe to be grain tin. The prisoner told me the melting pots were given to him by a servant of Mr. Brown. who is a refiner to the Company, and in regard to this chest, the prisoner stated that he split the lid in driving in the nail; now it fits so close that it is hardly perceptible, and being so split, he said he observed it to the purser; the purser said it was of no consequence. The chest is sealed on one side, on the other it is not sealed, and being so sealed, the wider part takes off without disturbing the seals, and there is room to take dollars out, and to put in the weight. The nails to the hoop might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150015"></xptr>be drawn in half an hour and the dollars taken out and the weight put in; I know there is a great deal too much of that done on the River.</p>

            . I am a clerk at the Thames Police office; I took down the account of the prisoner at the time he was under examination; he said the dollars are my own property, I bought them on Monday last; I expected to have some more to day, if I had not been here. People bring parcels to me when they have dollars to sell? He meaned persons about the India House; these who brought them up belong to the India House, I don't know their names, nor where they live; I buy and sell dollars for the purpose of getting two or three halfpence by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of seeing persons coming to the Bullion office, and offering Mr. Cobb dollars for sale; it is more than twelve years past when Mr. Mead was in the Bullion office, that he used to find me with money to buy dollars; I gave what I liked for the dollars, and the surplus of the money I had a part of it; there are people coming to the Bullion office offering Mr. Cobb dollars for sale; when they attend I give them something to drink; I never know who the parties are, I generally give a halfpenny more than the silversmiths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cobb. Three or four instances have occured where dollars have been offered to me; persons have most assuredly come and offered dollars to me for sale.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called twenty witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

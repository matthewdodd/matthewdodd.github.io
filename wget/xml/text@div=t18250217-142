I have the list which was handed to him on the <rs id="t18250217-142-cd837" type="crimeDate">24th of December, 1823</rs>

When the prisoner returned in the evening, he added up the list, and afterwards it was checked by the clerk. He was to pay the money he received in the evening. He remained in their service till the 21st of January, 1824, when he absconded. Eight shillings and sixpence was due to him for wages, and, I think, five shillings would have been the utmost that was due to him for perquisites - he was a weekly servant. We saw nothing of him till he was taken into custody this month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did it not often happen in the accounts, that there was sometimes too much money paid, and sometimes too little? A. It has been the case, but it was a very rare occurrence; I cannot say that it ever happened in his account; it has happened sometimes, that a drayman has given too little, and then he has had the list returned, and told, "You ought to have paid more money," which he has done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any question asked him about this money before he went away? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the accounts and the money laid on the desk that evening? A. I have no doubt but it was, and balanced in the usual way. I think, about a week after the prisoner left us, we heard of the 30 s. being received from Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he accounted on the list for all the beer delivered that day? A. Yes; the casks are always counted.</p>

            . I am a clerk to the prosecutors. This list is in the prisoner's hand-writing. I have a book, in which I made an entry of the money received on the 24th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170068"></xptr>of December, 1823. This entry was made from a small piece of paper, on which I made a memorandum at the time. We make the entry on the paper while the prisoner is by - the paper is destroyed immediately. I do not know whether the entry was compared with his list, or not.</p>
               <p>Q. His list corresponds with the entry in the book? A. Yes, exactly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NICHOLS. The prisoner was in our service, and quitted it, without notice, on the 21st of January, 1824. I gave information to Duke, a Bow-street officer, respecting the robbery. He was not taken till the present month - it was shortly after he had left us, that we received information of what he had done.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon, after you had received the information, did you go to Bow-street? A. I think, it was within a month. I told the officer, that he had lived in the service of Mr. Martel, and he possibly might be there, as I understood, that Mr. Martel had advanced him money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When the prisoner left, had you another drayman? A. Yes: it was from him I received the information.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any recollection about the money you paid? A. Yes; it was a sovereign and a half-sovereign. The receipt is for six casks - I only had one on that day.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I had a warrant against the prisoner, on the 7th of February, 1824. I took him on the 3d of February, 1825. I told him, I had a warrant against him, for embezzling some money of his late master's, and held out no threat or promise to him - he said, he thought he had paid back all the money he had received; that it was a very bad job, but, if he had known I had been coming after him, he would have gone further off: he was taken at Madden's brewery.</p>

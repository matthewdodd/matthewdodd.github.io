The prisoner Carter, who was tried yesterday, was employed in my service to take hay to London—he left me on the 21st of July at a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, with thirty-six trusses of clover and rye grass, and about 40lbs. weight of old in his cart to feed the horses—that was taken by my authority—I did not authorise him to take any new hay—I have seen the hay now produced—it is mine, and part of the 40lbs. I sent-I</p>

                  </hi> I am leather-cutting, and live in Stonecutter-street. On the 4th of March the prisoner came for a penny ball of hemp, and gave me a shilling—I picked it up, and saw it was bad—I gave it a bend, and gave it him back—I said he had better take that where he got it from—he went away with it.</p>

On the 4th of March I saw the prisoner waling backwards and forwards by Mr. Glenister's shop, looking in at the window, as if he were watching for some opportunity—he walked away, and came back, and went into the shop—he came out, and I went in and made some inquiry—I followed the prisoner, and came up with him at the corner of Shoe-lane—I asked what he had got in his hand—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Open your hand"—he said, "What for?"—he refused to do so—I caught hold of his hand, and said he had better walk on with me—I took him to the station, and found in his left hand three base shillings—one of them is bent—these are them.</p>

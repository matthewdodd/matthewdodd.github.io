On Saturday night, 11th December,? was going from Edgware across the fields to? place called The Hall, in the parish of Hendon—I had to pass? reservoir of the Great Northern Railway Company—two men overtook me—I cannot swear to the tall one, but the short one was the prisoner Port, who caught hold of my arm, hit me on the mouth, and knocked me down—I got up again, and he knocked me down again, and fell on me—the tall one kicked me on the ribs—I halloaed, and they said if? halloaed they would serve me worse—they took my basket, which contained bacon, sugar, and tea, and threw the basket down—they stopped behind, and? got up and went away—I afterwards picked out the prisoners at the station, as having been in the White Lion public-house with me, and I am able to swear to Port—we were together about an hour and? half—when I left the White Lion they had left about five minutes—I was sober.</p>

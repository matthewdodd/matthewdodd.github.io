With some Difficulty I got her before Mr. Justice Fowke , and there she confested that she took the Linnen, and sold it to Barfoot for 11 s. that Barfoot knew they were stolen, and bought them as such. She likewise said, they were sent away from Barfoot's to another House, while she was there.

             . As for the Prisoner Ellis, I know nothing of her, but on Tuesday the 30th of Dec. Mr. Browning sent for me, and told me, there was a Woman in Custody for buying his Linnen for 11 s. and desired me to go and s ee her. Accordingly I went into Ratcliff Highway, and found Barfoot in Custody; I told her if she would let me have the Goods, I would give her the 11 s. again; at first she would not, but afterwards she said, if you will not whiddle of me, perhaps I may help you to the Goods; then she order'd a Man ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160019"></xptr> one Hope, to go with me into Shorter-street , by Rag-Fair; we went a little Way in the Street, and he knock'd at a Door, and when we came in, I saw the two Prisoners Harrison and Smith in the House, there were abundance of Candlesticks and such Things, and a half Firkin of Butter lying about, so that I wished myself out of Doors The Prisoner Smith said, Is this the Gentleman? and Harrison said, can we trust him ? and the Man bid me give Harrison the Money; I gave her half a Guinea and 6d. and then Smith gave me the Goods, and I came away. After this I I went to the Constable , and told him the Story, and he threat'ned to prosecute me for compounding Felony. When we were before the Justice, Barfoot and Hope wanted to make it up with me, and she is now out upon Bail . The House from whence I had these Goods, went by the Name of Barfoot's, and I have enquired since this, and find it was hers, but she has left it. She is a very bad Woman, and a reputed Receiver of stolen Goods.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of October I was coming from Hounslow in a chaise, in company with Miss Pointon. The goods mentioned in the indictment were in a trunk, which was fastened with two straps before the post-chaise. At about a quarter after seven in the evening, when we had got about two hundred yards up the Strand, the post-boy looked back, stopped his horses, and said the trunk was gone. We went directly to Sir

            . It was the first day of the quarter sessions at Westminster. When I came home my wife told me she had bought some of these things.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Shade. What time did the prisoner bring them? - Between ten and eleven o'clock; she said she bought them at a gentleman's house; that a lady was dead in the family, and that these things belonged to that lady. As they seemed to be one person's wear, I thought it might be so.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her who she was? - No, I had some slight knowledge of her; I had seen her with her sister, and knew her by name; she brought the things at five different times; I looked upon her to be a dealer. She said she did not bring them all at once because she had not money to pay for them. There were two or three days difference between the times. I gave her 8 l. 8 s. 6 d. for the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time question her more particularly how she came by them? - She always said the same thing; I looked upon her to be a dealer; I knew her sister to be a dealer.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that the prisoner is the person who sold you these things? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the same things you bought of her? - Yes, they have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080029"></xptr>in my possession ever since. I told the lady there had been one apron and a petticoat sold in the course of the time.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in Court and deposed to by Miss Kirkpatrick and Miss Pointon.)</p>

               <p>Cross Examination of Miss Kirkpatrick.</p>
               <p>Do you know them by their being like those you lost or by any particular mark? - I know them to be my own, the shifts are my own make.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know any thing but the shifts? - Yes, I know the gown to be mine.</p>
               <p>The trunk was taken from the chaise in the Strand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a large trunk and very heavy I believe? - No, it was not a large trunk.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner near the chaise that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not she first charged with receiving them? - Sir John ordered her to be committed for the theft; there was a part of the riding-habit found upon her, and some lace that belongs to us.</p>
               <p>Was you before the justice? - I was.</p>
               <p>You had no suspicion at that time that the prisoner stole them I believe? - I cannot say that she stole them, I did not see her near the chaise at the time. Some things were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shade. I took her up.</p>
               <p>Did she make any confession in your presence? - None.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 7, Bradmore Park Terrace, Hammersmith, and am the owner of 3, Belgrave Road, which was let to Joseph Hicks, senior, who owes me two quarters' rent—I took proceedings in the Marylebone County Court—there were three or four adjournments—at the hearing on 21st May the prisoner was examined as a witness and I heard his evidence; he said, "While I was removing my goods from 3, Belgrave Road, by a van, Mr. Faulkner came to the house and said, 'As you have got your goods away the keys will be of no use to you, so you may as well give them up to me,' and I then and there gave them to Mr. Faulkner"—I was not at Bel<lb></lb>grave Road on the day mentioned; I was at Hammersmith all day, and therefore any conversation of the kind could not possibly have taken place—I have an entry on that date in my diary, "At Hammersmith all day and wrote to Mr. Hicks"—I wrote down his statement directly I got home from the Court, and as near as I could recollect they are the words he used—I have not received any letters from the prisoner—I have received letters from his father, the tenant, and have seen him twice with reference to this matter—the prisoner conducted his father's business when he first took the shop, and I have seen him there often—the key has never to this day been given up to me as alleged, and no meeting of the kind to which the prisoner referred took place—he came on or about the 25th January, with Mr. Child's son, to negotiate with me for the purpose of giving up, and they offered me then 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—they had entered a second quarter—that was on the part of the father; he said he had given up possession on the 17th, but on the 25th January he was there' negotiating to give it up then and offering 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound of the rent—he came again on 26th March, 1878, with his father to negotiate giving up the house—that was after the prisoner had sworn that he had given up the keys and given up possession.</p>

I live at 125, Canterbury Road, Kilburn—I was present in the County Court, Marylebone, and heard the prisoner's evidence on 21st December, 1877—while he was removing his goods in a furniture van Mr. Faulkner came up and said to him, "Well, the keys are of no use to you new, and you may as well give them to me," and that he there and then handed to Mr. Faulkner the keys—I made no memorandum, but am prepared to swear that is what was said.</p>

I live at 18, Sharland Road, Paddington—I remember being in Mr. Faulkner's shop at the latter end of March, 1878, when Hicks, senior and junior came in and asked the prosecutor, my brother-in-law, to write out a document, which he did and gave it to the prisoner, who said, "What do you mean by dilapidations, there are none?"—Mr. Faulkner said, "You must be a fool to say there are none"—the prisoner's father said, "I will not have my son called a fool, you shall neither have the keys nor money," and with that they left the shop immediately.</p>

               <p>on 5th December, and it said on the shutters, "In consequence of bankruptcy business is suspended"—I did not go there in December and call all the lodgers down—I saw them, but do not know how many—I did not ask them for their rent books—they asked me to take the rent—I told them I could not do that, as I had nothing to do with it, and that they had better speak to Mr. Hicks before paying any more—I did not tell them in express terms not to pay—the person who came to the door called all the lodgers down, and they said, "What are we to do? Will you advise us what to do? Are we to pay any more rent to Mr. Hicks? We have paid our rent up to the present time, and you can see our books"—they brought the books down to me; then I said, "I would advise you to see Mr. Hicks's receipt before paying any more rent"—he brought an action against me in the County Count—I did not hear any claim for specific damages—I heard that he said I had interfered with his lodgers, and they had not paid him his rent—I did not go into the house from 5th December till 25th January, when I met Mr. Hicks—I was not there on any occasion when goods were being removed, and cannot tell when he went away—he swore it was on the 17th—Miller is a tradesman who does my work—I have nobody to swear to the exact words he used—I claimed 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the County Court for dilapidations, but that was not the principal cause of dispute with Hicks senior—the prisoner denied that there were any dilapidations—no amount was mentioned in conversation—I said, "There is the rent due, and there will be dilapidations; you send a surveyor to meet my surveyor, and whatever they assess, that will be the amount"—we were discussing the point, and the prisoner kepi saying, "There ain't no dilapidations," and at last I said, "You are a fool to talk like that"—I saw the papers torn off the wall on 25th January, when I found the prisoner and the solicitor's son in the house—they had let themselves in with the keys that he had—I had not a key—I gave the key originally to the father, and they never gave it up—I did not go to the house between December 5th and January 25th—it was closed and they had the keys on 25th January, and the prisoner was in the house—his agreement specified that he was not to let the house to lodgers.</p>

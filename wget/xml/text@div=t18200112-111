On the 11th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the parlour behind the shop, and heard a rattling at the window, went out, and observed three persons at the window - one of them had his hands through, removing the things - the glass had been broken an evening or two before - the other two enclosed him to prevent his being seen. I went to the door, the bell rang, and at that instant they all ran away. I pursued them closely, one escaped, but the other two were taken without my losing sight of them; they were the prisoners. Nothing was found on them. On my return I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were safe just before.</p>

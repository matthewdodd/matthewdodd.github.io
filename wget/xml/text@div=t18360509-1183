                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Riley, and live in Old Pye-street, Westminster. We keep a coal-shed, and have the whole house—we keep a few single men lodgers—the prisoner came to lodge with me, and said she was in great distress—about two days before this hap<lb></lb>pened, I employed her to assist me—I believe she was eight weeks in the place before I employed her, which was on the 27th of March, to take care of the children, and mind the place for me—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and her victuals and lodging—she said she was badly off, for her father had died in Kent, in the hop-grounds, and she was only nine months from Ireland—on the 28th of March I received from my husband thirty-seven sovereigns, four half-sovereigns and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, consisting of half-crowns, two crown, and three quantity of shillings and sixpence—my drawers were in the shop, and the money in them, but for fear of accident, I took it and kept it in my bosom until I went to bed, and then placed it under my pillow—the gold was in a red merino purse, and the silver in a child's sock—the purse of gold was in the sock with the silver—the prisoner sat in the room at the time I undressed and put it under the pillow—it was near eleven o'clock at night—the publican's wife came and called me out, as far as the door, to come and tell my husband to come home—he was across the street having a pint of beer—I then left the prisoner in the room, and found her there when I came back with my husband, which was in ten or fifteen minutes—there was nobody else in the room but two children, one four and the other five years old—I hid the prisoner good night, and she went up-stairs to bed, and in the morning I discovered that the money was gone—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then gone—nobody but my husband had come into the room between the time of my going to bed and finding the prisoner in the room, and my missing the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She Keeps a house full of thieves, and every sort of people—there was more then ten in the room—two strange lodgers came into the room. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. My lodgers never used to go into bed-room—it is a little back parlour—there was nobody in the room except the prisoner and my two children when I left it to fetch my husband—there were no lodgers or strangers of any sort—I found the prisoner there when I returned—she did not say any body had been there in my absence—there were people in the Kitchen—it does not open into the back parlour where the money was—our property was not seized for rent—my husband did not want his horse and cart, and sold it—we had not taken our goods to any other place—I lived in the neighbourhood three years, and in that house nine months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, The reason I left her was because she was jealous of me and her husband, and was always <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. If I was jealous of her I should not have employed her—she was two months in the house, but I only employed her two days—I never in my life charged her with being intimate with my husband—none of the lodgers are here—Seaton is a lodger—he had lodged with us about four months—I never said in his presence that she should live no longer in the house—I never jawed her, nor was I jealous of her.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying your husband could be here very soon if he was wanted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might send for him—people tell me that a witness can come out of any prison—I could go to two or there person who saw me with the money—even the coal-merchant has seen me pay for two rooms of coals together—if I thought of bringing my book from the savings bank it would show that—I drew 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did your husband get the money from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He earned it—he had it in his box that day, which was locked—he gave it to me and told me if the coals came in to pay for them when they were delivered—he gave me the money between ten and eleven o'clock in the day, and I put it in the drawer in the daytime—it was an old-fashioned drawer, and I could not lock it, so I thought it safer to take it out, which I did at nine o'clock at night—I left it in the drawer all day—I do not know how much a room of coals is—my husband used to pay for them—they did not come in that day—a room of coals does not coat so much as five guineas—I believe it is ten chaldrons, but I am not sure—I was to pay Mr. Johnson for them.</p>

On the 30th of March I got up about seven o'clock, or five or ten minutes after—I was going out, and heard some money fall on the ground—I went into the room, and saw the prisoner stooping picking up some half-crowns—she had a white sock or glove in her hand—she immediately got up, looked round, and I saw some gold in the other hand—I did not take any notice—she said, "Halloo!" and down stairs I went to my work, knowing Mrs. Riley was down in her bed—as I came from work in the evening I heard of Mrs. Riley losing her money, and told her what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman M</hi> 16.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, in a court in Woolpack-yard, Kent-street, Borough—I found her secreted in a cellar, after searching for her some time—there was no way of getting to the cellar without getting over a fence six feet high, or being lowered down out of a back-parlour window—I found a scaffold-rope there, by which she might have been let down—I asked her what brought her there—she said she had run away from her father, being afraid he would beat her, or something of that sort—this was not the house she lodged in, but an adjoining house—I searched her, but found nothing on her—she said her father's name was Collins, and he lived in the court; but I found no such person there—I was obliged to force down the fence to get her out—I told her the charge—she denied knowing any thing about the robbery, but acknowledged having lived at Mr. Riley's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There were five or six open cellars for any body to go in. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There is a little row of houses there, and the Kitchens are never occupied—the back part of the house is on a level with the bottom of the Kitchens, and fenced up—the top part of the house I found her in was occupied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Her husband used to give her six or seven shillings at the most, at a time; and she suspected her lodgers of robbing her—when I heard she and the policeman were looking out for somebody, I thought (having left her) she might suspect me for something her husband had robbed her of, and I was afraid, if I was put into the station-house, I should never come out of it in my life—there was a passage to get to the cellar—the policeman asked me if there was a passage, but I would not please him by giving him any information, and refused to tell him—I told him the house in the court I lived at, and he went to it.</p>

            . I am a partner with Mr. Thompson - the prisoner came into our service on the Friday before Christmas-day - we had some suspicion of him; and on Thursday, the 26th of December, his hat was knocked off by our lad designedly, and a china mug fell out of it - I took it up, and said, "What had you this in your hat for?" - he said, "I was not going to take it away" - I went to the desk, and showed it to my partner, and the prisoner took up his hat and went into a little back place - he came out again, and another mug fell from his hat - these are the mugs; they are worth one shilling each, and the images are worth about seven shillings the pair.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WILDMAN. I am in the prosecutor's employ - last Thursday night week, I saw the prisoner take a mug from the front of the shop, and put it into his hat - I was outside at the time - I ran in, and he pulled a handkerchief out of his hat and pretended to be wiping his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020040"></xptr>nose - when Mr. Whitebread came in, I told him of it - I then went and knocked the prisoner's hat off, and a mug fell out of it - Mr. Whitebread took it up, and said, "What does this mean?" - he said, "I was not going to take it" - he took up his hat, and walked into the back place, and Mr. Thompson told me to fetch a policeman, but winked with his eye, as much as to tell me not to go - I went out for a minute or two, and when I came back, I saw Mr. Thompson pick up another china mug - both Mr. Thompson and Mr. Whitbread then told me to fetch a policeman.</p>
               <p>JOHN VIRTUE. I am headborough of Whitechapel - I went into the shop a minute after the policeman; Wildman got a light, and I went with him into the back place - I found these images among the straw - I showed them to the prisoner - he said he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WILDMAN. I had seen these images two days before, in a drawer, and I saw the officer find them in the back place, about the middle of it - I had been there several times that day; and about ten minutes before they were found, and they were not there then.</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th October, I was serving in Mr. Harris's bar, 15, Broad Street, Bloomsbury—I served the prisoner with one pennyworth of gin and some water—he gave me a shilling—I put it between my teeth, it bent readily, and I told him it was bad—he took it up, and said, "Yes"—he put it in his pocket, threw down another shilling, and said, "Try that"—I did so, and that was bad—he said that it could not be, and asked for it again—I would not let him have it, but gave him in custody—he was sober—he told the policeman he took them last night when he was drunk, he did not know where.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I met some friends, and got too tipsy to ride in an omnibus. I took a cab, but having only a five shilling piece, I stopped the cab, and changed it at a public-house, but did not get out. I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I never looked at the money. On the Tuesday I received a letter from Lord Grosvenor's committee respecting my vote, and went into this public house to get change for a shilling, that I might answer the letter. I showed it to this publican at the time. I have been thirty-five years in the same house, and have brought up a young family. I had no occasion to pass bad money, as my wife has an annuity.</p>

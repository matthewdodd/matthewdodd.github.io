                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live in New-street Mews, Dorset-square. On Friday, 14th Oct., I was in Smithfield, about half past. o'clock, endeavouring to buy a horse—a number of persons came round me, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me about—I saw both the prisoners standing close to me—I felt a <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> come round me, and I felt something go out of my right hand trowsers pocket—I had had in that pocket just before, a bag, containing 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver—I did not see the person who took it; I think it must have been a person behind me—at that time I saw Mid die ton standing on my left hand side—I did not see Collins—I went to turn round, but was prevented by Middleton, who put his arm over, and hit me on the eye—I went to turn round to the right, and he put his right arm over my shoulder, and hit me on the right eye; J believe it was with his open hand, I think more to prevent my seeing than anything else—I then turned round, and a lad standing behind me said, "There goes the man that has got your bag"—I</p>

               <p>saw Collins going across the market, under the pens or railings where the beasts and horses are tied—I followed him, and caught him by the collar—I did not give any alarm—he slipped his coat off, and ran away—I think he had one arm out of his coat, not both—I let go, and stooped under, and caught him again by the arms and round his waist—I caught him right in my arms—he went about ten yards before I first caught him—the second time he went but a very little distance—there were several persons round him, who stopped him—I saw a man come to him, and put his hands under him—I do not know whether he went to lift him up, or to take anything from him—I saw nothing pass—Collins was searched, but nothing belonging to me was found on him—I saw nothing more of Middleton till I saw him in custody—mine was a wash leather bag, but through wearing it, and carrying it in my pocket, it had turned dark.</p>

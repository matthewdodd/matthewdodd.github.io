On Tuesday morning, about half past one, on the 11th of December, on my returning home, I was about four doors in Cursitor-street. About seven or eight men together laid hold of me, and threw me down. I felt one of their hands in my right breeches-pocket. I had a dollar, four shillings, and about five pence in my pocket. I had been drinking. I was very little the worse for liquor. I was quite alone when these persons met me, they said nothing while I was on the ground. They tried to stop my mouth with mud. One of them said something before they attacked me. I believe it to be the prisoner, said who do you want? I am not sure it was the prisoner. While I was on the ground I cried out lustily, watch. I seized hold of the prisoner with my left hand, while they were rifling my pocket, I still kept hold of the prisoner. The watchman came up to my assistance. The rest all ran away. I had still hold of the prisoner with both hands when the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were on the ground did you feel any money go from you. - A. I perceived the hand in my pocket, and the taking of all the contents of the pocket out. The watchman took charge of the prisoner. While I was down, one of the parties kicked me. When I had got to the watch-house in Carey-street, I examined my pocket. I had lost a dollar, a shilling, and a few half-pence. I had three shillings and three pence half-penny left in my left pocket.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MACDONALD. I am a watchman in Chancery-lane. About half-past one o'clock in the morning, I heard a man cry out watch, in Cursitor-street. - I ran to the spot, and sprang my rattle. I found the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, he was crying out Oh you thief you have robbed me. The prisoner wished him to let him go for me to take him. I could see that the prosecutor had been drinking a glass or two, but he was perfectly sensible of what he was about. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutor, the last witness,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090028"></xptr>and the prisoner coming to the watch-house. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. What charge did the prosecutor give of the prisoner. A. That he was one of the party of seven or eight that knocked him down and robbed him. He lost a dollar, a shilling, and a few half-pence. The prisoner said he had been in Oxford-road, to see his sister. I asked him the name of the street his sister lived in; he said he did not know, he was a stranger to that part of the town, and having missed his way some where, he got into Fleet street. He came down Chancery-lane into Holborn, and passing by the end of Cursitor-street, hearing a noise, and a person calling watch, he went to see what was the matter, and when he came near the prosecutor several men ran away. He asked the prosecutor what was the matter, the prosecutor then seized him, and charged him with being one of the parties. The prisoner denied having any hand in the robbery, and proposed to be searched. I searched him, and found no property relating to this charge.</p>

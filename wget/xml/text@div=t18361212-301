                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Lambeth Water-works Company. I was present on the 7th when the money was marked, and on Tuesday the 8th, I saw the marks, and put them into the cash-box—this sovereign and half-sovereign part are of it—there were nine sovereign and three half-sovereigns marked and put into it—I gave the key to my clerk, Thomas Casey—the box was put into Casey's desk, the lock of which was imperfect and wanted repairing, and it was not locked—Casey came about nine o'clock next morning—I told him to get the box and put it on my desk, which he did—he gave me the key, and I opened it, I be<lb></lb>lieve, and a sovereign and a half were deficient from the marked money—I saw the prisoner in the office about one o'clock that day—I believe nobody was present but the policeman and himself, but the clerk and others case in two or three minutes—I told him to lay all the money he had in his pockets on the table before the policeman—he did so, and there were, I think, two sovereigns, besides this sovereign and a half-sovereign, and some silver—I examined it, and found this sovereign and half-sovereign were those I had marked—I desired the policeman to take him into an inner room, and examined him, and in about five minutes he came out of the room, and produced a key, which he tried, and it opened the cash<lb></lb>box instantly, much easier than the right key—the prisoner has been in the service of the company five years and three quarters—he has been my house-servant as well, and knew the house perfectly well—the box was always kept under lock and key by Mr. Casey—it was purchased for the exclusive use of the company's money, for the balance left there at night—all the sovereigns and half-sovereigns were similarly marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you give this money to Casey to mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I told him to mark what money there was on Monday afternoon—Mr. Casey is paid by the company, but he is under my control—I was at the police-office when he was examined—the clerk made a mistake in the number of sovereigns in Casey's deposition, which I told him was not cor<lb></lb>rect,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120079"></xptr>
               <p>and he said he would alter it—I rather think he made same mistake with regard to the umber of sovereigns in my deposition—I did not desire any error in mine to be corrected—I do not recollect that "ten sovereigns" was read over to me—it was the company's money—there was also 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, besides the gold, in the box.</p>

I was at the company's office on the 9th of November, with Mr. Nelthorpe, and a stranger was there—the prisoner came in—Mr. Nelthorpe called him forward, and desired him to empty his pockets—I also desired him to do so—he produced two sove<lb></lb>reigns, one half-sovereign, and some silver—Mr. Nelthorpe looked at them, and identified a sovereign and half-sovereign as the marked money—there was no opportunity of substituting other money for it—this is the sove<lb></lb>reign and half-sovereign which the prisoner produced from his pocket—they have been in my custody ever since—the marks were pointed out to me at the time he produced them—I found this key in his waistcoat pocket, which opened the box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you opening it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose two or three minutes—in getting it out of the lock I broke a piece off it—I told the Magistrate I tried the key, and there was something so that it would not open it—the Magistrate sent me back to try it again, and it then opened it perfectly easy—it would not open before, because a key filed as this is, if you do not put it far enough, or too far, it will not open—I had tried it two or three times, and failed each time.</p>

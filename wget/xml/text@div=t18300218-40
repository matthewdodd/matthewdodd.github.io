The prisoner came in on the day in question, and called for a pint of porter, which the servant took to him in the parlour; he stopped there till the rest of the people were gone from the parlour; there was a bagatelle-board in the parlour, which was shut up, and I had seen the balls safe about half an hour before he went into the room, when the board had been moved - the prisoner left about six o'clock in the evening; I had heard the board moved, and as soon as he was gone I sent my servant to look for the balls - I missed eight balls, and I believe these to be them; he was found in another public-house, and these balls were found up the chimney - other people had been in the room after I saw the balls safe.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a headborough. I was sent for to take the prisoner that same evening, a little after seven o'clock; he was in the parlour at the Phoenix tavern - I found nothing on him, but in the fire-place, up the chimney, I found these balls concealed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Other persons played with the balls after the prosecutrix saw them; what she said was my opening the board, was a pint pot which I sat down - I was an hour and a half there; there were six gentlemen there when I went in.</p>
               <p>MARGARET BARNETT. No one had played with the balls after I saw them, till I sent my servant, who said they were gone.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I was in the house that afternoon, but no one played with the board; he confessed at the watch-house that he took them.</p>

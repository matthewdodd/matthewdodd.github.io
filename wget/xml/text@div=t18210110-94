On the 14th of December, about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came to my house with some herrings, and made motions for me to let her fry them; she then sent me for half a quartern of butter and a twopenny loaf; she eat that and made motions that she was thirsty. I went down and brought her up some water, she did not drink it. In about three minutes she was taken with a violent pain, as I imagine. She put her hand into her pocket, and gave me twopence to fetch twopenny worth of liquor. On my return she stood with a tea-cup in her hand; she received the liquor, drank it, and went down stairs quite pleased. I went immediately to my chest, found it unlocked, and the watch gone, I had left it locked. I went and told her mother, who told me to go and look for her. On my return home I met a neighbour, who sent me to a public-house where I found her. I gave her in charge of a watchman, who found a leather glove on her, in which the watch had been wrapped.</p>

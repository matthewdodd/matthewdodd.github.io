                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 2, Queen-street—about a quarter to I on the morning of 4th February, I was in Sydney-alley, Soho, and saw the prisoner and another man coming towards me; the other man was about six yards in advance of the prisoner, and directly he passed me he turned round sharp and caught hold of my throat—he held me tight round the throat with both his arms—he did not hurt me much—directly he had got me the prisoner stepped up and struck me a very hard blow in the eye with his fist—I called out, "Murder!" "Police! and Police!" and while I was hallooing the prisoner tore out all my things, and snatched at my watch-chain and broke it in two—I had no watch—he got about four inches of the chain, and the key—the other man let me fall back after I had hallooed, and I came to the ground—they both ran away together till they came to the end of the alley, and then one went to the left and the other to the right—I got up instantly and pursued the prisoner, who was stopped by the policeman in my sight—I did not lose sight of him at all; I am sure he is the man—he had got about twenty yards when he stopped.</p>

               <p>before 1 o'clock, I heard cries of "Police!" coming from Sydney alley, and saw the prisoner running—I am sure he is the man—he came out of the alley into Leicester-street—I stopped him, and the prosecutor, who was close behind him, came up and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had been assaulted by two men; that one had got away, but that the prisoner was the one who struck him in the eye—his eye was very much inflamed and swollen—the prisoner said, "You are quite miss taken"—the prosecutor said, "No, I am not, for J never lost sight of you;" that was all—the prisoner was about five yards in advance of the prose<lb></lb>cutor when he was taken—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

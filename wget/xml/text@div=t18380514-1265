                  </hi>. I reside at Wandsworth. I was on a visit to Mrs. Fraser, who keeps a public-house at Knightsbridge—on the 31st of March, the two prisoners came to the bar for half-a-quartern of gin—I am sure they are the persons—Tobin asked for the gin—she was served—she and the other prisoner drank it—Tobin gave a shilling in payment—I received it from her, and put it into a small bowl in a till—there was no other coin in the bowl—I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—before they left Mrs. Fraser came in, and a man named Brook.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Sawyer, who keeps the Castle beer-shop, at Kensington.

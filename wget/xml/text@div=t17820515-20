On the 6th of March, I had been working in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel. As I was returning from my work, at about a quarter after seven o'clock, I was stopped by the prisoner and three other men in <placeName id="t17820515-20-crimeloc93">Stepney-fields</placeName>

They demanded my money; I said I had no money: upon which the prisoner kicked me on my right side with his foot, and I fell down upon the ground: then the prisoner put his hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and took out a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>How came you to have so much money in your pocket? - I took it with me to buy some clothes, but it was too dark when I had done work.</p>
               <p>Was there sufficient light to see the prisoner's countenance, so as to be certain he is the man? - Yes; it was dusk, neither light nor dark; but I could see his face very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150014"></xptr> well, as he had nothing over it; he had his hat flapped, but it was not over his face. I could not swear to any of the other persons.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - I was very little frightened; God kept me. When they left me, I went home, and went to bed, and in the morning I went to the Rotation-office, and gave information of the robbery. On the 18th of March, I was sent for to the Rotation-office; I saw the prisoner there in a room, in company with two other prisoners. As I passed them, the prisoner said to me, You sulky negro, what do you look at? upon which I fixed upon the prisoner; I knew him to be the man, though I said nothing till I went into the office. I am sure he is the person that took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What description did you give of the prisoner when you laid the information? - That he was a red-faced man, and I should know him again, if I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was that all the description you gave of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination, he said the prisoner was dressed either in blue or brown, he could not tell which; that he had no conversation with any person at the Rotation-office about the prisoner; and that he expressed no doubt whatever as to his identity.)</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. King, a butcher, in Bluecross-street. I saw the prisoner about a quarter before five o'clock, on the sixth of March; I particularly recollect the day, because I hurt my arm on the preceding day, the fifth of March: I met him in Warwick-lane; we went into a public-house, and had two pots of beer, and staid about two hours together. I then said I could not stay any longer; I must go home to my master's: he went home with me to my master's, and then we went to the Feathers tavern, and had two or three pots of beer, and parted about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the justice, I asked the prosecutor what dress I was in at the time he supposed that I robbed him: he said, the same dress I had on then. I have a person to prove I bought the coat I had on, four days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner ask you what dress he was in when he robbed you? - I do not remember that he did.</p>

               <p>Did you say he was in the same dress then, that he robbed you in? - I can swear I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Lake. The prisoner asked Justice Sherwood, whether he would ask that question about the clothes, or he should ask it himself;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150015"></xptr> the justice told him he might ask it himself, and he did ask it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Pitt-street, and am a wood-sawyer—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 1st of last month, I came home about twenty minutes to 12 at night—I found the street-door open, and the prisoner's mother standing at the door calling "murder"—in consequence of what she said I went into the parlour—I had to pass through the shop to do that—I found the prisoner in the parlour—I think I spoke to him first—I said, "Joe; what a fool you are making of yourself; I don't like to see old persons ill used, I have a mother of my own"—he turned and hit me with his left hand, and struck me in the chin—I shoved him back with my left hand—he got back towards the fire-place, took up a poker, and made a thrust at me with it, and sent it through my trousers, drawers and all—I shoved him back—I did not wish to ill use him, because I knew he was not a man that could stand against me in physical force—he then made a cut at my head—I caught the poker with my arms; it struck me here—it must have been rather hot; it caused a blister—I wrenched the poker from him, and threw it down—he caught hold of my neckcloth, and drew it very tight—I slipped my head through it, and got it off—he tried to bite and kick me—I struck him two or three times with my fist, and left him lying in the parlour—the mother said, "Mr. Earl, for God's sake, come out; you do not know what injury he might do"—I went out in the passage; the mother was outside—she locked him in the parlour—within three or four minutes afterwards he goes through the parlour into the shop, and comes into the passage again—a door parts the passage, which opens by a latch-key—he gets the door partly open—I got my feet against it—he put his hand round the door, and said, "Take that you b—"—that is the cut, through waistcoat and all, and here is the throat to show it—it cut my skin, and flesh as well; it wounded me—I have not quite recovered—I cannot get my head round very well—I had to go to the hospital, and a surgeon attended me.</p>

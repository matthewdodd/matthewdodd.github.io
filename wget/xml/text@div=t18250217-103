This property had been sent on shore on the evening of the 31st of January, to my house; I did not see it again till the day after, when I saw the flour and the pillow-case - the case had a hole in it, and I put a small handkerchief to stop it up.

            . I was on board the ship, and was sent by Wilson with these things; the flour was in a pillow-case. I landed at <placeName id="t18250217-103-crimeloc603">Bell wharf-stairs</placeName>

When I just got to the top of the stairs the prisoner sang out, "Halloo" - I had never seen him before; he asked me what I had there: I said flour. He told me to come up to the Police directly: I asked him if he would let me tell the mate first; he said, "No, go on;" when we got a little further, he told me to put the things down, and go and tell the mate directly; I went, and sang out on the stairs to the mate: he came on shore directly, but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170051"></xptr>things were gone. We gave information at the Police Office directly; I saw the prisoner next morning, on the craft, and told him he was the man who took the things; he said I was mistaken: he was then taken. I saw the pillow-case at the office.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. The prisoner never belonged to that office. I heard this account; the prisoner came to the office himself - when the boy came there he charged him with being the man that took the things. The prisoner took me to a house, and gave me a pillow-case, containing the flour, but not the jug and gingerbread: he said he had had a lark, and had got a little flour, and he should like to have an officer to go to the house; he said he had eaten the gingerbread, and broken the jug.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did not he come and give you this information voluntarily? A. Yes, he did; the boy had not given the information before. I was not there when the boy first came to the office.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, representing it to be a mere frolic.</p>

            . I live at Bell-wharf, Shadwell, and keep the White Swan, public-house. On the 31st of January, a little before seven o'clock, the prisoner came in, and told me he had had a fine lark, and said, "I have stopped a collier's boy with some flour, some gingerbread, and a little jug;" he then went away, and said no more - I did not say anything to him. I have known him ever since he was a child - I never knew him guilty of any harm; he bears an honest character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

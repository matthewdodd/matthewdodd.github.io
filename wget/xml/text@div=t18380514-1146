                  </hi>. On the 16th of April my suspicions were excited in consequence of what Roe the officer had told me, and I watched Brown, who was charing on the premises—she occasionally came out into Paternoster-row with dirty water, and looked about for somebody—I saw Raisin loitering about the premises, and after some time she approached Brown very closely, and appeared to receive some property from her—I went up and said, "Who is that person?"—Brown said it was a woman who was coming to assist her to-morrow—I took them both up stairs into a room, and got an officer—on Brown was found a comb, and close by her a jewel-case and another comb—the other prisoner was up in another room) and I believe she had managed to get rid of a very handsome comb, and put it into the fire-place—it was found there; and on her person was found some duplicates of our property, but we have ninety people serving in our shop, and it is impos<lb></lb>sible to swear that goods are not sold—Brown might have taken the pro<lb></lb>perty without Raisin's knowledge, but Raisin approached her, and I sup<lb></lb>pose received that handsome comb—she was loitering about, within thirty feet of the house—she could not see Brown take the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was called on to apprehend the pri<lb></lb>soners—I found them each in separate rooms—I proceeded to search Rai<lb></lb>sin—she had a large plaid cloak on—I turned it on one side—she had the bone of half a sheep's head under it—she said she had merely picked it up—I looked in the nostrils of it and found a piece of paper, which I found to be the parts of two duplicates torn to pieces—they referred to the lawn and shawl pawned on the 14th, and the silk pawned on the 16th—the comb was found in the fire-grate.</p>

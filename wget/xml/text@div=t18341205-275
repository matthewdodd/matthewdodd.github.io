                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Moad, and live in Green-bank, St. George's East. The prisoner lodged eleven weeks at my house—James Moore, who is now at sea, lodged with me for seven years, and left a jacket and waistcoat at my house—I was to take care of them for him—I missed them last Wednesday from a chest which has no lock to it—it was in the room the prisoner slept in—I had seen them the week before—in consequence of information, I sent my husband after the prisoner on Saturday evening—he did not sleep at my house every night.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was in the habit of coining to my house for eight weeks, backwards and forwards, to see a young female, who lodged at my house—he brought me a waistcoat on Tuesday week last, to get money on it—I pawned it for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Ward's, and gave the prisoner the money; and next day he brought me a jacket, which I pawned at Ward's, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him the money—when he brought the things to me, I asked if they were his own—he said, "Yes," they belonged to him; and on the first of the month he would get them out again, as he should have some money.</p>

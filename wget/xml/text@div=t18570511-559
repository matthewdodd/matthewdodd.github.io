April, about half past 3 or a quarter to 4 o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man on the top of the house, next to where I live—he was standing on the parapet, alongside some chimneys, with a rope in his hand; the other man was lying down in the gutter cutting the lead—I was at the top of our house, washing a box out, I could see them quite plainly—the other man saw me, and directly put down a piece of board that he had by his side—I saw the prisoner go away; he brought a long plank from the new building where he was employed, and put one end on the parapet, and the other end on the tiles, so as to walk backwards and forwards.</p>

We are employed building a warehouse at Bread Street Hill, within one house of Huggin Lane—the prisoner was employed there by me—he had no right to be on that house in Huggin Lane that day—on Friday, the 10th, about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, my attention was called to the top of that house by some men from the next warehouse—I went and examined the roof; I found the lead turned up, and beaten together with a hammer—there was about 28 lbs. of it—it laid just where it was cut—I found a plank there, leading from the building to the house.</p>

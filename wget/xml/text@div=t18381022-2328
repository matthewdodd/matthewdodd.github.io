                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel-road, and am a cooper. I had known the prisoner some years ago, but not very lately—he came to me on the 3rd of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked me whether I was a buyer of rum-puncheons—I said yes, if they were good—he said he knew of three for sale, and he thought I could get a shilling or two by them—if I could send 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would pay that as a deposit, and when he brought the casks to me we could settle the difference—it is very usual to leave a deposit—I considered he had bought them at the lowest figure—I said to my man, "Robert, you take "a sovereign, and go with this man, and pay the deposit, and what difference there is I will pay"—he was to pay the deposit to the publican who sold them, not to the pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not exactly explain that to Robert—when Robert came back I he had neither the casks nor the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I work with the prosecutor. The prisoner came on the 3rd of September—my master gave me a sovereign to go with him to buy some casks—I did not rightly know who I was to give the sovereign to—when I got to a public-house in Ratcliffe-highway, the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Give me the sovereign, I will go and pay for the casks and get the cellar open, and roll them out"—I gave him the sovereign, and stood outside—he did not come—I looked in, and saw him standing at the counter—he beckoned me in, threw down 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said, "Get a pint of beer; I will go and get it open"—he then went away—he was found on the Wednesday following—it was on Monday I went with him.</p>

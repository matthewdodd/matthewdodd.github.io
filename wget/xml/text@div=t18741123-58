                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 138). On the night of the 25th of October I was called by Catherine Vann to 4, Victoria Court, Broadwall—I saw Henry Vann and his wife standing there—I went inside, and was shown a bed in the back parlour, it was soaked with water, and a window looking into the back yard was broken—I returned to the front door and saw the prisoner, he was bleeding from the forehead—Mrs. Vann said she wished to charge him with breaking the window—I persuaded her to take out a sum<lb></lb>mons, and also to send for the landlord to see the damage that was done—the prisoner charged her with striking him on the head with a poker at the front door—she said she had not struck him at all at the front door, but she had struck him at the back window—as the prisoner was bleeding, I took the charge against Mrs. Vann—I asked if there were any persons present who saw it done, and two women came forward and said they saw it done—Mrs. Bassett was one—I attended at the Police Court next morn<lb></lb>ing, and heard the prisoner cross-examined—I afterwards went to Vann's house and saw the wall between his house and Cole's—I should say it was about from 4 to 5 feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Victoria Court, Broadwall, and am a stoker—on the evening of the 25th October I was in my front room, and heard Mrs. Cole speaking to my wife; I believe my wife answered her again—after that, Mrs. Cole made use of some unpleasant expressions to my wife—I came to the front door, and heard the prisoner trying to take his wife away—she did not go away—she called my wife several foul names, and my wife told her to go away—after that the prisoner came to my front door, and tried to get in—I pushed him back, and shut the door—he kicked the door, and tried to push it in—at that time my wife had no stick or anything in her hand—no blows were struck at the front door at all—the prisoner went away from the front door, and the next I saw of him he was coming in at my back door, that opens into our yard—I pushed him away, and shut the door; he then pushed up the window and tore the curtain down, and tried to get in at the back window—I believe my wife hit him with a stick to keep him out—he then threw a washing tray with some water on the bed—I sent my daughter for a constable—the prisoner, hear<lb></lb>ing that, got over his back wall again—at the time my wife struck him with the stick he had hold of the bedstead, and was trying to get in at the window, and he said he would scatter her brains out and ransack the place—when the constable came, he charged my wife with striking him with a</p>

I will fight him"—my husband slammed the door in his face—he then came round to the back—my husband pushed him out, and fastened the door; he then rose my bedroom window up and tried to pull himself in by the bedstead, and said "You b——mare, I mean doing for you to-night"—I said "If you do, I will mark you," and I struck him with the stick on the left arm—he stooped down and picked up a tray with some water, and threw it on the bed where my baby was lying, and drenched the bed with the water—I struck him again with the stick several times, no less than ten or twelve times, every time he tried to get in—my little girl called out "The police are coming," and as he was going I struck him very hard on the back, for I had a fair blow at him—the constable came, and I charged the prisoner with breaking my window and violence and threatening me; and then he charged me with hitting him with a poker at the front door I did not strike him at the front door—I did not use a poker that evening; if I had had one I would have used it.</p>

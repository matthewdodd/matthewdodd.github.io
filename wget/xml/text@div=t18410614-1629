About a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, on the 21st of May, I was in Pall-mall—I saw the prisoner following two gentlemen—I saw him put his hand into the pocket of the gentleman who was walking outside—he drew this handkerchief out—I took him with it—I asked the gentleman if this was his handker<lb></lb>chief/—he said, "Yes, it is mine, give it me"—I said, "No, if you please, come to the station and give the prisoner in oharge"—he said, "No"—he went to a Club-house—I followed him—he would not give his name—I asked his name at the house.</p>

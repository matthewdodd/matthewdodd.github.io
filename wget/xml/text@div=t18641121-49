                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 411). I have been watching the premises of Messrs. Nicholson, of 210, Upper Thames-street—about a quarter past 5 in the afternoon of the 12th October, I saw Bailey come out with a can apparently full, which he took to the Rummer public-house—he came out without it, and went back to Messrs. Nicholson's warehouse—about a quarter past 6, I saw both Bailey and Mills come out—Mills went to Fish-street-hill, and Bailey went into the Hummer, and brought out three cans, which appeared full—Mills waited about ten yards off from the public-house until Bailey came out, and then they went away together—on 20th October, about half-past 6 in the evening, I was opposite the warehouse—I saw Mills go into the public-house next door; he returned with Bailey—I saw them again come out; Bailey was carrying a piece of lead, and a bundle of wood—I left Mills locking the door, and followed Bailey to a marine store-shop in Lambeth-hill—I went in, and said to Bailey, "How came you with this lead?" and he said, "I have had it by me some time"—I told him I was a police-officer, and unless he gave me a satisfactory account of the lead, I should take him into custody—he said nothing, and I took him to the station—I then went to Mills's house, and waited till he came home—I said, "How do you account for that piece of lead Bailey brought out of your master's place to-night?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I told him I should charge him with being concerned in stealing it, and that I should search his premises—I went into the back yard, and found a large drum containing oil—I asked him how he came by it, and he said he had had it ever. since he was in business; twelve months ago.</p>

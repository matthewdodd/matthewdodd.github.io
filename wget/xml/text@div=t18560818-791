                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Brewer-street, Chelsea. I have known the prisoner the last four months—on the morning of 4th Aug. I was out between 3 and 4 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—he followed me straight home, and sat down on a chair—I had a shilling in my pocket and some halfpence—I put them on the mantelpiece, and I heard the report of a pistol—I turned, and the prisoner said, "If that won't do, I have another"—I went down stain to my landlord, and the landlady went for a policeman—I had met the prisoner in the afternoon, and had had some words with him, and he kicked me—I think he had been drinking—he had never threatened me at all—he has knocked me about—I was obliged to go to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You were sitting on my knee when I fired it; I said, "Charlotte, shall I fire this one off?" and you said, "you can if you like;" you got up and went to empty some slops. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have fought for my Queen and country; this girl has got everything she can from me; did I not say, "Come here, Charlotte, I don't want to hurt you?" and did I not ask you to take the pistol from me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you did not, there was not such a word said.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 131). I was called to the house of the prosecutrix—the prisoner was in the passage with the landlord—I asked him what he had been doing—he said, "Nothing of any harm; I did not mean to harm her"—he had a pistol in his hand—I said, "Give me that pistol," and he gavo me the one that was in his hand, and this other—one was loaded, and one appeared to have been attempted to be fired, and there was powder in the pan—it had been fired—in coming down the steps of the door the prisoner assaulted me—he was not drunk—when we were going to the station he said if he got over this he would serve her worse.</p>

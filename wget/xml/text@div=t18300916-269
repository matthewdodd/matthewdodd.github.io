            . I am in partnership with George Munro. In the beginning of this month, we lost a number of tin plates, and on the 7th of September the prisoner called, and said he had a quantity of tin plates, and asked if we would exchange some of them - we said if they were our mark and make, we should have no objection; Mr. Munro asked him if he had any objection to tell who he got them of - he said he had not, but he should not like his name to be mentioned, and he would point out the house of the person he had them from - Mr. Munro said we had lost a great many, and he was suffered to depart; we saw him in custody two days afterwards - we saw the boxes of tin plates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There is no doubt they are your property? A. No, the boxes have our marks on them; he took the officer to Aggus' house to show us the man - he was bailed.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. On the day after he had been to our house, I went with Brown and Attfield to the prisoner's - we said, "We've come about some plates;" he said he had no objection to change plates with us, if we would give him others for them - he said he had bought them cheap, and they were too large; I took them to our place - Attfield asked him if the whole of the premises belonged to him; he said that was not a fair question - Attfield said, "I am an officer, and shall take you if you prevaricate so;" I asked if he had any receipt - he said No; a woman then came, and said she had an entry in a book, but it has no date to it; it states, "Bought nine boxes of tin plates, of Mr. Aggus" - I said if he would go and show us the person he bought them of, we would exchange them; we went to Mr. Aggus', but found nothing there - there was a cart in the place, with the name of 
               <persName id="t18300916-269-person2217">J. </persName>
            Aggus, Pott-street, Bethnal-green, on it; a girl said it was her uncle's, and he was gone into the country to buy some pigs - the prisoner said the plates had been paid for in a public-house opposite, that he did not take a receipt, for he was rather tipsey at the time, but there was a person who could prove it - he named the person, but I forget the name. <rs id="t18300916-269-verdict1367" type="verdictDescription">

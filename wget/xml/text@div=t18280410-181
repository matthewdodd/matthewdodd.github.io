               <p>JANE BROWN. I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother. On the 31st of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, I was going along with my cousins; the prisoner and three other girls, came up to us; the prisoner left the others, came up, and asked us for a penny; I had none - my cousin had a halfpenny, and I had one; we put them together and gave them to her. I had never seen her before; she then asked for another penny, I said I had no more of our own: she said she knew we had, and that it was to make up three quarterns of gin, and we should have some. I said we never drank gin; she said she would never let us go clear, if we did not give it to her - she put her hand down my bosom and tore the beads off my neck; she threw them at me, and said, "You may have them again." I had a bag of money down my bosom, I took it out, and held it tight in my hand - she took my hand, forced it open, and pulled it out; my cousin asked her for the money, she took and hit her in the eye, and gave her a dreadful blow - she began to run; I called Stop thief! and she was taken; she gave my bag and money to another girl. I am sure she is the girl who took it - there were two half-crowns and two penny pieces in it; they belonged to Elizabeth Wickmill.</p>

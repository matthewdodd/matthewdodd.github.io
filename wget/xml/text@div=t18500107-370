                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier, of Woolwich. I had some lead in my yard, in front of my shop—on 17th Dec, between eleven and twelve at night, I was watching from my bed-room window, and saw the prisoner—I had seen him about three quarters of an hour before, as I was coming home from Plumstead—he was staggering as though he were drunk—it was a lightish night, and there was a lamp opposite—he was about three yards from the lead—I saw him go to the lead, unroll it, draw some<lb></lb>thing across it, and rip some of it up—I ran down as fast as I could, and took him by the collar, within about four yards of the place—he pretended to be very drunk, and asked what I was going to do with him—he threw a knife down—a man was coming by, and I sent him for a policeman—the prisoner attempted to get away, but I still held him.</p>

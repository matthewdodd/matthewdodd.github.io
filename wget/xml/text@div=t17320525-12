            . I was drinking with Spaul and Shaw, at the Black-Boy in Well-street, till 11 at Night, and from thence we went together into Goodman's-Yard; there was a Place pailed in, where some Houses were building; Shaw got over the Pails, and then handed a Ladder over to us, by the Help of which we got over too, and pull'd the Ladder after us, and raised it up against the Side of the Dwelling-house. Our first Design was to steal Lead, but it stuck so hard, that in pulling it up, some of the Mortar sell thro' into the Wash-house upon the Brass Porridge pots, which we perceiving, we thought the Pots would be a better Booty than the Lead, and so we untiled Part of the Wash-house, and put the Ladder in, and Spaul went down, and brought the Goods up to us. When we had got what we thought convenient, we haul'd the Ladder up, and set it again against the Pails: Spaul went over first, and I and Shaw handed the Things to him, and then followed; we carried them all to Warfield's House; her Husband keeps a Smith's Shop, but I have no Acquaintance with him. We knock'd at the Fore-Door, and a Man within (I don't know who he was) bid us go to the Back-Door, which we did; you go down Steps to the Back-Door.

I went by myself, and picked out a Rag that was mine from a Heap of other Rags that lay in a Corner of the Room Up-stairs, and every thing look'd so miserable, that I did not expect to find any thing else there that belong'd to me. Court. Have you got it here? Pro. No, they said I should but be laughed at for bringing such a thing hither. Court. They were mistaken, it was very proper to be produced, if you could swear to it.

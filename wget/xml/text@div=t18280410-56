On the 20th of March, in the morning, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and purchased a gross of laces, for which he tendered half-a-sovereign. I went into the counting-house to make the entry in the cash-book, and get him change, which I brought him out, and he went away. I went to the desk to enter the transaction in the ready-money book, and Dixon came down, and said, "That fellow has got half-a-dozen of thread in his bag." I went out, found him in the street, and brought him back. I desired him to turn out his goods; he pulled out various parcels from his bag, then took out this 6 lbs. of thread, and handed it to me. Mr. Dimsdale came in, and sent for a constable; the prisoner then touched my arms, and said, "My dear sir! My dear sir!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he in the habit of coming to sell articles to you? A. He has done so; his sister makes braid - he asked me that day to buy some goods, but did not take any articles out of his bag to my knowledge; he might have done so in my absence - I did not suspect him before, and believe he hears a good character; he was walking away when I took him; he had left the shop a few minutes, but had not turned the corner.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How can you swear to it without opening the paper? A. I have seen it before; I have no private mark on it, but I know the manufacturer's mark and number; I stopped him about one hundred yards off; he does not deal in thread; the same maker makes for other people.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I daresay you will swear that it is it? A. No; I was ten yards from him, looking down from an upper warehouse - we have too much to miss it; his own goods were in brown paper, but were very different parcels to these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was guilty of such a thing; I knew nothing about it, till the gentleman came and said, I had something in my bag; I said I would go back with him - my bag was full of parcels; I had them taken out in the warehouse while the gentleman was getting change, as I wanted to replace them - I was in conversation with the gentleman some time after I paid for the goods - my bag was on the ground, and the parcels of thread close to it.</p>

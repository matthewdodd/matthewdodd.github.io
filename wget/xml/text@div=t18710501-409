                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of the Barking Road—I saw the deceased on 7th April, the day after the occurrence—he was in a comatose condition, totally insensible, and breathed stertoriously—he was sinking fast—I saw him three times during the day, and he gradually sank and died—on 11th April I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body—there was a fracture of the skull, with great extravasation of blood, from the effects of the fracture, between the cranium and the skull—the brain was very highly congested, and I attributed that to the effects of recent drunkenness—in my opinion, looking at the appearance of deceased generally, he was in a helpless condition, from the effects of intoxicating drink, at the time he fell—I think he was in liquor, because the bladder was much distended at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what do you attribute death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the fracture of the skull, undoubtedly; congestion already existed—the fracture of the skull and the highly congested state of the brain caused the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The skull was fractured nt the base—it was much thinner than we ordinarily expect to find it—the injury at the back would arise from a fall—I cannot say how long congestion of the brain had been going on—I should say the deceased had been accustomed to drink—I think so from the state of the bladder—irrespective of the condition of the brain, the fracture would have caused death; there was not congestion enough to do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that the brain was highly congested; that the frac<lb></lb>ture of the skull was caused by a fall; that extravasation of blood set in; and that that, added to the congestion of the brain, caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on Thursday, 6th April, about 11.15 at night, I was walking up the North Woolwich Road, at West Ham, and when near to the Royal Sovereign public-house, I saw the prisoner and the deceased talking loudly on the pavement, but what it was about I could not tell—I saw the prisoner hit the deceased in the face, and he fell—the prisoner stooped to pick him up—in consequence of what I saw I fetched a policeman, and on my return the prisoner was helping to carry the deceased to his home—the deceased never spoke or moved, as far as I am aware, after he was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was six or seven yards from them when I heard them talking—I didn't think they were quarrelling before I got up—I heard prisoner say, after he had struck the deceased, that he was sorry for it, as they were mates—my impression was that the blow caught deceased's face—I did not see the prisoner try to restrain him—they were both strangers to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 8, Denmark Street, West Ham—I was in the North Woolwich Road, and saw the prisoner and the deceased opposite to the Royal Sovereign public-house—I saw the prisoner's hand go into Willis's face, and he fell back heavily—I cannot say whether the blow was struck with his fist or his hand—I ran to Mr. Kelland's surgery, and when I returned the prisoner had hold of the deceased, and was trying to lift him up—Wells never moved or spoke afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear anything said before the blow was struck—I cannot say whether the prisoner was drunk, but he seemed to be greatly agitated at the time.</p>

I am stationed at Plaistow—about 2.45 in the afternoon I apprehended the prisoner, at the Walmer Castle, Plaistow—I told him he was charged with assaulting a man named Willis, who was then lying in an insensible state, at 13, Stratford Street—he said "I did not assault him; I met him in the road, and we had a few words about my striking his son; I could not get away from him; I gave him a shove, and he fell on the pavement; I assisted him home; I am sorry for what I have done"—I then took him to the police-station, and he said nothing more.</p>

               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Garrow, and the case by Mr. Attorney General, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: - This is an indictment against the prisoner, founded upon an act of parliament in the nineteenth year of his late majesty, and which was then found necessary for the protection of the revenue, which was at that time, as I am sorry to say it is at present, very much and almost totally annihilated, by the violent proceedings of those engaged in this illicit traffick. - Gentlemen, the object of the act is to prevent a forcible opposition to the officers of government, in the discharge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270103"></xptr>of their duty; the consequences of such opposition had been then so fatal, and has of late years been so fatal, that it became absolutely necessary, that severe laws should be made, in order to effectuate that end, which ought to be the purpose of every law; the prevention of the offence, as well as that of the more serious consequences, which sometimes happen; therefore it was enacted, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, shall be assembled for the purpose of rescuing uncustomed goods, after seizure, that that shall be deemed a capital felony. - Gentlemen, it will be necessary for the prosecutors to prove, in order to sustain this indictment, that the prisoner was, together with others, more than to the number of three, assembled for the purpose of rescuing, and that they actually did rescue from the officers of excise, after seizure, a considerable quantity of goods liable to pay customs, and the customs of which had not been paid. - Gentlemen, the facts are these: On the 5th of November last, a cutter, called the Resolution Cutter, in the service of the excise, was stationed off Swannick's Bay, for the purpose of looking out for smugglers; early in the morning, but when I believe it will appear to you that it was perfect day, they discovered a small cutter at anchor in Studland Bay, about four miles distant from the place where the cutter lay; upon this the smuggling cutter slipped her cable, and stood out to sea; the smugglers finding she could not make out her way, immediately went ashore, landed her goods, and carried away as many of them as they could; before the Resolution was able to come up, they had been able to carry but a very few off, and the rest was left upon the beach, or thrown into the sea, out of which the Resolution's crew took up a considerable quantity; they had secured them, and were ready to carry them away as soon as the tide would permit; having waited there about three hours, they perceived about thirty men on horseback coming towards them; and it will appear that the prisoner was one of them; they were armed, some of them with fire arms, some of them with large bludgeons, of whom the prisoner was one; and with these arms they came evidently for the purpose of rescuing these goods; upon which, Quick, the officer, called out to them, that they had arms with them, and bid them stand off, for they certainly should not rescue the goods; upon which, they cried out, fire away and be damn'd, we are come resolute! upon which, they forced on horseback against the officers; Quick ordered them to fire, which they did, and several of the smugglers fell; they then rushed in upon them, and very soon put the King's officers to flight, except Quick, who was knocked down, and lay senseless for some time; the rest ran into the water till they were up to their necks; the smugglers went into the water after them on horseback, and it was God's providence alone that preserved any of them: when Quick came to his senses, he found that he had not only received the blow that laid him senseless, but that the smugglers had in the most inhuman manner cut and mangled him in the way he will describe to you; upon this, another party of smugglers came with a waggon and cart; the officers not being able to protect their seizure, the smugglers put the goods into the cart and waggon, and carried them away. Gentlemen, this is the kind of case I have to lay before you; no men would venture their lives, if laws of this kind were not made to prevent such offences; and the officers of the crown do no more than their duty, in bringing to justice the prisoner at the bar: It is not for me to comment upon these offences, because you know the laws of this country must be maintained, in a rigid execution of them: whether this man falls within the law, it is for you to determine; I have stated to you the law and the evidence; if the evidence comes up at all to the brief I have in my hand, there can be no doubt, but the prisoner is guilty of the offence, of being assembled with others to the number of more than three, with fire-arms and other offensive weapons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270104"></xptr>concerning which, you will have my Lord's direction; sticks, commonly called walking-sticks, certainly would not be considered as offensive weapons; you will judge whether the arms were fire arms, or bludgeons, such as were made for the purpose: if the evidence comes up to the case, I am sure you will find the prisoner guilty; if it does not, you will of course acquit him.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Solicitor General.</p>
               <p>What is your occupation? - I am a mariner.</p>
               <p>On board of what ship was you in November last? - The Resolution.</p>
               <p>Where was you on the 6th of November last? - In the morning we lay in <placeName id="t17880227-106-crimeloc507">Swannick's Bay</placeName>

               <p>Were you on shore that morning? - Yes, about ten o'clock, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Quick, the officer of excise, that morning? - Yes, he landed a few minutes after me in another boat.</p>
               <p>Describe to the Jury what passed upon Quick's coming on shore? - From her coming from the cutter, we saw a small boat that we supposed was what they call a tub-boat, a boat used by smugglers to carry tubs.</p>
               <p>Upon seeing this boat, what passed? - We pursued her to the shore, and in a little time she landed; we saw her land, and the four men that were in her, ran up the sands.</p>
               <p>Where did you see her first? - About three miles from Swannick's Bay.</p>
               <p>Was she sailing? - Yes, towards the land; the four men ran up the sands, each of them taking a tub; the tubs are four gallon casks.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - In a few minutes after we landed; and in the wash, the surf that runs upon the shore, we found about one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty small casks of spirits, which we saw thrown out of the aforesaid tub-boat; we seized them, and piled them up in a heap; we endeavoured to launch them off in our own boats, but on account of the surf running so high upon the shore, we found it impracticable, we could not get them off; we continued so without any thing material happening for about the space of two hours.</p>
               <p>What time of day might this be? - It might be about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stand by the casks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. At the end of two hours, what happened? - We perceived a company of men on horseback.</p>
               <p>How many in number as near as you can judge? - As near as I can judge thirty or forty; I am sure upwards of thirty.</p>
               <p>Had these persons any things with them? - When they came nearer, we perceived they had clubs.</p>
               <p>Describe to the Jury what sort of clubs? - They were near about three feet long; the small end was about the bigness of a common walking cane; the large end came to a large knot about as big as the fist of a child of ten years old.</p>
               <p>Did this appear to be a walking-stick? - I never knew them used as walking-sticks; they must be very unhandy for walking.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner at the bar one of those thirty? - That man was very near in front.</p>
               <p>You are very sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any such stick as you have described? - He had one of them.</p>
               <p>What did you observe the prisoner do? - I cannot say any thing of the prisoner, any farther than that there was a general explanation.</p>
               <p>What was said? - When they came within twenty or thirty yards, the mate, Mr. Quick, desired them to stand off, or he would fire at them.</p>
               <p>How near were they when this happened? - Twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this explanation before or after Quick desired them to stand off? - After.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. What answer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270105"></xptr>was given to this? - Fire, you b - g - rs, fire, we are come resolute.</p>
               <p>What passed upon this? - Upon that, most of us fired.</p>
               <p>How many were you in number? - Eleven.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of this? - I saw immediately, one man drop from his horse.</p>
               <p>Go on? - The company rushed in among our people.</p>
               <p>What did you perceive then? - I saw two men beating Mr. Quick, the ate, with these large stick; I having a musquet in my hand, ran down to relieve Mr. Quick.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you find Mr. Quick? - He was all over blood; the blood was gushing out at his head.</p>
               <p>What passed upon your coming up? - As soon as I had cleared him of the men that was beating him, I received a blow myself that made me stagger.</p>
               <p>What was that blow given to you with? - I cannot tell, as the man was not in front of me; I cannot say; he was behind me.</p>
               <p>Was it a blow with a fist? - It appeared by the cut to be a cutlass, for it cut my hat as sharp as a knife, and cut my head in the crown.</p>
               <p>After you received this blow, what happened? - I had not recovered staggering till I received a second blow.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive what that blow was given with? - It must have been with a cudgel or stick; it did not cut me, but brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Having received this second blow, what happened? - I lay blind some little time; the first thing I saw, was a man making a blow with one of these sticks at me; as Mr. Quick and I lay close together; we received each of us a blow with these sticks from near twenty of the party; one man snapped a pistol at me twice.</p>
               <p>As you lay in that situation? - As I lay upon the ground; finding the pistol would not go off, he took the pistol and rammed it into my mouth, knocked out two of my teeth, and loosened three.</p>
               <p>Did you see any fire-arms? - When they first came up I saw none.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards? - Afterwards, I saw several of them have pistols.</p>
               <p>Were there any other sort of fire-arms? - They had some of them; I cannot describe the number; they were short pieces, like carbines; they appeared to me to be musquets with half the barrel cut off.</p>
               <p>Were there any other species of arms besides these? - There were cutlasses besides.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation that Quick was in? - When I first recovered, he was lying like dead; I hardly thought that he could survive long; he hardly flinched when he received the blows with the stick.</p>
               <p>You mean the last blows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe among those persons that any of them fired? - There were two of them fired, but what, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>In what direction? - One of them towards the sands, and one towards the water.</p>
               <p>Towards your people? - At that time, I could only see our mate and another man; we lay upon the sand close by the water-side; while we were in that state, this company, with about ten more than first came, came with a cart and waggon.</p>
               <p>What did they do with this cart and waggon? - They loaded the tubs that we had seized, upon the cart and waggon.</p>
               <p>What did they do with them? - They rode off with the waggon, and their whole company as a guard, putting their wounded upon the waggon and cart; they put three upon the waggon and two upon the cart, that I suppose could not ride on horseback, and covered them up with great coats, and rode off.</p>
               <p>What became of Quick? - He was carried away by our people, upon two oars.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he? - When I spoke to him, he could not speak; he only shook his head and waved his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270106"></xptr>And was carried off in that condition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were in the casks? - I smelt brandy and tasted rum; they were four gallon casks; they were slung.</p>
               <p>Describe exactly what the slings are, and how they were connected with these casks? - They are small slings, made of small cord; they were made fast round the cask for the more convenient carriage of them.</p>
               <p>Court. How many of these casks might be so tied together? - Every cask was separate with a sling about it.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the service of the Revenue? - Near ten months.</p>
               <p>I think you say there were four men in the tub-boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they sailors? - There was one of them a sailor; two of them were young lads, about sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>The first time you saw the prisoner was on horseback coming down upon the shore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As soon as you told them to stand off, you fired? - Quick fired; I cannot say we all fired.</p>
               <p>Quick was the first man that fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many do you think you might kill? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many did you see turn about and ride off wounded? - There was one man wounded; they took him off his horse, and put him in the cart; by the time that I recovered my sight, the waggon was close to us.</p>
               <p>It was some time you know before you was knocked down after you fired? - No time all.</p>
               <p>Upon your party's firing immediately, the other party pushed in upon you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was a man then dropped from his horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before that time? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long did you observe him? - I observed them some little time as they were riding off, to see if I knew any of the company.</p>
               <p>But you did not know this man? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him afterwards? - At Southampton, after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is Adams? - An inspector of the out-ports of excise.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body you knew him at that time? - Yes, the captain of the cutter I belonged to was with me; he asked me, if I knew him? and I said, I did.</p>
               <p>At that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You recollected him, when you saw him at Southampton; there was no difference in him? - Yes, he looked rather thinner, but there was no material difference.</p>
               <p>This was the 6th of November? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose he appeared the same then, that he does now? - He looked rather fuller.</p>
               <p>With a patch upon the side of his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing of that kind, at that time? - No; he was then dressed in a long smock frock.</p>
               <p>He had no mark upon his face at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any others of the party since? - I have seen none else.</p>
               <p>This man was amongst the thirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were many of them in long smock-frocks? - Most of them were.</p>
               <p>How far off might he be when you fired? - Not above ten yards.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of him after you had fired? - Not that I can possibly say.</p>
               <p>I believe most of your shot told? - I cannot say for my own, for it did not go off.</p>
               <p>When you fired, then it was that they broke in upon you, and knocked you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in this man's face that made you recollect him? - The only thing was his complexion and features; as I might suppose, if I were to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270107"></xptr>any one of the gentlemen here, and was to see him again, I should say, I saw that man at such a place.</p>
               <p>But suppose you were to see him a month afterwards, should you recollect him? - Yes, if I looked very attentively; and from the notice I took of this man, I know him to be one.</p>
               <p>How came you to take notice of him in particular? - I took notice of all that were in front.</p>
               <p>Do you think you could recollect at a month's distance? - I think, I could; I do not speak from any resentment against that man.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you saw this man at Southampton? - About a fortnight ago, or nearly thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Do you think if you had met that man, and had looked at him, you should have known him without his being pointed out to you? - If I had not looked at him, I should not; but if I had looked at him, I should.</p>
               <p>About the middle of this month it was that you saw him? - About the 14th, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Where have you been since this accident? - Mostly at Southampton.</p>
               <p>You have seen many there in smock-frocks? - A great many.</p>
               <p>How long after this was it, that Quick gave information to the Board of Excise? - I believe immediately; I have heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give any information yourself? - Of what.</p>
               <p>About this man? - I could give no particular observations, further than I described the man at front; that he was a man of such statute.</p>
               <p>To whom did you give that description? - To the officers, at Pool.</p>
               <p>Give us a description of some of the others in front? - There was another man next to the prisoner, was a stouter man than any of the others; they asked me, if I should know them again, if I saw them; I told them, I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. I think you said at the time, that Quick advised them to keep off, that they were within forty yards distance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the firing was, they were about ten yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they continue advancing? - Yes, with their full bent on horseback.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>You are an officer of excise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The mate of the Resolution cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what happened on the 6th of November? - I went on shore.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time in the morning? - I came out of Bourne-sea; it might be about eight o'clock, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You came in the boat? - I was officer of the boat.</p>
               <p>A boat belonging to the Resolution cutter? - It was; after I got out of Bourne-sea, I saw a vessel lying riding upon anchor, in Studland-bay, which I supposed to be a smuggler, and when she discovered me, she slipped, and went out of the bay.</p>
               <p>You saw her slip? - Yes; she was going to the Westward, but seeing the Resolution, she hauled her weather, and went down upon the North shore; I chased her in the boat, the captain in the cutter; the captain got up with her; before I pulled in my boat, the smuggler had sent his boat on shore.</p>
               <p>You saw that? - Yes; the captain immediately hoisted his four oar'd boat, and sent her on shore after the smuggling-boat, with four men in her; as soon as I arrived at the spot, I went on shore, and seized the goods which were all lying upon the land-wash of the sea; I got them together all on a heap, as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>What did you get together? - The tubs.</p>
               <p>What kind of tubs were they? - What they call half-ankers.</p>
               <p>What liquor? - Rum; I tasted.</p>
               <p>Were they in flings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You tasted nothing but rum?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270108"></xptr>- Nothing but rum; after I got them together, I tried to launch the four-oar'd boat to get the goods on board of the cutter, but the sea ran so high, I found it impossible to get either of my own boats off; after that, I got my own masts and fails into the smuggling-boat, and endeavoured to launch that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You thought the smuggling boat would launch sooner than your own? - Yes, because she was flat, and would rise lighter; while I was putting the goods on board, I saw a party of people riding down from Bourne-bottom.</p>
               <p>How many might that party consist of? - About thirty; seeing them ride down in their long smock-frocks, I took them to be smugglers; I ordered my people to take to their arms.</p>
               <p>Court. They were in smock-frocks, were they? - Most of them; they accordingly did take to their arms; as soon as the smugglers came within hearing, I desired them not to ride any farther, if they did, I would sire upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How near might they be when you gave them that caution? - About ten or twelve yards, or rather better; upon which, the answer they made me, was; d - n your eyes! fire, you b - g - rs, fire! they rode up immediately, with their sticks brandishing over their heads; upon which, I ordered my people to fire, and fire! myself; when one man dropped from his horse.</p>
               <p>Had you observed the persons of any of those that came up? - One that was a-foot upon the shore, of the name of Dominy, I am sure I should know again.</p>
               <p>But of the thirty that came up, do you know the persons of any? - I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Look at that man? - I cannot swear positively to him; after this man fell from his horse, they rode in upon me, and the man that was on shore, cleft my skull with a tomahawk, which he got out of my own boat; cut a piece out of my left arm, wounded me in my right hip, cut me across my left hand, and broke my right hand little finger; after they had done that, they beat me in a very cruel manner; I was lying upon the sands; they bruised me from head to foot very much.</p>
               <p>Had you observed what the men had in their hands when they came up? - Some sticks, some whips.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks? - They might be as big round as a large broomstick, with a large head to them.</p>
               <p>How long were they? - About three feet, or three feet and a half, as nigh as I can tell by the sight of them.</p>
               <p>What kind of whips were they? - They seemed to be large loaded whips; I cannot say they were loaded, but they appeared to me to be large loaded whips.</p>
               <p>What was the size of the end of the whips? - About as big round as the large end of a broomstick.</p>
               <p>As you lay upon the ground, you say you received several blows; do you know what you was beat with? - With those sticks; they laid hold of the small end, beating me with the large end; after beating me, and wounding some more of my people, they drove off the goods in triumph, in a waggon and a cart.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the rest of your people? - No, I was in a state of insensibility at that time.</p>
               <p>Therefore you do not know what became of your people? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You was afterwards carried on board; I believe that was all you knew? - That was all I knew.</p>
               <p>You did not see the goods carried off then? - Yes, but after that I bled so much, that I was insensible.</p>
               <p>What has been the consequence of those blows? - It affects my legs; a paralytic disorder proceeds from the wounds of my head, to my leg on that side.</p>
               <p>How long was you confined? - Between five and six weeks in my chamber.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>You say, these persons were about ten or twelve yards distance, when they first came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270109"></xptr>Upon that you gave immediate orders to fire? - I desired them to stand off.</p>
               <p>And they not standing off, you desired them to fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the firing, I take it a scuffle immediately commenced? - It did.</p>
               <p>You were of course, in a great deal of confusion, as well as the other men at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have stated a tomahawk being made use of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That came out of your own boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not brought by these people? - No.</p>
               <p>Your own own masts and fails were in the smuggler's boat at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were in the way that the smugglers had to go to their own boat? - No; the goods were all on shore.</p>
               <p>But they must have passed you to have gone to their own boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were no other weapons besides sticks and whips, except this tomahawk? - I did not observe any other.</p>
               <p>And this mischief was done you by this Dominy, who is not yet taken? - It was; he came behind me, and cut me with a tomahawk.</p>

               <p>Do you know who the man was, who fell from his horse, who was shot? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He was shot before any scuffle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You was the first person knocked down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seized the boat? - I had clapped the broad arrow upon her, in two places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no firing from the smugglers? - Not that I remember.</p>

               <p>You belong to the Resolution cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quick was the mate of that cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you in the boat with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You landed with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see upon the beach when you first landed? - Some tubs swimming in the water.</p>
               <p>You collected them together afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been on shore by the beach and taken possession of these tubs, before you saw a company of men coming down upon you? - As nigh as I can guess about two hours.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it, as near as you can guess? - About ten o'clock, when I came on shore.</p>
               <p>How many do you think there were? - I cannot rightly say; there might be thirty, or there might be more; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When they had come within twenty or thirty, or ten yards, was any thing said by Quick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near were they then? - They might not be any further than from one end of this table to the other.</p>
               <p>You were near enough to hear distinctly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did Quick say? - He desired them to keep off, or he would fire.</p>
               <p>What answer was made? - They said, fire, you b - g - rs, fire! for we are come resolutely bent!</p>
               <p>After that answer was so made by them, what was done? - Quick ordered us to fire; he fired first, and then ordered me to fire.</p>
               <p>When you had obeyed this order, did you perceive the effects of your firing? - We saw one or two men drop.</p>
               <p>When you had seen them drop, what followed immediately? - As soon as they had dropped, they rode in upon us, and knocked us down.</p>
               <p>Now look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he one of the company? - He was one of the company.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he in the company? - He came on horseback, with a large club in his hand, not quite so big as my fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270110"></xptr>In what manner was this club carried? - By the small end, and the big end above his head.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he; as there were thirty of them, some must be forward, and some behind; was he in the front? - He was nearly in the front, there was one before him.</p>
               <p>And you took observation enough to say he was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came forward, did you see who he assaulted? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see whether he assaulted any one? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What became of you? - I ran into the water, and as I was in the water, a man came to me, and pointed a musket.</p>
               <p>One of the company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On horseback? - Yes; he pointed a musket at me, and snapped it, I suppose a dozen times, and it did not go off.</p>
               <p>What became of you at that time? - As soon as that man went away, there were three more came and knocked me down, cut me in the head, and bruised me very much.</p>

               <p>What did they do after they had knocked you down in the water? - They knocked down every one they came nigh, and went away with the goods.</p>
               <p>In what manner were they loaded? - In a waggon and a cart.</p>

               <p>Do you happen yourself to know what those casks contained? - About four gallons each.</p>
               <p>But did you taste any of the liquors? - What I tasted was rum.</p>
               <p>What became of Quick after they were gone? - We came and took them up that were wounded, and carried them on board.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that man, the prisoner at the bar, was there? - Yes I am, he certainly was on the shore.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>Where did you see him first after this happened? - At Southampton.</p>
               <p>A fortnight ago? - It might be a fortnight, I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you had seen him since that happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, I saw him upon the shore.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before the time the affray happened? - No.</p>
               <p>There could not be much time intervene between your firing and their attacking you; they were very near you when you fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say there might be one or two men before this man? - There might be one or two, he was almost as soon as e'er a one.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of him after you had fired? - No.</p>
               <p>Then, in fact, the only time you saw this man, was when they were advancing in this riotous manner, and when Quick ordered you to fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think all this took up two minutes? - Yes, ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they make any halt at all? - No.</p>
               <p>They came up galloping very furiously, when Quick called to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they called out, fire, you b - g - rs, fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the only opportunity you had of observing him? - We had a very fair opportunity of observing him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance was this man from you, when you first saw him? - I suppose he was not above ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>You particularly saw him, so as to be perfectly sure? - Yes, perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>You never saw him till he was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>And then he was pointed out to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. When you saw him again at Southampton, had he that patch upon his face that he has now? - I cannot say he had; he had an handkerchief over his head then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It was not bound up the first time you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>But from the observations you made, did you immediately know him again, the second time you saw him? - Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Had you given any description of him to any body before you saw him again? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not given any description of them, to know them again? - I had said, that if I should see some of them again, I should know them, but I never described this man particularly.</p>
               <p>[An objection was taken by Mr. Sheppard and Mr. Knowlys, being of Counsel for the prisoner, that it was necessary to support the indictment, that the subject of it should himself have preconcerted the assembling, and that he should himself be armed with an offensive weapon; but that the stick described by the witnesses to be in the hand of the prisoner, was not an offensive weapon; which objection was debated by the Counsel on both sides; the learned Judge said he was of opinion, that whether it was an offensive weapon or not, was a matter of fact that ought to go to the Jury.]</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. - The case upon which it becomes me to address you, deserves the attention both of the Judge and the Jury. This, you find, is an indictment against the prisoner at the bar,

               <p>The learned Judge having summed up the evidence to the Jury, proceeded to make the following observations.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. - This is the evidence on the part of the prosecution, and this prosecution is founded upon part of an act of parliament, which was passed in the 19th year of the late king's reign; in which it is enacted, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, armed with firearms, or other offensive weapons, shall be assembled, in order to be aiding and assisting, in the running, landing, or carrying away prohibited, or uncustomed goods, or goods liable to any duties, which have not been paid or secured; or after having been seized, to take them from any officer or officers of excise: in that case, and other cases specified in the act, but which are now out of the case, it shall be deemed a capital felony; so that the crime for which the prisoner stands indicted, is a capital offence. The question is, whether he comes within the meaning of the act. It is certainly true, that the mere act of rescuing smuggled goods, is not now, of itself, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270112"></xptr>capital felony; because though it was so under this present act of the 19th of

            . the subsequent act has described that offence, and made it a misdemeanor only; and subjected the offenders to certain punishments less than this act of parliament had described for that offence: the construction is, that this is a virtual repeal of the statute of the 12th of

            . so far as it goes to inflict the capital punishment, upon the rescuing of the goods. - That part upon which the prisoner must be convicted or acquitted is, that he with other persons, to the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms, and other offensive weapons, was assembled, in order to be aiding and assisting, in taking those prohibited goods, or rescuing the same after the seizure by the officers of excise; so that to bring the prisoner's case within the meaning of the act, it is necessary he should assemble with other persons, with the intent, and for the purposes of the act; and that the persons so assembled should have been armed with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; and in my opinion this act requires, that every person charged with having committed the offence, should be proved himself to be actually so armed; and that if the prisoner had been seen unarmed in this assembly, and every other man in the assembly had been armed, I should have been of opinion that the prisoner was not within the meaning of the act. Therefore the question for your consideration in the first place will be, whether any persons with whom the prisoner was connected, did assemble armed, and whether the prisoner was so armed, for the purpose of assisting in preventing or in rescuing the seizure? In the first place, with regard to these things being uncustomed goods, I believe you can have little or no doubt; the circumstances of their landing in the manner they did, the casks are found to contain goods liable to the payment of the customs and excise, their being in those small casks with slings tied round each cask; the pursuit of a boat with such a sort of cargo on board, the landing of that cargo, and the men running away from it, must leave very little doubt in your minds but these goods were certainly smuggled goods, and were brought there for the purpose of being landed. - Then, gentlemen, the question will be, whether you are of opinion that the prisoner was a person present; the next question will be, whether the persons assembled, the persons who committed these outrages, and who have in fact carried away the smuggled goods, did assemble for the purpose of rescuing the goods. Then what is the evidence? The goods are landed, they are in possession of the revenue officers, who are making preparations for carrying them off, but are prevented from doing it immediately; they had them in their possession two hours; the men who land them leave them, and in two hours time there appear men to the number of thirty or more, with certain instruments, sticks or clubs; these men advance precipitately; upon their coming up, they are called upon to desist, or they would be fired at; and then they use terms of high provocation and defiance, bidding them fire and be damned, with very opprobrious names; the party are too numerous, they overpower them, and several of them are ill treated, as you hear by the witnesses. In consequence of this, the revenue officers being overpowered, the goods are carried away in a waggon and cart, which waggon and cart are brought down; this is a very material circumstance; there arrives very soon after these men a waggon and cart, and into this waggon and cart are these goods put, and carried away under the guard of the whole company; then the question will be, whether they originally assembled for the very purpose of that which they effected? Now, Gentlemen, their number and the circumstances under which they come, their bidding defiance, and their actually taking away the goods, are circumstances for you to put together, in order to decide, whether they did or not assemble for the purpose of doing this act. The next question for your consideration then will be, whether the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270113"></xptr>bar is one of those men; if you are of opinion that they were not so assembled, I mean the body which he joined, then of course there will be an end of his guilt; then the question will be, whether the prisoner was one of those persons? now you see upon what evidence that rests; there are, to be sure, two witnesses who speak to it, but the prisoner was a stranger to both those witnesses till this happened; they had but a short time to observe his face; neither of them were acquainted with the prisoner, nor did they see him again (this was upon the 6th of November) till about the 14th of this last month; when they did see him again the second time he was in custody; they were called to look at him; they both agreed that he was the man; there certainly was a very material difference in his appearance, owing to some accident which appears about his head, the marks of which he now bears; but however, they do undertake to swear, that notwithstanding that difference, he was one of those men. Then, Gentlemen, the next consideration for you will be, provided you are satisfied the witnesses are not mistaken, whether the prisoner was armed with an offensive weapon; for it is essential that he should be himself individually armed with an offensive weapon; for though all the rest were armed, if he was not he would not be within the meaning of the act. Now, Gentlemen, you have heard a great deal from the Counsel on both sides; to be sure I do not go the length of one of the Counsel, in saying that any instrument whatever it be, is an offensive weapon if it is used as such; a common cane that a man usually carries would not, in my opinion amount to the offensive weapon mentioned in the act; but my notion of the act is this, that if it is an usual instrument, if it is a common stick that he carries in his hand, or a stick that he may carry without exciting any surprize from the size of it, it would not come within the description; but any instrument that imports terror in its appearance, and that may serve to intimidate persons, that instrument, in my opinion, will be an offensive weapon within the meaning of the act, if that instrument is shewn in such a way as to intimidate. Gentlemen, it was a stick, one witness says, about three feet, and another about three feet and a half long; but he describes it to be about the size of a large broomstick, with a large head to it; there was no name to it, and perhaps it was not fit should have a name, but it was said with such the prisoner was armed at that time; the prisoner when he appeared carried it over his head, which was in an offensive manner no doubt. I shall leave it entirely to you, whether the instrument, as you have heard it described by the witnesses, was an offensive instrument, and liable to produce that terror to the witnesses from which danger was likely ensue; if you are of that opinion, it will be an offensive weapon, within the meaning of the act; but it depends upon whether you are satisfied that the persons were assembled for the purpose of carrying away the goods; that they were so armed; and that you are satisfied in your conscience that the prisoner is one of the men; it depends upon these circumstances whether you convict the prisoner: It will be your duty to acquit him, if you are not satisfied that the company in which he is supposed to have been, did assemble for that purpose; or if you think that he himself, with them, was not so assembled; or that they were not armed, that is particularly, that the prisoner was not armed with such a weapon as may be deemed an offensive weapon; for all these circumstances must concur before you can convict the prisoner; you will exercise your own judgement, and either convict or acquit the prisoner, as the circumstances shall appear to you.</p>

Both the Prisoners came into Mrs Roberson's House; Saverey. the Prisoner, in a Soldier's Coat, he came from the Box where he sat, to the Chimney-side , where the Pestle and Mortar stood; he came under a Pretence to toast a Piece of Cheese, which he put upon a Pen-knife in order to toast it. I did not like the Looks of the Men, therefore I had the Curiosity to see if they had any thing: the Things wrapped up were opposite to Brown , I declared I would see what was in it; upon that, Saverey got up and gave me a Blow; however, I held them both as long as I could; being sturdy Men, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160016"></xptr> could not manage them both; upon that the Girl came up,

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 158). I am stationed at Brentford. I saw the prisoner there on Monday last, near the waterworks, about half a mile from Mr. Woodley's—he had a sack on his shoulders, which I took very particular notice of—in the course of the same evening I, with Mr. Woodley, saw the prisoner again—Mr. Woodley asked him what the sack contained that he took to the brewery—he said sawdust—he asked him where he got it from—he said, "From Scott's"—I took him in custody—I went with Mr. Woodley to the brewery, and Mr. Allen showed us this sack, which I said I could swear to—it was the one the prisoner had in the morning—it contained two bushels and a half of malt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, at Old Brentford. I know the prisoner by sight; he came to my house last Monday—I did not see him bring any<lb></lb>thing with him, but he asked me if I would let him grind some malt; I said, "Yes"—I was just going out—I did not get any malt—I think he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a maltster, at Strand-on-the-Green, at Chiswick. The prisoner was in my service from Oct up to last Monday; he was fore-man at one of my malt houses, and had the charge of everything there—in consequence of what I heard from the last witness, I went on Monday even<lb></lb>ing to look for the prisoner, and met him; I said to him, "You were seen to-day with a sack; what was in that sack?"—he said, "Sawdust"—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, "Scott's"—I detained him, and vent with the officer to Mr. Allen's brewery—I was there shown this sack—it was taken to the station and opened; it contained malt—I examined it, and I believe it is mine—I had a considerable bulk of it, about eighty quarters—I have examined it since, and there was some missing—it was Irish malt—I have had similar sacks to this in my possession—the malt comes in sacks, and they remain there—I believe this sack to have been on my premises.</p>

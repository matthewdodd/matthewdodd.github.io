I am sure it is the same. I had had it seven or eight years. It was brought home by the waggon.</p>

I can swear they were on the common between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 5th of March, I saw them there when I went to catch my own; I did not see them again until they came back from town, Mr. Elliot had them - They were the same - He brought them back about the 12th or 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They could stray if they liked; they could not come to town. The turnpike is about two miles from the common. There are turnings out of the road.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in Smithfield, it was horse-cattle day there-each of them had a black pony - They were both in halters, and several people were looking at them; the ponies were very dirty with country dirt, which made me suspect them - They appeared jaded, as if they had ran a great way. Horn asked 9l. for his, and Green 6l. for his. Horn was going to sell his, when I touched him on the shoulder, told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him where he brought them from? he said he brought them from Hounslow-heath, and that he bred them there, and that he lived there. I asked him if he was a horse-keeper there? he said he was. He was asked, in my presence, if he lived near the Magpie, he said he did not know, for he did not use the house. I took both the prisoners, with the ponies, to the Bear and Ragged Staff. I told them I was not satisfied with what they had said, and wished to know the truth, or I should take them into custody; Horn said he would cut his throat sooner than tell me. Green said nothing about the pony that he had. They were shown to Elliot and Marlow, and they claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I noticed their being covered with country dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have collected that dirt within two miles of town - A. No; they were very dirty. I think if I had rode them forty miles I should not have made them so dirty; they appeared to have been rode very hard, and the prisoners appeared as tired as the horses.</p>

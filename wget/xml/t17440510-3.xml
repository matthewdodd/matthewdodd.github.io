On the 27th in the morning he came and told me that it was broke open, that somebody had drawn the staple of the skuttle, and taken away the things mentioned in the indictment. Two or three days afterwards Mrs. Gregory came and said, she believed if such a house was searched we might find some of the things. Some people went to search the Prisoner's house, and he said they were very welcome; but while they were searching it he ran away, and they found a tolling and some other things in the closet, and the fails were found at the top of the house. We went before a Justice, and the Prisoner Andrew said he would own every thing, and how they came there. Then said I, how did they come there? He answered, the man of the house where you found these things (Greswold) enticed us from our masters, and said we should not want for money, victuals, or clothes: one of the boys said, that Groswold sent them out o'night with tools to break open vessels, and that he received what they brought.</p>

               <p>Hall. I call them both cables, but some people call them tollings; - we found all of them at Greswold's house, I found the two cables in the closet, and Greswold's wife said she would show me two sails that her husband had bought, and I said they were mine.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you go to the ship?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. Greswold lent us his little boat till we could get another to suit our conveniency: we used to take any large boat that we could find, and so go on board the ships; he had bought a larger boat and brought it home from the carpenter's the Saturday that we were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got these things where did you carry them?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. To Mr. Greswold's house, and delivered the sails, ropes and stanchions, &amp;c. to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night did you go to do this?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. The watchman went past one as we were taking them out of the yatch, which lay between Cole Harbour and Stone-Stairs. - Greswold lives at Cole-Harbour by Blackwall, and keeps the sign of the Ramsgate Pink.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he knew these things were stole?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. He lent us a boat to go on board with, and enticed me away from my master (one Griffiths a waterman and lighterman). He told me I might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100004"></xptr> living open yatchs, and get these things and bring them to him; I have known him about two years.</p>

               <p>Greswold. Did not the officer promise you, that if you would accuse me you should be cleared?</p>

Accordingly we did, and when Mr. Hall took hold of a rope and said, that is a piece of my cable, he walked away. I said, Mr. Greswold, don't go; he said he was going to look for the boy, and would be back again in a minute. I sent two men after him, and then he run into the marsh - the Isle of Dogs, which is right against his house. I went the next day to his house again to search for him, and found him covered over in a copper he used to brew in (he used to brew his own beer) in his shirt, without his coat and waistcoat; there was water in it, for when he came out of the copper I was forced to stay till he changed his shoes and stockings, they were so wet.</p>

His wife said, some old ropes that we have bought, and I found them to be ours. I found some of our old fails in the garret, but his wife was not very ready to show them. The next day I went with a warrant to search for the rest of the things, for Pinfold told us where to find them. There was a woman talked pretty much, and I asked her what she had to do there? she said, she was to take care of the house. I said, I would take hold of her. She answered, I had no occasion to do that, for Mr. Greswold was above, and as I was going up I think I saw his legs, and one of our people found him in the copper in his brewhouse; he was stooping down, half bent, and said, if we used him well he would come out.</p>

            . I live in Shadwell, the Prisoner has a very honest character, (for what I know) he keeps a publick house.</p>
               <p>Greswold. I was a <rs id="t17440510-3-deflabel15" type="occupation">distiller</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17440510-3-defend52 t17440510-3-deflabel15"></join> by trade, but have had misfortunes by informations; I can prove that I bought them publickly of Pinfold and Andrew.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did the Prisoner give for all these things, ropes, iron, and every thing?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. He gave us ten shillings for them; there was about half an hundred of iron; - it was about three o'clock in the morning when he paid us for them.</p>
               <p>Greswold. I did not think this boy would swear so roundly against me, or I would have been better prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hall. What are these things worth? are they worth 10 s. are they worth 40 s.</p>
               <p>Hall. I don't know the value of them, they are worth 20 s.</p>
               <p>Q. to Phillips. What are all these things worth at a low price.</p>
               <p>Phillips. They are worth in all between thirty and forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Greswold. Pinfold swears a false thing, to say I gave but 10 s. for them, I gave 15 s. for them. Did you find them in my house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100005"></xptr>Phillips. I never was in your house.</p>
               <p>Hall. The iron was found at a Smith's, where Greswold carried it to be sold.</p>
               <p>Pope. I have known Greswold about half a year. People used to talk, that he got coals and corn in a clandestine manner: he was s uspected by all the neighbourhood before this, and every body was for suppressing his house. His father kept the house before, and it had a bad character then.</p>

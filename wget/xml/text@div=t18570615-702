                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Bachrach, a merchant, of No. 38, Clement's Lane. Bahmer was employed as his clerk for about four or five months—on Saturday evening, 2nd May, about 6 o'clock in the evening, he came and asked me for the key of the office—I took it, and went down with him—I went into the office with him, and he pointed out to me a certain quantity of goods in the office, which he said would be sent for, and he desired me to give them up to the person coming for them—he went away, and at 7 o'clock the boy Mohr came with a truck—he gave me this letter—it was in an envelope—I did not open it—just as I had token it from the boy</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Gower Walk, Whitechapel. Hahn came to my father's house on Saturday evening, 2nd May, about 6 o'clock—I was just having my tea—he said to me, "You come with me; I want to remove out of Lambert Street"—I said, "Yes, sir"—he took me down to Back Church Lane, and I got a truck, and he took me up into the City—he took me to the corner of a street, and gave me a letter, and sent me to the house—I gave the letter to the housekeeper, Reeves—before Hahn gave me the letter I saw the prisoner De Gruyter—we met him just at the beginning of the City—he and Hahn went into a coffee shop—I stopped outside, round the corner, with the truck—they stopped in about ten minutes—they came out, and they said, "Come on"—I said, "How much further?"—they said, "A little further"—when we got to the corner of Clement's Lane, Hahn gave me a letter, and told me to go to the house, and give it to the lady or gentleman—De Gruyter was not with him then; he had just left—I went to the house, and saw Mr. Reeves, and gave him the letter—while I was giving the letter Bahmer came in—he opened the letter, and read it, and said, "Come in, my lad"—he showed me the things—I said I could not take them at once—he said, "Can you at twice?"—I took eighteen pieces of cloth—Mr. Reeves helped them into the truck, and he pushed the truck off—I went to Aldgate, and met Hahn and De Gruytei just by Aldgate Church—Hahn said to me, "Go on ahead, and I will meet you just by Whitechapel Church"—I went on, and they followed me behind—when we got to Whitechapel Church, they took me up Union Street, and</p>

               <p>you think so, do as you think proper," and I was taken; Mrs. Mohr said, "It was the fault of this fellow that my husband was taken, take him in charge;" I had given the letter to her husband that morning to fetch the things, that was all I know; the policeman said, "You must go away;" Mrs. Mohr was following me up, and in order to avoid a noise I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove away; in the afternoon I went to Colchester, De Gruyter was also there, mending watches; I had been in company with him from the morning till 9 o'clock at night, on the Sunday previous to our being taken into custody; we returned to London the same evening; Bahmer called on his landlord, and when he came back, he said, "If I were to inform against you, I would be free;" the thing was only to know where De Gruyter and I were; on the Tuesday evening Bahmer went to his master, and in order to excuse himself, he said that I and De Gruyter were the guilty parties; Bahmer did not require any temptation to do this bad thing, because he had been obliged to run away from his home on account of having stolen a letter with ten Prussian dollars, and in London he had made many attempts to swindle; I was never intimate with Bahmer; I did not seek for his friend<lb></lb>ship, but he sought for mine; in the time, eight weeks since, that I made his acquaintance, he called on me more than ten times; he repeatedly asked me to come and see him; I have been there only once, and was there only five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Worf's Defence.</hi> I cannot say that I was out on Saturday evening; on the Saturday evening these three men came to my house, and said they were going to Liverpool in the morning; I asked Hahn what he had done, he said, "Nothing at all;" Bahmer made me a present of the three dupli<lb></lb>cates; I went to Mr. Bachrach, and asked him if he had offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one that gave him information; he said, "No;" I said, "Put down on a piece of paper that you are willing to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and so he did; I said, "I expect a letter from those men, and as soon as I have a letter I will tell you who they are;" he said, "I don't want them, I want my goods back;" he said he did not believe my word what I said; I had the three tickets, but how could I know that Mr. Bachrach would get his goods back; I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Bachrach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bahmer's Defence.</hi> I never knew Hahn before; I made his acquaintance through another man; I knew De Gruyter; he came from Germany, and brought a letter for me from my uncle; through that I got acquainted with him; Hahn knows perfectly well that I am not brother to Mr. Bachrach, because Cook told him my name was Bahmer; Hahn came to me, and asked me to get him a situation, and I gave him an address to Stockmer and Co.; he afterwards told me he was conversant with the French language, and as my master had a letter to be written in French, I called on him, and got him to write it, and from that time, after writing that letter, he told me that my master was a swindler, and it was no sin to swindle a swindler, who was swindling other persons, and he said if he had any things, he would pay me; I also got daily visits from De Gruyter; my master had American leather, cloth, and calf skins, and Hahn came to my office, and said he was going to take his things away, and he would write a letter for me, that I might say I had received an order for the goods, and I should be free, and we would go together to America; at last he prevailed upon me with this letter; the boy came with the truck, and gave me the letter; I opened it, and gave the boy the pieces to take away; after that I got in such anxiety I did not know what to do; I ran away from the office, and went to my friend Hahn, and he said to me, "You need not be</p>

               <p>afraid," that I had got the order, and it would be nothing, "You have only to say that the order came from your master;" Hahn said that eighteen pieces were too few, they were a trifle, that I should go and fetch the calf skins, else we should not get away; and I went and fetched the three dozen calf skins, and he pointed out which pawnbroker's I should pawn them at; I pawned them, and got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them; I never received a farthing from Hahn, nor a ticket; Hahn received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the articles he pawned himself; he never gave me any money; the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I received for the things I pawned was taken from me by De Gruyter, he saying that he was much older than I was; Hahn told me that I was to go in company with De Gruyter, and he would follow us in the evening, because he was afraid the thing might be known, and we went to Colchester, Hahn having bought razors for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he sold again; I never had the money.</p>

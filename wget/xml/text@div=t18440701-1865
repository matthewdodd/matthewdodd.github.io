                  </hi>. I live in Plummer-street, City-road. At a quarter past twelve o'clock, on Saturday night last, I was coming from Camden-town to King's-cross—the two prisoners came, and wanted to know where I was going—I said, "What have you to do with me, what is that to you?"—they pursued me, and there was no person to be seen about—it was about 200 yards from the turnpike; and as they went along, Peak put his hand into my smallclothes pocket, where I had a spectacle-case, a knife, a half-sovereign, and some more money—he did it a second time; and I said, "If you do that again, I will knock you down with the butt end of my stick"—I went on, and he did it again—I went on for the turnpike as fast as I could—when I got there, there was a blow against my hat, and I turned round into the turn<lb></lb>pike house—three or four persons were there—they came out, and the pri<lb></lb>soners, finding they could get nothing else, they got off my hat, and ran together away with it, and the handkerchief in it—I was sober—they were taken, and put into the station at Somers-town—I know my hat.</p>

I was in the toll-house when the prosecutor came into the bouse with his hat on—he asked for protection—the toll collector told him he could not be in there, he could stand outside—he took hold of the wicket to hold fast, that the pri<lb></lb>soners should not pull him away—he had had a little to drink, but was quite</p>

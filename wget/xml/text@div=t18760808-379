                  </hi>. I live at Epworth Road, Rotherhithe—I am a platelayer in the employ of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company—on Monday, 31st July, at about 5.30 I was on the railway at London Bridge, filling hoies between the rails—the prisoner was a fellow-workman—I had occasion to go away from my work to the other road, when I came back something was stated to me, in consequence of that I said to the prisoner "If you get telling stories about me, you and I shall fall out"—I said "I don't like him to tell stories about me without occasion, as I have done nothing to him"—I put my open hand on his chest—he then struck me five times, four times across the arm, and once on the thumb, with a shovel; the blows were aimed at my head—I held my arm up to protect my my head—I then ran away, and he ran after me, but was stopped—I went home and my landlady bandaged my arm, and then went to the hospital, and it was found my arm was broken—the prisoner was sober—I have had no rest since it has been done; it is very painful.</p>

I am a porter in the employ of the same company—I was close to the men at the time of this occurrence—I did not hear what they said at first—the prosecutor ran by me—I was in a first-class carriage—the prisoner ran after him; I was on the step—he had in his hand this shovel</p>

I am junior house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on the morning of the 1st of this month the prosecutor came to the hospital—I attended him; he had one or two superficial cuts and a good deal of swelling on the arm; after the swelling had subsided I found that the bone on the inner-side of the arm was broken—it will be some seven or eight weeks before he regains the use of it.</p>

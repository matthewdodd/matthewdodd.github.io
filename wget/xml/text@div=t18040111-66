I ran out immediately, and three or four men ran from the window in different directions; I followed two of them up Leather-lane, four or five doors; I was nearly in the act of laying hold of them, when they took their hands out of their waistcoat-pockets, which alarmed me, and I drew back; I still kept crying stop thief, and returned to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was any person brought to your shop? - A. In the course of two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any spectacles? - A. Yes, four pair; a part of the things were taken out of the area afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him when he was brought in? - A. The person that brought him in desired him to pull his hands out of his breeches-pocket, his right-hand was in his pocket; he took his hand out.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance did it exhibit? - A. It was bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see whether it was cut or not? - A. I did not examine it myself, I did not look so close as to see the cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see his glove? - A. Yes, the glove of the right-hand was bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether it was or was not cut? - A. It was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of it was cut? - A. About the first finger.</p>

               <p>Q. On Monday evening last, tell us what you observed? - A. On Monday evening last, I was going home up Back-hill from my labour, about a quarter past six o'clock, I heard a great crash of glass windows break.</p>

               <p>Q. How far were you from his shop at that time? - A. I suppose it might be a dozen or fifteen yards.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar, and two or three more, run away from the window; the prisoner was eight or ten yards from the shop; he went some little way across Leather-lane, and then made a cross double towards Back-hill, where I was crossing, about the middle of the street, he called out stop thief, stop thief, running as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue him? - A. He was close to where I was; he was coming right to me, and I laid fast hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time of his quitting the window till you seized him? - A. No, it was not much further than from my Lord to the window that I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him to Mr. Page's shop? - A. Me, with another gentleman; he at first said, when I laid hold of him, don't stop me, I know nothing of the affair, I am a respectable tradesman in the Old Jewry; then came up another gentleman, whom I have not seen since, a Mr. Rusby, a corn-chandler, who took him into Mr. Page's shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110054"></xptr>Q. Did you observe any thing with respect to either of his hands? - A. Both his hands were in his breeches-pocket when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take either of them out? - A. He seemed very much confused and frightened; he begged not to be exposed, but to be taken into a back room, that he might not be seen by so many people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken into a back room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When his hands were taken out of his pockets, did you observe any thing? - A. When he was desired to pull them out, he was very loth to pull his right-hand out of his breeches-pocket; in pulling it out, it was very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether it was cut? - A. I did not see whether it was cut then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards? - A. I cannot say exactly; it was somewhere about the finger and thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the right-hand glove? - A. Yes, I asked him the reason of his hand being bloody; he said, it was owing to his putting his hand in his pocket against a piece of silver solder, which they used in their line of business; he said, he was a working jeweller; he then pulled out eighteen pence, a pen-knife, a comb, and two or three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not pull out any solder? - A. Yes, he pulled out a piece of solder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in his waistcoat or breeches pocket? - A. In his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask to see his glove? - A. Out of his left-hand pocket he pulled a small neat hook, such as are used for buck-skin breeches, but it has been lost since; he took his right-hand glove out of his right-hand coat-pocket; his right-hand glove appeared very bloody; I asked him the reason of its being bloody; he said, by putting his hand in his pocket upon it, his hand being bloody; I then turned the glove inside out, and the inside was bloody as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the glove besides? - A. No further than there was a cut in the glove corresponding with the place in his hand; two officers were sent for to take him to Hatton-garden, and I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you came up, there was a considerable noise in the street? - A. The breaking of glass, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occasion a great alarm, and a cry of stop thief? - A. It created an alarm about Mr. Page's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Page's is quite the corner, is it not? - A. The corner of Eyre-street-hill and Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner desired not to be exposed, for he was a respectable tradesman? - A. Yes; he said, pray don't stop me, I am a respectable tradesman in the Old Jewry; he said, he would give me his address; I told him I should certainly stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you his direction? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not since heard that he does live in the Old Jewry, and is a jeweller? - A. I have heard so from other people; in Mr. Page's shop, he said he lived four doors from the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, there was a piece of solder found in his breeches-pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sharp? - A. Not very sharp; not sharp enough to cut any body's hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he pull his hand out himself, or did Rice Jones take it out? - A. Himself; he was very loth to pull it out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. An officer belonging to Hatton-garden; I was sent for to Mr. Page's to take charge of the prisoner; I searched him, and took out of his coat-pocket a glove, (producing it;) it has been in my possession ever since; I found this piece of solder lying upon the counter. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rayment.) Was the piece of solder that laid upon the counter the same that was taken out of the prisoner's pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I am just informed, and I wish it to be understood, that the prisoner did give a true account of his residence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I live in Dove-court, in the Old Jewry; I left home between three and four o'clock in the afternoon to meet my father, who was gone to Hampstead; when I got to North End, I found he was gone; I came to town again down Gray's-Inn-lane and down Liquorpond-street; I crossed over at the end of Liquorpond-street, when I saw three fellows running away; there was a cry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110055"></xptr>of stop thief, and that man immediately laid hold of me, and took me to Mr. Page's; it was a wet afternoon, and one of my gloves were wet; I have a habit of walking with one hand in my breeches-pocket; I put my hand into my pocket with my glove on, and my glove being wet, and the breeches having leather linings, it stuck; and, when I got my hand out, it was bleeding.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

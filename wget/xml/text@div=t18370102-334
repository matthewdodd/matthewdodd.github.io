                  </hi>. I live at Great Stanmore. On Wednesday the 6th of December, I had four store-pigs, which were loose on the road in the day, and came home at night usually—if they did not I fetched them—I saw them safe at three o'clock—I did not go to fetch them in that night, as I had occasion to go to London—I saw them at Mr. Hussey's, the Welsh Harp, on the Friday—I am quite sure they were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 7th of December I met the prisoner, about half-past eleven o'clock, near the five-mile stone, on the Edgware-road—that is the road from Stanmore—he had four pigs—I asked if they were his own, he said they were—I asked him where he brought them from—he said from his brother, whose name was Cole, and lived at the Hyde—I was not satisfied, and turned my horse's head, to apprehend him but he made his escape, and left the pigs—it was near the Welesh Harp, and the pigs turned into that yard—I pursued and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol. I was at the Hyde that night, and saw the prisoner driving the pigs—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I went to the Welsh Harp, Butler was sitting on his horse, and the ostler had something like a pot, handing it up—the patrol asked me whether I saw a man with four pigs—I said, "No"—he said "Good night"—I then made my way on to the path, knowing it was better than the road—I had got three quarters of a mile, and he overtook me, and said he could see no other person that was with the pigs, and if I did not go back be would blow my brains out—I said to the ostler, "Did you not to hear him ask me about the pigs, and bid me good night?"—he said "Yes."</p>

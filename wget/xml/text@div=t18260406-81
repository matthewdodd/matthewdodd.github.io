On the 9th of March, at 8 o'clock in the evening, I was going up stairs to the garret with a hay of clothes; the doors and windows were closed; I heard a noise of persons going from one room to the other; I went down stairs, and by the drawing-room door I let the tray fall; my fellow-servant, being in the back parlour, came out - I said somebody was in the garret - I went to the street-door - she followed, and called Watch! - I then stood with my back to the door of the next house, which was uninhabited - and hearing that door open, I turned round and a man came out - Norman came up - I pointed the man out to him - he ran after him - he got out of my sight before he was taken - I did not see his features - Norman and a watchman brought a man back - I went up stairs with two or three other persons and found the wearing apparel and table linen, stated in the indictment, packed up in the back garret in a bag, which did not belong to the house. The property had been taken from the wardrobe in the front attic - the attics join each other - I found the back attic window wide open - I had not seen it after twelve o'clock - it was then open - the bag contained a silk pelisse, worth 5l.; two ladies' dresses, worth 10l.; two cloaks, worth 10l.; an apron, worth 1s.; three bolster-cases, worth 10s.; nine table cloths, worth 5l. Mistress kept her ornaments in a dressing-case on the second floor, which is under the attics - I cannot say whether the room door was shut - I am the only servant who attends in that room - I closed the door in the afternoon - I do not know whether her ornaments were there, they have not been found - I had seen part of them in the room the day before, when I assisted in dressing my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. - Q. At what time did you close your Mistress' door? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you judge by the footsteps how many persons had been there? A. I should think two or three- I could not compare them with the prisoner's feet, because the marks were wet, and one on another. I do not think it was a wet night - I did not examine his shoes.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE GROVES. I examined the property in the bag, and have no doubt of their being my mistress's property.</p>
               <p>THE HONOURABLE HENRY WILLIAM STANHOPE. I had seen Mrs. Stanhope's ornaments two days before, and I think on the day before the robbery - they were kept on the toilet table in her bed-room, in India boxes; they have not been found. There are missing two necklaces, worth 20l.; two pairs of ear-rings, worth 15l.; a garnet cross, and two breast pins, and other property - they are charged at an under value in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. The box is what I use of a morning when I get up; the first witness said at the office she was not sure whether I was the man who came out of the house or not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MISS WILKINSON. Q. Can you swear it was the prisoner who threw something away? A. No, but I saw the watchman take the same man as I saw throw it over. I did not lose sight of him till I saw him taken.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

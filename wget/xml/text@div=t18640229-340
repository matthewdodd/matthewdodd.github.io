               <p>last, I was with my son in Newgate-street—the shops were open and the street lamps alight—I heard money fall; two or three persons stopped to pick it up, and I paused so as not to interrupt their search—the prisoner was five or six yards in front of me, looking on when I found the search was not over, I started forward and went up against the prisoner, who, to my surprise, resisted my passing—I pressed against him, and as we brushed past each other, I saw my gold watch passing under his cape—I thought it was an accident, that the chain had caught in the button of his waistcoat, and passed my hand along the chain very quickly, to release it—while doing so, I felt a snap, and the prisoner started off; I started in pursuit—my watch was gone, and the chain was left in my hand—I did not speak to him—I heard nothing fall before he started—he was afterwards secured—I did not lose sight of him except the moment he turned the corner into Pannier<lb></lb>alley—he was stopped by the people coming the other way, and I put my hand on him at once.</p>

I take your watch! the man who has taken it has gone on before, and I am running after him"—there was no one running before him so far as I could see—I did not hear anybody call out, "Stop thief!"—Newgate-street was rather clear; there were a few people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son of the last witness, and am also a clerk in the Bank of England—I was with him in Newgate-street, and saw some men on the path looking for something—I heard the expression, "Oh, you have knocked a half-crown out of my hand"—the prisoner passed between us and the men who were looking for the money, and before he crossed I noticed that my father's watch chain was hooked into the prisoner's coat button, my father disengaging it, and the prisoner's hand disengaging it also, as I thought, and next I saw the chain hanging down without the watch—the prisoner ran away as fast as he could—I ran after him, and kept him in view, except for half a second, in turning the corner of Pannier-alley, and he was stopped in about ten seconds, and before he got out of the alley—he was then still running—he had on a cape—I am certain he is the person who ran against my father in Newgate-street.</p>

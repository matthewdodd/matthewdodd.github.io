                  </hi> I manage the business of Mr. Isaac Moses—James Bar<lb></lb>rymore was in his employ, as night watchman—he has been in the police, and Mr. Moses has employed him since March, 1846—we have missed a number of articles; several young men have been turned away in consequence of it—we had the prisoner James detained, and I felt it necessary to go to his house—Mary Ann Barrymore, who is his sister, came in the evening, about seven or eight hours after—I did hear any one tell her it would be much better for her to tell the truth—she said I might search the house, she had destroyed all</p>

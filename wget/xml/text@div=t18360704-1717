                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Little Dean-street, Soho. On Sunday night the 26th of June, between six and nine or ten o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Little Pulteney-street—I had three half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence, in my hand—a person came behind me, knocked my hand up, and knocked the money out—I was rather con<lb></lb>fused—he picked up the half-crown—I asked him for it, and he ran away with it—I did not run after him—I lost sight of him—I do not know who it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Beachley, of Little Windmill-street. On Sunday evening I was at the public-house, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor there together—Wallis came out, then the prisoner—they appeared to come out together—they were talking together, and there was ale before them—I did not see them drinking—they were talking about drinking ale and rum—I came out, and then I heard the prosecutor accuse the prisoner of robbing him of a half-crown—I thought it might be a spree between them—I saw what appeared to be a half-crown in the prisoner's hand, but I never saw it on the ground, not in the prosecutor's hand—the prisoner passed it behind his back, from one hand to the other—I thought it was a half-crown, but I could not see it distinctly—the prosecutor did not pursue him.</p>

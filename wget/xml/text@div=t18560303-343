                  </hi>. I lodged in the same house as the prisoner, in Portland-street, Soho. The prisoner and his wife lived on the ground floor of that house—they kept a shop for the sale of cigars and tobacco—they occupied the shop and back parlour—the shop opens into the back parlour—there were other lodgers in the house—Mrs. Bousfield attended to the shop—her Christian name was Sarah—there were three children—the prisoner was at home during the day—on Saturday night, 2nd Feb., at half past 12 o'clock, I went down and rapped at their parlour door—I wanted three bundles of wood—they sold wood—I asked for the wood—Mrs. Bous<lb></lb>field answered me—she said they were in bed, and could not oblige me with the wood—the prisoner was at that time in the room, and in bed—I heard his voice—Mrs. Bousfield spoke in a very cheerful voice—I had seen them together several times on that day—they appeared to be on very good terms—I never saw Mrs. Bousfield alive after that Saturday—I had lived in the house with them about two years—they often had words, I mean now and I then, occasionally, because he did not provide for his children—Mrs. Bous<lb></lb>field said that to him several times—I never heard him make any complaint to her, or of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 36, Berwick-street, St. James's. I went to the prisoner's house at the desire of the inspector—I noticed the dead body of a woman in a French bed there—I found a transverse incision on the right side of the neck, four inches in length, separating the jugular vein, and almost the common carotid artery—death would follow almost immediately from such a wound—I should say she had been dead two or three hours at least—I was there within three minutes after I received the message, and it was a quarter past 7 o'clock exactly when I got there—the wound was most probably inflicted with this razor.</p>

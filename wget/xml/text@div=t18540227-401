                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and am apprentice to Messrs. Fenwick and Kean, linendrapers, of Whitechapel-road. It is my duty to sleep in the shop at night; a person named Clemow sleeps there likewise—about 2 o'clock in the morning in question I was awoke by a noise, looked up and saw a man scratching the glass of the glazed fanlight over the shop—it was a moonlight night, and I could see him stooping down cutting the glass, and about two minutes after I awoke the glass dropped on the counter—I did not look at him all the time, as I was afraid he would see me, because he had a very good sight of my bed—I saw his head touching the framework after the glass was cut, and then turned away—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—his coat was then buttoned up to his throat—the roof is not very high—the prisoner was afterwards brought by a policeman—my bed is under the counter, it pulls open—I turned my head round under the counter, which protected me from his sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Messrs. Fenwick and Kean, and sleep in the shop. I was awoke by a noise at the skylight, and saw a man cutting the glass; it was a moonlight night—I had not a distinct view of the person, as I had to look backwards—I heard the glass fall on the counter—the man had on a coat buttoned up to the throat, and dark whis<lb></lb>kers—just after the glass fell he put his head through, to his shoulders; turned his head, and looked round the shop—I am quite sure his head was within the glass—I heard some person outside say, "Are they asleep?—I thought I had had enough of their company, and called out, "Halloo! what are you about?"—the person immediately withdrew his head and made off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 317). I was on duty in the Whitechapel-road, about 2 o'clock on the morning in question, and saw two men stand<lb></lb>ing near Hope-place; I went towards them, and when I got nearer the prisoner jumped between them from the roof of a potato warehouse which adjoins Fenwick and Kean's premises—a person could get from there to the roof, it is almost on a level—one of the men tried to prevent my fol<lb></lb>lowing the prisoner, and hit me on the breast—I knocked him on one side, and followed the prisoner till he was stopped by another policeman, 200 or 300 yards off—I am certain he is the man who dropped from the roof—I never lost sight of him, except when he turned the corner for a moment—an alarm was raised immediately afterwards—I took the prisoner back into Messrs. Fenwick and Kean's back kitchen; he said we need not search him, he threw open his coat, and pulled out this bag, and these four skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they are of a make which is very seldom seen—another constable picked up these other keys, and this rope of handkerchief, in the direction in which the prisoner ran (<hi rend="italic">three or four handkerchiefs tied together</hi>)—I examined the fanlight; there was an aperture large enough to admit two men; three feet by twelve feet had been cut away, by cutting the putty with a chisel—the whole pane was cut out except one corner—when the prisoner threw down the bag, he said, "That bag has had more property in it than you or your masters are worth."</p>

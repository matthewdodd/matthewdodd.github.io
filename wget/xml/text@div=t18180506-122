            . I am Mr. Elliot's hay-binder. On the 28th of April, in the morning, I loaded the waggon with thirty-six trusses of hay only. I left the prisoner in the yard; when I returned I missed a truss of hay out of the barn, which was there after I loaded the thirty-six trusses. The prisoner was detected in selling it.</p>

            . I was standing near my house, saw the prisoner get on the load of hay, and take one truss off. I followed him to a house, where he went in, and saw him receive 1s. 9d. for it. The moment he received the money I caught him, and asked him what money he had in his hand? he said, "1s. 9d., which I have received for this truss of hay." He said his master ordered him to sell it, for it was a returned truss from the barracks. He said he was going with the load of hay to market. I told him it was strange his master should send a single truss of hay ten miles for him to sell, and detained him. I took the team to market, and delivered it to the salesman. I returned for the receiver, but he had absconded. When I went back the prisoner said he picked up the truss near the Edgware gate.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIOT. I had not ordered him to sell it. I had none returned from the barracks.</p>

            . Q. Have you valued the tea at the cost or selling price? A. At the selling price - I should think Mr. Kimber could not have bought it under 9l. - it is fine strong Congon tea, at 5s. 6d. a pound- it fetched 2s. 6d. or 2s. 7d., without duty, at the sale; it could not be got at the India-house for 5l. or 6l., I am positive - here is the invoice and permit in the bag.</p>

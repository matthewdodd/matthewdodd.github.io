                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife; he is a shoemaker by trade; he was at one time one of the masters at the House of Refuge for the Destitute at Hoxton; that establishment was broken up, and he lost his situation; I lived with him in the back-parlour of 4, New Church-street, Spitalfields. I remember the night of 23d April—I did not observe anything unpleasant about him before that—he had made threats to me about three nights before, he said he could soon strangle me by pinching my throat—we were on friendly terms that night, and went to bed together—we had no quarrel during the night—I got up next morning at seven, and when I had half my clothes on, and he too, he put his left arm round my neck, pulled me down on one knee, and held a shoemaker's knife in his right hand, and stabbed my throat—I</p>

               <p>did not see the knife in his hand at the time; it was covered with a cloth—I received a cut about eight inches long on my throat, and as I was saving my throat I got two of my fingers cut against the knife, it was done after the stab and before the cut—I hallooed "Murder!" and endeavoured to get to the door as fast as I could—I heard him say, "I have done for you now," that was after the stab and cut, and before I went out of the room—my niece bound up the wounds for me until the surgeon came—I had locked the door myself when we went to bed—I got it open by turning the key after I was cut.</p>

                  </hi> am a surgeon, of Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On 24th April, I was fetched to 4, New Church-street, and found Mrs. Webb sitting on a chair in the back-room ground-floor surrounded by several people, with a covering over her neck, saturated with blood—I found a wound on the right side of the throat, extending from the collar-bone obliquely downwards, about four inches long—if it had not been arrested by the collar-bone it would have been very deep; if it had been a little higher up it would have divided the carotid artery and been fatal—it was a dangerous wound from the subsequent bleeding, and might have been done with such a knife as this—I have no knowledge of the prisoner except what I saw at the police-court—my con<lb></lb>viction is that he is insane; I merely judge from his appearance and manner, which is that of an insane man, from his peculiar irritable way and his rest<lb></lb>lessness; he is incapable of standing still—I do not say such symptoms may not be assumed.</p>

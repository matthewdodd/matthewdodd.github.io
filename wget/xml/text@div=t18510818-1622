                  </hi>. I am a trunk-maker, at 358, Strand. On Sunday, 27th July, I was on my way home on the right-hand side of White lion-street—I went up Mercer-street, which is in a line with White Lion-street, and con<lb></lb>tinues to Long Acre—as I entered Mercer-street, I saw Best cross from the right side of Mercer-street to the left, upon that I crossed also—I followed; he was about fifteen or twenty yards in advance of me, he walked slowly, and I walked quickly, and came up with him—when I was about five yards from him I saw another man cross from the right-side to the left, towards where I was—when I came up to Best on the left-hand side, a pause took place for a second; he then let me pass about a foot, the other man was close to my back; we were in a manner all three together—when I got about a foot onwards, Best came and put one hand to the back of my neck, and the other in front; the other assisted him in strangling me, and I was made speechless directly—I cannot tell which gave me the most pressure—they kept me in that position for a second or two—Best leant over me, with his face within a foot of mine, and said "Press him tight," or, "Squeeze him tight"—I kept my hand on my watch, I was pressed tight, and became sense<lb></lb>less—when I came to myself I was sitting on the pavement, and my watch and chain were gone—I called "Police!" but very faintly; a policeman came, and I went to the station—I was very ill, and kept my bed for five days—I was so hurt I could only be fed by a spoon, and with milk—I have not been able to attend to my business since—I have come from Rarasgate to attend this trial, and am going to return there—I did not notice Kelly's face—I cannot say whether be is the man that joined the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 11, Great St. Andrew-street. On 27th July, I was in Long Acre about half-past 11, or 25 minutes to 12 o'clock, standing at the corner of Mercer-street—the prisoners came up from St. Martin's-lane, and turned down Mercer-street—when they got to the bottom of Mercer-street they stopped and looked round—I then saw Mr. Day twelve or thirteen yards from me, coming towards me and them into Mercer-street—he passed them, and then they turned round and looked at him; they followed him, and he looked round—one went up on his right side, and the other behind him—I saw them put their hands up, and take hold of him by the neck—they both had hats on—they were about 100 yards from me up the street—they were some distance from the public-house at the corner—as they put their hands on him, they all three went down together—the prisoners got up; they walked some distance, and then ran away down Castle-street towards St. Martin's-lane—I went and found Mr. Day lying on his back with his legs cocked up—his face looked quite black, and tears were running down his cheeks; he could not speak for about a minute—I helped him up, and called for a policeman—two constables and a sergeant came, and he com<lb></lb>plained of having been robbed of a watch and chain, and described two men dressed in black—I knew the prisoners before they were put in gaol—I have known them thirteen or fourteen months—I used to see them every night at the Dials, when I was in the police—I saw no other man in the street on this night—a man named Wallis was before the Magistrate, and was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general-dealer, and live 10, Charles-street, Drury-lane. I know Best—I do not know much of him—he did live at 11, Charles-street, next-door to me—I heard of this robbery on the Tuesday after the Sunday on which it occurred—I believe it was the 27th I saw Best on that Sunday, at 1 o'clock in the day, up in my place—he came up for his key, to go to his own room—he said the doctor was coming to lance his face, and he must go and get some hot water—my wife had looked after his wife while he was in prison, as she was ill, and she died on the Wednesday before, as he came out on the Saturday—when he got his key, he went to his own room—I went with him—he lit his fire, and made some water hot, and the doctor came, and lanced his face, and ordered him to put a linseed-meal poultice to it—he began to bathe his face—I remained with</p>

               <p>him till he tied his face up—he said he had to go out to dinner—I believe be did go—I saw him again at three—he came up for his key, to go to his room again, to put a fresh poultice to his face, and be laid down till six in the evening—I then went up to his room, and called him to come and have some tea at my place, as we thought he must be rather lonesome—he came, and had some tea, and remained till a quarter before 11—he and I then went out together—we went to Mr. Nolan's, in Little St. Andrew-street—Best said there was to be a meeting there; but when we got there, there was no such thing, and we returned home again—he came home with me—he said he did not like to be out in the night-air with his face, for fear of catching cold—he came into my house, and remained there till half-past 12 (we got break about five minutes past 11); he then went to bed, and I took the caudle, and left him—I am quite sure this was on the Sunday as I heard of the robbery on the Tuesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

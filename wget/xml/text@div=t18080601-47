               <p>Q. Did you go down stairs into the cellar - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had concealed yourself there did the dustmen come - A. About four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dustmen went down - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who these dustmen were - A. The two prisoners at the bar; when they went down first, the younger man, Smith, took the shovel and filled the basket; they took a candle with them down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had the means of seeing them distinctly - A. Exactly. The younger one Smith filled the basket, and Russell took it up stairs; when Russell came for the second basket, Russell said is there any thing in this, speaking of the second basket; Smith said no, it shall be in the next; then Russel took the candle and looked at the back part of the cellar, and went to where there was some wood; he looked to see if there was any body there, he went then to the coal cellar, and went to where they clean the knives; he returned to the basket and took this bundle and put it edgeways into the, basket and covered it over with dust; he took it from the left hand side of the cellar warehouse, he took it from a place where there were five in a parcel, and took the others and covered the vacancy so that it should not be discovered.</p>
               <p>Court. How many did he take away in the third basket - A. This one; then Russel took this one and the basket on his shoulder, Russell said to Smith there is one there, and I will put another in the next; then Smith went to the other side of the warehouse, and took this bundle, and put into the other dust basket and covered it with dust over it; I then threw down my concealment where I was in the cellar, and ran up stairs immediately, bolting Smith in the cellar; I took Russell in custody with the basket and this bundle on his shoulder before he got to the cart; I took him to the Compter directly; then I came back to the cellar and took the other prisoner, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you came back to that cellar and found Smith, where had he put that parcel which you saw him put in the basket - A. On the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. He had taken it out and put it on the coals - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the other parcel had been removed from the dust basket and put on the coals - A. It had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you had them parcels in your custody ever since - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Which is Russel.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 46, Middlesex Street, Somers Town. I have part of the same yard with Mr. Joseph Hedge, a cow keeper—on 6th Oct. Charlotte Hedge came to me; I ran down the steps, and turned my eye round, and saw the hay in the shed on fire—that shed was not more than twenty yards from the back door of Mr. Hedge—I went and extinguished it—there were three trusses of hay on fire when I went in, and then one more burst out—there were thirty-six trusses of hay there—the prisoner had been at work with me before breakfast—when Mr. Hedge came home, he began abusing him—the last time I saw the prisoner was about ten minutes before I saw the fire—I had turned him out of the yard—there was no one on the premises between 3 and 4 o'clock but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went down the yard, and the cow keeper said I had been wanted; I went to Mr. fledge, and said, "Do you want me now?" he said, "No, come on Tuesday morning;" I went on Tuesday morning, and Mr. Hedge said he would give me some dinner; I went up stairs to him, and he was writing a letter; I was standing at the door, and he said, "If you don't go down, I will kick you;" I went down, and left the yard; I did not come down to the yard again; I did not know that I had any lucifers with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cow keeper to Mr. Hedge. I have known the prisoner twelve months—I saw him on the premises on 6th Oct.; I ordered him off about half past 3 o'clock—he said he was not going to hurry, and after he got outside he said, "You have no occasion to be so bounceable, you won't be there long"—I asked him the reason, and he said, "That it my business"—this was about half past 3 o'clock—I had seen the hay safe about five minutes before—I saw the prisoner no more till he came and tapped at my window to call me, at 4 o'clock—he said, "You are wanted;" he did not say for what—when I was going across the road, I understood him the hay was on fire—it was in the shed—it was the back part of the hay that was on fire—no one could have got easily at that part.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of March, I was called up by a person who comes to work for me - I heard a rustling noise in the yard; I pulled my curtain aside; I saw a man get off the water-cistern, in the yard, and come in at my back door into my passage - my yard joins the prosecutor's; there is a wall between them - I told the person, who called me, and he alarmed the Police; two Policemen came almost directly, and went out of my back door to Boddington's, but could find nobody - I did not go with them, as I was not dressed; I went to the back door; a bag and several weights were found in Boddington's yard - I went to the top of my house, thinking they might have got out at my roof; I knocked at the prisoner Harper's, door, which is the top room in my house, and said,"Mrs. Harper, don't be frightened, have you any one there?" - she said, "Oh, dear, no;" she and her husband lodge with me - I went down again; we hunted in the cellar, but could find nobody, and the Police went away; a little after six o'clock, Mrs. Wood, who lodges on the same floor as Harper, came down and told me something- in five or six minutes I went up with Rose and another Policeman, and found the three male prisoner in Mrs. Harper's room; they were taken to the watch-house.</p>

             re-examined. I could not form any judgment who it was it at I saw come ozer the cistern - there is a water-closet at the side of the cistern; that is close up to the wall, and there is a water-cistern on the other side of the wall, so that it is easy to get down, and on my side it is like a ladder; I never examined the other side to see if it was easy to get up from there - there is no wooden partition; it is a brick wall, eight or nine feet high.</p>

               <p> - HALL. I am a fishmonger, and live in Clare-court, which is right at the back of Boddington's house. On Sunday morning, the 7th of March, about half-past one o'clock, I was closing my shop, and observed the prisoner Harper coming up the court with a man; they stopped at Bishop's private door, stood talking for two or three minutes, then passed each other, and parted - she went up stairs, and the other one went down to the end of the court, to two more men who stood there, and in two or three minutes I saw three men come up the court together - they went to the same door as Harper went in at - I heard one say, "Is the fire a light?" they all three went in, and closed the door - I saw no more; I did not notice their faces.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BODDINGTON. I know these weights - the things found in the handkerchief are mine, but not the handkerchief; I do not know any of the copper - I lost as near as I can calculate, 8s. or 10s. in halfpence, farthings, and pence, but how many of each I cannot say.</p>

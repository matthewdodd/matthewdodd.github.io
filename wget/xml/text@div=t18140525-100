            . I am a paper-hanger; I live at No. 8, Beech-street, Barbican. I know the prisoner Israel; he frequented my shop. I went to his house near <placeName id="t18140525-100-crimeloc576">Stoney-lane, Petticoat-lane</placeName>

I had conversation with Israel on the subject of tokens; he said, he could introduce me to a better thing, to country notes. I said, I believed no such people existed there; that dropped. I and Israel met the following day, at the Ship public-house, in Stoney-lane; we met there by agreement. We talked upon the subject of counterfeit tokens. I then agreed to buy some. Israel told me, he did not care about serving me, unless I took a large quantity. As soon as I had the idea of the business, I informed the Bank. They directed me to buy them of him; I did, on the <rs id="t18140525-100-cd577" type="crimeDate">15th of April</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18140525-100-off575 t18140525-100-cd577"></join>. He said, I could not have less than five pounds worth. I met him at six o'clock, on the same day, at the same house in Stoney-lane. Andrews was there, and Israel. I there purchased five pounds worth of Israel; Andrews was by at the time. Andrews took one in his hand; he said, they were well executed, he could see no fault in them. Israel desired me to put them in my pocket, for fear they should be seen. I was about counting them; I was to have five dozen for five pounds. He told me to put them in my pocket; which I did, supposing I had sixty. I put them into my pocket. We drank together. I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for them - A. Five pounds for the sixty.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you parted with them did you mark them - A. Yes; before I parted with the tokens I marked them in the presence of Dickens and Mr. Westwood, in Mr. Westwood's office; I parted with them to Mr. Westwood. I am sure these are the fifty that the prisoner gave me for sixty, and they are the fifty that I gave to Mr. Westwood; they are all marked with my initials under the head. I saw the prisoner again the next morning at his own house in Stoney-lane. He asked me what I had done with them. I told him they were gone into the country. He had told me to part with them as soon as possible. I told him according to his directions, they had gone into the country. He then told me that he ought to have a share in the profit of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted them - A. I counted them, and was surprized there were only fifty. We appointed to meet on the next day, that was on a Sunday: Andrews and Israel were to come to my house, on Sunday morning, by nine o'clock. I took care to have the officer in my house. Andrews came to my shop, he asked me if I had done any thing; I told him, yes, I was going on well. I walked up Sun-street with him; the officer was behind me. I told the officer to keep back. I went into a public-house, and drank with him. He appointed to meet me the next day. The next day I purchased three pounds worth more of Israel; I was to have thirty-six. I counted them; there was only thirty-three. I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Westwood, as I had done before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 1.) On Saturday, the 6th of June, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Camberwell, in a street leading towards Denmark-hill—he went towards Cold-harbour-lane—I ran there my<lb></lb>self, a few minutes afterwards, and did not see him—I ran till I came to a passage about two hundred yards up Cold-harbour-lane, looked through the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and live with my father, at 7, Crown-square, Camberwell—I am in the service of Mr. Clavey, of Denmark-hill—on Saturday, June 6th, between one and two o'clock the prisoner came into the shop, and asked if he might leave a basket there—I did not look into it—I delivered it to the police-sergeant—our shop is about twenty doors past Cold<lb></lb>harbour-lane, and four or five doors from the passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Elizabeth Howard—on Saturday, 6th of June, I received information, went to the station, and saw this basket and the things in it—this piece of solder belongs to my mother—I know it by a mark upon it—it is a mould we cast them in ourselves—this is an accidental mark on it—I produce a corresponding piece—I cannot swear so particularly to the other articles—I do not know the basket—I can<lb></lb>not swear to these buckets—they have no private mark upon them—we had such things as all the articles here, and have missed several things—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my mother's employment that day—I had given him a bar of solder to use the day before—this mark is caused by a crack in the mould—we pour water on it when it is in the mould—and that has caused it to crack—I can swear to it—this copper wire I cannot so particularly speak to—it is very much like some I had in the green-house.</p>

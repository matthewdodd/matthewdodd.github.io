               <p>the White Horse, at Ratcliff. The prisoner was his servant—in consequence of missing money, on Tuesday night, 5th Aug., a little after 11 o'clock, I marked a half-crown, two shillings, six sixpences, thirty pence, and eight halfpence, and put them into the till—the prisoner went to bed at 11, and I went at 12—I came down next morning at a little after 6, found the till wide open, and missed one shilling, two sixpences, and some copper—a constable was called; he searched the prisoner's box in my presence, and found one shilling, two sixpences, and eight pence, all marked—to get to the till a person would have to unlock the bar-parlour door, but the key of the sitting-room above, which is left in the door, will unlock it—on this morning, before I came down, I heard the prisoner get up and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down—I then looked from the top of the landing and saw that the sitting-room door key was gone—when I came down in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after, it was replaced.</p>

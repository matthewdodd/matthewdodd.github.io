            ; we live in Carburton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 5th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was going to Barnet - I was too late for the stage, and waited at the Bell, public-house, at Pentonville, for a stage to pass. An elderly woman was with me, who assisted in carrying my bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment. She called for two pots of beer, which made me angry with her - the prisoner, Yates, was in the taproom, and offered to carry my bundle to Islington for 1 s.; the woman of the house wanted me to leave it there, but I took it away myself. When I got to the door Yates took it from me to carry it - another young man was with him (not Liversedge). We went to the Peacock, at <placeName id="t18200217-154-crimeloc893">Islington</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200217-154-crimeloc893" type="placeName" value="Islington"></interp>

               <p>"Now, young man, give me my bundle." He said,</p>
               <p>"There will be a mail up in a few minutes, and I will give it you then." We then went on to the turnpike - Liversedge told me to run into the <placeName id="t18200217-154-crimeloc894">toll-house</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200217-154-crimeloc894" type="placeName" value="toll-house"></interp>

I was not a moment talking to the man, when I returned they were gone with the bundle. A little girl said they were gone into the Swan, public-house, just by - I went there, and saw Liversedge in the taproom. I asked him what he had done with my bundle? he used most gross language. I said I wished I could get a constable - one came, and took him. The landlord said I must be mistaken, for he had not been out of the house, but I am sure he is the man. I described Yates to Purton; he took him on the Thursday following, and produced my bundle; several things had been taken out.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was standing by the Peacock, the prosecutrix gave Liversedge into my custody, I found nothing on him. Next evening I took Yates, and found the property at his lodgings, tied in a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>YATES'S Defence. I waited twenty minutes for her, then went to the toll-house, and asked if she had been there? he said she was gone to Pentonville. I took the bundle to my lodgings, and left my address with Hicks, the landlord, in case she should come back.</p>
               <p>- HICKS. I am landlord of the Bell, at Battle-bridge. The prosecutrix was at my house. I do not think she was capable of knowing what she was about - she was very much intoxicated. I do not know whether she had a bundle or not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, did you see her with a bundle - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you say you did not know - A. I offered to take care of it for her. Yates did not give me his address.</p>

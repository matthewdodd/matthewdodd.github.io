               <p>Q. What makes you accuse him of taking your coat and waistcoat - A. My coat and waistcoat was taken out of my cabin, on Monday morning last, about half past four o'clock, and they were found in another vessel. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARR. I was on board a collier; that is not Mr. Robinson's ship; there was one ship laid between Mr. Robinson's ship and ours. I slept upon the half deck; our dog barked; I jumped out of bed; I looked into a lighter; there was a man there; I asked him what he was doing there so early in the morning; he came on board our ship, and asked me to lend him our boat to put him on shore; I refused. He said, he would get a scaller. I stepped over our ships quarters; I saw a little bundle laying upon the lighter's gunnel; the prisoner was standing about a yard off the clothes. I called out here, a hand here, I suspect this man, here is a thief; the Captain came, and looked at the clothes; he said, he is a thief. I directly took hold of him. One of our men went on board the lighter, and fetched the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner - A. No; I never saw him before. It was between five and six in the morning. The dog barking, I looked into the lighter; I then saw the prisoner, and the bundle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Brown, Higham House, Shooter's Hill Road, Blackheath—on 23rd December I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and put it in an envelope, enclosing 1 1/4 yards of ribbon, and addressed it to "Mrs. J. Pickthorne, Hatherley Fields, near Gloucester," and handed it to my fellow-servant, Grace Miller, to post it, giving her two packets at the same time and the money for the postage.</p>

I remember Pickthorne giving me two brown-paper packets and a letter to post on Christmas eve—the letter was addressed to Mrs. Pickthorne—I took them into the office at Shooter's Hill Road, stamped them, and put the letter in the letter box—Boecher was on duty there and weighed the packets for me.</p>

I am travelling clerk in the Missing Letter Depart<lb></lb>ment—in consequence of complaints at Shooter's Hill Branch I instructed Poliee-officer Fry to search the prisoner on 4th July—Fry took from him a bunch of keys—I accompanied the prisoner to his lodgings, 28, Bedford Place, Shooter's Hill Road, and saw him unlock a hat-box there, and found in it the first part of the letter produced, and subsequently the second sheet—I said "How did this come here?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Do you know anybody living at Higham House?"—he said "No"—I said "This letter appears to have contained something, and is I believe a post-letter; I shall want some satisfactory explanation as to how it came here"—he said "A young woman left it one evening on the counter at the office"—I said "You had no business to break it open"—he said "It contained a piece of blue ribbon; it was not properly fastened down or addressed"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050137"></xptr>
               <p>I said "Then you ought to have sent it to the Returned Letter Office"—he said "Yes, I know that, but I meant to have returned it to the young woman herself. I forgot it was here"—I said "Do you know where the ribbon is and the envelope?" and he said "No"—I said "Where is Higham House?" and he said it was about two minutes' walk from his lodgings—I subsequently charged him.</p>

I was receiver at Shooter's Hill Road Post-office last Christ<lb></lb>mas, and the prisoner was employed under me, and was on duty there on 23rd and 24th December, and had access to the letters posted on that day, and it was his duty to clear the box—there was no one else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated that the letter was found on the counter with-out any address, and neither sealed or stamped, and it was placed aside in the office, and he put it in his pocket, intending to take it to the girl, and over-looked it; but was certain he mentioned it to Mr. Rice at the time.</hi>

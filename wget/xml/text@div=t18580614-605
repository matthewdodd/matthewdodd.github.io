                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of New Street, Gravel Lane. The prisoner was my potman and porter—I had reason to suspect that my till had been robbed for many years—Mr. Solomons said to me, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, "I saw your servant go over and take money out of the till;" the prisoner said, "I have not taken a farthing out"—he had no right to go to the till—my wife was present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I was sitting in the bar on 29th May, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, with my back to the till; I heard several voices, turned round, and saw several persons coming out of the tap room—I then saw the prisoner coming from behind the bar, with a measure in his hand—he had, before that, asked me for the measures to clean; I had told him to take them—I could not see the till on turning round, but I heard voices say, "Why do not you tell Mrs. Moss she is being robbed"—I found the till open; I had shut it six or seven minutes before, having counted the money in it; there was then 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I cannot say of what coins it consisted—I did not count the gold or the copper, only the silver that was in the bowl—on finding the till open, I counted the silver again, and missed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the till is behind the bar, and I was in the bar, stooping to hook my little boy's frock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar maker, of No. 21, New Street, Gravel Lane. I was in Mr. Moss's tap room on the Saturday, and as I came out I saw the prisoner with his hand in the till, taking out some money; I could not see how much, but I saw that it was silver—I gave the alarm; some young men came out and told Mrs. Moss, and Mr. Moss came down stairs.</p>

When I found these four I put them behind the bed that my brother might not have a beating for them, because the boy had brought four guns in before, and my master beat him severely for it; I meaned to send them back to the tower at the watering time, then my master would not have known it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had done this did your master come in - A. Yes; I did not acquaint my master with it; I went out to get a side of brass, and while I was gone my master was taken up to the office for the four guns; upon that I went to the officer to deliver my evidence. I found my master locked up and his hearing was done with.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath had your master any knowledge of these guns being behind the bed - A. I do not believe he knew of it; the number to be returned was ten, and we had only nine.</p>

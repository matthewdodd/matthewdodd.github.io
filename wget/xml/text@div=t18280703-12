I was stripped of my bonnet, scarf, rings, cap, comb, and all. I certainly told the Magistrate I was in liquor, and I say so now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner EDMUNDS. She tried to bite me; I let her go, and walked away; this watchman came after me. Did I not walk back with you to justify myself? A. No; I took you back: I said what a shame it was to leave her in that way; Johnson said, "D-n her, we shall leave no more trouble with her;" I said, "How came you to rob her of her bonnet and things?" she said, "D-n her bonnet - here it is, and the comb, for you;" in Plumbtree-street one of them shoved the shawl down an area; the prosecutrix was fainting, and was carried to the watch-house. I saw nobody else running away.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. She came over to me in Broad-street, St. Giles', between twelve and one o'clock, quite intoxicated, and asked if I could get her anything to drink - she gave me 1s.; a watchman came over, and said,"What, mistress, have you not been home yet - you have been in the watch-house, and promised to go home;" she said she would go home when she thought proper - we went over and had some gin, which came to 1s. 1 1/2d.; she had not got the 1 1/2d. - the landlord said, "Take her out, or she is beastly drunk;" she followed me over, and asked me to get her a bed; this man was passing with an umbrella - she caught hold of his arm; two watchmen same, and said they would take her to the watch-house: at this time there were two men and two women with her; they went a little way, and then left her: we stopped, and he watchman came up; this watchman pulled her about; I said, "Don't ill-use her - let her go home; she says she lives in Tottenham-court-road:" we took her a little way- her bonnet fell off before we touched her, she was so intoxicated; this man left me; I could not get her on - she fell, being so drunk, and I left her.</p>
               <p>EDMUNDS' Defence. I met her - the rain poured; she asked me to hold the umbrella over her, which I did; two persons were there; she said she had been robbed of two rings, and they directly ran away; she began making a noise; these watchmen came up; I was going to move her on - she bit my finger; and about twenty yards further on she tried to bite me again; I left her, but ran back for my umbrella; I came away; this young woman followed me; I stood talking to her; when the watchman came up I returned with him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PRATT re-examined. I did not lose sight of her till she was robbed; I saw her fall, and they both ran away; there was nobody near her but the prisoners; they were both going away together when I came up to them.</p>

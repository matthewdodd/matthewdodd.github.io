               <p>Q. What makes you suspect the prisoner? - A. I do not know who took it away; I never saw the prisoner before I saw him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch? - A. I recovered the watch at a pawnbroker's, Mr. Turner's, near Golden-square.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner when he pledged this watch? - A. On the evening of the 14th of January the prisoner came to redeem some articles of wearing-apparel; he shewed me a metal watch which is now produced in Court; there was a woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced that watch to you? - A. I cannot take upon me to say; the prisoner gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You will not take upon you to swear whether the man or the woman pulled it out of their pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the watch was produced to you, did not the prisoner say the watch belonged to the woman? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner had pledged it, did he not return to your shop? - A. Yes; in consequence of a ham that was left at our shop.</p>

The pawnbroker knows very well my sister lives in the neighbourhood; I told him my sister pledged things there; my sister found this watch; I and my sister went there on Saturday night; she has used the house twelve years; I asked him what the watch was worth; I thought it was gold; he said no, it was worth about 2 l. I pledged it for 1 l. 10 s. and gave my sister the money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150020"></xptr>and the duplicate; on Wednesday I went to pledge a coat and waistcoat for 16 s. I said, Mr. Turner, if I cannot get the watch out, will you buy it of my sister; my sister had a ham to dispose of; said I, Mr. Turner, do you want to buy a ham; Mr. Turner said, my brother is not in the way, you may leave it and call again in the evening; I went again in the evening, an officer was there; he asked me how I came by the watch; I told him I had it of my sister; he then took me into custody.</p>

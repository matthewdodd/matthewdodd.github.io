            . On Friday the 16th of May, there had been a party at my master's house; and the next morning I washed up the plate and put it in a table cloth in the back kithen, at about half past twelve o'clock. It consisted of all the articles enumerated in the indictment. The back kitchen where I put them, is at the back of the house; they could not be seen from the street.</p>

            . I am Sir George's servant. There had been an entertainment at his house the night before this robbery. There had been near an hundred and twenty persons. There was no more plate than Sir George's; there were some persons coming from the Argyle Rooms to take the seats away, which Sir George had hired. Persons going by, might observe that there was a stir and bustle going on in the house.</p>

            's house, to remove some of the things which he had hired. I was taking away cane seats, tables, and tressels. There was another porter named Roach. It was necessary that the door should be left open. In the course of the work, between half past one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the bar. To the best of my belief I saw her on the two pair of stairs landing place. I don't know whether she had any thing; she had a pair of pattens in her hand. I was coming down; thinking she was one of the servants of the house, I remarked to her, that it was a nice day, to what the day before was, when we brought the things, for it had been a rainy day; and she said, yes it was. From that moment's conversation I had sight and view enough of her to know it was she, when I saw her again; in the course of about three hours, or something less, I was as sure of her then, as I am now. I think she had something in her apron before her, but I can't swear.</p>

            . I am a linen draper, at No. 119, Oxford-street. On the day in question, I took notice of the prisoner by her being in my house. It is two turnings from John-street, which leads to Great Portland-street. It was about twelve o'clock. I had the Rev. Mr. Helm in my house, who on going out to his silversmith's left the street - door open, and I found the prisoner in my house. I knew her person; I saw her in about an hour and a half afterwards in Edward-street, Cavendish-square. She had then a large bundle of things in a table-cloth. From that to Sir George's house, which is about four or five hundred yards, or rather less than a quarter of a mile. I took particular notice of her and walked past her. When I turned round, she was out of my sight; she had gone down a gateway, where there was no thoroughfare. I went down also and heard a noise behind a stable gate, and I looked, behind, and immediately she ran off from behind it and up some steps, and said, I am undone, take the property? the property is yours, or something to that purpose. She was greatly confused. I called several persons but not one of them would secure her. I took her; I afterwards took the bundle from behind the gate, where she had left it. I afterwards examined it. There were one hundred and one pieces of silver plate. All these I gave to the officer. They were never out of my hands until I gave them to the officer. I delivered the prisoner to him also.</p>

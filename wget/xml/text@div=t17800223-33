As soon as I entered the gate I saw two men; the evening was drawn in so that I did not see the colour of their clothes; I went down the Park that is called the <placeName id="t17800223-33-crimeloc185">Queen's Park</placeName>

               <p>You followed the men? - Yes, I did; I never saw their faces, nor they mine; they turned short, and ran quick at me and knocked me down. When I was down I saw one behind and the other before me; I was apprehensive they were going to cut my throat; I halloo'd out; there was a sentry near; the men might imagine the sentry would be alarmed, they snatched my hat and cloak immediately and away they ran.</p>
               <p>Do you know who those two men were? - No: I never swore to their persons. As I was going to my own home, in Peter-street, at the bottom of Strutton-ground, I saw two <rs id="t17800223-33-viclabel186" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

I directly followed Burrows into the pawnbroker's shop; supposing them to be the men who had robbed me. As he was showing the cloak to the pawnbroker, I snatched it out of his hand, said it was mine, and asked him where he got it? He said it was his wife's.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230051"></xptr>I said, I believed he was the villain who had knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Was it your cloak? - Yes; it was the same cloak that had been snatched off my back. Burrows said it was so, he would take me where I might have my hat and all.</p>
               <p>At first he said it was his wife's cloak? - Yes; I said, I must know how his wife came by that cloak; then he said, as it had happened so, if I would be at peace he would take we where my hat was.</p>
               <p>Was the other prisoner in his company? - They were both together; when he found Burrows was detained in the pawnbroker's shop he went home to his lodgings; I detained Burrows till the constable was sent for; I had a great scuffle with him in the pawnbroker's shop; when I insisted upon its being my cloak, he violently seised my arm, but I would not let him go upon any account; we kept him till the constable came; then we took him before Justice Jordain in Petty France; the other prisoner Burden was then brought before the Justice; they both there confessed that they were the men who committed the fact.</p>
               <p>Did you say that you would not prosecute them, or give them any hopes of favour? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was any menance made use of to induce them to confess? - No: there was not; it was all voluntary.</p>
               <p>Burrows. She came to us in Tothilfields; we begged mercy of her; she said that she would prosecute us for the sake of the reward.</p>

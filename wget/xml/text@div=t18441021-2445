                  </hi>. I am servant to Mordon Martin Monroe. On the 23rd of Sept. he had seventeen ducks, and on the 24th I missed one white speckled one, and two were crippled—I had fed them ever since they were born, and knew them well—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be the one I lost—there was but this one of this colour.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 314.) I found this duck in the pri<lb></lb>soner's pocket, about half-past twelve o'clock, on the night of the 24th of Sept., near the prosecutor's house—it was quite warm—I asked him how he came by it—he said his master gave it him three hours before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not take the duck away out of the pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The pocket was tight, I could not get it out without using bolh hands, and I must have let go of him—he tried to make his escape—it was Enfield fair time—the prisoner did not appear to be drunk—I had heard the ducks crying out before—he did not say that he did not steal it.</p>

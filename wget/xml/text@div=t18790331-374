                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About 6 o'clock on the evening of 1st Feb. I saw Alvey in Aldersgate Street, close to the door of Messrs. Atkinson's warehouse—I knew him to be one of their servants—I saw something pro<lb></lb>jecting from underneath his short canvas jacket—I followed him to the corner of Carthusian Street—I saw Tyler standing on the kerb; he went up and spoke to her, and they both went into the Red Lion public-house—I suspected there was something wrong, I pushed the door partly open; I saw Tyler sit down and open this little bag; Alvey pulled this bottle from underneath his jacket and put it into the bag; I saw the quicksilver—I went few paces from the house to get assistance, I turned round and saw them both come out of the public-house—they parted, one came towards Aldersgate Street and the other towards Charterhouse Square—I followed Tyler, stopped her, and asked her what she had in the bag—she said "What belongs to my husband"—I said "I mean that bottle which the man in the public-house put into your bag just now"—she said "He put nothing in the bag"—I said "I saw him put a bottle in," and I put my hand in and pulled out this bottle of quicksilver—I then told her that I should take her into. custody—I took her to the prosecutor's warehouse, took Alvey also into custody and took them both to the station—she said that her husband had given ber this to take to be burnt—I told Alvey I should charge him with stealing this bottle of quicksilver and giving it to the female in the public-house—he said he had not given anything to her, she had merely come to deliver a message to him from her husband—Mr. Best, one of the pro<lb></lb>secutor's clerks, afterwards came to the Guildhall Police-court and spoke to Alvey about the state of his machines; he wanted to know how they stood, because of putting the different ingredients into the mills—the prisoner said No. 3 was 44, and he told him of the other machines, and that they Would</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutor—it was part of my duty to weigh out to Alvey at stated periods the quick-silver that he required for his machines, and as a rule I weighed it out in his presence and handed it to him and entered it in a book—I have been there 17 years, but not always in that capacity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the prosecutor—Alvey has been in the employ about 30 years—it was his duty to look after the machines for making ointment and pills, one of the chief ingredients being quicksilver—since this matter has been brought to my notice I have made an inspection of the books in which the quicksilver delivered to him appears—I have also made an inspection of the quantity of ointment that was turned out by him from the machines, and found a deficiency—about February, 1878, after taking stock, I had reason to tell Alvey that his stock was deficient, that he was continually having silver out, and I was dissatisfied with the result—he said he had worked up all the raw material and we had had the result, and as he had been in the employ such a number of years I was reluctant to be suspicious or to be harsh with him, and I passed it over at the time—about the early part of February this year I saw the female prisoner meet Alvey in Barbican; she opened a bag and he placed something in it—I did not we what it was—the mercury produced is similar to what was given out to Alvey—we use a bottle like this, this other is a spirit bottle—others besides the prisoner used mercury, each workman has it weighed out to him in his J presence, and they have to account for it—the manufactured article and the mercury account is balanced every month—it is in the manufactured article that we are deficient.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Alvey</hi>. You have been absent from business—your brother has occasionally worked the machines when you have been absent Thomas Best. I am one of the managing chemists at the prosecutor's—I saw Alvey at the Guildhall Police-court and asked him how the machines stood—he said as to Ko. 3 that he had put 40lb. of quicksilver into that machine and 4lb. of other ingredients—I went back with Potts and looked at the machine and found there was only 30lb. of quicksilver—also found the sugar and Fuller's earth underneath in a box—it had no business there.</p>

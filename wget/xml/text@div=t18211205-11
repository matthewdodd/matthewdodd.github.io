The prisoner came in and bought two apples, for which he paid three halfpence - It was on Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock; he asked me to have the goodness to look in my till for a new shilling, as he wished to make a child a present of one - I had a child at my breast, I took the till out, and put it on the counter, that he might see, there was 18 s. there, a few minutes before, he put his hand in three times to search for one - I told him I thought there was not one, but if he could find one he might have it; he turned the money over three times, there then appeared to be less in quantity. He wished me good night and left - I ran after him, and overtook him myself, and brought him back; I then counted the money, there was only 12 s. in the till - I had left the shop in care of the maid-servant, who is about eleven years old. I charged him of taking the money out of the till, which he denied; a constable was sent for, who found six shillings on him and one farthing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JESSOP. Q. Was the till locked - A. No. I counted the money a few minutes before, and my husband counted it before that, there was then 15 s., and I took 3 s. more, which made 18 s., when I took him he denied being the man - he turned out his pockets, and said</p>
               <p>"I have only 6 s.," the 18 s. was all in shillings, I at first said he took 6 s. or 7 s., as I had not counted it then.</p>

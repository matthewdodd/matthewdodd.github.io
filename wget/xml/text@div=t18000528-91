             sworn. - I am hay-binder to Mr. Gaunt: On the 20th of May, near about five in the morning, I went to the rick-yard. I found the rick cut and hacked about at a strange rate, I thought I had lost fourteen or fifteen trusses of hay, but there was not so much cut out as if I had cut it myself; I looked at the other rick, I saw but a trifle cut off the other rick, and that was hacked about like mine; I then tracked the loose hay that had been dropped into the lans, the lane was close by, there was not more than room for a carriage to pass between the rick and the hay; I traced it about fifteen yards up the lane, there was a good deal of hay there, where I suppose they loaded the hay; I then tracked the horses' feet, and the wheels, towards London; I then took my horse out of the stable and followed the track down the road, and saw hay scattered at several places; I tracked it up a lane that goes towards Hampstead; I then went on to West-End, and there I was informed of a cart with some hay slung off it, I made the best of my way after it, and when I got near to Hampstead, I saw the track plainer and plainer; there had been rain, and the road was wet; I went down Hampstead till I came to a gate-way, where I could not have gone past it without I did it on purpose, it was so plain; there were two horses in the cart, and the hay in it, under the gate-way; I saw the landlord, and desired him to assist me; I got off my horse, and asked who belonged to that cart, and he, by pointing, made me understand that the person was in doors; I went in, and asked which was the man that belonged to that hay; and the prisoner at the bar told me that he belonged to it; I went to him and took hold of his shoulder, and told him he was my prisoner; he asked me for what; I told him, the hay that was in that cart was stole out of the rick where I bound, that it was my property; he said it was not; I said it was my master's; he told me then that he brought it from Harrow-Weald; upon which I said, I know it did, for it never was there; then I sent for a constable, the constable came, and I searched the cart; I pulled the hay on one side to look for tools, and found a cutting-knife in a sack, upon the top of the cart; I told the constable to take care of him, and I went and rode to Park-lane, to my master, and told him I had had four cuts of hay stole; and he went with me to look at the rick, and then went to Hampstead where the prisoner was in hold.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been used to cut this hay? - A. I had cut upwards of thirty load of it; I built the rick, and thatched it, for a gentleman that is dead; Mr. Gaunt bought it at the sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Then can you tell us, whether the hay in the cart, from the quality of it, was the same hay that had stood in your master's rick-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that from knowing the hay, or tracing the wheels, or all together? - A. I know it from both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How far is it from the rick-yard to where you found the prisoner? - A. About two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you went out in search? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many hay-carts were coming to London at that time in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the track so visible that you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280089"></xptr>trace it from the place where you first found it to the place where you found the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say you traced the track without any information? - A. There might be places where the wheels had crossed.</p>
               <p>Q. You made an inquiry of a man that you met, you must therefore have lost the track? - A. No; I only asked him to know how long it had been gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ladder in the rick-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have been carried without a ladder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found no ladder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. In what state was the hay? - A. Made up in bundles for trusses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said, that the knife you found upon the prisoner could not have cut that hay? - A. I do not think I could; it is not cut, hardly, it is rather mauled about; I could not have done it as should be with that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to swear to the hay? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found eighteen bundles of hay in the cart half a load? - A. Nineteen; if it had been properly bound, I think it would have been contained in between fourteen and fifteen trusses.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say, that there was ar in the cart that clearly did not come from your master's rick? - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gaunt.) Did you look at the hay in the ot? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hay was it? - A. It was mine, there no doubt of it; I know it because all the rick of hay that has been cut, has been used by myself; I could, with a vast deal of safety, swear to it; it is a very remarkable load of hay, it is of a very particular colour, it has a great deal of gay flowers in it; though it is dark in its colour, there may be a great dead of hay like mine; but I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to undertake to swear to the hay? - A. I cannot swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No; I gave one hundred and sixty guineas for the rick.</p>
               <p>- READ sworn. - I am a constable, I took the prisoner into custody: I asked him where he got the hay from; and he said, he brought it from Harrow-Weald, from his father-in-law's. (Produces the knife).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gaunt.) I want to know, whether with that knife you could have cut the hay? - A. There is not a doubt of it; it was very fresh when it was found, it is a little rusty now.</p>
               <p>Read. I asked him how he came by the knife, and he said it was the last load that he had; it was his own cart and horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you leave the prisoner at any time by himself at the public-house, for a considerable length of time? - A. I did; he said, I need not be afraid of his running away; and when I came back I found him there; I really thought, at the time, the man was innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Saturday morning, 20th March, I was on duty in Oxford-street, between 3 and 4 o'clock, and saw the prisoner between the Marble<lb></lb>arch and the Circus, with this carpet bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his shoulder—I asked him what he had got in it, he refused to tell me—I then took hold of it, and he said that there was nothing in it but wearing apparel, and pulled out a boot—I said that I thought that was not the sort of boot that he was in the habit of wearing—seeing another constable coming, be dropped the bag and boot and ran away—I pursued him, and he fell down so as for me to fall over him, but I did not—I took him to the station, and this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in his pocket—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it behind him, and I picked it up—he said that it was there when he came into the station.</p>

On Wednesday, 14th March, I was the last person up—I went to bed between 10 and 11 o'clock, and fastened the house up—I came down next morning before half past 4 o'clock, and found the house had been broken into—the store room window was broken, and a hand put through to unfasten it—they had got in that way—the store room door had been looked, but was broken open—I missed this shawl, gloves, and carpet bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are mine—these four pairs of boots belong to Mr. Routh.</p>

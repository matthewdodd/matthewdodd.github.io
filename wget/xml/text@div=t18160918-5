I recollect going home on Monday the 15th of July; I was going home in the middle of the day, at about a quarter before one; at the time this transaction happened, I was in <placeName id="t18160918-5-crimeloc26">Great Garden-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160918-5-crimeloc26" type="placeName" value="Great Garden-street"></interp>

As I was going along there, I was suddenly stopped by some men, and the two prisoners at the bar held me fast; they held my arms; I cannot tell whether each of them held an arm, as it was done instantaneously; I am sure they were about my person. There was nothing more particular happened to me, only I saw a lad run away, and I suppose he had got the watch; I know I had my watch when I first came into the street, about two minutes before. That lad ran away, I did not feel the watch go; I believe I had it in my possession immediately before the two men laid hold of me. As soon as I was liberated, I discovered that my watch was gone, and then I called stop thief. There was a gold chain and a gold seal to my watch; it was a watch that went upon a diamond, and it was silver; I have never seen it since. The two prisoners were stopt directly afterwards; they did not run, but they walked away very fast. They had not got an hundred yards, before they were stopped. I am quite sure they both assisted in holding of me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. That was within a few minutes of one, in a street which is rather short, and rather narrow. Mr. Elwes is the man sent for to take them into custody. They were walking away, they had no hand in robbing me, but they held me fast. I did not say to Mr. Elwes that I could not swear they held me. Mr. Elwes keeps an oil shop in White-chapel; he was sent for. His house and shop are not in a situation as to enable him to see what passed from them. I was alone in this street; there might be people in the street in which I was walking along. I first got Mr. Westcoat to assist me, and afterwards Elwes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with Elwes or Westcoat about a reward - A. No.</p>

            . I was in this street on the 15th of July, I live there. I remember hearing stop thief cried; it was eight minutes before one at that time by my watch. I observed the old man shaking, and quaking, and I asked him what was the matter, and he said, those two men have robbed me of my watch; they had got better than an hundred yards off, and I went forward and seized them. I took them to a public-house, and Elwes searched them.</p>

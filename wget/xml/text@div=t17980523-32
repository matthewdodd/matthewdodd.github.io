             sworn. - I know the prisoner at the bar: I live at Mr. Dexter's, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road; she pledged with me a bed-tick for five shillings, on the 23d of April. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that duplicate? - A. That is my writing, I gave it her; she pledged it in the name of Astor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. That is her maiden name.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Stone.) Can you undertake to swear that that is the tick of a bed that was in Mr. Holcomb's house? - A. I lay upon the bed near three weeks, and I made it every night, and have no doubt but it is the same bed; I have not the least doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the glass? - A. No; I cannot say about the glass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are servant to Mr. Holcomb? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you examined about the identity of some bed-curtains that were produced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not undertake to say that these bed-curtains were in the house? - A. I said they were like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say they were the curtains that were in the house, till the person came forward, and proved that they were in his possession? - A. I never said any thing but that they were like them.</p>
               <p>Q. The curtains hung round the bed, and of course, you had a better opportunity of being acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230027"></xptr> with them than you could have of the tick? - A. No, I cannot say that I had; only in regard to the pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. And you made no observation upon the bed, but when you were making it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many qualities and sizes of ticking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think you are as likely to be mistaken in the one as in the other? - A. I have no doubt it is the same tick.</p>


               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Q. I wish to know by what particular mark you can distinguish that bed-tick from another of the same size and stripe? - A. There is an addition made to it in widening it, and also a very remarkable seam.</p>
               <p>Jury. Nine bed-ticks out of ten are made in the same way; that is not an addition, but the way in which they are usually made.</p>

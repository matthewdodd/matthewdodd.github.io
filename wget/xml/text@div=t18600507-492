                  </hi>. I live in Shaftsbury-street, Walworth, and am a black<lb></lb>smith—On Saturday, 7th April, I was at my own house about 8 o'clock in the evening—I had been at home some time, and had had my tea—the prisoner came; my wife was out—I don't know whether she was gone to the prisoner's mother's—his mother's house is less than a quarter of a mile from mine—I was at home when a knock came to the door, and I was in the act of stirring the fire with this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner's wife has worked at my house for my wife, who is a laundress, about twelve months—she was in the habit of working there about two or three times a week—she came to iron—on hearing this knock I got up to go to the door; when I got to the parlour-door I heard a noise in the passage—I did not open the street-door; the prisoner's wife opened that—I heard a noise as if a person fell down, or was knocked down—the poker was hanging down—it was not lifted up at all—the prisoner was there, and he said to me directly, "It is you, you b—r"—he struck me a blow with his fist, and said, "I mean to murder you to-night,"and snatched the poker out of my hand, and struck me with it five or six times—the blows were given me over the table—he seized me by the stock with one hand and struck me five or six times with the poker, and said, "I intend to murder you"—I lost a wonderful deal of blood—his wife came to my assistance, and said, "Don't murder the man"—between his wife and I we managed to put him out of the house, and he broke the panel of the door after the door was closed, and said, "I will go in and finish him"—I at last escaped by the back way into the next house—I afterwards went to a chemist and then to Dr. Howitt—I was under Dr. Howitt's care about nine days; I was not able to get out at all during that time—about two minutes after this happened I put a shawl over my head and went to the prisoner's mother's—I expected to find my wife there; I found the prisoner there; he knocked me down, and my arm was black and blue—he said he meant to finish me—his mother called out "Murder," and the prisoner was dragged away from me, and I was hurt a good deal.</p>

I live in Apollo-buildings, and am a surgeon—on 7th April, I was called to the police-station, I found the prosecutor there—he had five contused wounds on his scalp, three of them were from two to three inches long—the scalp was divided in five places—the wounds had gone down to the bone—he had bruises on his arms as if some person had stamped on him—the wounds turned out not to be dangerous—sometimes such wounds are of a serious character, and sometimes they are not—I have seen a man who fell on a fender and the scalp was divided from the eye to the head, but he has recovered and is living—these wounds might have been inflicted with this poker, decidedly—he was very faint and very low, but that I considered favourable—I considered that danger might ensue—the quantity of blood that he lost might be something of a benefit to him—the next day he was extremely exhausted and very faint.</p>

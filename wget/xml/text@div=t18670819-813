                  </hi> I live at 8, Lark Row, Cambridge Heath, and am a weaver—about ten minutes past five am. on the third instant I saw two men leap over the garden fence at the back of Mr. Sanderson's factory, about fourteen yards from it—they were going from the direction of the factory—they continued going over all the neighbours' gardens—I lost sight of one of thorn, but the other, who was the prisoner, I never lost sight of—he got on to the workhouse wall and ran along the canal bank—I did not follow him, but looked from my window the whole of the time—I lost sight of him when he went down the descent—when I said before the Magistrate I did not lose sight of him I meant until he went over the union wall—I next saw him at the station-house—there are three or four gardens between the factory and the union wall—I am positive the prisoner is the second man I saw on that morning—it was a clear light, and I had a full view of his face as he passed.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 7, Lark Row, Cambridge Heath—I am a silk manufacturer, in the employment of Mr. William Sanderson—my house adjoins the factory, and there is a door communicating with the factory—at ten o'clock on the evening of the 2nd August I saw that door closed, and on the same afternoon I saw the silk which is the subject of this indictment on the looms in the factory—it was partly manufactured and worth about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw that silk on the morning of the 3rd, shortly after live o'clock in the passage leading from the factory to the garden—it was tied in a bag—no one had authority to remove it—I endeavoured to get from my house into the factory, but found the door fastened on the other side—I afterwards got into the factory by going round the garden to the back door, which ought to have been fastened, but which I found open—the bar of that door was barricading the door that led into my house—I then went over each floor, and found the doors all open and the various looms disturbed—another man fetched a policeman.</p>

"—I said, "No"—a few minutes afterwards I saw a man running along the wall of the union—he ran to the end of the wall, and then got from one wall to the other, where I lost sight of him—I next saw him at the Victoria Park Gates—I was then in the company of the police constable—when he saw us he ran away, and the constable caught him in the Old Ford Road—the prisoner is the man—I am certain of that.</p>

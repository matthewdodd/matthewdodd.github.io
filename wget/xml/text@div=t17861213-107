               <p>Was this the first time you heard your husband complain of being hurt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you hear him complain of being hurt? - On the Tuesday morning; but he was ill directly; I had much ado to get him back from the Compter; he complained of being in very great pain.</p>
               <p>Where did he complain of the pain? - All the pain he complained of was in his stomach and belly.</p>
               <p>How did he appear to be the following day? - He was very full of pain all that morning, and the whole day, and at six on the Tuesday evening, I sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>When did he appear to be dangerously ill? - He complained very much the whole time; and he died on Friday morning, ten minutes after five; during the Thursday, he was very bad during the night.</p>
               <p>Did he apprehend himself on the Thursday night, to be in danger of his life? - Yes, he always said so.</p>
               <p>On the Thursday night or Friday morning, did he say any thing respecting this hurt? - I did not hear him, but there is a man that did.</p>

               <p>Your husband I take for granted, was more than usually jovial on the occasion? - I do not know but he might, he had not drank a great deal; we had but three bottles of wine, and there were eleven or twelve drank out of them; my husband was not sober, nor so much in liquor then, as as I have seen him.</p>
               <p>This young man, beyond all question, behaved very imprudently? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - I do not recollect in my flurry.</p>

               <p>Was your husband a very lusty man? - Yes lusty, but not very lusty.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that while you staid at the watch-house, there was no punch nor drink of any sort had? - I saw none, we did not stop three minutes.</p>

               <p>I am mother to Mrs. Delew; I was at her house on the 27th of November; I remember the prisoner coming to the house about 12 o'clock; when they came in they asked for Mr. Trott and Mr. Delew opened the door for them; they had a shilling's-worth of punch and sat quietly and drank it, and two bottles of wine; Mrs. Delew put her hand on the settle, and the young man came up and used very ill expressions, and put his hand in her handkerchief, and then because she resisted, he let her alone; I saw a scuffle between Mr. Clarke and Mr. Delew; and Mr. Delew had a fall on the stairs, and he put his hand on his thigh, and said oh! I have got my death's wound, which was his cry till he died; I was the person that was with him; he said, oh; that villain has given me my death's wound, he said in his privates, where one man should not hurt another; he said that he was both kicked and punched; and the last breath that he drew but one, he said oh! that villain has been my death; and the last breath that ever he drew, he said, oh! that villain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, Prisoner's Counsel. You saw Mr. Clarke when he first came into the house? - Yes, he appeared very well dressed.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>But at the time when the scuffle happened between Mr. Delew and him, what words passed? - I cannot say, they scuffled some time before they fell; I did not see any more falls but one; Mrs. Delew was in the parlour; she was holding her husband down; he complained, and he said oh! my dear, I am hurt very much;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130116"></xptr> and he did not tell her till she got him his hat, and went with him to the watch-house to give a charge.</p>
               <p>Court. During his illness, where did he complain chiefly of the pain and illness? - The apothecary ordered him to be bathed with oil; he kept saying to me, I do not mind you being my mother; I do not like a stranger to bathe me; I beg you will bathe me lower, and lower; there was his pain.</p>
               <p>Did he complain that his pain was in his private parts? - Yes, more than any where else, and when he was dead the mortification took place.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and two others came in about twelve in the night, on Monday the 27th instant, I think it was; they asked at the door for me; Mrs. Delew opened the door; she came into the parlour, and told me there were three persons wanted me; I went into the tap-room, and found the prisoner and two others, and they were a little in liquor; I begged of them to be as peaceable as they could, and I asked them to walk into the parlour, and have something to drink; they had a shilling's-worth of punch, and two bottles of wine; a third was called for, and while the landlord was gone for it, the prisoner went to Mrs. Delew, and stroked her down her handkerchief; I begged of him to desist and behave like a man; upon that he quitted her, clapped his two hands on each side my face, and kissed me; I took and knocked him over the table; he immediately returned the blows, and several passed between him and me; after that was over, some altercation took place, between Mrs. Delew and him; several bad words passed, and she slapped his face three or four times; I do not know whether the watch was sent for; and he endeavoured to escape before they came to get out of the house; I stopped him near the door; the deceased came, and insisted he should go to the watch-house, and a scuffle ensued between them at the bottom of the stairs, and several blows passed on each side; with that I interfered, got the prisoner upon the settle, and Mrs. Delew got her husband up and set him on the stairs; we separated them; in the interval the watch came and took him to the watch-house, and charge was given to take him to the Compter; he made his escape going to the Compter; I never heard that Mr. Delew was hurt till the next morning; I saw the deceased the same morning between five and six, in his bedroom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you been long at Mr. Delew's? - No Sir, the Change chimes were going twelve as I crossed Cornhill; I was asked on account of Mrs. Delew's birth-day; Mr. Delew was in liquor; he was a lusty corpulent man, a very stout able man; I have worked in the shop with the prisoner, five or six years; I have observed him very much adicted to women.</p>
               <p>You never had an idea of his kissing you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Is he an ill-natured cruel sort of a fellow, or a good humour'd fellow? - He is the best humoured fellow I ever came nigh; when he was sober, there was hardly a possibility to rouse him; I have known people angry sometimes to see him put up with so much; not a man of a cruel revengeful temper; Mr. Delew was very angry at his behaviour to his wife; Mr. Delew dragged him to the foot of the stairs; I do not recollect any expression; I separated them as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>How many blows might they have given to each other? - I saw Mr. Delew give him one or two on the side; which I think he rather cried out at, and there was a severe struggle; I cannot say which had the best of it; I had no idea this man was mortally injured till four in the morning; I do not recollect whether I saw Mr. Delew at the watch-house, but I remember seeing her; I have no recollection of any drink.</p>
               <p>You was close to them when they were striking in the passage? - I was.</p>
               <p>If this young man had repeatedly kicked</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130117"></xptr>Delew in an improper manner, must not you have seen it? - I think I must.</p>
               <p>Did he kick him at all that you know of? - He did not indeed that I know of, I did not hear any such complaint in the house, nor till I heard it in the watch-house; I stopped him in the passage, he then seemed to be desirous of going.</p>
               <p>What was the charge made against him at the watch-house? - For ill treating, and ill using Mr. and Mrs. Delew; he went to his work the next morning, and after that, came and surrendered himself to the constable; I was present; the constable told him he was not his prisoner then, without he chose to surrender; he said he was willing to go before a magistrate; the deceased being a very good man, he said no, if he will only acknowledge himself in a fault and come down a bit of something, I will forgive him; at that time I had no idea of its being a serious injury.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you quite sober yourself this evening? - I was strictly sober, as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Then you had an opportunity of observing all that passed distinctly? - I had; Mr. Delew had been drinking.</p>
               <p>All that you saw was a scuffle? - I saw no other to the best of my knowledge; I was the nearest person to them.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Delew present at any part of the scuffle? - Not till she came to separate them.</p>

               <p>You attended Mr. Delew I understand, the whole time? - Yes, from the Tuesday morning; he died on the Friday morning following, ten minutes before five.</p>
               <p>How soon before he died, did you hear him say any thing about this transaction? - I suppose about an hour.</p>
               <p>Was he in his senses at that time? - I think he was.</p>
               <p>Was not he in the agonies of death and senseless? can you venture to say that he was quite sensible? - Yes, Sir, he was, he called me three times by my name; I went to him; he says,

            , do you know where Doctor Thompson lives; I said yes, I went to fetch him, and he called me back, and asked me if I particularly knew where it was; I believe I gave the medicine to Mrs. Cox; he begged for it; she put it into his cup, and gave it him; he drank it as hearty as ever he could, and laid down his head for four minutes; then he called to be lifted up, I lifted him, and he asked for the pot to puke in; Mrs. Cox gave it him, and as soon as ever he had done puking, he said, oh, that villain! and he laid down his head on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130118"></xptr> shoulder, and died immediately; the last conversation I had with him, was on the Friday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did he suppose himself in a dying state then? - I did not suppose it then.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Wallbrook; I attended Mr. Delew; I saw him first on Tuesday evening, the 28th of November; I attended him to the day before he died; I saw him on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court. What was his complaint? - When I first saw him, he told me he had a kick in the belly, and that he had great pain; he had with this a very considerable fever, and in consequence of the remedies that were ordered, the next morning he was considerably easier; during that day he was very sick, and on the Thursday, the sickness increased, and his pain also returned to a greater degree of pain, and the sickness continued during the latter part of Wednesday, and the whole of Thursday; on Thursday afternoon I dined out of town; the fever and the sickness were both very violent in the evening of Thursday; they sent to the apothecary; I saw him no more after; on Friday evening at six o'clock he died.</p>


               <p>Did you examine the body? - Yes, the bowels were very highly inflamed, and the caul that lays before them, and in some parts there were small livid spots, the first stage of a mortification; the inflammation of his bowels was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was an incipient mortification? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From what that proceeded you do not affect to know? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Was he very corpulent? - He was.</p>
               <p>You would not have been at all surprized if he had died of a mortification in his bowels? - Not at all; we are all liable to that, particularly corpulent men who live free; he told me his pain was in his belly; he told me before he had been kicked in the belly; he shewed me; he put his hand on his belly; his private parts were not hurt, nor did he complain of them to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any mortification in the scrotum? - There was no blow on the scrotum.</p>
               <p>Did you order fomentation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the whole, can you from the view of the body, both before and since his death, form any probable judgment, whether the inflammation was occasioned by external violence or not? - A blow is a very common cause of an inflammation, especially in persons of his habit of body; a man who has drank very much, is more liable to mortifications from external injury.</p>
               <p>Was there any rupture? - There was none, that was the most probable cause of all the symptoms, but there was not the smallest disposition to it; I examined and found none.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As far as the prisoner's character for humanity can be proved, I have a number of people.</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be necessary after the evidence of Trott, and the character he gave him.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have had the misfortune of being the cause of this unfortunate man's death, and your conduct has been far from blameless; though you certainly did not intend what ensued, it is proper you should abide the consequences of what has happened. You, without any other apology, but that of being in liquor, insulted and ill treated his wife, and the violence that you used was the cause of his death. I am satisfied it was not the result of a malicious disposition; and I think it right also to say, that the aggravating circumstances that were given in evidence by one of the witnesses, Mrs. Cox, will not make any addition to your punishment; but if that circumstance had been fully proved, I should have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130119"></xptr> thought it a manslaughter of the most aggravated kind; as the rest of the evidence against you has authorised the Court to lay that circumstance out of the question, of course the rigour of your punishment is considerably mitigated; therefore, the sentence of the Court is, that you be <rs id="t17861213-107-punish539" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. She was going away on Saturday, the 6th of June, Mrs. Machdougal had given her warning to be gone in a week, she was going away that night, and would not stay the week, and I was sent for; when I came back, a coach was at the door to take her things away; I went up to the room that she slept in, and there were two tablecloths and some other things lying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then tell you of the table-cloths? - A. She did, and said there were other things pawned there.</p>

               <p>Q. You took six pounds, then, upon condition that you would not prosecute her? - A. My wife took it.</p>
               <p>Q. In your presence? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have got the six pounds, have you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And have had it ever since? - A. Yes.</p>

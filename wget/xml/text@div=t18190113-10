            . I am an officer. I was informed of the robbery - the shoes were described to me. On the 28th of December I was passing a pawnbroker's shop in Houndsditch, was called in, and found the prisoner, Taft, pledging one pair, which corresponded with the description I had received. I asked how she came by them? She said she had robbed her master, Mr. Abrahams of Camomile-street, who is the male prisoner, she said her master had more. I went there, found him in the counting-house, and asked if he had lost any shoes? He said he had got shoes, but did not know that he had lost any - there was a quantity in the counting-house, which corresponded with the others. I told him he must excuse me, but the property was stolen. He said I must be mistaken; I said they corresponded with the description I had received. He said he knew the gentleman whom he had them of very well. I told him he had only got to prove that before a magistrate, and all would be right. Both the prisoners told me who brought them - they agreed in the account. I went to the man's house, and found he had left. I found 123 pair of shoes in Abraham's house - I found no trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. No man could conduct himself better than he did - A. No - he said he bought them fairly, he told me the man's name. I cannot had the man nor another suspected of the robbery - the shoes laid openly in his counting-house.</p>

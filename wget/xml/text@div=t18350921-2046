                  </hi>. I am a hosier. On the 29th of August, I was in my back-parlour, adjoining my shop—about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in a back part of the shop, trying on a pair of my best 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. gloves—after I had my supper, which was not more than five or seven minutes, I went into the shop—he seemed confused—I said, "John, have you sold any gloves?—he said, "Yes, he had"—I said, when I had locked up the shop, John, have you had any gloves out of the shop for you own use?"—he said, "No, I have not"—: Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes"—I had six or eight months before cautioned him against taking any thing out of the shop—he said he had the liberty of</p>

               <p>taking any thing from his last place—I said if he did so with me, he had lost his situation—on the Sunday morning, I found a pair in his coat-pocket, which excited some suspicion; and on that evening, I had the officer ready when he came home—he came in without any gloves on, which was con<lb></lb>trary to his usual rule—the officer came in immediately after him—he said, "Jhon, I want to see what gloves you have"—the first thing he lock out of his pocket were these gloves, which are mine—he was searched, and on him was found a watch-guard, broken in two or three pieces, which he acknowledged he had taken on the Friday week previous, and broken it, by playing with the servant-girl, which he had no business to do—It is like mine—In his box was found this shirt-front, which he said he purchased of me three or four weeks ago, which he never did—It has not been worn above once, as it is merely tumbled—the mark is not washed out—on the Monday he went before the Magistrate, and was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my son. I called on Mr. Harding for his things—he said he was quite willing to give them up: and as for the shirt-front, he could not say whether it had been paid for or not: and in regard to character, he would not make it worse than he could help, but if they asked whether he was honest, he-could not say that he was—he had been to Worship-street, but was discharged, and the prosecutor went last night, and got a warrant, and brought him here—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wages coming to him, and he summoned him for it; that has made him more spiteful against him.</p>

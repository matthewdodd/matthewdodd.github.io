               <p>Q. Where was your watch, in your pocket, or your fob? - In my pocket; and upon my stopping the watch in my hand, the chain broke. I put my right hand out and catched the prisoner, and catched part of the chain in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160203"></xptr>Q. In which hand had he it? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he facing you? - No, he was on my right-hand side, nearly opposite me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people about you? - Yes, a good many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him? - Yes; and directly called for the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key and seal remaining on the chain? - Yes; the Bow-street officers took it from him; Croker took the chain. They were delivered to me next morning at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him after you had taken him? - No, I did not loose his hand till the officers came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these things? - Not worth more than one shilling and nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your watch? - I had occasion to take the watch out about a quarter of an hour before, and from that time I had the chain in the slap of my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a great crowd about you, was this a public day? - Yes, it was the night of the marriage of the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>CROKER sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Bow-street; I was present at the time the last witness was robbed; I heard that there was a person had picked a gentleman's pocket; I took him into custody, and took him to the public house. I see nothing of the robbery, only the prosecutor charged this man with robbing him. He said, that he had attempted to rob him, and produced a part of a chain, which, he said, he felt him draw from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What public house did you take the prisoner into? - I believe it is the Star and Garter, Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor give you the chain? - Yes, he told me that was part of the chain he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, we were together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you? - The key and seal, and part of the chain of his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - I asked him for his address, and he refused to give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell me about his address, tell me what he said? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the address? - He would not give me his address till we took him before the magistrate, I then took him into custody, and part of the chain, with the key and seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he examined? - At Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you deliver the chain to him again? - I did at Bow-street; he said that was his property.</p>
               <p>-BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about this than Croker? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken out? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the chain in the prisoner's hand? - No. (The prosecutor produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is on the seal? - A snipe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lived upwards of thirty years in this kingdom, and never did any thing that was bad before; the night of the robbery for which I am in custody, I came down Pall-mall; there was a great crowd; I endeavoured to get the other side; I could not, there were so many people. I attempted to go towards Westminster, pressing through the crowd. I fell at the curbstone of the pavement; a coach came by while I was down; I endeavoured to raise myself up, and I catched hold of any thing to save myself; whether I laid hold of that gentleman's chain I know not. I am confident that the prosecutor speaks the best he can, and I am also confident,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160204"></xptr>that I never intended to rob him; and there were several hundred people near when this gentleman took hold of me, and called for the constable, and took me to the watch-house. I am in circumstances very unfortunate; I was committed for re-examination as yesterday, and yesterday morning the turnkey of Tothill fields, where I was, asked me if I knew there was an indictment found against me? he said there was, the bill was found against me last Friday. I had made my wife believe, and my friends, that I should not be tried till next session, of consequence I am unprepared. I was only brought here yesterday; none of my friends know where I am, except, only at two o'clock, I sent to my wife. I have a respectable merchant in the city who can come to speak for me to-morrow. This is all I can say; I leave my cause in your hands, my lord, and the honest jury.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Kirby. When was he brought here? - Yesterday; the turnkey told me that the man was committed for further examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he brought in? - About eleven o'clock yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prisoner. What countryman are you? - No way.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you perceive this man was falling; was it an accident? - No, he appeared perfectly upright, and in no danger of falling. I was pressed with the crowd in close with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Breaking your chain in this way, did he say any thing to you? - He never opened his lips at all; he did not deny any thing of the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of this kind that he was falling? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He says now he was falling? - And so he said at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not fell. I was perfectly upright, but I was afraid of falling. I was pushed off from the curb-stone; I was fearful of the coach going over me, and I endeavoured to save myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were there any coach near him? - No, there was a rank of coaches standing perfectly still.</p>

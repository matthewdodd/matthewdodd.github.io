            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 11th October, I measured out forty-nine yards of sand from the barge. Shepherd was one of the carmen, who was to take it to Pimlico. I met Godlicut next day, and from what she said, I went to the gates on the New-way - that is not Hill's premises. I saw marks of sand on the outside of the gate, and brought a sample away, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230053"></xptr>got one from the bulk, which I produce. Hill lives close by the premises. I saw the marks of sand on his steps; it was shot close to the steps, where it had been been carried into the house. I saw Hill, and asked where he had the sand from the day before; he made no answer; I said I was afraid he had been doing wrong, and that the prosecutor had lost sand. He turned pale and gave me no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is he not a plasterer - A. Yes, and uses sand. I dare say a great deal of sand passes his door every day. I do not swear the samples are alike.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Shepherd on the night of the 14th. Mr. Want asked how he could be guilty of robbing him of the sand; he said he had done it, but would pay for it, but his wages had been stopped, and he took this in lieu of them, and shot it out in Broadway. I took Hill; Mr. Want charged him with receiving it; he said two loads of sand had been left there, but he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I was at the public-house by the office when Pace brought Shepherd there; Want asked how many loads he had taken; he said he took two on Friday, and one on Saturday, to Hill's, in New-way; but had made no agreement with Hill, what he was to have for it. At the examination, the Magistrate asked how it was taken into Hill's premises; Want said it was wheeled in; Hill said,</p>
               <p>"Don't tell lies, it was basketed in."</p>
               <p>SHEPHERD'S Defence. I know nothing of it, but my wages were stopped. Mr. Want desired me to make away.</p>
               <p>MR. WANT. He was paid on the 5th, but was not paid on Saturday the 12th. I kept his wages back to settle on Monday.</p>

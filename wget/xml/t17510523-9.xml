I came down stairs, the prisoner was eating his supper, I accused him with it, at first he denied it. I told him he had been seen in Shoreditch with such things, then he acknowledged the fact and desir'd I would be merciful. I sent for a proper officer and he was carried to the Compter. After he was lock'd up he desir'd to speak with me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230006"></xptr> then he told me, he sold the snuff-box, buttons, and bowl of the spoon, to one Lloyd, a gold-smith in George-yard, Bishop's gate-street, for 9 s. 6 d. and the day following he went with the other things to Mr. Lloyd and he stop'd them. On the 24th I went with in officer to Mr. Lloyd, who deliver'd these things to me, part of my buckles, tea-tongs, and table-spoon, I can swear they are my property. Although he had bad them so long he did not advertise them. I found a handkerchief at a pawn-broker's by the prisoner's direction pawn'd for 1 s. 6 l. at the Angel in Shoreditch.</p>

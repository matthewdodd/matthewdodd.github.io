                  </hi>. I live in Richmond-street, Lisson-grove. About one o'clock in the morning of the 21st of August, I was coming out of the Crown, at the corner of the Uxbridge-road, and met the prisoner—I said to her, "Will you have a glass of rum?"—she said no, she would rather have the money—we then went down the Uxbridge-road to an<lb></lb>other house—I said, "I will give you sixpence, and will <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and have a glass myself"—I came out, and we went down the road—I felt her hand in my pocket—I had one half-crown and two shillings in my right hand pocket—I said, "If you don't give me that money, I will give you in charge"—she said she had nothing of the sort, only the two pence and six<lb></lb>pence—I got the officer, and she was searched—a half-crown and two sixpences were found on her.</p>

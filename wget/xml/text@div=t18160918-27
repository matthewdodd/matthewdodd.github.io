               <p>MR. JOSEPH EDLMANN. I am agent of the house of Reyer and Schlik. I know the gentleman at the bar. I first became acquainted with him on the 1st or 2nd of July; he came to me, and represented himself to be a countryman of mine, and to have served in the Army, and to have got into some embarrassment on the Continent, and for that reason quitted the Continent; he came to England to look for employment, and was actually in great distress; I relieved him. He was in the habit of coming to my house every day twice or three times. I found him serviceable in his own language. On the 18th of August, which was Sunday, he came to breakfast. After breakfast, he went away; he had not taken leave of me to go any where in particular at that time. He went out. In about half an hour after, I went into the Country. I returned about ten or eleven in the evening. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed the bills in question; they had been in an iron safe in the counting-house; the key of that safe was generally in a wooden case by the side of it. The prisoner at the bar knew where the key was kept; he was frequently in the counting-house, and I have used the key while he has been there sometimes. I had seen the bills on the Saturday during the day; the three amounted altogether to nine hundred and twenty pounds. In consequence of missing them, I called my servant maid; I made some enquiries in my house, which led me to go to Bow-street; ultimately I and Bishop went in a post chaise to Caterbury; we got to Canterbury between two and four in the morning. I first saw him in the room in the Inn at Caterbury, when he was brought in by Bishop. I first identified him, and then Bishop seized him; the bills were found on him; I saw Bishop find them in one of his pockets; those bills Mr. Bishop has.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Edlmann to Canterbury. I overtook the coach at Canterbury; I found the prisoner just going from the Dover coach into the Guildhall tavern; he was alighting from it where they change horses. I secured him from behind for fear of accidents; he had this loaded pistol in one hand, and a dagger in the other. I found another loaded pistol in the pocket of the stage coach. On searching him, I found the three bills in question on him, and a quantity of powder and twelve bal1s.</p>

               <p>Mr. Edlmann. Those are my bills.</p>

            . I live servant with Mr. Edlmann. On Saturday, the 18th of August, I remember the prisoner at the bar breakfasting with my master; he went away about half an hour before my master in the morning. After my master had gone out about an hour or better, the prisoner returned, and said, he wanted a book out of the counting-house; he went into the counting-house, and I went about my domestic concerns; he was in the counting-house in which my master's iron safe was. He was about twenty or twenty-five minutes there. I was up stairs on the first floor, and I heard the door open, and I looked out of the window, and saw him go out with a book in his hand. He was gone about an hour; when he came back, he said, he wished to write a note to Mr. Edlmann, to say, he should not breakfast with him the next morning; but he should see him the next day. When he got a bit of paper and began to write, I of course left the counting-house, and when I came to the door in four or five minutes, he came out, and said, I have finished the note Mrs. Totter, give it to your master with my compliments; then he went away.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, St. Martin's-le-grand, and am a corn-dealer. The prisoner lodged in my house. On Sunday, the 18th of August, he said he should go and fetch a book, and I believe he brought one in; it was similar to that. He said, he had lost the key of it some days, and I was laying on the sofa, and I got up to see if I had a key that would open it, I had not. He said, he should get the key of it the next day. He got up about nine o'clock the next morning, and I believe he was gone before ten; I believe he owed nearly a pound for lodging; he had his trunk away, and he asked my man to get a porter to carry his trunk; he took no final leave.</p>

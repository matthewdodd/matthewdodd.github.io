                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at the Half-Moon and Seven Stars, Rat<lb></lb>cliffe-highway. On 13th May, the prisoners came in together, and went in the tap-room—Costello came out, and called for a pot of beer; he gave me a shilling—I gave him a sixpence and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put the shilling in the till—he went in the tap-room again, and played a tune on his flute—he afterwards came and called for a glass of gin-and-peppermint; he gave me the same sixpence I had given him, and had his change—soon after White came out, and said, "Give me a pot of porter, and give me as good a pot as you gave the other man"—he gave me a shilling—I put it in my mouth, which he did not see—I found it was bad, but being in the bar by myself, I was afraid to say so—I said, "Go in the tap-room, and I will give you your change in a minute"—he went in and came out again, and said, "Give me my change"—I said the shilling was bad—he went to get a sixpence to pay, and while he was gone I went to the till, and found the shilling there was bad—there was no other shilling there—Costello came out of the tap-room, and I said it was a bad shilling he gave me—he said I was a liar, and he cared not for any Magistrate, or anybody; they could not hurt him as he had no more money—I kept the shilling in my hand, seized White, and said, "I will give you into custody"—I called to a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> on the rank to get an officer.</p>

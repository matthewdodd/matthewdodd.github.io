                  </hi>. I am servant to Elizabeth Goodhugh—she keeps an eating-house, in Oxford-street. On the 7th of April, the prisoner came there—I do not recollect that I had seen her above once before—she had something to eat, and left about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock—we did not miss any thing then, but a few minutes before one o'clock, as we were going up-stairs to bed, a policeman came, and asked if we missed any thing—we then missed the table-cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer. A little before one o'clock I was in Guildford-street—I heard a cry of "Police" from a female—I ran in the direction of the voice, and met a gentleman running—I stopped him—the prisoner came up and stopped him—she said, "I will give him in charge, he has knocked me down"—I said, "What for?"—she said that he went into Pump-yard with her, and gave her a shilling, and he knocked her down—I said, "I did not see the assault, and I shall not take him; go about your business"—she still stood there—I took hold of her arm, and again said, "Go away"—I then saw she had this table-cloth; and as I had heard from a waiter at eleven o'clock that he had lost one, and seeing mustard on this, I thought it might be the one—I took her to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's, and asked if they had lost a table-cloth—they said, "No"—I showed it them, and they said it was theirs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Though the prisoner accused the man of assault<lb></lb>ing her, you let him go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he admitted that he knocked her down, because she wanted to extort another shilling from him.</p>
               <p>(Frederick Brellard, a cabinet-maker, No. 19, Ryder's-court; and Will<lb></lb>liam Hart, an ostler, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

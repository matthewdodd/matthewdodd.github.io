               <p>Q. On the 25th of October had you a pocket-book - A. I had, it is a bankers book, it contained a check for an hundred pounds upon Marsh, Sibils, and company. I was going with it to their house in Berner-street, Oxford-street. a little after eleven in the middle of the day. When I got into <placeName id="t18111204-46-crimeloc257">Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18111204-46-crimeloc257" type="placeName" value="Oxford-street"></interp>

As it was necessary for me to pass through the crowd I was very particular of securing my book and buttoning my coat pocket; when I entered the crowd I held my hand for the purpose of securing the book, I had not been in the crowd two minutes before I found myself very much hustled, then I found it necessary that I should use both my hands to get forward, and when I pressed with my hands I perceived I had lost my book, and I am very sure it was not more than a minute before I put my hands down again, I found my pocket lighter and missed the book; I turned round to see who it was pressing behind, I then saw the prisoner with his back turned towards me making from me, and at this instant at my turning round a man that was arm in arm with another man, he pushed me before for the prisoner to escape behind, because I stood they said, d - n you, what do you stand here for, and pushed me violently before them; he then caught hold of another man directly before me, and the prisoner was behind them, the third man was arm in arm between me and the prisoner. At the instant one of these fellows laid hold of the man of the left side I turned round and laid hold of Wood by his shoulder, be then let his left hand man go, and was more violent in cursing me, endeavouring to make me let Wood go. As he was so upon my seizing Wood I was more positive of Wood being the man that had my property; I then called out,</p>
               <p>"hold him, a pick pocket, to the crowd around; I succeeded in getting through them. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040034"></xptr>followed Wood through the crowd at the distance of half a dozen people; the crowd pressed very hard in consequence of my calling out, and Wood could not escape very fast. I then catched hold of him by the collar the second time over two persons heads. It was their breaking my hold the first time that strengthened me that he was the man. I dragged myself up to him, and he pressed forward dragging me after him. I then held him with both my hands, and came before him and accused him of the robbery, he very strongly denied it, and used abusive language, presented the end of his finger and said, I am a <rs id="t18111204-46-deflabel258" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

I told him I did not care what he was, I was very certain he had robbed me, I would not let him go. While he was amusing me with his left hand I saw the pocket book fall as if from him; I did not see it in his hand; his right hand was by the side of him; when the pocket book fell as if from him at the same time he began to struggle, and as I saw the book down I let him go in order to secure the book; he was ultimately secured. I only lost sight of him while I picked up the book, he was working away from those that held him through the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man that you followed through the crowd, and from whom you saw the pocket-book fall - A. Most certain; he was damning the people and saying d - n any man that touches me; I went forward and seized him. This is the book and the warrant. I had not received the money, I was going to receive it. The pocket book and warrant belonged to Mr. Phildes. (The warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was quite a stranger to you before - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for you to be so accurate to his person - A. I never let him go out of my sight. I never saw his face untill the second time I seized him, and I saw the book come from his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be dropped by somebody else - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>- PRESTON. I am a patrol of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Wood - A. Yes, I assisted in apprehending of him, he was trying to rescue himself from every body. I knew him in the crowd; I have been in the habit of seeing him with other characters about town. I have no doubt of his person.</p>

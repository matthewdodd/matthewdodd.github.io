                  </hi>. I keep the Flying Horse, at Hackney. On 22nd Nov. the prisoner Ward came there—he asked for a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a florin—I saw it was bad, and told him so—he told me to take half the beer back, and he gave me a penny—I bent the florin double, and kept it—when Ward went out I followed him, and watched him—he joined Pratt about 200 yards from my house—Pratt was walking on, and stopping occasionally, and Ward overtook him-—they walked on towards the Downs—they went together to within about ten yards of the Weavers' Arms, and there they stopped—they had been joined by a third party, but one was not taken—they were all three together when they got near the Weavers' Arms—they then separated; the other two went towards Kingsland-road, and Pratt went into the Weavers' Arms—I followed him in, and heard him dealing for a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco, and Mrs. Collis, the landlady, had got a florin—I took it out of her hand, and it was bad—Mr. Collis took possession of it, and Pratt was detained.</p>

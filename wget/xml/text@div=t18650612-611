                  </hi>. I am an artist, at Percy Street, Bedford Square—on 12th May, I was walking with Miss McClachlan in some fields near the Finchley Road—the two prisoners suddenly accosted us, and accused us of trespassing—I told them that we were not—Brown then went on with Miss McClachlan, and I followed across the corner of the field with Street: after getting some distance he said, "I am a poor man, and a little money will be acceptable to me, if you will give me a trifle I will say no more about it, but let you both return on the road"—I gave him about six shillings—Brown was some little distance off, with the lady; he took her over a stile, which separated us, but in a couple of minutes Street ran after her and went across the stile—she then returned to the corner of the stile with Brown—in a minute or two, Street returned to me with Brown, and told me to keep off the grass—when I got on the footpath Street was behind me and seized me suddenly by the throat, threw me down with violence, and Brown rifled my pockets of everything I possessed—he took my watch, chain, pin, purse, hat, and umbrella, a half-sovereign and some silver—they ran away, and by the time I had sufficiently recovered to see after them, they were out of sight—on the Monday following, I was with two policemen in the Regent's Park—saw the two prisoners together and gave them into custody.</p>

               <p>saw two boys in the fields five or six minutes before the prisoners came up, and a lady and gentleman passed just before the robbery, but they were out of sight then—it was getting dark at the time the robbery took place—I was with the prisoners twenty minutes—it was almost dark when the lady and gentleman passed—we were full half a mile from the high road in one direction and two or three large fields in the other—I gave the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the lady and gentleman passed—I did not know that I was trespassing, I thought they made use of that as a threat—I thought it would not be the slightest use to tell the lady and gentleman, because when they had gone I should still be in the prisoners' power, and they would be more than a match for me—Miss McClachlan was with Brown when the lady and gentleman passed, she was out of my sight at that time, and I do not think she could have seen them—I did not cry for assistance, it was impossible, as I was suffocated—I went to the Britannia Tavern and sought for assistance—it was then about a quarter-past 9—I went to a policeman, and then went to different taverns to look for the prisoners—it might then have been between 11 and 12 o'clock—we walked a long distance towards Hampstead for a policeman—I described the prisoners at the station—I said that Brown was about 5 feet 9 inches, that they both wore caps and walking coats; their clothes were neither dark nor light, but a grayish colour, rather darkish than light—I had an appointment with the inspector to search for the prisoners—I was not with him when I saw them in the Regent's-park—I was only examined once at the police-court—I was brought up there twice—the lady was not present at the first remand—I knew the road she lived in, but did not know where she resided—I believe she went to the police-court on her own accord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at York-place, St. John's Wood—on Friday evening, 12th May, I was with Mr. Har Wood—I saw the prisoners—I am sure they are the men—Street came tip first and said, "You are trespassing"—Mr. Harwood I think said, "No we are not"—the prisoners said that they were put there to prevent trespassing—Street took us both round the fields, and when he came to the stile he said that I might go—I refused to go, and kept with Mr. Harwood—we went back, and when Street found that I would not leave, he called Mr. Harwood back and left me with Brown—I went on with Brown, and then said that I wished to speak to my friend—Brown said that I could not—I said that I should, and I turned back and followed Street—Brown told me that they had turned to the right, and I turned to the right, but did not see them; I then turned, and saw the three standing together, but I did not see what happened—Street crossed to me and told me to be off, saying that I was to think my<lb></lb>self lucky to get off without being locked up—I told him he had changed his tone, and pretended that he was Irish, but it was too late to do that as I could swear to them both, and that I should go into the road and find the first man I could and bring him—they then threatened to tie my hands and feet, and said, "You want keeping quiet"—I ran off, and found that Street had not followed me—I turned back again, but when I got to the stile I could not see any of them—I tried to jump across a ditch, but slipped into it, and then saw the two men running away alone, they had left Mr. Harwood—one of them said, "If we see her, we must keep her quiet, or else we must tap her and keep her quiet"—I was then in the ditch, they crossed the stile, and directly they had crossed I got into the field again, and found Mr. Harwood there—he had just risen from the ground, and had no hat or watch—I had seen his watch before that—I saw</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see them in the dock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before they got into the dock: I was not aware that they were prisoners, the police were behind them—I had seen Mr. Harwood on the Monday, and he told me they were taken into custody—I was not before the Magistrate at the first examination—Mr. Harwood did not give my address, he probably did not know it—we walked up to Finchley-road from the Eyre Arms, we started at a few minutes past 8—the robbery took place about a mile from the Eyre Arms—I saw two boys in the field, and a lady and gentleman had crossed just before; they came quite close to us both—I did not speak to them—I crossed the stile directly after them—the prisoners were not with us then, they came up three or four minutes afterwards—I did not see the prosecutor give them any money—I did not resist, because Street said in a lowish tone, "Go alone, it is entirely for your own good"—when we got into the next field he said, "You shall go one way, and your friend the other, I cannot let you go together, for our superintendents are watching us"—when the prisoners came up we were walking arm in arm—I had no chain on—I did not lose anything—I did not scream—I did not become frightened till I was in the ditch and the men said that the would "tap "me—the prisoners were dressed as they are now, I think, except that Street had on a black or darkish tie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which of them had a hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, but I think it was Street; yes, I am sure now—I am quite sure Brown did not wear a hat—Street had a hat and Brown a hilly-cock—it was Brown that paid me parti<lb></lb>cular attention—I cannot say whether he had a necktie, as his waistcoat was buttoned up—from the time I met Mr. Harwood to the time I was out in the road again was, I should imagine, half an hour—when the men passed over the ditch I was as near to them as I am now, but they did not see me, it was dark—at the station I left the prosecutor, and went home.</p>

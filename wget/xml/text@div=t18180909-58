On the 5th of June, the prisoner came into my house about twelve o'clock in the morning, and had a quartern of gin, which came to four-pence. She tendered me a 1l. bank note; I took it. Mr. Lewis who was sitting near me, told me to be cautious as I had only been in the house three days; he requested to look at the note, which he did, and said it was a bad one - She heard it. She had a child in her arms. I asked her by what means she got the note? she said a man at the corner, had given her the bottle, and the note to get changed. I, Lewis, and the prisoner all went out to look for him - She led us to the corner, which was twenty or thirty yards off - We saw no one there. She said she did not know the man. We told her we must detain her - She said she hoped we would not, for we might keep the note if we liked. I went for a constable. Lewis had the note; he did not return it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was it from the time she came until she went out - A. The whole did not last above ten minutes-it took up no more time than merely helping her to the gin and giving change, which would not take a minute. I detained her long enough to alarm a person who was waiting outside.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How long was she in the house before you went to look for the man - A. Not more than five or six minutes.</p>

On the 5th of June I was at Terry's house, saw the prisoner come in with a bottle for some gin, and tender a 1l. note. Mr. Terry handed it to me; I looked at it, and immediately said, in her hearing, it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how she came by it - A. Terry asked her. She said a man gave her the bottle and note at the corner of the street to get some gin-he was a stranger. We all three went out to look for him. We went to the corner but found no person there - She said he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time what was done with the note. - A. I put it in my breeches-pocket, and held it in my hand. The prisoner requested me to let her go, and seemed a great deal agitated - I took her into custody. While Terry was gone for an officer a crowd came round. I walked through Hoxton with her, put her into a coach, and took her to the office. I asked her in the coach what her real name was? she said it was

When I got to Worship-street I gave the note into the hands of Mr. Yardley, the clerk of the office. I took it from him again before he left my presence, and took it to the Investigator's Office at the Bank, and put my name on it before I parted with it-(looking at it)-this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make inquiry at John's-row - A. The day after she was taken, I went and made a diligent inquiry in John's-row. I found two houses of No. 5 - I inquired at both of them, and all the houses of that number in the neighbourhood, leading from John's-row, but could hear no account of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Where did she give her address - A. Turner asked her address at Worship-street - I took down what she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say it was Little West-place, John's-row - A. She did not; two persons attended at her third examination, by her desire. I do not remember Westplace, John's-row. I went to all the streets about there.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BISHOP. I live at No. 5, John's-row, in the parish of St. Luke. I have lived there fifteen years. The prisoner never lived there. I never had any lodgers.</p>

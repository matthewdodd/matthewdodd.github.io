            . I am a constable. On the 22d of December, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Bullock came to me, and said he had a lot of old pipe to sell - I told him to bring it, and in about half an hour Pearce came and brought it - I thought it was not right, and I went to a fireman, and told him to look into the engine-house; he did so, and missed a roll of pipe, and a piece of brass to it - I said I had stopped Pearce on suspicion - Pearce said Bullock had employed him to sell it, and he was to have 1s. - another officer took Bullock - Bullock said he thought I bought things on the cross, and that made him bring it to me. I am a boot and shoemaker.</p>

            . I am in the service of Robert Ware, an engine-master. On Friday morning, the 21st of December, the pipes were all right in the engine-house of St. Dunstan in the West, and on the 22d, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a roll of pipe - the lock of the engine-house had been forced off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Q. What makes you think this is the pipe you lost? A. It has five tongues to it, which no other of our pipes had, and here are thirty-five feet which is just the length of the piece lost.</p>

            . I am keeper of St. Dunstan's engine-house. The engine belongs to the parish - I believe this pipe to have been taken from there. I have seen it many times.</p>
               <p>PEARCE's Defence. I went down Petticoat-lane, to buy some old shoes, and translate them - I met a man with this piece of pipe, and another small piece - I bought this large piece of him for 10s. I went along Long-lane, the next day, where I met Bullock, who asked if I had any shoes. (I had once sold him a pair) - I said I had not; as I had bought this pipe, he said he thought he could tell me of a man who would buy it; he went to Vincent's, and came and told me he would buy it - I went there, and he was not at home - I waited for him, and when he came in, I said, "I have brought the leather the young man spoke to you about."</p>
               <p>BULLOCK's Defence. I met this young man - I asked him if he had a pair of shoes; he said No, he had laid out all his money for this pipe, and asked if I knew a man who would buy it - I said I thought I did - I went to Vincent, who said he would buy it - I told Pearce to take it, and he gave me that small piece to mend the heel of my shoe.</p>
               <p>Pearce received a good character.</p>

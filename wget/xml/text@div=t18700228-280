                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi> 6). On Saturday afternoon, February 5, about 4.30, I was on duty in St. Martin's Lane, with Inspector Harnett, and saw the prisoner and two others standing outside a public-house at the corner of West Street—I have known Cook for two years—they went into the public-house, and I crossed the road and followed them in, leaving Harnett outside; he was in uniform—I found another police sergeant in the public-house, and saw Cook there—I went out again, and fetched Harnett in—Cook then came to the bar, and I pointed him out to Harnett, and mentioned his name—we went to the bar, and the prisoner said that his name was Cook—something was said which I did not hear, and we than left—Cook came out shortly afterwards, and I stopped him, and said "Cook, I believe you have something in your possession which you have no business to have"—he made no reply—I said "I shall see what you have about you," and in a small breast-pocket I found a gold watch in a leather case—I took it out very carefully, using no violence; it is just as it was—I said, "Inspector Harnett, take this gold watch; you see it has no bow on it"—Cook said, "No, you have broken it off," which I certainly had not done—I said "You will have to account for its possession"—he said, "I have purchased it this day at Debenham &amp; Storr's, for which I can show a receipt"—he had a diamond ring on his finger, which I have here—I took him in custody to Bow Street station—on arriving there I missed the diamond ring from his finger—I searched him, and tried to find it, but could not asked him what he had done with it—I then heard a noise in his throat, and said, "You are endeavouring to swallow that ring," and took hold of him, took it from his mouth, and handed it to the inspector—he said that he had purhcased it at the same time as the watch, at Debenham's.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 58, High Holborn—on Sunday evening, 30th January, I went with a friend who was going to Ireland, to Euston Square, to his hotel, and on returning through Bedford Street about 11.30 I felt a blow on the back of my head, and another on my eye, at the same moment—I fell, and felt my watch being taken from me—I just vaguely remember catching hold of the long chain—when I got up I missed my watch and chain—I gave information at the station next morning, and a constable called on me and I gave him a description of the watch and two numbers on it—this is my watch, I have had it three or four years, the number on the outer case is 3530—it was given to me by Mr. Reynolds, the city marshal of Dublin—I have not the slightest doubt about it—it is made by Dobbin, of Dublin—the name on it now is James McCabe, Royal Exchange, London—I can see that it has been filed since I lost it—1976 was the number of the works, but the 7 has been turned into 9, and the 9 into 7—the number on the outer case remains the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watch-maker, of 55, Berwick Street, one door from Oxford Street—this watch was brought in my absence, it had a bow on then—I put a glass in, and the prisoner called for it on Saturday afternoon, 5th February, between 3 and 4 o'clock—when I delivered it to him it had a bow on it.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you open it and look at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did not see that it had been filed, the outer edge often projects, the unskilfulness of the workman will do that—that did not strike me—the glasses of hunting watches are often broken on account of this opening at the rim—there was a little piece of dirt in it and it had had a Call—I have seen some of McCabe's watches—I have been in the trade thirty years—I cannot say that it is McCabe's make—I do not keep a book—I knew Cook before as a customer, to have a similar job done and perhaps half a dozen; brooches, pins, and watches.</p>

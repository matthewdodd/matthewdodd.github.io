On the 31st of October, about six o'clock in the morning, I lost ten fatted pigs out of my sty. Some of them were fatted barrow pigs, and some sows. They were safe the night before. I traced the footsteps of two men from the sty into the road, and the marks of the pigs' feet in a direction towards London. I found them at Mill-hill. They were half fat, and I should have thought it hardly possible for them to have been driven that distance in so short a time. The prisoner said he had them from Housely, of Becclesway. I could find nosuch person.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 21st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man driving ten pigs. They passed me by Mill-hill, which is about ten miles from town. I walked by the side of them. I afterwards went on towards Hampstead, and saw them again about ten o'clock. The other man was then gone. I asked the prisoner to drink with me, which he did. I collared him, and said I suspected the pigs were stolen. I took him into a back room, and wrote down what he said. - (Reads.)"He said he bought them of Mr. Housely, of Becclesway, for 22l. 10s., on the 14th of October. That his name was Field, of Blackfriars'-road." I found a dead fowl and a knife in his pocket. The pigs were very much fatigued; they could not stand on their legs for two days.</p>

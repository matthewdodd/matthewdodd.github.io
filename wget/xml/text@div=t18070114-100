I told the prisoner I had missed them, he said it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140070"></xptr> great pity, and he wondered very much how it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these things. - A. I missed them sometime before he left me. In November I went to his house. in East Smithfield; I found the property there, he was not at home when I went in, and we did not begin to search till he came in; and then he said we should find some feathers, and that would be all. He said the parasol he had found in the shop. I said Bell you and I have always had a good understanding, till you went away in the manner you did; how is it you have these things; he said he took them for his own security, he said he had offered the feathers for sale, and could only get a guinea for them, or else he would have sold them. Then we went to Marlborough street. When he was with me he was to have fifteen shillings a week and his wife was to have fourteen shillings a week, during the exhibition.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. This man came to your service in January, and staid with you till April or May; were you at home all this time. - A. No, I was a good deal out.</p>
               <p>Q. For pleasure or business. - A. Only on my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where might you have been at these times. - A. In Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in Surry. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By the bridge. - A. I was in the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated you went to Marlborough street. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the first time you was there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character have you always appeared there, as prosecutor; do not hesitate Mr. Brookes, did you always appear there as a prosecutor. - A. No, I appeared there in consequence of having a dog, it was a false charge, the gentleman swore to it. I was obliged to give bail to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not satisfied with the magistrate, you were tried at the sessions, and there the magistrates were of the same opinion with the magistrates at Marlborough street. - A. I was convicted of a penalty and I paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man's wife was to have fourteen shillings a week, was it ever paid. - A. I never knew what was due to them, they received money at the exhibition, and paid themselves. I do not believe that I am in debt to them a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never say so. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of May when he left your service, and till the month of November, you never saw him. - A. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first see him. - A. A little time before he was taken into custody; I said Bell I am very glad you are come, for Mr. Richardson charges a bill of twenty pounds which you have paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Was that after he left his lodgings in Rupert street that he called at your house. - A. I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you had been robbed. - A. No, I did not think it right till I knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you send for a constable. - A. I was in great business.</p>
               <p>Court. What was that great business. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had some great business, I insist upon your telling the jury - A. I had some particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that great business that prevented you from sending for a constable; do not you know the obligation of an oath. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. An oath is to swear to the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth; as you have told the jury that you had business so extremely pressing, what was that business so extremely pressing. - 
               <persName id="t18070114-100-person1070">A. </persName>
            Why I was in fear of being arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that prevent you from sending for a constable, I will have an answer to the question, or I will send you to Newgate. - A. I had an execution in the house, I was obliged to attend to it, I can say nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you say you had business to attend to; your goods then was in the hands of the sheriff's officer. - A. I considered that was business of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the business that prevented you from sending for a constable. - A. It was. I was going to get the money that was owing me, and if I had given charge of him I must have gone to Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you from making the charge the second time you saw him. - A. I wish to make up this matter of twenty pound between Mr. Richardson, if I had taken him up I did not conceive he would have come respecting the twenty pounds that he had paid, he went to Mr. Richardson, I was not satisfied with the account that he gave to Mr. Richardson; I immediately after that searched his house, the next day or the day after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You have now spoke to two times of that man coming to your house. - A. I do not think that he came more than three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him up the third time. - A. The third time I think I met him in Cranbourn alley, and the third time he called at my house I was so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. This makes four times you saw him without taking one single step to apprehend him. - A. I cannot state whether it was two or three times.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray, sir, when you met him in Cranbourn alley did you come up to him, or he to you. - A. We met, I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you no remembrance of what he said to you in Cranbourn alley (witness paused), are you dumb or deaf. - A. To the best of my recollection it was about Mr. Richardson's business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about the money you owed his wife. - A. There was nothing passed about money, but Mr. Richardson's business.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you swear that he made no demand either upon account of his own service or his wife's in Cranbourn alley. - A. I cannot say that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to put your credit to the jury, whether this man who is suspected by you of having robbed you, made any demand of money due to him. - A. I cannot recollect; the conversation that passed was only momentary in Cranbourn alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it was momentary you must recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140071"></xptr> what passed. - A. All that I cannot recollect respecting money due to him, says I, Bell this business of Mr. Richardson's must be made up.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr Brookes do not imagine the court to be imposed on in this way; I ask you upon you oath did he in that momentary conversation make any demand of money due to him, aye or no, I ask you again, do you swear that he did or did not demand money at that time. - A. I cannot swear whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You did not turn back to apprehend him. - A. I did not.</p>

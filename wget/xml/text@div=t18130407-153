            . I am a patrol. On the 20th of February, about half past three in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Drury-lane; each of them had a bag. I asked them what they had got; they each answered, grub. I took them to the watch-house, and made them empty their bags. There were three quartern loaves, a leg of mutton roasted and cut, a veal pie, some fresh butter, and some cheese. Roberts said they were coming down Charlotte-place, some boys were before them, and dropped these things, seeing him in a watchman's great coat they ran away. They picked them up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my dish; there is my crest upon it. These things were taken out of a safe. I knew nothing of having lost it. I only know that my servants said they lost it.</p>

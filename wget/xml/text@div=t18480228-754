                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 269.) On Sunday morning, 13th Feb., between one and two o'clock, I was on duty at Enfield-highway, passing Mr. Webb's, and saw the prisoner in the yard—he concealed himself behind the yard door—I asked what he did there—he said he went there to make water; he seemed very confused—I went behind the door and found a can, containing four or five quarts of beer—I asked whose it was—he said it was his—I asked where he got it—he said that was his business—I said if he re<lb></lb>fused to tell me I should take him to the inspector—he said he would be d—d if he left his beer—I got another constable—we found the cellar-flap open, and called Mr. Webb up—on the way to the station, the prisoner said, "If you had gone the other way you would not have seen me; but the other one told me to come this way"—the liquor appeared like beer and porter mixed—there were barrels of beer and porter in the cellar with taps in them.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Gardeners' Arms, Enfield-highway, in the parish of Enfield. The prisoner has been at my house—on Saturday, 12th Feb., I went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock—I fastened the cellar-flap with a wooden bar, let into the brick-work—the cellar is part of my house—after I had been in bed some time, I was awoke by stones being thrown up at the window—I made no answer—I heard two people talking outside—one said, "I will throw once more, and if they don't answer we shall be all right"—I then heard footsteps go towards the cellar-flap—in a few minutes I heard a rumbling noise—I heard nothing more—I was afterwards awoke by the police—great force must have been used to undo the cellar-flap—I had a barrel of beer and a barrel of porter in the cellar—I tasted the liquor found, it was beer and porter mixed.</p>

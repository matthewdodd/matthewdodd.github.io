            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 22d of June, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house in Sharp's-buildings, Aldgate, and saw him - I produced my warrant to search his house; he accompanied me - I went into the cellar a second time with him, and found some boards standing up; I desired them to be removed, and behind them I found pieces of a tea chest cut up; and in the coal cellar I found the remainder of a chest - I said,</p>
               <p>"This appears to be a tea chest, and fresh cut up;" he said he bought it of a man at the door the day before, and had it cut up. He had before this asked me what I came for - I did not tell him then, but when I found this, I said I came to find a chest of tea, and having found the chest, I supposed I should soon find the tea. I then went into the kitchen, and, on opening the door of the water closet, I found the seat wet, which was not so shortly before, as I had been in; I lifted up the lid, and there found the tea on the soil, all loose. I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you say to this? Here is the tea? How did you get it?" He said,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of it." His wife was there, and said it might all have been avoided; he told her to hold her tongue. I have picked out pieces of the chest which had marks on them.</p>

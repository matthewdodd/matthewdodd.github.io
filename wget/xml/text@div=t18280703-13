            . I live in Shoreditch, opposite Mr. Picard, and am a headborough. On the 21st of June I stood at my door, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner go to Mr. Picard's window - he stopped there seven or eight minutes; he went away, and returned again in a minute; he left again in a few minutes; I crossed, looked at the window, and found it cracked in two places; he kept going to the window and returning; I saw Perry and Fryer, and pointed him out to them, as I had business to do.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. The prisoner was pointed out to me: I watched him from four o'clock till half-past nine, during which time he went up to Mr. Picard's window fourteen or fifteen times; I at last saw him go up, turn short round, take something out, and place it a few yards off, near the scraper of the next house; he then returned - I saw him take something from the window, and put it into his hat; I ran across, and took him - he immediately pulled his hat off, and threw this shawl out of it; Fryer came and took it up; I took him to the watch-house, then went to the scraper, and found a piece of glass there, which fitted one part of the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was watching the prisoner - there is a gas-lamp at the next house; I stood in a shop, and saw him go to the window several times, and press his finger, as if to force the glass in: Perry ran across; I ran out, and received the shawl from a stranger, who picked it up; I had seen him go to the scraper.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I walked down Shoreditch twice, waiting for somebody in a pawnbroker's shop; I came back, and as they were gone I ran along; this man came and took me; they went about three yards off, and picked the shawl up.</p>

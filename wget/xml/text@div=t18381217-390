Between seven and eight o'clock on the 25th of October, I was coming along Shoreditch, and met the prisoner at the end of the Hackney-road—she stopped me, and I asked "What do you want?"—she said, to go with me—I said I had no money—she said, "You have a little"—I said I had but 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went behind a house with her, but she jumped up as soon as she got my watch, and away she ran as hard as she could—I could not follow her—I cried "Stop thief," but she was off—I have not seen the watch since—I know she is the person—I was not drunk—I had had some liquor, and cannot say I was sober—I had given her the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

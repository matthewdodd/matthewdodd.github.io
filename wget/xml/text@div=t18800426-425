                  </hi>. I live at 1, Minton Street, Deptford, and am a labourer—the prisoner lodged with me a few weeks—we slept in the same room—I went out with him on Easter Monday, and left him about 9.30 p.m.—some time afterwards I went with a fireman to a public-house in Church Street, Deptford—something was said to me, and I started with my friend to go home—on the way home we met the prisoner coming away from the lodging—I said, "Where are you going?" he said, "I can go where I like," and began abusing the landlady to me—we started an argument, and then I knocked him down—he got up again—we did not fight—I went five or six yards towards home, and then turned back for my hat, and he struck me on my face—I did not see a knife, but blood flowed—I do not remember being struck more than once, but I found several cuts afterwards—I did not fall—he said nothing—I went to a doctor—I had had a glass of liquor, but I was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at 1, Burton Street, Deptford—the prisoner and prosecutor lodged in the house on Easter Monday, and some time after 10 p.m. I met Brown with a comrade in Church Street—I stopped and spoke to them, and we all left together to go home, and met the prisoner about four doors from our house—Brown asked him where he was going, but I do not recollect what he said—I looked round, and they were both quarrelling, but I could not see which struck first—I saw them separated—Brown went towards home, and then turned back for his hat, which was lying between the road and the footpath—they got together again, and Brown called out, "I have been stabbed"—I saw blood running from his face, and his comrade took him home—the prisoner and Brown had both been drinking together in the fore part of the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Deptford—on Easter Monday, about 11.30, I was fetched to 1, Burton Street, Deptford, and found Brown in a state of collapse through loss of blood—he had two severe gashes on the right temple and a gash across the cartilage of the nose, cutting well into the cartilage—the wounds on his temple were long and deep, evidently inflicted by a sharp instrument—a sharp knife would produce them, but not a dagger—they were not stabs, they were gashes,</p>

               <p>lacerated wounds—I afterwards saw blood on the pavement in the street—he is now able to go to work, but he carries the mark of the wound—there was no danger unless erysipelas had set in.</p>

I received information, and took the prisoner entering a public-house—I said, "I shall take you into custody for stabbing a man in Burton Street, Deptford"—he said, "All right; I have stabbed no man"—he had been drinking, but he was sober—I searched him, but found no knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met this man; he assaulted me and knocked me down, and fell on top of me in the street, and it took two of them to separate him from me. After that he came back. I cannot say whether he had come for mere abuse. I had a piece of steel, or patent crinoline spring which I was cleaning my pipe with, and when I saw him returning I struck him with it. I was in a fury of rage and drink. I had no knife. I had to borrow one in the afternoon in the prosecutor's presence. <rs id="t18800426-425-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

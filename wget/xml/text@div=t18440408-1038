                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">cabinet-maker, Tredear-street.</hi> I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner Bottrell about fifteen years—I took a house for him in Frederick-place—he said it would suit him, and asked me to take possession of it as he did not wish his name to appear in the rate-books—I took possession, because the landlord objected to him as a tenant—I went into the house to live, after asking Bottrell two or three times to send in furniture—I told him my reason for that was that I might be safe as to the rent—he sent in some furniture on the 29th of April—I had a necklace and six silver coins in the house belong<lb></lb>ing to my daughter, two coats, and a tea-caddy, a dish-cover, handkerchief, a ring, and some other articles of my own—I saw those articles safe the morning before the house was broken open—I went before the Magistrate,</p>

               <p>as Bottrell summoned me to give the goods up—the Magistrate would make no order, and the next day my house was broken open, and when I came home I missed these articles, and I believe he took other things away—there was an iron bedstead of his without a bottom left behind; also a small linen horse—they were of little value—the Parcel-delivery Company left a small parcel for me two days after, at a baker's near where I live, and a dish-cover which was taken, was sent by a boy—I have not opened the parcel—(<hi rend="italic">the parcel being opened, contained a necklace, silver coins, a purse, a looking-glass, a pair of gloves, some buttons, and a glass</hi>)—these are mine—I have not recovered two coats worth a sovereign, and a tea-caddy, worth a sovereign—the most valuable thing was an account-book, containing an account by which he is a debtor to me—that has not been returned.</p>

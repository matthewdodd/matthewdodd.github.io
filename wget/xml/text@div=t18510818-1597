                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. I was at Newgate-market on the morning of 11th July—I went into the mar<lb></lb>ket, leaving the cart, and a whip and horse-cloth in it—I bought some meat in the market, and gave it to my servant, Clark—in about three-quarters of an hour I went for the cart, and it was gone—the horse and cart are worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the meat 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have since been restored to me by the constable Allen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 321). I was on duty on the morning of 11th July, in St. Paul's Church-yard, and saw the prisoner driving a bone and cart—his appearance not being that of a butcher, I suspected he had stolen it—I stopped him, and asked where he brought it from—he said from Westminster—I asked where he was going to take it to—he said to Waterloo-road—the horse's head was then towards Cheapside. I said that is not the way to Waterloo-road—he said he was going over London-bridge to it—I asked him his master's name—before replying he endeavoured to look over the off-side—I prevented him, and he said, "Well, it is no business of yours? I shall not tell you?" I told him I should take him into custody on suspi<lb></lb>cion of stealing the horse, cart, and meat—he said I might do so if I liked, but I should find it all right—I took it to the station, and then found the owner.</p>

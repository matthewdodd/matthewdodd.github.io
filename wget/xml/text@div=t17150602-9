The Prisoner in his Defence prov'd, That when the Prosecutor was at the Tavern he was very much in Drink, and that he and Mr. Lister drank each of them a Rummer of a Quart and Half pint, in a Health to each other, which Health the Prosecutor would have writ down in his Pocket-Book, and pull'd it out for that purpose, and it was handed round the Company; That after this, the Prosecutor fell from his Chair, and being help'd up again, fell a sleep; in which Condition he was for some time, and then got up and went away; but soon after he came again, and demanded Money he had lost; which the Company did not take much notice of, as believing him a Person uncapable of carrying so much about him. As to the Pocket-Book, he said it was not put up after the Health was writ in it. Then the Prisoner brought several Witnesses, who gave the Prosecutor but an indifferent Character; and a great many of very good Credit to his own Reputation, who said he was a <rs id="t17150602-9-deflabel47" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>

In consequence of what Suffolk said I watched near his stall - the prisoner came up and I asked where he got that beef from - he said a person gave it to him up at the top, to bring for sale, and if I would go with him he would pay me for it; I refused. He then said he brought it from Leadenhall-market, and wished me to let him go. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Suffolk's employ. On the 19th of May, about half-past seven o'clock, this rump and loin of beef were brought to his shop by the prisoner - he said, "This is a bit of beef of mine;" I directly booked it to him; my master was to sell it for him - we have had meat from him before. Gain claimed it in five or ten minutes; I told him who had brought it, and in about ten minutes the prisoner was taken.</p>

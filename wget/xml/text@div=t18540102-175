                  </hi>. I am a lock maker, in Cheapside. On Satur<lb></lb>day evening, 17th Dec., the prisoner came to my shop about 10 minutes past 5 o'clock—I had not known him before—he said he wished for one of our cards, as he had a friend coming from the country who wished to purchase one of our locks—he said he wanted it for his friend, who was coming from the country on Monday—I gave him one, and he left the shop—he returned in five minutes, and asked me to give him Mr. Weston's address—I knew Mr. Weston very well, and I gave him his address, No. 31, Lawrence-lane—he left, and shortly afterwards he returned, and said Mr. Weston was not at home: and he said he had to make up a bill in Walbrook, and he was deficient 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; would I lend him that amount, he being a friend of Mr. Weston's—he did not describe Mr. Weston any further than that he knew him—he did not mention his Christian name—I told him I was convinced Mr. Weston would be at home if he went and knocked loudly, and I made it a rule never to lend strangers any money—he then left, and I saw that he went to our factory, in Lawrence-lane—I saw him speak to our foreman, and he took him to the house of Mr. Weston—I saw him go into Mr. Weston's, and I followed him in—he went up the staircase, and I went to the bottom of the stairs—I heard him and Mr. Weston conversing; I do not know what they said—I know Mr. Weston's voice very well; and when I went up the staircase I saw him speaking—I asked Mr. Weston in the prisoner's presence if he knew that party—Mr. Weston said he never saw him before in his life; and after Mr. Weston had told me what he had said to him, I said I would give him in charge for attempting to obtain money—the prisoner begged for mercy, and said, "Consider my position."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Lawrence-lane. I was at my warehouse on Saturday evening, 17th Dec, at 10 minutes past 5 o'clock—I had been there for the best part of two hours previously—about 10 minutes or a quarter past 5 o'clock the prisoner came—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—that was the first time, as far as my knowledge goes, that he came there—I answered to the name of Weston when I heard inquiries—the prisoner said to me, "Is Mr. Weston within"—I said, "Yes, my name is Weston"—he said, "I beg your pardon; will you allow me a minute's conversation with you?"—I was talking to a lady, and I left her to hear what he said—he told me he had got an amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up, to pay in Walbrook; and he pulled out his <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, but did not proceed any further when Mr. Fortescue</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020019"></xptr>
               <p>came up—the prisoner had represented himself as a particular friend of Mr. Fortescue's—Mr. Fortescue came up, and said to me, "Mr. Weston, do you know this party?"—I said, "No, I never saw him before in my life"—he said, "He called on me, and introduced himself as a particular friend of yours"—I said, "That is the very thing he has done with me; he represented himself as a friend of yours"—he said, "I never saw him;" and he said to the prisoner, "I believe you are an impostor"—he said, "I am no impostor;" and he said to me, "I have seen you several times"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I have seen you at the house opposite"—I said, "What house!"—he said, "At the public house"—I said, "At the public house)" and knowing there was no public house, I said, "What is the sign?"—he said, "At Lake's Dining Booms"—I said, "Lake's Dining Rooms I have not been in for two years"—I then said he ought to be given in charge—he begged for mercy, and said, "I am a respectable man."</p>

I can swear to them all; one of the table spoons has a rock engraved upon it, and the word firm; and A. D. C. on another. I can swear to the other table spoon by the bruises as particular marks.</p>

I alarmed the house; my wife got up and missed the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment. I went to the office in Bow-street, I advertised the prisoner and the property lost, and she was taken about Christmas, and we had notice to attend at the office; I went and saw six tea spoons which I can identify.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness. I hired the prisoner at the bar as a servant, on the 13th of December. I took her on her own account. I was to send into Kent for her character. I went to bed on the 13th of December, at night, On the 14th when we got up we found the house was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them).</p>
               <p>When did you hear of them again? - On the Wednesday following; then one of the men from Bow-street office came to our house to inform me she was apprehended. When I was at the office she would not own to any thing she had taken.</p>
               <p>What do you think those goods are worth all together, be rather under than over? - I would not be hard; I will suppose them under forty shillings. On the Saturday following I was ordered to attend at Bow-street again; then she owned where the goods were.</p>
               <p>Were any promises or threats made use of to induce her to make this confession? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100029"></xptr> None. She gave the names of two different pawnbrokers in the Strand.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, she came to live with Mrs. Steward, on the 4th of October. She came from the register-office, in Wych-street. I went to the office, and they sent her.</p>
               <p>You was the last person who went to bed? - I and Mr. Steward.</p>
               <p>Did you see the things that were lost? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Was you the first that got up on the 5th of October? - Yes; I got up about half after eight I sent the child down; he told me the doors were open and no fire was lighted. I went down and found the door open below and the parlour door open and the things mentioned in the indictment were gone.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these things? - I cannot say.</p>

Upon the 21st of December I was sent for, and saw the prisoner at a publick-house, opposite the office in Bow-street. She confessed taking the things.</p>

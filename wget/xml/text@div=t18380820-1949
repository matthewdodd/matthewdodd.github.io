                  </hi>. I am a tin-plate-worker, and live in Ann-street, Cannon-street On the 2nd of August, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners at Aldgate—they tried to pull down some stockings at Mr. Few's shop, but did not succeed—they then went on to Bishopsgate, and on to Shoreditch—it was then about a quarter before ten o'clock—they got to Mr. Ubsdell's shop in Shoreditch, and I saw Holley put his left hand in where a square of glass was out, and take two pieces of goods out of the window, and give them to Marsden, who put them under his apron-Haley was on the opposite side of the way—I ran after them, but I lost sight of them—they were taken the next morning about half-past ten o'clock.</p>

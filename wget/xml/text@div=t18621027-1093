                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers at Messrs. Coutts'—on 14th October, about 12 o'clock in the day, the prisoner presented himself at my desk—I asked him what his business was—he said, "I want to draw some money"—I did not know him, and I said, "Have you an account with us?"—he said, "I have"—I then handed him one of our blank cheques—he filled it up in my presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "London, 14th October, 1862, Messrs. Coutts and Co. pay to George Jordan, or bearer, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Henry Hardy"—he then handed it to me written—I examined the signature—I did not know it or the name, so I went for reference, first to the ledger and then to the signature book—I then went back to him, and said, "Do you draw this on your own account, or have you any authority to draw in any other person's?"—his reply was, "Oh, if it is not here, it is at Herries'"—I communicated with the principals of the firm, and the officer Hanscomb was ordered to take him into custody—we have no customer named Henry Hardy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 102). I am on permanent duty at Messrs. Coutts'—I was directed to take the prisoner into custody—I asked him if he had any account to give respecting this cheque—he said he could not say more than he had already said to the gentleman—I was then going to take him in custody and he said, "It is all through Mr. Whithall, who had the paying of some legacies left to me and others, by my uncle, and they were deposited at Messrs. Coutts' bank"—I took him to the police-station, left him there, and went to his lodgings—when I returned, I found that the inspector had taken off this wig from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner what was the cause of his wearing a wig—he said, "Well; I did not want to be known by everybody, and if I had succeeded in getting the money, I intended to go abroad."</p>

               <p>nights before in the character of Iago—I found two or three other wigs at his lodgings—there were no theatrical dresses besides—nothing was there scarcely—I noticed him quoting a piece of Othello at the station-house—he said he could go through it very well—he did not go on quoting—he was quiet after that—I did not see him when he came to the station-house—he appeared to me as if he had been drinking something previously—he certainly looked to me to be labouring under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>,—he said before the Magistrates that his name was Hardy, Harold, or Drysdale, or whatever you like.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an actor, and have been so between thirty and forty years—I have known the prisoner for the last sixteen years—his name is Henry Hardy Drysdale—he is an actor, and has been so, I should say, for about thirteen or fourteen years—he has been acting at almost every prin<lb></lb>cipal theatre in the provinces, and two engagements in London, one at the Surrey, and one at Sadlers' Wells—he has been taking the lead at the theatres, and has been a most prominent actor—my opinion of his honesty of conduct is the very highest in the world—this wig is decidedly a thea<lb></lb>trical wig—they are thicker and heavier than wigs which are ordinarily worn—they are made for dressing, and so on—the prisoner was performing on the Saturday previous to 14th October—I cannot say whether he performed in this wig—he must have been performing in one something like it, for the character which he represented—he represented Iago—I was informed by some friends of mine, on the Saturday, that he had been drinking to extreme—I know that he had just recovered from a severe illness—he had a sort of gastric affection, or diarrhoea—he was prostrate for days and days—it put him in great danger—he had recovered from that about a fortnight or three weeks, I should think—I know nothing about Mr. Whithall, or the payment of any legacies—I did not see him drinking after his illness—I observed some very great peculiarities in his manner after his recovery from this illness—I have imagined sometimes that his mind has not been all correct, and that I fancied arose from drink, not from real insanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Newgate-market, and am cousin to the prisoner—I witnessed his performance of Iago at the Bijou Theatre in the Haymarket, on Saturday night, at her Majesty's Concert Room—his state was very peculiar; indeed, I am almost certain he was in a state of intoxication when he was performing—I saw him afterwards—I called at the Nell Gwynne as I went along, and saw him there drinking—that is where a good many actors go—I knew that he was suffering from this gastric fever—I visited him while he was suffering from it—he recovered from that about three weeks before 14th October—he seemed to me after that, when I saw him, which was about twice a week, to have been drinking rather freely—his manner was very strange and incoherent, talking all manner of nonsense, which I could not understand or anybody else—I have known him from infancy—I give him the very best of characters for honesty and upright conduct—I never knew him to commit a dishonest act in his life.</p>

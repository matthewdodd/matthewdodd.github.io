                  </hi>. I live in Lower-road, Rotherhithe, and am clerk in the service of the London Dock Company, the prisoner lives nearly opposite me. On 12th Jan., about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I was standing opposite the Red Lion at Rotherhithe—the prisoner came and asked whether I had seen Stubbings—I said, "No"—he said he wanted to speak to him particularly, and he asked me to come down Chilton-street and up the Plough-road, because he did not want his father to see him—I went down the Plough-road, and he said should he go and call for Stubbings—I said no, he might be at tea, or his father might be at home—he went and rung at Stubbings's bell, and Miss Stubbings came out and called her brother, Richard Stubbings—he came out; there were then three of us—the prisoner then hung his great coat on the railings—he had had it under his arm—he then came up to me, took me by the collar, and said, "Now, prove I am a liar!"—he then said to Stubbings, "Did you ever catch me out in a lie, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>?"—Stubbings said, "No"—the prisoner then said to me, "Retract your words"—he said it rather loud, and in a rough way—I said, "You have often called me a liar in a joke, and I have taken no notice of it"—he appeared calm and quite cool—he did not seem to be excited at all; he seemed in rather a bad humour—when I said he had called me a liar, and I bad taken no notice of it, he presented a pistol in my face—I saw him draw it up from his right pocket or his side—he did not say anything, but kept it pointed at me—he took it down again, and in about three seconds afterwards he raised it again and fired it in my face—he had hold of me by the collar with his other hand—he retained hold of my collar the whole time, and kept pinching me tight—the muzzle of the pistol was a few inches from my face when he fired—I felt injured by it—I felt as if my face was all <hi rend="italic">taken up</hi>; it was as if the skin of my face was rolled up—my eye was injured, and it is now affected—I was under a medical man for a fortnight or three weeks—by what I could see, the prisoner ran across the field or up the Plough-road—I did not hear him say a word—I know a young lady, named Payne—I was not paying my addresses to her, not at all; I believe the prisoner was—there has never been any con<lb></lb>versation between us respecting her that I recollect—I have been in the habit of visiting at her father's house—her brother used to draw, and I used to draw with him in the parlour.</p>

About a fortnight or three weeks after Christmas I was going down the Plough-road about half-past 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw three young men standing on the foot-path—I watched them—I had some suspicion—I stood in a dark place—I could see their motions by the light of the gas, but I was not near enough to hear what was said—I saw one young man put something towards the others face, which was turned</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the evening of 12th Jan.—he was in a considerably agitated state, and had an injury on the left side of his face, which appeared like a burn—it was very likely to have been caused by the discharge of a pistol not loaded with ball—the face was red, slightly swollen, and had numerous small punctured wounds, some of them containing a black substance—the external skin was removed in a small degree, and the eye was injured with these black specks—it is a very slight injury to his present appearance—those black specks will be permanent—he sow complains of weeping, of tears running over the eyelid; whether caused by the injury, or previous to it, I cannot say—the wound was likely to cause it—that probably will be for a long time; whether permanent I cannot say—weeping of the eyes arises from injury to the little duct which communicates with the nose—there are small specks on the white of the eye and the eyelid.

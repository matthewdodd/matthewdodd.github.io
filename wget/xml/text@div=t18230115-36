               <p>"If that is what you want, d - n your eyes I'll soon fetch somebody who shall settle you." I saw nobody near them, the woman who spoke went to the Lord Nelson, public-house, close by - and in a very short time I received a blow on the back of my head. I was knocked down, and as I rose I saw the prisoner standing close by me; he got my head between his legs as I rose, and some person was beating me on the right side. I felt a hand in my left hand pocket - my hat was knocked off by the blow, and my handkerchief was in it. In a short time I got away from them, and took my hat from one of the women who had struck me - she did not attempt to run away, nor did she conceal my hat; I looked for my handkerchief, and asked her where it was, she said she knew nothing about it. I missed four penny pieces and four halfpence, which were in my left hand pocket; several men came round me the moment it happened to assist me, or I should have been murdered - they got me from the prisoner. I did not hear him say any thing, nor do I know who took my handkerchief or money; he is the man who struck me; he did not run away, but went into the Lord Nelson. We went in after him, he said he would not be taken, and if I was not satisfied he would serve me worse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He said that in the public-house - A. Yes, publicly. I told the constable of the night the whole - he put it down as an assault, and said they ought to be more civil in that quarter. I do not know that I ever said I should not have come here except for my wife; I might have said so. I did not feel for my money till I left the watch-house - the handkerchief might have fallen out of my hat - I looked for it, but could not find it.</p>

            . I live in Thomas-street, Commercial-road; I was passing at the time, and saw the prosecutor and his wife. Two women came out of a public house, and one of them spoke to him, and the other struck him. I think he made some answer to them. The other said she would bring somebody who should do for him; she went into the public-house, and came out followed by the prisoner; she pointed to Fitch, saying, that was the man, that had struck her; he immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150020"></xptr>struck Fitch, who fell, and as he got up he struck him again, he fell to the ground, he then got his head between the prisoner's heels, and the prisoner stooped over him. I saw his hands close to Fitch's pockets; I heard money drop, it sounded like several pieces; his hat was knocked off - it laid on the ground with the handkerchief in it. The two women went up to his wife, who screamed out</p>
               <p>"Murder!" they said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, Ma'am, we will soon stop your screaming." Fitch got his head disengaged in about two minutes, and the prisoner returned into the public-house, and the women followed - the prosecutor also followed. I went into the passage - several people were collected. Fitch took his hat from one of the women.</p>

            . I was walking behind my husband; two women came up - one of them struck him, he told them to keep off, and the other fetched a man who struck him, and knocked him down, and as he rose struck him again - and as he rose a third time, he held his head between his legs. I screamed Murder. I cannot exactly say what passed in my fright.</p>

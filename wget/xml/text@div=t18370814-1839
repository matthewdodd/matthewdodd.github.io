                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. I live at No. 4, Sun Tavern-fields, St. George's, and keep a green-grocer's shop—my husband did not live there at the time in question—the 22nd of June was the last time he lived with me—I was keeping the shop by myself. On Saturday night, the 19th of July, I went to bed about a quarter past twelve o'clock between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a noise at my door—I looked up, and saw my husband by the side of my bed—I had no light, but I knew him' in a moment, and said, "Oh, my God, what do you want"—he said, "Oh, you b——old w—I will do for you"—I started up in bed, and found myself stabbed directly, just in the right side of my belly—I received two wounds—the other was at the back of my right hand—it gave me a great deal of pain—I passed by him, and received the second stab—as I was making down stairs he caught hold of my head, to pull me back, but my hair had been cut, and I got down—he kicked me down—I fell to the bottom of the stairs, and then he took hold of my throat to choke me—I screamed "Murder, "which brought assistance, when I got down stairs, and he was taken into custody—he said that I was in bed with a young man who had come with my son from sea, and was living in my house at the time, and has done so twice before—he came to my house after my husband left me—he was never in my room.</p>

Mrs. Driscoll came to me between ten and eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, the 16th of July—I found a slight wound on the back of her bud, and another, I cannot call it a dangerous wound, on the right side of the abdomen—this knife would produce such a wound—I think the peritoneum had been very slightly wounded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) This is the statement of Jeremiah Driscoll, about twenty-five or twenty-six years married. Within these last eight or nine years my wife turned to drink very much, and going to plays to parties, and coming home at very improper hours, three and four o'clock in the morning. When I used to ask her where she used to be till that time, she told me where she liked, and then for quietness I would hold my peace, for I had to be up every morning myself at five o'clock to go to my work. I often told her, if she did not mend her maneners, I would go and do for myself; she used to tell me to go, and that I had not the spirit to do so. She several times took my name off from over the door, and put another name on. All this I put up with, for fear of having any words with her, what she was very fond of. We keep little chandler's shop. At last I was forced to go away and lake a lodging. I told my daughter that lives next door to her, (a married woman,) that I would leave her, and she told me it was the best way, as she did not mean to mend. Then I went away and took lodgings, and there I stopped for eight or nine months from her. She met me one night at I was going to my lodgings; she begged of me to come home, and that she would swear against drinking any more spirits. I told her I would not go home any more, as I had a very bad life when I was there. She promised me that she would make that all right, and leave off drinking. I told her I heard she had another husband, she told me that was a young man that lodged in the house with her, and he was gone to sea, and that she did not know him man from a woman, which I believed of her on account of her age, and that she would know herself better; and therefore I came home. During the time I was from her, I saved upwards of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When I came home, there was scarcely any thing in the house but what she told and made away with, to keep this young man, who I was told that she was very fond of, but I put up with all this. I told her daughter that lives next door, and she told me to say nothing to her as she might mend—then she turned to drink as bad at ever, therefore I put up with that and a great deal more than I here mention, there is plenty of witnesses to prove what I mention. On about the 1st of July, she got drunk for three or four days, and then we had some words, I told her I would go where I was before and get a lodging; she told me to go, the would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140062"></xptr>
               <p>very glad of it; that aggravated me, and I was obligated to go—in two or three days after I was gone this man came home, and come to lodge again with her; the neighbours told me, and one night as I was passing by the house I looked in through the joints of the shutters, and saw her sitting on the man's knee, and eating their supper. I said nothing, but I went to my daughter's and rapped at the door, and asked her to come and see the way her mother was; but she suspected something was the matter, and she would not see it. Then I went away to my lodgings, and I had a very uncomfortable night of it. On two Saturday nights after, on the 15th of July, I met her and this man going to market to buy some tea and sugar, and other things they wanted, and I watched them, but lost sight of them in the crowd of people. I met a friend, and I asked her if she had seen my wife and her lodger, she said, she did, d—n her, go home and never mind, let her go to h—I. Soon after I went home, and found the place in darkness. I thought she had stopped somewhere, for she often stopped out all night when I was at home with her. Then I took it into my head to go in through the window on the first (floor, where we did keep our bed,) to bring away some planes and tools of mine that were in the house, and when I lifted up the window and put my head in, there, to my surprise, I saw them in bed. Before I got right in they were back to back, and he pretended to be asleep. I immediately called the police, and there was none there then. I saw a man outside, and he asked what was the matter, I said, "Come in, you will do as well." I went to open the door to let him in, and she jumped out of the bed, and left the man, her lodger, in bed; however, before she was out of the room, this man I called in and I was in the room, and I said, "You sha'nt go out of here until the policeman sees your behaviour." This man told me to let her go to h—I, and not mind her, and then she got down stairs. Then the policemen came in, and I took them up stairs to let them see where she was in bed with the lodger; her daughter and son-in-law came in also; she then said I cut her with a knife in 'the back of her hand. I could take my solemn oath I had neither Knife, nor any other sort of instrument, for the policemen searched me, I had nothing in the world but my pencil that I had in my pocket, and I did not see that knife for the space of nine or ten days before this happened, which I could take my solemn oath of, and this man that was nearly as soon as I was in the house, could prove the same. The policemen did not come in for about twenty minutes after; when they came in, she gave me in charge to them. I told them I would not leave my house for no one, but to make every thing quiet I went with them; and at the station-house, she said I cut her in the hand, which I could swear she did herself on purpose to get me out of the way while her lodger stopped at home with her; and now she wants <hi rend="italic">to</hi> transport me if she can, which all the neighbours that live near at hand to her knows, and often told me I was a fool for ever coming near hand to her. She often told me she would ged rid of me, which I did not take any heed of, because she used to be in liquor, and when she used to be in liquor she would tear and scratch any man. Therefore, gentlemen, I hope you will look into this, and take it into consideration.</p>

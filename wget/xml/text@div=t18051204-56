             sworn. Q. You know the person of the prisoner at the bar, do not you? - A. Yes, on the 16th of November, about a quarter after six o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour, I thought I heard a coach go by in the street, plainer than I usually do, I got up to see if the street door was open; I saw the prisoner at the bar just going out of the door; the street door was open, I took hold of her, I asked her where she was going, she said nowhere, I perceived that she had got a great coat under her cloak, I called to my brother, she dropped the great coat, and kept the hat still under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her drop the coat? - A. Yes.</p>

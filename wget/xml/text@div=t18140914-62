            . I am a waterman, and constable of the Thames Police office My wife, the deceased, was a woman very much given to liquor. On the 25th of June, she was in liquor. She would have cut me down with the shovel, if I had not prevented her. She was desperate in liquor. I never struck her, or pushed her. I took the shovel from her, she fell upon her head. She was very much intoxicated when I left her, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. She said, upon her death bed that Mrs Collins had given her her death blow. She was then in immediate apprehension of her death, she always said so, from the time she was taken ill. She said, that Mrs. Collins had struck her under her heart, and had given her her death blow. She died about eleven days after, on the 5th of July, last year.</p>

            . Mrs. Collins came into my mother's shop, and threatened Mrs. Bolus very much indeed; that was the morning the fight was. Mrs. Collins had not offended Mrs. Bolus. Mrs. Collins' boy came for a quarter of a pound of cheese. Mrs. Bolus came in the morning; we asked her whether she had it or no; Mrs. Bolus said, she had not sent for any. Mrs. Bolus went and fetched Mrs. Collins' boy to our shop; the boy would not say whether he had it or no; he would not come in doors. Then Mrs. Collins came, she swore she would have Mrs. Bolus' life before night. Mrs. Bolus accused the boy of getting the cheese without any order. Mrs. Collins was very angry about her accusing her son. I did not see them fight.</p>

            . I saw the fight between the prisoner and the deceased. The beginning of this quarrel was, with respect to three three-shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140040"></xptr>pieces that were deposited in a drawer, they were to defray the expence of reparing a boat. This boy was in the habit of going for errands for Mrs. Bolds. She spent one of these three-shilling pieces in liquor; she accused the boy of taking another to get the cheese with; the quarrel began upon this, and lasted six hours in the street. The deceased flew over into Mrs. Collins' room, she began to beat the boy; the mother defended the boy; they catched each other by the hair of their head, they pulled off each others caps, and the window being open, Mrs. Collins and Mrs. Bolus both fell over the ledge of the window. I cried out murder. This was about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>MR. TOULMAN. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend Mrs. Bolus; she complained of a great pain across her chest. I attended her till her death; she constantly complained of pain across her chest. She died on the 5th of July. I opened her body; there was no inflamation, but a very large extraversation of blood upon the lungs; the head appeared to be much bruised. The extraversation of blood on the lungs was the cause of her death. I think her life was not worth one years purchase; her life was very precarious. I rather think it was the effect of violence. I saw no external appearance of a blow near the heart.</p>

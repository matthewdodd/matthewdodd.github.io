               <p>CHARLES HEDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a builder, and reside in Crown-street, or Hog-lane; Messrs. Holmes occupy a shed of mine in which these boards were deposited: On the 25th of June last, I saw the prisoner, Gwynn, go past my window; I never saw him before or after; in consequence of information from my man, which I communicated to Mr. Holmes, I watched at home; the prisoner, Ranger, met me as I was coming out of my yard; a person of the name of Jones was with him, who has escaped; he presented to me a note, saying, it was an order from Mr. Davies, Messrs. Holmes foreman; I refused taking it; he said, he was come for some mahogany boards; I ordered him to go to my foreman, Russell; I then saw Ranger take the boards out of the lost, and put them upon the ground to Jones, who took them, and set them by the side of him; Jones took the first four out of the yard; then Ranger came down from the lost, and took the remaining three out of the yard; I did not see Gwynn at that time; I ordered Russell and Smith to follow Jones, and I, with Robertson, followed Ranger; he put the boards down to rest; he then saw me looking, and immediately turned to the right, left the boards, and went away; I had waved my hand to my man Robertson to apprehend him; he stopped him, and took him directly to Mr. Holmes's, with the boards; Mr Holmes, in the presence of the prisoner, denied the order.</p>

               <p>- RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was employed by Mr. Hedge: On the 25th of June the prisoner, Ranger, came to me, between two and three o'clock, and said, he had an order from Mr. Holmes's people for some mahogany boards; I did not see the order; he said he was ordered by Mr. Holmes's foreman, Mr. Davies, to come for the pannel-boards that had been stopped; I told him I could not let them go by any means without Mr. Davies came; he asked me if I should be satisfied if he went back and got a written order; I told him I should not; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010052"></xptr>would go back and get a written order at any rate; he went away, and before he came back, Mr. Hedge ordered me to let him have them upon a written order, and to watch him, (produces the written order; reads it). -" Deliver the bearer,

I said, if that came from Davies, he might take the boards; he then gave a signal to a person of the name of Jones, and he delivered seven boards to Jones from the lost; I then went in to put on my coat to watch them, but I did not see either of them go out; I saw Jones with the boards in Moor-street, in Earl-street; I saw Gwynn walk by the side of Jones as far as the corner of Tower-street, and he put down the boards, and the prisoner, Gwynn, then took the four boards, and proceeded towards St. Martin's-lane.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you give any directions on the 25th of June for Ranger to go to Mr. Hedge's for some of your master's boards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Ranger's defence. I met Jones, and he said he would give me a job; he sent me to Mr. Hedge's for the boards, and they told me they were stopped; I said, I supposed I must have an order; then I went back to Jones; he said, he would go to Davies and get an order, and he brought me an order; I went for the boards, and they delivered them to me; I went with them into West-street, and stopped to rest against the chapel; I put down the boards, and was going across the way to speak to a fish-woman that I knew, and just before I got to her, she took up her basket and went away, and I was going to return to the boards when they laid hold of me.

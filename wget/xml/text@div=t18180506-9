            . I am in the East India Company's service. On the 8th of April I received orders from Mr. Baxter, and concealed myself behind three chests of tea. at the bottom of the passage. In about ten minutes the prisoner came down the passage into the room, and put his hand into a chest of tea; I then saw him put something into his breeches and go away. I informed Mr. French.</p>

On the 8th of April, in the morning, I found him absent from his station; I went to the third floor, and in about three minutes I saw him come along the room-Squire told me what he had seen. I followed him to his room, which was down two pair of stairs, and told him to come with me and strip himself, as I suspected he had some tea - He said he had not. I found nine ounces of tea in a bag between his legs. The chest contained the same sort of tea as that in the bag.</p>

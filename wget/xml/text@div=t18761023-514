I did live at 40, Ash Grove, I now live at 20, Bonner's Row—I am a boot finisher, and work for Mr. Ayres, of 343, Hackney Road—on Monday afternoon, 18th September, about 3.30, I was coming out of Mr. Ayres' shop and saw Dilworth standing outside; the shop <hi rend="italic">goes</hi> back with a garden, I suppose he must have been about 18 yards from the shop, on the pavement—I had never seen him before—he said "Shopmate, do you know that the shop is on strike"—I said "No, I was not aware of that"—he said "Are you going to work for Mr. Ayres"—I said "Yes, if the work and if the price suits me, I shall work for Mr. Ayres"—I had done a sample pair for Mr. Ayres, and they suited him and the price suited</p>

               <p>Sutton's goods and I said "Yes", I was guilty of it—I worked twice for Mr-Branch, after March and before Christmas—I illegally pawned there and also at Mr. Pearce's; the reason I pledged them was because Mr. Pearce made me pay for some boots and likewise he owed me some money; he has never I paid me—I think the goods are in pawn now, but the manufacturers can't claim them now, because it is over six months—I worked for Mr. Moore, not for Mr. Pearce, that was in August this year, I think—I pawned Mr. Moore's work illegally, but he gave me work after that; all the three of them employed me afterwards.</p>

I live in Chapter House Terrace, Kennington Park, and am manager to Mr. Ayres—on Tuesday, 19th September, between 11 and 12 o'clock I was leaving Mr. Ayres' premises to get into the trap to go about my business—Baxter was in front of me some 2 or 3 yards—the house lies back from the street with railings in front; I was following Baxter out to get into my trap and saw Dilworth stop Baxter—as I got into the trap I heard him say "What have you got there?"—he said "I have work"—he said "Are you going to do it?"—he said "I am"—he said "If you do you are a d——d scamp," or "scab," I would not be positive of the word, I think it was "scamp," "and if you take out any more work I will break your b——arm"—I got out of the trap, went over to Dilworth, and told him I had overheard his threats and he had better be careful, or he would get in for it—I then told Baxter not to be in fear, as I would see him home with his work, and I did so—Dilworth still remained there—I had not seen him near the premises—before—I think he was there for a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards, hanging about the premises in the same form that he was then—I saw him every day for that fortnight, hanging about the premises and fre<lb></lb>quently stopping persons going to and fro to work—I have watched that from the window and also from the door, and I have stood at the window—oppo<lb></lb>site—I spoke to him about it then and afterwards—he was sometimes alone and sometimes in company with others, more frequently alone—Mr. Ayres' shop was on strike all this time, from this class of men—I was coming out of Mr. Ayres' premises to go about my business for the day, I am representa<lb></lb>tive as well as manager—I did not come in front of Baxter, I had no idea any one was there; I did not come out with him; there is one door for the men; I came out of the passage, out of the office, the trap was waiting for me at the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). Nobody. was in the trap when I first saw Mr. Morgan with it; he got into it; I don't think there was anybody with him, he got out and went into Mr; Ayres' on business, I believe, and when I came out with the work on my arm he came out after me and got up in the trap—he got out when he said to Dilworth "You must be careful what you are saying"—I should not think he was more than 3 yards from me when he said that—I don't think there was anybody in the trap with him, my attention was drawn to my work—he went home with me, I walked on the pavement down the Hackney Road, and he was in the trap and walked the pony at a slow pace—when he saw me home to the bottom of Hackney Road young Mr. Ayres was in the trap, but I don't know whether he was in the trap when it was standing outside Mr. Ayres' shop—it was after this took place that I saw him at the bottom of the Hackney Road-young Mr. Ayres was in the trap with him when he saw me home, I don't think he was when he got out to speak to Dilworth, I did not see him in there then, I did afterwards when he accompanied me home-to the best of my knowledge I did not see him when Mr. Morgan came up to Dilworth and told him to be careful.</p>

No one was in the trap with me when I got out—I cannot refresh my memory whether I met young Mr. Ayres as I accompanied Baxter home, but I am positive there was nobody in the trap when this conversation was going on; I would not undertake to swear whether.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">examined by</hi> the Court). On Tuesday, 19th September, I remember hearing that one of our workpeople had been molested—I was not in the trap with Mr. Morgan that morning, not at any time that morning to my knowledge; I don't recollect, I may have been in the trap by myself, but I don't recollect being in it with Morgan that morn<lb></lb>ing—I was not present when any conversation passed between Dilworth and Baxter outside our premises, I believe I was standing at the door when Morgan went up to them; I did not hear anything that passed, they were too far away from me; the house stands a long way back; they seemed rather angry, having words, I thought, but what passed I did not hear—I don't remember whether I afterwards got into the trap when Morgan drove away—I believe he got out of the trap and spoke to Dilworth; I should think I was about 10 feet from them, I was standing on the threshold of the door, and there is a bit of garden in front and there are railings; I did not hear anything that was said—I am in and out of the trap all day long, sometimes a dozen times a day, sometimes with Morgan and sometimes by myself—I was in the trap that day two or three times alone, it may have been before or after Morgan came back; I was in it early in the morning and in the after part of the day; we both use the trap and my father also—the distance from the shop to the footpath may be 20 feet—I was about 10 feet from the railings, but I daresay 15 or 20 feet from where they were—I have not measured the distance.</p>

On Tuesday night the 3rd of November, I saw a young man pass through the passage of the house, with a bundle under his arm—he came from the kitchen, and went out at the street-door, which was open—the door had been shut all the evening—I know it was shut half an hour before, or less than that—It was on the latch, and could he opened from the outside—It was not bolted—I cannot say whether any body came in after I had seen it on the latch—there are lodgers in the house, who might have come in—I missed from the kitchen, two sheets, one blanket, a towel, a night-gown, and night cap—they are not worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the young man passed me in the passage, and had rather a large white bundle under his arm—I did not see his face—It was a little after nine o'clcok.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a city special-constable. I was out on Tuesday, the 3rd of November, and saw the prisoners in company with two others, going in a directon for Camden-town, from Tottenham Court-road, about five o'clock in the evening; and about half-past nine o'clock the same evening I saw the two prisoners in Tottenham Court-road, near University-street—Moore was carrying a large bundle in a silk handkerchief—I followed them and heard Moore say to Poulton, "Here, you carry the <hi rend="italic">swag"</hi>—I followed them some distance, and saw Tibbs the policeman on the other side of the road—we followed and overtook them—they looked round, and saw us and when we nearly got up to them, Poulter threw the bundle at the policeman who was nearer to him than me—the constable picked it up immediately, and they ran away in different directions—I pursued Poulton some distance, and secured him, and took him to the station-house—I am quite positive he is the man who threw the bundle at the constable—Moore made his escape, but was taken afterwards—I am sure he is the man—I knew him before.</p>

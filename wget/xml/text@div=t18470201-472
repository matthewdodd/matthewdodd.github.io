                  </hi> I am a jeweller, and in partnership with my brother. We live in Cornhill—we both live on the premises—we rent a portion of the premises and live there—the landlord does not live in the house—it is let of out to four or five different persons—there is but one outer door—our shop door opens into the passage—the shop is on the ground floor, and our apartments at the top of the house—they do not communicate with each other—the house is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill—on Friday afternoon, the 8th of Jan., the prisoners came into the shop and requested to see some pins—I am quite certain of their persons—I did not rightly understand them, and asked what I could show them—Stone replied pins—I took a tray of pins from the window, and observed the pins in it—I cannot say what number there were, but could see there were four brilliant pins—I placed the tray on the counter—Stone took up a mourning pin and banded it to Voisin, who asked the price of it—I took it from him, as the price was marked on it, but while I was looking at it I missed the brilliant pin, and immediately handed the mourning pin back to Voisin—I said nothing—they went on look<lb></lb>ing at pins, and asked me the price—several pins were handled, but not brilliant pins—Voisin took up a turquoise pin, and Stone took up another pin—they laid them by the side of each other on the counter—they spoke together in a foreign language, which I could not understand—Stone spoke English to me—Voisin made the remark "How much?"—I said to Stone that I did not understand Franch—he replied that I should learn, as I should find it useful—one of them, I believe Stone, asked what time our shop closed—I said, "Half-past seven o'clock"—they said they would call again, and went away—I rung the bell for my brother, who at the top of the house, put on my hat, and immediately followed the prisoners, having missed the brilliant.</p>

               <p>pin—I went up Cornhill, down Gracechurch-street, and saw the two prisoners and a third person standing together, about 300 yards from the shop—I passed them, then spoke to a policeman, and immediately turned round—the prisoners were coming towards me abreast with the third man—I seized the prisoners, and said to the policeman, "Take the other"—Voisin broke away from me, but I held Stone—I did not observe anybody outside while they were there—there was a lad in the shop about three yards from me inside the door—he could have seen what passed had he been looking—the pin was worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was the property of myself and brother.</p>

On Friday afternoon, the 8th of Jan, between four and five o'clock, I was in company with Hayden in Gracechurch-street, and saw the prisoners in company with another party between 200 and 300 yards from Mr. Dodd's shop—I watched them, saw the last witness lay hold of the prisoners—Voisin broke from his grasp, run across the road along Gracechurch-street towards Fenchurch-street—I followed him, stopped him in Gracechurch-street, and said he had better go to the station to see the charge against him—I took him to the station, searched him, found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., this pair of scissors, a pocket-book, and a small breast-pin, worth nothing, on him.</p>

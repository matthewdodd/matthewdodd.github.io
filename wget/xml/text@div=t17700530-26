            , came up to me on the 12th of May, about four in the morning, and told me my desk was broke open. I went down, and found my street door open, which I saw fast at eleven o'clock, before I went to bed, and the chain up cross it. I found the lock of my compting-house broke. I missed a 3 l. 12 s. piece a French crown, a Spanish dollar, a Prussian six-dollar, two English crown pieces, and five, six, or seven pounds in loose silver; there might be six or seven half crowns, two or three half moidores, a 6 s. 9 d. or two, and several five-and-three-pences, two four-and-six-pences; here were some half guineas, three three shilling papers of halfpence, a green silk purse; out of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300017"></xptr> closet, in the same room I missed five large silver table-spoons with a crest-upon them, and the letter W on the back of the bowls, two silver tea-spoons, not marked, a little pair of sugar-tongs, and two pair of dog-skin shoes. The prisoner lived servant with me, and had been discharged from me about nine months before that time; he had been at my house the day before, to see his late fellow-servants; they all had a suspicion of him. I dispatched my servants to see for him, one went one way, and the other another; they took him the same day, the 12th of May, with some of the things upon him. I saw him searched; he had one of my pairs of shoes on his feet, and a pair of my metal buckles in his shoes. I asked him what was become of my silver spoons and tongs? He said, they were at the lodgings of a girl that he had kept company with, in Wentworth-street. The constable went there; it is between Whitechapel and Spitalfields; the prisoner went with him. Then we suspected he must have the money or the purse about him; and in his breeches we found 5 l. 2 s. a French crown that I swear to, by having a mark upon it, two English crowns, a Spanish dollar, a Prussian six-dollar, a 3 l. 12 s. a six and nine-pence, a four and six-pence, three thirteen and six-pences, five guineas, three half guineas, two quarter guineas, concealed under his ham, and fifteen shillings and six-pence in silver, loose in his waistcoat pocket. The prisoner owned in the presence of six or seven people, that he took all these things out of my desk. I asked him how he broke the desk open? He said, with a small sugar-chopper that lay in the window; and it appeared to be done by such an instrument. When I went to bed, it lay in the farther window, and in the morning it lay in the window next to the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he got out?</p>
               <p>Walker. He said he went out at the house door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Walker. He lived with me about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he speak English? (He pretended not to understand English.)</p>
               <p>Walker. I have heard him speak English three or four years ago; he lived servant where I served my time.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner came to me to light a candle that night this house was robbed; it was properly Saturday morning about two o'clock. I cannot say I ever saw him before he came from over the way from Mr. Walker's house, and after that I saw him go in at the door, and heard him fasten it; my place is just opposite the house. When he came out he was in his shirt, and his breeches on. It was much of his size; I do not say he is the man.</p>

            . I was attending the Rotation at Whitechapel, the prosecutor came there, and asked for an officer. I went with him to Mr. Rider's house in Angel-alley, from there he sent one of his own men with me, to shew me where the prisoner was. He was not at his lodging. I went a second time, and saw him in the street, going along, and the servant after him. I ran and laid hold of him, and said, You are my prisoner, and brought him to a public house near Whitechapel church, into a back room. Mr. Walker came. I searched the prisoner, and found a pair of shoes and a pair of metal buckles in them. Mr. Walker asked the prisoner, what he had done with the spoons and the money; he said, he left them in a drawer in his lodging. I went with him to his lodging, and searched all the drawers, but found none; but upon a half-tester bed I found five tablespoons, two tea-spoons, and a pair of tea-tongs, all silver, in a handkerchief. Then I went to the Minories, where he said he had sold a pair of buckles to Mr. Harding; then I came back to the public house. We took the prisoner's shoes off, and opened the right knee of his breeches, after that the left, then the silver and gold sell out in a green purse; I took them up, and laid them on the table before him.</p>

I went into the compting-house, and found the desk broke open; then I went and called my master; he came down, and found his money was gone. I was present when the money was found upon the prisoner, and heard him say he took it out of Mr. Walker's desk; and that he got in at a window in the coal-cellar.</p>

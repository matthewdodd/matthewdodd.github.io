            . I work at shoe-binding, and live in the same room as Milton, in Queen-street, Seven-dials. On Sunday night, the 30th of November, I was coming home with her - I had never seen the prisoner before; we were just turning the corner - the first thing I observed, was a man come between us; I know the prisoner by his squinting - he came up and asked Milton what she had to say about him; she said she did not know him - he then put up his fist and struck her a blow in the face; I do not know whether it was a severe blow, but he struck her again on the shoulder, knocked her down, and took the cloak off her back - I went and caught him by the collar, and said the cloak did not belong to him; he then struck me on the face, and knocked me down - I lay for a few minutes senseless; I got up, and called Watch! I went and looked down Nottingham-court, and saw Milton at the corner - the watchman went into a house, and took him out of bed; the watchman picked the cloak up off the ground, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was a late hour - were you supping at the same place as Milton? A. Yes - at her mother's; her sister had a child christened - the sister lives in the same room with us, but was at her mother's; neither of us caught hold of the prisoner's arm - it happened in <placeName id="t18281204-122-crimeloc642">King-street</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. On the 30th of November, at half-past eleven o'clock, I was standing in King-street, Seven-dials, and heard a call of Watch! repeatedly - I was about fifty yards from Queen-street; I went up as quick as possible; the prosecutrix said,"Watchman, it is a very hard case that I should be knocked down and robbed;" I asked where the person was, could she point him out - she said No, he is not here; I ran a few yards further and picked the cloak up; I went further down and she called Watch! again, and said, "He is gone this way;" I asked if she should know the man - she said "Yes, he has got a cast in his eye;" I went and knocked at Ward's door, knowing him before: he lives on my beat - his mother let me in; I found him in bed undressed all but his shirt; Milton said he was the person - I think he squints; she said her cloak was gone, but did not say how it went from her - she said she was knocked down and robbed - she claimed the cloak.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How soon after she complained of being knocked down did you go to the prisoner's house? A.About ten minutes, to the best of my knowledge; I found him comfortably in bed; the prosecutrix saw him undressed - I was not going to take him out of bed unless she said he was the person; she did not tell me what she had been robbed of - Watch! was called with a load voice - I cannot say it was her that called; she said she had called; I did not see the prisoner till I saw him in bed: I picked up the cloak in King-street, about thirty yards from his house - I did not see Williams to know her, there were so many people about - I could not be less than five minutes going up to her; there were then forty or fifty people assembled.</p>

            . I saw all this row - I was coming home from work about eleven o'clock at night, and these two young women were before me - I live in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials; I am cook at an eating-house - I saw these two young women at the corner of Queen-street, and both appeared as if they were quarrelling with each other; one asked leave of the other to lie her cloak, and she said she would not let her; Ward was coming by, and one of them laid hold of him by the arm, I cannot say which, I was not near enough to tell - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040056"></xptr>said something to him, and he resisted going with her; she would not let him go - he turned round, and rather shoved or knocked her down, I do not know which; she fell - she ran after him, and swore she would be d-d but she would have him, and the cloak fell off her shoulder; she called him a cock-eyed ***; she called Watch! the watchman came and picked the cloak up.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the young women it was you could not tell? A. No; they were both quarrelling among themselves at first - the cloak was picked up about thirty yards from the prisoner's house; I have not heard the evidence which has been given - I do not know where the watchman went, for I went home; Seven-dials is generally full of women on all sides.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the watchman by at the time she called him these scandalous names? A. I do not know whether he heard it, he was coming up - after she ran after him she called him these names, and then she called the watch; the women were both quarrelling - I only saw one of them knocked down - I was about ten yards from them; I was there when Ward first came up to them; I only saw him strike one - I will swear he did not strike them both; I have seen both the women before, but never spoke to them; I live in the same neighbourhood with Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in the same house? A. Yes I did, but not at this time; and these girls lived in the neighbourhood at that time - it was about four years ago; I first heard of his being taken up last Monday; about half-past eleven o'clock I went to the office, but was too late to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when these two women laid hold of him? A. I do not know - but he resisted, and pulled his arm away; she would not let him go - they were both very much in liquor, by their appearance and their discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. What discourse? A. Why they called him a cock-eyed *** - and I dare say they wanted him to go with them; I know they did not get their living honestly when they lived in the same neighbourhood as I did four years ago.</p>
               <p>JAMES DUNN re-examined. They did not appear to be drunk - I could not see the least appearance of it; I did not know them before - if they had been loose women about that neighbourhood I must have known them - I know Collins, but did not see her there; I did not hear either of the witnesses use any indecent language.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did either of them mention a cast in his eye? A. Yes; they said he had a cast in his eye; Collins might have been there and I not see her.</p>

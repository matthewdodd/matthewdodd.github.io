On the 26th of May I stopped with my coach near the Green Dragon, in Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street—I left my great-coat on the box, and went away for about three minutes—when I returned I missed it—I found it at Bishopsgate watch-house five or eight minutes after, and saw the prisoner in custody there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On the 26th of May I was on duty very near the Green Dragon, and saw the prisoner come down Great St. Helen's-place with a coat on his shoulder—he dropped it, left it, and walked away a few yards, to see if anybody was pursuing him—seeing there was not, he returned, picked the coat up again, and walked towards me with it—I stopped him, and asked where he was going with it—he said, "To Vine-court, Spitalfields"—I said that was not the way—he made no answer to that—I asked whose it was—he said his uncle's—I asked what he was—he said, a hackney-coachman—I said he must go with me, and see farther into it—he went with me as far as the top of Great St. Helen's, and then took to his heels and ran away—he was stopped by a gentleman, and I took him to the watch-house—the prosecutor came these in a few minutes, and swore to his coat.</p>

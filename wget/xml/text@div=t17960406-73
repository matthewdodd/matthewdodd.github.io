               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Agar; I took the prisoner at the door coming out of the house, on Sunday the 6th of March, without any shoes; his hands were quite black, apparently as if he had been handling lead; he told me he had been drinking, and taking a girl home, and the girl had run into that house, and he had been in after her; I asked him where the girl was? and he said he did not know; he was then taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole of Mary-le-bonne watch-house: On the 6th of March, between six and seven o'clock, I took charge of the prisoner; he had no shoes on, his hands were very dirty, as if he had been taking lead; I searched him, but did not find any thing upon him; the next morning, about nine o'clock, I went to the house, and found the lead there, it was delivered to me, and I marked it; I put the lead down, and it sitted the place exactly, at the end of the gutter, but there was a great deal gone.</p>

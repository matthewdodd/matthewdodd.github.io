               <p>Q. Do you know any thing yourself with respect to the blinds? - A. Sometime in July last, or beginning of August, we missed a number of fixtures from the house, and I informed Mr. Welch of it; among which were the Venetian and canvas blinds, mentioned in the indictment; three of the canvas blinds and four of the Venetian blinds were fixed, and the rest were lying loose in a back office; I was present when they were afterwards found, on the 25th of January, in the lodgings of the prisoner, in the house of a man of the name of Levi Hayes, in three different rooms, two of them up two pair of stairs, and one up three pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from any thing the prisoner has told you, that he had any connexion with those rooms? - A. No: All the things mentioned in the indictment were found in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have valued them at 30s. is that about the value? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When did you agree for this house for Mr. Welch? - A. The 23d of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deeds executed? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the things as long ago as July? - A. July or August.</p>
               <p>Q. That is upwards of six months; had you other people working in this house? - A. There were other people.</p>
               <p>Q. They were found the 25th of July, at this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other person as well as the prisoner might have taken them to this house? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. From July to the time you found them, they might have been through many hands? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not concealed? - A. They were rather concealed; the one was under the bed, the others behind a box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You would not have employed this man if you had not had a good opinion of his honesty? - A. Certainly I had no bad opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at work there likewise? - A. He was; there were some blinds loose in the back room, and in the one pair of stairs the blinds were fixed; they were missed while the prisoner was at work there; I had the blinds from Mr. Sapwell's, and went with Mr. Fletcher to see whether they would fit the places in the one pair of stairs; I sitted the blinds to the places where they were suspected to be taken from in Mr. Welch's house, and they sitted exactly; I observed they had not been unscrewed, but torn off with a narrow chissel, or a screw-driver; the hinges of the blinds were bent, and there was the impression of the instrument in the bead of the sash frames they hung to; I believe the blinds I had at Sapwell's, and fitted to the places, were the blinds that were taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a journeyman carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.From the observation you had had of them, and from the marks you saw upon the sitting, do you believe then to be the blinds that sitted the window? - A. I verily believe they are; they are bent hinges; these are the same blinds, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. They are common Venetian blinds, others might fit the windows? - A. A thousand to one if they did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any marks upon them that you can point out? - A. I can say no otherwise than they fitted the place; the hinges are torn off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is no mark but the violence that identifies them? - A. It has not marked the blinds but the beads.</p>

                  </hi>I am a woollen-draper and man's mercer, and live at No. 135, Regent-street. I know this velvet—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I cut it myself in my shop on the 4th or 5th of November—I believe it was the 5th—a few days after, I had another order for some of the tame, and looked for it, but could not find it—in consequence of information on the 10th of December, I went to Mr. Gray's, the pawnbroker's, in Fleet-street, and saw this velvet there—I had sent round to inform the pawnbrokers of the loss—I saw the prisoner at the station-house on the 10th of December—(<hi rend="italic">I had seen the velvet a fortnight previous</hi>)—I did not promise or threaten him in any way—I charged him with having pawned my velvet—he de<lb></lb>nied having seen the velvet at any time, or having pawned it at all—I am quite sure of that—I asked him who he was—he told me he was an agent for persons in embarrassed circumstances—shortly after that, he told me he was a tailor—that was in consequence of a question I put to him about some black velvet which he had tried to pawn the same day—that black velvet was cut in a peculiar way, what tailors call on <hi rend="italic">the bias</hi>, and he used that phrase, which made me say, "What, are you a tailor? " and he said,</p>

               <p>"Yes"—I asked his name—he said it was John Smith—I left him at the station-house—this velvet is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I ordered it myself to be made for me at Lyons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How much of it did you have from Lyons? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Only fourteen yards and three-quarters of this pat<lb></lb>tern—I have a memorandum J of the quantity I sold—I received the fourteen yards on the 10th of September—I have sold some of it—I cut it last on the 5th of November, and missed it a few days after—we missed it about the 19th of November—I had not seen it after the 5th—when I cut it on the 5th there were ten yards and seven-eighths, but three yards were cut off immediately afterwards by another person—there is now five yards and three-quarters—the people at Lyons are extensive manufacturers, they are agents, and export a good many fancy velvets—I have six per<lb></lb>sons in my employment—I swear this velvet corresponds in every respect with mine—I have part of it left in my own stock with the selvege on it—I saw the black velvet—it was with respect to that that the word "bias" was used by the prisoner.</p>

A yard and three-quarters—there were two cuts the same day—I hardly know whether one cut was made before me—I presume there was ten yards and one<lb></lb>eighth at the time I cut it—three yards were afterwards cut off to my knowledge—the quantity which appears now does not exactly tally with the quantity which was left—the length I lost was seven yards and one<lb></lb>eighth, and here is five yards and three-quarters—I have no doubt of it being mine—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>I am assistant to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker in Fleet<lb></lb>street. I know the prisoner—on the 9th of November he brought this piece of velvet to pledge, which I advanced 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on—I have the duplicate—he pawned it in the name of John Turner, No. 11, Dorset-street—on Fri<lb></lb>day, the 10th of December, he came again—we had in the interval intima<lb></lb>tion respecting the velvet—he came into the private boxes, and offered to pledge a piece of black velvet—I recognised him, and made a communica<lb></lb>tion to my brother shopman, who moved—the prisoner saw that, and he delivered the piece of black velvet into the shopman's hands, who gave it to me, and went out to fetch a policeman—while he was gone the prisoner moved from the box into the front part of the shop, and when the police<lb></lb>man was coming in through the middle door, the prisoner opened the door, and was going out—he had not got the money he wanted on the velvet, nor yet the velvet, at that time—I went to Dorset-street, but there was no No. 11 in the street.</p>

On the 10th of De<lb></lb>cember I was called to Mr. Gray's, and saw the prisoner there—he was leaving the shop, when the shopman caught hold of him, and gave charge of him—he gave the name of John Smith at the station-house, and said, when he stopped in town, he slept at the Cross Keys public-house in Gracechurch-street, and he had slept there the night before—I made in<lb></lb>quiry at the Cross Keys public-house, and they knew nothing of any such person—I was at the Justice-room at Guildhall when the prisoner was there—previous to his being examined, I asked him from whom he pro<lb></lb>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Are you quite sure he said he got it from the pro<lb></lb>secutor? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What words? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was that before or after he said he received it of the prosecutor, pointing to him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Before—after he said he received it of a person, he said he received it of that man, looking at the prosecutor—I then asked him if he meant the prosecutor, and he said, "Yes, condi<lb></lb>tionally."</p>

I have caused the trade to be searched—I examined the velvet with two patterns I have in my hand, with a mag<lb></lb>nifying glass, and can swear the selvege threads are exactly the same—I had the whole piece, fourteen yards and three quarters—I have the same pattern, but the selvege is widely different—I have two pieces off the whole piece which I have cut off our cards—the longest length we ever sold was three yards.</p>

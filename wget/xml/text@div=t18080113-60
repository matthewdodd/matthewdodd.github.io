            . I am a watchman on Saffron-hill. On the 13th of December, about a quarter to one, I stopped the prisoner Wells, he had this sack and the potatoes in it; I asked him what he had got, he said hog potatoes; I told him I must stop him, unless he gave me a satisfactory account to pass; Wheeler said they were his property, he had bought them; he lived at No. 1, Black Boy-alley, Chick-lane; I asked them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130055"></xptr>go to the watchhouse with me, and if the constable of the night was satisfied, then I should be satisfied they both seemed willing to go to the watchhouse. Turning out of Saffron Hill into turnstile that leads into Hatton Garden, Wells threw the sack off his back, he swore d - n his eyes, for my giving him that trouble, I should carry the sack; I sprung the rattle, one of the watchmen came; Wells was conducted to the watch-house with the potatoes; Wheeler got away. I told the constable where Wheeler lived; he sent the watchman and a patrol after him; he was brought to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I was officer of the night of Saffron Hill liberty. On the 13th of December, about one o'clock in the morning, Wells was brought to me with the sack of potatoes on his back; I asked Wells where he had brought it from, he said Clare Market; he said it belonged to Wheeler, and he was employed by Wheeler to carry it to Wheeler's house, No. 1. Black-boy-alley; he said they had stayed rather late drinking after they had purchased them. I sent for Wheeler, he said he had not purchased any potatoes that evening; he did not know Wells, he had not employed him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Wells's Defence. I met a man at Chancery-lane, he said he had slipt down and hurt himself, and he wished some one to carry the sack to Saffron Hill; I told him I was going as far as Saffron Hill; he said if I would carry the sack he would give me a shilling. The watchman stopped me, he asked me what I had got; I said, potatoes, I believe, by the appearance; he said, I must go to the watchhouse; I asked him to look after the man that owned them. I was detained. This man was not with me at the time I undertook the job.</p>
               <p>Uwin. I am convinced that Wheeler was along with Wells at the time I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Wheeler's Defence. I was not there at all; I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Wheeler called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Wells called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Jones. I take my oath that the prisoner is the man that took me by the collar, I saw them at a distance laughing and all playing the rogue together, this man was along with the other four, they were all in one company, they all came up to me together; the prisoner took me by the collar, and said, he and another in a blue coat were custom-house officers.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th October, about twenty-five minutes to twelve, I was in St. James's Park, in front of Buckingham Palace, in plain clothes—I saw the female prisoner about halfway between Buckingham Gate and the front of the Palace—at that time I had a scarf and a pin, which cost about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was in a very sharp walk, as I had to get in before twelve o'clock, and she came up to me and said, "Are you in a hurry, dear?"—I told her to get out of the way, I did not want to be annoyed by her—she kept dodging me backwards and forwards till we got opposite a lamp-post—I passed that into a dark place, where any one who sits can see those who come by, but they cannot be seen, when she instantly made a grab at my scarf and pin, and took my scarf off, with the pin in it—it was a buckle scarf—just as she snapped at it I was knocked down by three men—Ricketts kicked my legs from under me—I can't say where they came from—I had got hold of the woman at the time—I was just turning round—I saw Dickson there—he struck me under the ear during the time that Ricketts was kicking my legs from under me—I was then walking, just turning round to run after the woman—they threw me on the ground—Ricketts got on the top of me—I turned him over, and pulled Dickson down—I got him with his head under my arm, and tried to take him with me while I went after the woman, who was then going away with the other man, who is not in custody—I could not get Dickson along fast enough, so I had to let him go to apprehend her, and when I apprehended her I was instantly knocked down by the man who was with her—Dickson tried to get away all that he could, but he did not punch me or anything of that kind—the two male prisoners ran away, when I apprehended the female with both hands, and the man who is not in custody bit me in the thumb—I was bleeding very much when I got to the station—I tried to detain the man, but could not—I retained the woman till 326 A came up, and I handed her into his custody—I saw the male prisoners again on the Monday week, the 28th, in Short's Gardens, Drury Lane—they shifted from there, and I followed them to the Lyceum Theatre, as 1 had not a constable then—I recognised</p>

               <p>them—I then followed them to the Adelphi, in the Strand, where I came in connection with a constable, and apprehended Dickson—he punched me violently in the neck to get away—I told him the charge, he said, "All right, I will go"—I gave him into custody, and took Ricketts myself—I was on plain-clothes duty at the time.</p>

I was on duty on Saturday night, 19th October, in St. James's Park, in front of Buckingham Palace—I saw a crowd of people, and went up—Bramall said to me, "Take this woman in charge"—he had got hold of her—I asked what she had done—he said, "She has stolen a scarf and pin from me"—I took her in charge, and searched her, but she had not got the pin—I took her to the station, and returned to my beat, and when I returned I saw Ricketts sitting on a bench handy to St. James's Palace—I should say that would be from thirty to sixty yards from where I took the woman into custody—it was about one o'clock—I should say there were nearly twenty people collected when I took the woman.</p>

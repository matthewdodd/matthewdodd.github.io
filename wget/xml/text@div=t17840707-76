               <p>Mr. Tomlins Prisoner's Counsel. Did the prisoner live in your house during all the time that you mention? - As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Was not your house repairing at that time? - It had been repairing, I do not know that the prisoner slept out.</p>
               <p>By whose desire was it that the prisoner was discharged, did not she herself desire she might be discharged? - She did not.</p>
               <p>What character had you with her? - I wish not to enter into that.</p>
               <p>Court. How many boxes did you see of her's? - I think it was three, every one was locked and one was a very large trunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tomlins. Did the prisoner near you give any orders to have the boxes fetched down by the porter? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She made no resistance, it was so heavy a thing a woman could not bring it down.</p>
               <p>Did you know that any other person in your house besides the prisoner had the key of her box? - I never heard of it.</p>

               <p>I lived with Mr. Strutt in June last, I have lived there two years and a half.</p>
               <p>In what capacity? - I was in a place of all work when she came, my mistress desired me to put some blankets and things into a box, and I was putting them strait and there was a pair of curtains, and I said to her Bella what is that, and she desired me to let her look at them, and she said they were a pair of cradle curtains and my mistress should never see them again, this was in the garret.</p>
               <p>Did you see any curtains on the stairs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Are they they the same curtains that yo u had conversation about with the prisoner? - They are.</p>
               <p>Did you see the box open? - No. (The things produced.) Here is a petticoat which belonged to Miss Strutt, it is a dimity petticoat, here are two petticoats, two frocks, these are a pair of stockings of my mistress's which I have mended for her several times; they are marked No. 3. with black silk; my mistress has many of these clouts, this is one, this stock is new, I have seen it several times in my master's drawer, they are marked I and a dot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tomlins. When you saw these curtains in your mistress's room, did you know they were your mistress's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell your mistress? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I did not like to make a disturbance, I know the curtains by sewing one of the loops.</p>

               <p>What was found in these boxes? - She took them out herself in the shop below stairs, the boxes were carried down stairs into the shop, she told me they were her boxes, I do not know what things were taken out, my master was in the shop all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070106"></xptr> the while, and also when I brought down the boxes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor.

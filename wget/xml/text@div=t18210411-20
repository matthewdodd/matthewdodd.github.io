Mr. Payne came to my house one day between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I had been at home all the afternoon in the parlour behind the shop, my family were also at home, there was nobody in the shop - it is part of the house. Payne brought one of the prisoners into my shop, I sent him to the watch-house. I went with Payne to the Jacob's Well, public-house, in Charlotte-street, the landlord produced some spoons to me which Coates has.</p>

            . I now live in Beaumont-street, and am a shoemaker. At this time I lived at No. 29, Marylebone-lane, directly opposite the prosecutor's shop, which is at the corner of William-street. On Tuesday afternoon, the 6th of March, I took Jordan to his house. I had seen the three prisoner's in company about his house, I saw Jordan and Donald stand opposite a square of glass. I saw Jordan take an instrument from his pocket and do something to the glass; Steers stood four houses off. Jordan looked a little about him and walked a pace or two, and then came back and put his fingers through a hole he had made in the window and took six silver spoons out, then all three ran away, Jordan and Donald turned the corner, and I think Steers took an opposite direction. I ran after them, knocked Donald down, followed Jordan, he fell down by the Jacob's Well, public-house, and threw the spoons down into the cellar, the flap of which was open. I laid hold of him as he threw them down, took him into the public-house, and told the landlord, in his presence, that he had thrown the spoons into the cellar. I then took Jordan to Mr. Harris, and he was sent to the watch-house; I returned to the public-house with Harris, and the landlord produced the spoons. I took Donald two days after, I knew them all before by seeing them about - I had seen them all three together on the Sunday night, and on Monday morning, and on Monday afternoon I saw them together standing by Harris's window looking about, watching the shop. On the Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, I and Coates followed Steers into a coffee-shop and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday afternoon when the spoons were taken, where was Steers. - A. Standing four doors off, I observed him for about ten minutes; I saw them all three come up together from Oxford-street way. I was standing at my father's door, they passed Harris's door two or three times before they stopped. Steers did not stop at the Oxford-street side of the house, but the other way.</p>

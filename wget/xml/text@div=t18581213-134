                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Eastern Counties Railway Company. My office is at the Shoreditch Railway-station—the prisoner has been a clerk there about two years—he was formerly at the Stores department at Stratford—the whole of this invoice marked A is in his writing, except my signature, and the stamp at the bottom—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> Eastern Counties Railway, October 1st, 1858; John Roberts, 55 fathoms of wood, discount 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; certified as to quality and rate only. J. B. Examined, Henry Newman, store 3010, Frederick Waddy.)—if goods had been supplied as stores, the invoice would have been sent down to the Store keeper's department at Stratford, and another invoice would have been sent to me—the invoices are made to the prisoner—it was the duty of Mr. Bullivant, the store-keeper at Stratford, to see that the quantities mentioned in the invoice were correct, and upon that being certified, the invoice would be sent up to my office in London, and exchanged for the one I hold—it would be the prisoner's duty to examine it on its arrival at my office, to see that the sum charged was carried out accurately, and to see that it was</p>

I am storekeeper to the Eastern Counties Railway, at Stratford—stores that are bought for the use of the Company are all bought through me, and come under my care—the Company bought wood of a person named Roberts, living at Hampnill—the last order I gave him was on 12th July, 1856—I have had no dealings with him since—Roberts' invoices were on printed headings, and I should have an invoice of some kind, stating the quantity and the rate, which it would be my duty to ascertain was correct—these initials, "J. B." are not my writing—I know nothing of the transaction—if this had been a genuine transaction it would have been my duty to have certified the invoice, and passed it to the accountant for payment—I should have transmitted the actual invoice to the London department, certified as this purports to be—in August, 1857, I had a small quantity of wood from Mr. Barnes, about three fathoms per diem—I have got his account here—it is not kept by myself, but I know that there was not 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him in August, 1857.</p>

Mr. Sinclair is the chief superintendent for distant depots, but he has half a dozen under him—Mr. Brown would certify at Stratford, and sombody else at Norwich—the office at Stratford is at the same building as mine.</p>

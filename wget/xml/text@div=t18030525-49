To the care of Chubby and another boy; they came to Smithfield that night; between twelve and one I found five of them missing when I came to draw them, that is, to separate every man's sheep by themselves; they belonged to three different people.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, did you make any enquiry of persons of the names of Boyle and Butler? - A. Yes, and they took to the house of the prisoner; I went to the prisoner's house between ten and eleven on Monday morning, with two officers of the Police; we found five sheep dead.</p>
               <p>Q. The carcases of five sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the house were they in? - A.Just as you go in on the right hand; he is a butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bear the appearance of having been recently killed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the skins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the heads on or taken off? - A.Taken off; we found the heads underneath an armedchair in the same shop, facing the carcases.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to say from the appearance of the carcases, or the heads, whether they correspond with the five you lost? - A. They were like the five I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you speak from? - A. The heads.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the heads any marks upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the heads the heads of sheep of different sorts? - A. Yes, two or three different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the appearances such as to induce you to believe they were the same sheep? - A. Yes; I cannot undertake to say they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The skins were not off the heads? No, not all off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot positively swear they were the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.If you had seen other heads of sheep with marks on them, you might have thought them the sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the heads immediately on entering the room under the chair? - A. No, the patrol pulled them out.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in custody yourself for this? - A. Yes, a week.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of a boy of the name of Chubby, where is he? - A. He is gone off.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police officer belonging to Hatton-garden: On the morning of the 25th of April, I searched the prisoner's house; I found, in a dark part of the shop, parted off from the front of the house, (one side is parted off, and kept dark, and the other is open,) five carcasses and five heads, under a chair; the liver, hearts, and plucks, were hung behind the door of the partitioned room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the same day, apprehend the prisoner? - A. I did; the sat was in a pan.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you apprehend the prisoner? - A. About twelve; I went to him in the City, where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he a master butcher? - A. No, he is journeyman to a calf-dresser, in Warwick-lane; they call him a leg-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. This shop was parted off - was it a shop he only hired, or a part of his dwelling-house? - A. Part of the dwelling-house, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a regular butcher, killing meat at this shop? - A. No, there might be a few joints of meat sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the shop appear to be such as would lead you to suppose you should find five carcasses there? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the carcasses where they might easily be seen? - A. No, you could not see them at all without a light.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the prisoner where he was at work, did you make any enquiry about this shop? - A. I said to him, Harvey, there is a person in possession of five sheep at your house, and without you come and prove which way you came by them, they will be taken away; he said, he bought them of a man in the Hackney-road, who was driving them along the Saturday before; he washed himself, and came along with me; I told him he must go to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where is this shop? - A. In Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When this is for sale, it is usually hung up in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen joints of meat in this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In butcher's shops there is a place to kill sheep? - A. There were pullies behind the door; they were temporary things; they appeared to be a make-shift.</p>
               <p>Q. If a butcher wanted to kill sheep, he would have this kind of make-shift? - A. He must have pullies to pull them up.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was a journeyman butcher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But, though a journeyman, he carried on the trade of a butcher in this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After they have killed the sheep, don't they hang them up sometimes till they are cold, before the carcasses are cut up? - A.Exactly so; I never searched a butcher's shop before where there was such a private part as this.</p>
               <p>Q. There were five heads, and hearts, livers, and plucks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The heads were under a chair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a bottom to the chair? - A. I cannot say; it was an old chair.</p>
               <p>Q.There was no difficulty in discovering the heads? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see them immediately as you got in? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say whether or no those sheep resembled those you lost? - A. I believe they did resemble them, from the heads, and carcasses, and plucks.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the heads first, had they any marks upon them? - A. No farther than the teeth, and being born sheep; the borns were chopt off.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the weight such as would correspond with what you had lost? - A. Yes, and the price corresponded; provided they had had the skins, they would have corresponded in weight and price within five shillings of the money; they were worth forty-five shillings each.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe those to be the sheep you lost? - A. As far as a person can be sure without the skins, I am sure they were my sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. There would be born sheep there? - A. Yes, there is a great difference of horns.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear no others are chopt off in the way these were? - A. No.</p>

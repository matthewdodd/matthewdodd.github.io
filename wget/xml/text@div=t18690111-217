                  </hi>. I live at 22, Martha Street, St. George's, and am foreman to the Animal Charcoal Company Limited—the deceased and prisoner were fellow labourers there—they had worked together for about seven years, and agreed very well indeed; they never had any words before this—on Christmas Eve they had had a little to drink, but were not drunk by a long way; the deceased was worse than the prisoner, if anything—they were working on a platform from 16 ft. to 18 ft. high; they were night workers—about 11.45 they were <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> one another which could get the most beer on credit—one said he could get so much; the other said he could not—the deceased said he could go and get beer at any public-house where the prisoner dared not show his face—the prisoner said he could not—with that the deceased called him some very nasty names, and the prisoner went and hit him with his fist, a slight blow, I believe somewhere about the face; it was not so hard as to mark him—the deceased then took up the shovel he was working with to strike the prisoner—I picked up a handful of grain, and said to the prisoner, "Howard, we will have no words here; go to your work"—the prisoner went to his work on that, and the deceased went to his work, but came back again in a minute with the shovel to Howard, called him a nasty name, and said he would fight him—with that the prisoner hit him and knocked him down, and he rolled off the stage—I descended the ladder, and helped to get him up—he had fallen into a canister, a thing about 3 ft. 6 in. or 7 in long, and about 2 ft. wide; a deep iron thing—I found him doubled up in this canister—he did not speak—I went for a doctor, and when I came back the man was dead.</p>

I live at 12, Duke Street, St. George's—I worked with the prisoner and deceased—on this Thursday night there was some <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> going on between them about beer—the prisoner struck the first blow, he hit the deceased on the head or face—the deceased presented the shovel towards him after that—not before, the foreman then ordered the prisoner to knock off, he would have no more of it, and he went to his work—the deceased then came up to him and told him he would fight him in the morning—the prisoner then dropped the shovel he was working with, and struck the deceased twice, first with his right hand and then with his left, somewhere about the head—the deceased staggered and fell, and rolled on the edge of the stage—he fell about 18 ft. into the canister—he died in about seven minutes afterwards.</p>

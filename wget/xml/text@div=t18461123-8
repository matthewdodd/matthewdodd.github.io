                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a watch-maker and jeweller in Bull and Mouth-street—my mother is in partnership with me.

I was in Bishopsgate-street—I saw the prisoner—he was very drunk—he staggered up against me and said, "It is all through the d—d watch"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Have you not heard of the watch that was stolen by the Blue Coat School?"—I said, "Do you mean to say you stole that watch?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said. "What have you done with it?"—he said, "Pawned it"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "In Hackney-road, at Mr. Cotton's"—I went and ascertained that he had pawned a watch there, but it had been redeemed the day afterwards.</p>

               <p>Mary Batten thus depos'd. Last Christmas was Twelve Month, about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, I went to see a Shop-Mate of mine, who liv'd in Bishopsgate-street; but is since dead. She and I us'd to wind Silk together. And there I staid till one a Clock in the Morning; not that I use to keep ill Hours; for it is very well known that I take an honest Care for a Livelyhood, but it was Holiday Time, and we were willing to be a little Merry together. - So as I was a going along Windford-street, in my way home, there came 3 Men out of Mr. Jackson's, the Black Lyon Ale-house, the Prisoner was one, and the Names of the two others, were Ward and Borce. They took hold of me, and one of them said, she's a jolly Girl she shall be my Wife No, says another, She shall be mine. But indeed says the third, she shall be mine, - and so they drove me along as far as <placeName id="t17260302-17-crimeloc74">Spittle-fields-Market</placeName>

They gave me the French Disease, and took away my Gown and Handkerchief.</p>

             thus depos'd. Upon Enquiry in Spittle fields-Market, I found the Prisoner and the two others. They own'd they had lain with her. They beg'd she'd give them no Trouble, and swore from Time to Time, that they'd come and make her amends, and give her 6 Shillings a piece to buy her a new Gown, but were never so good as their Promise.</p>

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner is my Daughters Husband. I believe he's as honest a Fellow as ever liv'd, and I am sure he had no Occasion to ravish any Body, for my Daughter, tho' I say it, is as likely a Woman as any in the Parish. Other Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of a sober, industrious Man, and the Jury <rs id="t17260302-17-verdict76" type="verdictDescription">

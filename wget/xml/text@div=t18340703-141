             (City police-constable No. 39). on the 4th of June, I was in <placeName id="t18340703-141-crimeloc772">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was this? A. On Holborn-hill, opposite Field-lane - a horse had fallen down, and a crowd had collected - he was a tall stout gentleman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked for my father who is a basket-maker - he sent me on an errand - I saw the cab break down - the officer took me and said he saw me take the handkerchief, but I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOSEPH ARIS. I am quite certain I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief, and he was in the act of putting it into his side pocket when I took him.</p>

On the 25th of February, at nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner take these beans from my barn- I was in a place adjoining to watch; he was in my service - he came into the barn, took some beans from the heap, and put them into a bag; he then went to the lower part of the yard with the bag - I waited till he came back and said, "Milton, you have stolen some beans;" he said he had not - I said, "I saw you take them, and you shall go with me;" he said, "I will go and fetch them back;" but I said, "No, that won't do, you have taken so many;" he said it was the first time - I went with him across the turnpike road, and found them under a bush.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he any horses to feed? A. Yes; he had been with me about a week- my horses had split beans, but these were not split; they were to be split in the barn.</p>

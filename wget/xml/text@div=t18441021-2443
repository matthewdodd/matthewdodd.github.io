                  </hi>. I am in the service of Frederick Amey, who keeps the Red Lion public-house, at Enfield. About the middle of the day of Wednesday, the 16th of Oct., I saw the two prisoners at my master's house, sitting at the bar, drinking—there were seven or eight more persons in the bar—I saw my master's watch hanging up in the bar between ten and eleven o'clock—the prisoners came in just before dinner—after that I saw the prisoners against the haystack—I did not see either of them take anything out of the stack—I saw them in the bar about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

On Wednesday, the 16th of Oct., I was in the wash-house—the stacks are ten or twelve yards from the house—while I was in the wash-house I saw Wright at the corner of the first hay-stack, pulling out a piece of hay and smelling it—there was a fence round the stack which was broken at the corner where I stood—Wright was inside the fence—after that he went straight up into the house—about a quarter of an hour after that I was coming out of the wash-house, and saw Blair at the corner of the next hay<lb></lb>stack, inside the fence, and he pulled a piece of hay out—I am not able to say what time it was—it was before dinner.</p>

I was at the place, and in consequence of hearing that my master had lost his watch I went to the hay<lb></lb>stacks between one and two o'clock—there were other persons searching about—I searched in the hay-stacks, and found my master's watch in the second stack, very near the corner, just under the thatch—I gave the watch to my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision dealer, of No. 23, Addle Street, Greenwich—on Friday, 2nd of April, about 4 p.m., I was at the Pier head, Victoria Dock—I was wearing a silver hunter watch, gold Albert, gold locket, and a small coin attached to it—I asked the prisoner for the small steamboat to Black wall—he said, "There will be no more to-night, but I can show you where you can get a waterman's boat"—there were two or three men about, but I did not notice them—the prisoner came with me across the caisson which divides the pier head from the dock, to where there was a dark alley—when we were about half way down the alley he put his right arm from behind round my neck, and threw me against the wall—I was afraid—I could not see at all on account of the darkness—he held my head back by the force of his right arm—I felt my watch being taken away—I did not see it in the hands of any person—directly I was released I saw two men—I had heard a party following—he one could have secreted themselves in this dark alley, because you could see the light at the other end—they ran away; I ran after them—I will positively swear the prisoner is the man who put his arms round my neck, and that he is one of the men who ran away—I lost sight of them—I gave information at once—I next saw the prisoner at Barking Road Police-station—the police fetched me there, and I identified him from five or six other men—he was the second man—directly I saw him I said, "This is the man," and I put my hand on his shoulder—he said, "I did not take your watch;" I said, "I did not say you did, but you held me while the other man took it."</p>

Prisoner's Defence. I went up as a witness for a shopman who had had some flannel stolen, and these lads all swore they would get me six months. I was going to my work. I know nothing about it.

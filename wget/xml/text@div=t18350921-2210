On the morning of the 25th of August, I saw Hadland and Grout come down St. George's market, near tge Elephant and Castle, with this mare—Gront was riding it, and Hadland walking alongside of it—as they came down the market they saw me—Hadland called me by my name, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tommy,</hi> will you buy the pony?"—I knew him before very well—I said, "No; the pony will not suit me"—It was a very small pony, about the size of a donkey—I said, "No; it will not suit me; it is blind, and such an object I will not have it"—I called Mr. Bennett, My master, and said, "Here is a pony perhaps will suit one of your little boys"—my master truned round and saw it, and asked if I knew the two men—I said, "Yes; I know them both"—master bid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and Grout took it—I saw him paid—my master gave them a bit of steak, and they went over the way and had sixpenny worth of gin—the pony was claimed the next day, and master gave it up to Price.</p>

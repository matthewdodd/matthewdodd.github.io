             sworn. - I am a peace-officer for Mary-le-bonne parish; I let furnished lodgings, and live in South-street, Manchester-square; I have known the prisoner Gladwell nine or ten years, but have had no intimacy with him till within these three years: On Wednesday, the 12th of July, he called upon me between two and three o'clock; I made an appointment to call upon him the next morning to go into the City with him; he stopped till between six and seven; he asked me to go with him to drink tea with Yates, at Mr. Morse's; he said, you know Yates is a very particular fellow, and he will be offended if I do not go, and I will not go without you; I had known Yates fourteen years; we went together; the maid-servant opened the door; Gladwell was going up stairs; I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200050"></xptr>where are you going, I will not go up stairs; upon which Yates said, the maids are washing below, and we shall interrupt them; we then went up stairs; the first thing that took my attention was a painting of a dancer upon the top of a harpsichord; from there I saw a watch lying upon the chimney-piece at the other end of the room; some time after, Yates went down to get the tea, upon which Gladwell said, let us go and look at Mr. Morse's bed-room; we went into the bed-room; Gladwell said, let us wash our hands in Mr. Morse's bason; he washed his hands, and I washed mine; there was a pot of pomatum stood upon the chimney-piece in the bed-room, which Gladwell looked at; when I had washed my hands, I went out into the front room; when I returned into the front room, Gladwell was there; we drank tea, and left Mr. Morse's lodgings between seven and eight; we might have been there about an hour, or an hour and a half; I called upon Gladwell the next morning at Hartnell's, in St. George's-fields, at about a quarter after nine; when I went in, he was dressing his hair, and was using the pot of pomatum that I had seen in Mr. Morse's bed-room; I said, that was Mr. Morse's pomataum; he said, it was; I said, how could he take it; he said, Yates could manage that with Mr. Morse; a short time after, he went down stairs, and returned with Yates with him; when they came into the room, Gladwell said, here is a pretty piece of news Yates brings, Mr. Morse's watch is missing off his chimney-piece; Yates said, yes, my master placed it on the chimney-piece when he went out to dinner, and when he came home it was missing; Gladwell said, how does your master know the watch was there; Yates said, he always winds it up when he goes to bed, and he placed it there when he went out; Gladwell then said, is Mr. Morse sure the watch was there; upon which I made answer and said, that the watch was certainly there, for I had seen it there; upon which Gladwell said, you saw the watch there, are you sure you saw the watch there? why, says I, I think I am sure I saw the watch there; you think you saw it, says Gladwell; if you are not sure, you should not say any thing about it; I said, I don't know that I am going to say any thing about it, because I hope it will be found, but it I am to say any thing about it, I certainly saw a watch there, upon which I told him, I should not go into the City, I should go to Mr. Morse; Yates said, his master was determined to find out his watch; he said, Mr. Morse is out, but I dare say he will be at home by the time you get there; I said, at all events, whether he is at house or not, I will go; Gladwell said, he would go too; certainly, says I, it is very necessary; upon which we all three set out to go to Mr. Morse's; he was out; we waited till he returned; I proposed to Mr. Morse to go immediately before a Magistrate; Mr. Morse said, he could not go at that time; I gave Mr. Morse my address, and told him who I was, that I should be ready to come forward at any time, and Gladwell gave him his address; after that, Gladwell and I went into the City; upon our return, we talked a great deal about it; Gladwell asked me why I made myself so uneasy about it, what did it signify, they could not say we took the watch, the apartments are open to a great many besides us, they are open to every body in the house; I said, an imputation of that sort was enough to make me uneasy; he said, what does it signify, what can they do? I said, they can do a great deal, they can take us both up; what then, says he, we must be discharged, there is no proof against us; says I, they can do more than that, they can go into my house and search it, turn all that is in it upside down, and your lodgings likewise; says he, they cannot break our locks; yes, says I, they can; what, when we are not there? yes, says I, equally as much as if we were there; upon that, there was a complete change in his countenance, and so there was for the whole night; we dined together at my house upon bacon and cabbage; we were engaged to go that evening to Vauxhall, and there was an unusual dullness upon him all night; I parted with him about one in the morning, and the next morning he met me at Mr. Morse's lodgings, when he appeared very chearful.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had known Yates longer than you had known Gladwell? - A. Yes; about fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have called on Yates often? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And received money of him for Gladwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money is not paid to Gladwell yet? - A. There is a part of the money paid to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you paid him all that you have received? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Gladwell went to Morse's lodgings to meet the charge as often as you did? - A.Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the time he was taken up, to the present hour, he has not been at large? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he had left his lodgings, and was in custody, there was nobody to answer for him except the master of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, no person who called there would be likely to see him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I dare say you never took the trouble to call at his lodgings? - A. No; I never did; I called on Mr. Hartnell there; the day after the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200051"></xptr>examination, Mr. Morse requested of me to make enquiries about the neighbourhood for the watch; as I went past, I saw Hartnell in his shop, his wife and his aunt were there; I never called at any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a private door, is there not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not near his lodging? - A. No nearer than the butcher's parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go past his coal-hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the coal hole is? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go for coals in the winter, when he wanted them, when you have been there? - A. How is it possible I should know when I was up stairs with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You used frequently to visit him? - A. I used to go upon his business, it was to oblige him.</p>
               <p>Q. You obliged him by keeping back his money? - A. No such thing, it is ready whenever it is demanded, he has got my note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any business whatever? - A. Yes; I am employed a great deal in my lodgings; my wife is a ladies' hair-dresser, and very much out; I attend sales frequently, and buy different articles, and sell them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Follett? - A. Yes; I have kicked him out of my house between two and three in the morning.</p>

             sworn - I am a butcher, in Marshall-street, Prospect-place, St. George's fields; the prisoner, Gladwell, has lodged with me two years: Last Thursday was a week, the 14th of this month, having a great deal of vermin about my house, a sirloin of beef had been destroyed by rats, and bearing a parcel of rats in the coal house, I took my dog into the coal-house, I had a candle in my hand, and saw a handkerchief with something glittering in it; I took it up, and found it to be a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gladwell keep his coals in that place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any thing kept there besides? - A. Yes; a pot or two, or any thing we wanted to put in; there was no lock upon the door, but I have not put any thing in these three months,(produces the watch and the handkerchief); the next morning I sent to Mr. Morse about it; the watch seemed to have lain sometime in the handkerchief; there was a mouldy or rusty appearance upon the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How far is the coal-hole from the private door? - A. About three yards, I suppose; it is under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not White frequently call upon Gladwell, and come in at the private door? - A. Yes; his bell was at that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore a man that called often, would know where the coal-hole was? - A. I should think so; he used to call once or twice a week sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White ever call at your house after Gladwell was taken into custody? - A. Yes; the Wednesday after, I was standing in the shop as he was going by, and I asked him to walk in and sit down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not your eye upon him all the time, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in, was there any thing to prevent his going to Gladwell's lodgings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Who was there at the time besides? - A. My wife and my aunt, my aunt is in her eighty-second year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. What character does the prisoner bear? - A. I never knew but he was a very honest man.</p>

               <p>Yates was not put upon his defence.</p>
               <p>Gladwell's defence.

               <p>Q. Do you know Henry White? - A. Yes, very well; I knew him first of all about twelve years ago; I have known very little of him these three years.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you know of him, would you believe him upon his oath? - A. I would not take his oath, nor his word, nor his bond, for a penny.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Have you never had any quarrel with White? - A.Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he never turned you out of doors of course? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he never turn you out of his house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he never kick you out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200052"></xptr>Mr. Raine. Q. Will you swear you never had any misunderstanding? - A. No misunderstanding particularly; I knew his character so well, that I have known very little of him lately.</p>
               <p>Court. (To White). Q. Did you ever kick him down stairs? - A. No; I turned him out of my house between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Follett. He did not turn me out, he opened the door and let me out; he had me at his house to write an inventory of his goods to the amount of 334l. and he told me I had not put down the linen or the plate; now I should like to know where he got money to buy all those things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To White). Q. Upon your oath, did you or not turn this man out of your house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you turn him out? - A. Because he staid in my house at an improper hour; I had been in bed some time; I heard my children crying; I got up to see what was the matter; I went into the room to see if the servant was there, and she was not; I went down and found her below stairs with Follett; I told her to go to bed; I went down again about an hour and an half after that, and found them together; I told her again to go to bed; and between two and three o'clock in the morning, I went down again, and found her with him; I had no patience with him any longer, and I gave him a kick, and thrust him out of the house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you ever had any quarrel with him? - A. Not previous to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Follet). Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did White ever assault you, or turn you out of his house? - A. No, he never did; he says it was between two and three o'clock in the morning, it was not ten o'clock; he stood in the passage with his arm out, it was in the dark, and I ran against his arm, he did not turn me out.</p>
               <p>White. What he speaks of, was on a Sunday evening; my wife and I had spent the evening out; I went in in the dark, and wondered what was going forward; I heard somebody creeping up stairs, and he ran against me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Follett). Q. Do you remember this other business,sitting up with the nursery-maid? - A. Yes; I sat up, that was no harm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the night that you were turned out? - A. No, it was before that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Gladwell, called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

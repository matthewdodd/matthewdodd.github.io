I handed over that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with other moneys, to Rawlings, but not the card—I received further moneys from him on the 23rd for the prisoner, and they are initialled by me—whenever I received money I handed it over to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant superintendent of the Coal Consumers' Association—in the early part of this year I was ordered to go through the books of the Camberwell Depot, kept by the prisoner—there was an order-book, a delivery-note book, and a stock-book—an order would be first entered in the order-book, the number, the date, the name and address of the party ordering, the quantity ordered, and the number of the coupon or delivery-note which would be presented—when the coals were sent out the carman would have an invoice given to him, and the order should be marked off as sent, with the name of the carman who took it—the delivery-notes have a cheque and a counterfoil—attached to the invoice is a receipt which the party receiving the coals signs and gives to the carman—a card is also received by the carman to deliver; it contains the particulars of the coals he is to deliver—the number of the invoice would be put on the card, by which we can identify the customer—it was the prisoner's duty to receive the money brought by the carman to the office, and the delivery-note, turned into a receipt, would be given to him, which he would paste in the delivery-book on the counterfoil from which it was torn—he would enter the receipt of the money in the stock-book—he entered the whole transaction, and there the matter would end—he would pay the money into the Kennington Butts Branch of the London and County Bank daily, and send up a weekly return—I have selected the weekly sheets sent in by the prisoner to the head office—I find 2 tons of coal ordered on 12th October by Mr. Edwards, of the Beresford Arms—they were not delivered till 23rd December—the order is No. 514—I am not certain whether it is the prisoner's writing or his assistant's—I have got the counterfoil, which is pasted in. (<hi rend="italic">This was for two tons of coal, at</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 44,693 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 44,694, <hi rend="italic">signed "Thomas Rawlings, E.S.</hi>") Then follows the receipt for two tons of coal, signed "James L. Edwards"—the entry in the stock-book is "24th December, two tons;" the date is in the prisoner's writing—there appears to have been a mistake; it is two tons, invoice No. 514, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the entries are correct, except that 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is put down instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., excepting the case of Mr. Fuell—Bond's order is for two tons, delivered on December 23rd, and the delivery-book says "Two tons, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," signed by Thomas Rawlings—it is enclosed again in the stock-book, "Two-tons, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on the same date is "Mr. Fuell, two tons ordered December 11th, delivered December 23rd"—here is a note in the margin, "One ton only sent, T.R."—the counterfoil is "Fuell, 114, High Street, Peckham," "1" ton altered to "2," a "2" altered to "1;" 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the prisoner's writiug—two tons are signed for—in the stock-book here is "One ton at 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—here is Mr. Russell, of Leipsic Road; one ton Silkstone ordered on 28th October, and sent on December 24th, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and here is Mr. Russell's receipt—there is no entry of that in the stock-book; it, is not accounted for—on 5th June two tons of small coal are ordered by Buzzuy &amp; Co., and sent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070112"></xptr>
               <p>on the same day—the invoice-book says "Two tons at 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and is signed "F.R.," which appears to be in the prisoner's writing, and then there is "Two tons small, per G. G. Buzzey. J. White."—there is no entry in the stock-book at all—in each of those instances, Edwards, Bowden, and Fuell, he has only accounted for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he has not accounted for Russell or Buzzey's order at all—these documents, called "Expenditure accounts," were sent in weekly by the prisoner—I have gone through the amounts, and find cheques from the Directors paying for them which are all here, so that each of these expenditure accounts was satisfied each week by cheque—these two signatures (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are those of the directors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi>. I live at Maida Hill, and am manager of depots in the Metropolitan District of the Coal Consumers Association—we had a depot at Camberwell in October last, and the prisoner was employed to superintend it—it was his duty to keep certain books and to receive money for coals delivered—he had not to look after any other depots, but he had to go round to see the Kensington and Finchley Road Depots at times, to see that my system was carried out—he was my assistant—there are twelve depots, he was depot clerk at Camberwell, and when the other clerk left, I added other duties and increased his salary to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week—I opened an account at the Newington Butts branch bank for the current expenses of the Camberwell Depot—the prisoner sent in every week to the head office an account of his expenses, and they were paid by cheque ordinarily—he had not, to my knowledge, made any charge against the Company for expenses, beyond what had been paid, nor had he complained—he commenced his double duty in September—I saw him on the day he was taken in custody—the week's sheets showing money received by him, came up to me to be initialled before they were paid—those are the sheets which have been handed to Mr. Norris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the employ of the Company when Mr. Peter Martin was there—we had not always sufficient coals to supply our customers and then we could not deliver them—the banking account for expenses was opened on November 14th, 1873—I am not aware that Mr. Peter Martin did not hand in two cheques in August, amounting to 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to open this account for expenses—I did not tell him that I could not open the account with those two cheques, because I owed Mr. Tilley, the contractor 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no recollection of handing him back one of the cheques for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and asking him to change it as it was payable to his order—will not swear that I did not—cannot tell you whether he cashed it for me, and whether I paid Tilley 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it—I paid Tilley over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070113"></xptr>
               <p>did not retain the balance myself—I do not recollect handing him back the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and telling him to pay the week's expenditure out of it—he is here—I do not remember whether the week's expenditure came to 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or whether he handed me back 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I did not open the account at the bank till November, because I did not think proper to do so—it was left to my discretion by the directors to open it when I pleased—I did not use the two cheques to open the account in August, because Mr. Martin was about to leave the depot—I kept the money because it was required to pay the expenses of the depot; I kept the balance in hand—the weekly sheets were made up from Thursday morning to Wednesday evening, and I generally come on Thursday or Friday morning to examine the sheets—I used to pay Martin the amount of the expenditure sheet while he was there, and when he received the cheque on the following Wednesday, he sometimes handed it to me—he left the depot to go to the head office, and a man named Blake took his place—Blake was there more than three weeks—he got a small sum to the bad; I can't say whether it was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may have said that he had handed to me whatever amount he was wrong, but I don't remember it—how can I swear what I don't know anything about—there was no dispute between us as to whether he had handed it to me—if there had been I should have recollected it—there was a little arrear in Blake's account, but he did not say that it was through me, or that he had handed the sum to me—I never heard Rawlings say in my presence and Martin's, that owing to his having received no cheque from the office or cash from me—he had had to pay the men and trades people out of the money he had received for coal, but in my infirmity of deafness I cannot say—Martin is not deaf—I have given Rawlings papers authorising him to pay out of the accounts—I sanctioned his doing so when by any hitch I had not got the money—I did that twice, and you have got the two papers by which I sanctioned it—one was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cannot tell the amount of the other—that was not about the time I neglected to pay the 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank—it was before the banking account was opened, but I cannot say whether it was before I got the cheques in August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot fix any date for this affair with Martin, and the two cheques—if I had known you would ask me I would have refreshed my memory—it was during Mr. Martin's time, and the prisoner was not employed at Camberwell during Martin's time; he succeeded Blake—I did not think it prudent to open a banking account when there were charges at the depot—the account was opened on 4th November by 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid in, and it was always kept at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the account was opened Rawlings always received sufficient to make up for his expenditure—it was opened in the name of Jones and Rawlings—I only gave Rawlings authority on two occasions to pay expenses out of money received.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at one time in the service of this Coal Association—I entered at the commencement and took the management of the Camberwell depot, which I managed till 10th December, when I was removed to the head office—it was the course of business to take the orders, enter them in the order-book, place them in the invoice-book, and from thence to stock-book and to make out the weekly receipts from the stock-book—Wednesday was the day for payments for the week's expenditure, and it was made out up to that day—there were expenses sheets, which could be com pared with the weekly sheets, and if they did not tally the error must be detected—that was the old system—the expenses sheets and return sheets were charged and initialed by Mr. Jones—every shareholder in the association has a certain number of coupons, according to the number of shares he holds, and the amount of coal he is entitled to depends upon the number of his shares—I remember receiving two cheques in August from the head office, amounting to 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of opening an expenses account—one was for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I handed them to Mr. Jones, because he had shown me a letter a few days previously which he had received, and told me that I might expect that amount to open the account—he said that he could not do so on account of owing Mr. Tilley 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the previous week—I know that he is deaf, but I made him perfectly understand—he paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and put the balance in his pocket—he then gave me back the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, I endorsed it, cashed it and gave him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—the week's expenses had to be settled, amounting to 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and he paid me that out of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I subsequently received another cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, and gave it to Mr. Jones—at that time he had the whole 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his possession, but he had paid Tilley 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I left the depot, Mr. Blake took my place temporarily, and somehow got about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wrong—Mr. Blake said that he believed Mr. Jones had had the money—I don't know whether Jones could hear that, but he was informed of the fact I know—I cannot tell you what he said to it—I was present in the office on 17th October when Rawlings told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070115"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. Jones that he had received no cheque, and that he had paid expenses amounting to 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd out of the coal money, Mr. Jones said "I will give you a receipt for the money, stating that the pay sheet will owe that amount of money"—this is the paper Jones handed to him, with his signature to it; this other paper is also in Jones's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Pay Sheet, Dr. to Camberwell Depot, amount of sheet, week ending October 15th, 1873, 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. J. Bent Jones, October 17th, 1873"—"Camberwell Pay Sheet, October 22nd, 1873, owes Camberwell Depot 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. W.' Bent Jones, October 24th, 1873.") During Blake's time all the cheques were sent to me, and I numbered them and handed them to Mr. Jones—I always found the prisoner very attentive to his business, and he had onerous duties to perform, not only at his own office, but of all the depots.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I left the employ on 24th December—I was not discharged, I left before Rawlings—I gave notice because they would not pay me my salary—I put them in the Mayor's Court, and then they paid me—I received fifteen guineas and expenses—I joined the Camberwell Depot on 17th July, and was there till 10th September, when I was taken to the head office, but I always lived at the Camberwell depot; I continually went backwards and forwards and gave instructions—when I received these moneys for expenses there was no banking account, the same books were kept which are kept now—I kept them—when I went from Camberwell there was no complaint about any deficiency, and no charge against me of not having made proper accounts. Rawlings had a different system of books to what I had—I entered in the order-book the customers name, the amount to be paid, and the date—the invoice was entered in the stock-book when the money was received, not before—the pay sheet was prepared from the stock-book and sent in each week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The difference of system was this, Rawlings made out from his order-book on slips of paper the names of the different parties he was sending coals to and filled them in at his leisure into his stock-book—I was there to see that.</p>

I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this prisoner is indicted for a highway robbery upon this boy, now it seem to me, and Mr. Recorder agrees with me in thinking that the evidence does not amount to a robbery on the highway, for though he snatched the bundle away, yet there was not that degree of force nor of terror that is necessary for a party to be under to constitute a robbery, and it would be too much therefore to make it so serious an offence as the law considers a highway robbery to be; but you are at full liberty to find him guilty of the larceny, and acquit him of the capital part.</p>

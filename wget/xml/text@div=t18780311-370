                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Newton, of Honduras Wharf, Bankside, a fire-brick and building merchant—on Friday, 8th February, I received information from a man named Bridgman, and watched for a furniture van belonging to a man named Row—it came to the wharf about 7 o'clock—I watched it till 7.40—I afterwards saw Seymour and had a conversation with him—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went to breakfast—the van started; I followed it in a cab and stopped it in Trafalgar Square—I looked inside it and saw Mrs. Gilbert and the carman, the 25 foot tiles, which he had paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and two large paving tiles, covered over with a sack—I gave instructions to the carman—I followed the van to Gilbert's house, Little Pulteney Street, Golden Square—Mrs. Gilbert went upstairs and called me up—I saw the prisoner in a front room upstairs partly dressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. I said to Mrs. Gilbert "Something very wrong is going on here; how long has it been going on?"—she said "From three to four months"—I said "You had better make up your mind to come back to the office, and I recommend the carman to take them back"—the prisoner said "Let me bring them back in a cab"—Mrs. Gilbert said "We have had them away from the wharf and only paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert subsequently came back to the wharf—Mrs. Gilbert said "My husband and me have been talking it over since you left, and we have both made up our minds to make a clean breast of it and confess all"—Gilbert was the first to speak—I asked him how long it had been going on—he said from five to six months—Mr. or Mrs. Gilbert said "We have had three lots away this week"—Gilbert said "I hope you won't lock me up, on account of my little family; I hope to get some money in about Wednesday, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and then I will sign an agreement for anything which we can arrange"—to that Mr. Newton said he could not say anything, because the constables were waiting—Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert said that Seymour had been in the habit of going on Saturday night or Sunday morning and receiving sums of money from Gilbert and his wife, sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and if he had been there three times he would have received a sovereign—I called Seymour in and questioned him in the prisoner's presence—he denied at first, but afterwards said "Quite right"—they said "On Wednesday we paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 200 stock-bricks, but we had between 300 and 400"—Mrs. Gilbert said "We had them on Monday, my husband fetched them away himself."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Gilbert never saw the van, he was lying on a couch partly dressed, and covered with two blankets—Mrs. Gilbert unbuttoned her dress to find an invoice, but could not—I did not say "If you will tell the truth I will sack the foreman and let you off"—nothing was said about settling the matter—I did not go to Mr. Newton to see if we could arrange the matter without taking criminal proceedings—no deposi<lb></lb>tions were read over to us—if that is in the depositions I don't know how it came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Rowe, who keeps furniture vans—I have been employed by the prisoner to fetch materials from Honduras Wharf on different occasions—I went on 8th February—I saw Seymour and took from him 24 square paving stones, two large stones, and 10 small bricks—I was stopped by Smith, in Trafalgar Square, and by his directions went to Gilbert's house—Mrs. Gilbert gave me the order to fetch the tiles on this occasion—I had been once before that week—Gilbert had been with me, but not that week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I never received my instructions to go to Honduras Wharf from the prisoner, but always from Mrs. Gilbert—Gilbert was generally at home when I got there—I remained nine or ten minutes—I only went about half a dozen times—I believe Gilbert went to work at 6 a.m.—Smith said that Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert had better go and see Mr. Newton and see if they could settle the matter without taking criminal proceedings—Mrs. Gilbert was very agitated and Mr. Gilbert appeared stupefied—he was ill and seemed distressed at what his wife was doing—I did not hear her say anything about the van going on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was not asked as to what I heard when before the Magistrate—I have known Gilbert eight months—he used to pay Mr. Rowe—Smith's exact words were "You had better come over to Mr. Newton and see if you can settle the matter."</p>

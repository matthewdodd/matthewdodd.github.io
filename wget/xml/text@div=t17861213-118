               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Wiltshire and Marriott, the prisoners came into the shop and asked to look at some muslin, I shewed them several pieces, and they could not find any that would suit them till they had tumbled several pieces, then they went out and did not buy any; after they had gone out I observed a piece of muslin was wanting, and I immediately pursued them and brought them back into the shop, and examined them, and a piece of muslin dropped from one of them, but I did not see it drop, they said they knew nothing about it, they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Did you see them take the muslin at all? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>You did not suspect them before they went out? - No.</p>

               <p>Are you quite sure it could not drop from the counter? - I am quite sure it did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. James, did you take the trouble to go before the Justice? - Not that evening.</p>

               <p>So your governors are at home now? - Yes; I stood behind.</p>

             when she had dropped it? - He was going to begin.</p>
               <p>Why he has told us he had searched her? He had begun when she threw it down.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear Sir, that he had searched her? - He had begun to search her.</p>
               <p>Will you tell us what you call an incipient searching, and what you call a compleat searching? - I never searched one, I do not know whether he did or not compleatly, I was behind them; and he was in the back shop, I know he had began.</p>
               <p>What had he done towards searching her? - She opened her cloak, and that was the time I saw the muslin going down from her.</p>
               <p>Had not Dawson compleated his search? - I do not know he had.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say he had not? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. James this was nine yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not made up close? - It was made up as muslins are, it was close out of the piece, it was not open from one end to the other.</p>
               <p>Was it not open? - It might have been open.</p>
               <p>Was not it loose when it fell on the ground? - It was not loose.</p>
               <p>Was it folded tight? - As muslins are, just as we put them up in paper.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath at the time this was picked up from the ground, had it not been opened, or was it close and firm? - It was rather close.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a linen draper? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Did you say to your friend Dawson, did not you see her drop it down on the ground, if you did not you must be blind, for I saw it distinctly? - I do not remember saying so, I do not recollect it, I was not before the Justice till I went to the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go before the Justice? - I was very busy in the shop, I thought it was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see either of these women take the muslin? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who else was in the shop? - Another young man.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Coleman.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nobody but you three in the shop at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the muslin in the usual folds? - I have it in my pocket, it was just as it is now (Produced.) This is the piece of muslin that is my masters property, I gave it to Dawson.</p>
               <p>Dawson. It is the same piece, it is my masters property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Dawson. Did Drudge tell you what she wanted this linen for? - No</p>
               <p>Did not she say the wanted it for baby linen? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DRUDGE'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When the gentleman called me in, I said I was very willing to go back; and Mr. Dawson said he did not see me drop it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CLARK'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to James. Do you remember Coleman turning over the muslins on the counter after the prisoners returned, looking for it? - No, I did not see him, he might, I was serving a customer at the other end of the shop, he might look them over, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him or did you not? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Can you say then whether this piece did not drop from the counter where it was laying, did she not stand so near the counter that her cloak touched the counter? - I believe she did, she had a loose cloak on, she stood quite close to the counter.</p>
               <p>Then can you undertake to say, that as she stood so very near the counter, the muslin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130147"></xptr> might have dropped from the counter, and have appeared to have dropped from her cloak? - One side of her cloak just leaned to the counter: I am very sure I saw the muslin drop, as plain as any thing in the world from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. What is the value of the muslin? - Two guineas and nine pence is the prime cost.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Drudge called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Clark called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

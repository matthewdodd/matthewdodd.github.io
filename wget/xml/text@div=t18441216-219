                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Nicholls—he lives at No. 72, Quadrant, Regent-street, and deals in shawls—the prisoner was in my service three months—she was so on the 28th of Nov. From something I had heard I sent for a constable, and searched the prisoner's box in her presence—I found a crape collar, some blond, and a piece of holland—these are them—I said they were mine—the prisoner said they were her own—they are my husband's—the prisoner was given into custody—I searched her box after that, and found some ribbon and another lace collar, which are my hus<lb></lb>band's—I had missed the crape collar some time previous—I had used it for my own wear, and it was in my bed-room in a box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Nicholls. I saw these things taken out of the prisoner's box—the box was locked, and she had the key of it—after these things were found, this habit-shirt was found on the prisoner—it is mine—I had it for my own wear—it had been in a box in my bed-room, which is a different room to my sister-in-law's—I had missed it, and asked the prisoner if she had seen it—she said she had not—when she was searched it was found in a black apron tied round her waist.</p>

                  </hi>. Last Saturday week I was at a beer shop, kept by Harrington, at Edgware, playing at skittles—the prisoner was there, setting up the skittles for us—before I began to play, I took off my coat, and tucked it down between a piece of wood and a board—I was playing for an hour or more; I afterwards went to look for my coat, and it was gone—I missed the prisoner out of the skittle alley, and I went to look after him—I could not find him—I did not miss any one else—I gave information to the police—between 12 and 1 o'clock at night I was knocked up by the policeman—I went with him to the station, and there saw my coat—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a handkerchief in it, that I tie up my victuals in when I go to work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Edgware. Last Saturday week I was going to the Crystal Palace beer shop, and, passing over a bridge on the premises, I saw the prisoner looking over the bridge—I asked him what was his <hi rend="italic">game</hi>—he made some reply, and I saw a coat drop from under his frock—I then went into the beer shop, and after a little while I heard that Wedlock had lost his coat—I mentioned what I had seen.</p>

In consequence of some information last Saturday week, I went in search of the prisoner—I found him in a barn about a mile and a half from the place—I found this coat with him—there was another man lying near—I asked the prisoner if he knew anything of the coat that was lying by his side—he said, no, he had no recollection of a</p>

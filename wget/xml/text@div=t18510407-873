                  <hi rend="italic">had at one time held, that in a charge of this nature an assault was involved; that opinion had been overruled, but subsequently adopted. The question was, whither this was a case within the Statute. The Statute said, that where the offence charged involved an assault, then the prisoner might be found guilty. To inquire whether the offence charged, involved an assault, you must look to the language of the indictment, and to that alone; and whether this indictment did mention the word "assault," or not, did not signify, because it was clear that it need not be mentioned. The question came to this, whether in stating an the face of an indictment that a prisoner had carnal connection with a girl under ten years of age, you state that he committed an assault. Me was very much disposed to think that as connection could not take place without contact, that contact without consent amounted to an assault. A child under ten years of age was incapable of giving her consent; and if any consent were in term given, it would be wholly inoperative; he therefore thought it might be considered that an assault was involved, and that a person might be found guilty of an assault under this indictment.

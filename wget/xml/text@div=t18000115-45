               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you present at the time the horse was brought to your yard? - A. No; it was brought by a stranger that the ostler at the Maiden-head, in St. Giles's, sent it with.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the horse in the possession of the prisoner? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bishop.) What time was it that your servant delivered the horse to Marsden? - A. On the Sunday about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Hollingsworth. I took the prisoner the very next day, after my master heard of the horse being stopped, somewhere about the beginning of December, at No. 1, Portland-street, he lodged there; when we were coming out, Mr. Langhorne asked him if he remembered receiving the money for a black horse, on the 18th of November; he said he did; Mr. Langhorne then informed him that it was a stolen horse; he said he would give us information where he got the horse, but he must step home to his wife first; then I walked after him, to see that he went to his house, and, instead of going to his house, he ran through the passage, caught hold of the back door, and kept me in the house; I recollected the next house, and got over the wall; by that time he had got out of his own yard to the next premises, over another wall, and was trying to get in at the back part of the house, but the door was fast; I asked him why he ran away, as he told me he could tell the person that he had the horse of; I told him he had better go with me; he said he would if I would let him go over the wall, which I did; and then he gave a spring from me, and went over a number of back premises, and I after him; he then got into the farmer's yard, and when he got there the back door was open, and he went through the house, and I after him; at last he ran into a butcher's shop, and there I took him; I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you mention one word of this before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you bound over by the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story you have told to-day, and yet the Justice did not bind you over to give evidence here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been talking to any body about it, have you? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that gentleman, Mr. Gould? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him? - A. No, not to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. During the sessions, in the yard? - A. No; I have never seen Mr. Gould; I saw him in our yard before the Sessions began, and Mr. Gould was in the yard when we came home from apprehending Snook.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about a forty pound reward, if this man is convicted, and that you should have a good part of it? - A.Not to my knowledge; I never took a man in my life before; I did not take him for a forty pound reward; I took him for my master's security.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no conversation with Mr. Gould, about a forty pound reward, that you were to get a good part of? - A. I do not recollect any thing of it; Mr. Gould may come forward, and talk about it, but not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never stole a horse in life; the rest I leave to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I lost these out of my left hand side pocket, on Thursday. the 16th of May, at about two o'clock; I was coming along by <placeName id="t18160529-120-crimeloc645">St. George's watchhouse</placeName>

I stopped to look at them; I felt some thing press my pocket, but did not take much notice. I brought my hand down, and immediately missed my leather bag, containing my money. I looked round, and the prisoner had his left hand in his breast, with the bag between his fingers; he could not hide it, and I got hold of him, and said you have been picking my pocket. The people said hold him, for he is a pick-pocket, and then he made a start from me for five or six yards; but I caught him, and gave him into the custody of an officer.</p>

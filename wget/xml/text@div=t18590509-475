               <p>Wednesday, 4th May, I was in the warehouse—the prisoner came in for some stamps—I did not see him come in—the first I noticed was hearing the last witness say, "This is a had half-crown"—and he said, "It is not the first I have had from you"—he produced the other half-crown, and said, "You gave me this some days ago"—I think he named the day—I had seen the prisoner at Mr. Barclay's before—I can't say how long before, but I was familiar with his coming in and out—I followed the prisoner from the shop to George-street, behind the Mansion House—he then went to Change-alley. As we were going along, a person made several attempts to speak to the prisoner—I saw him several times as we were going along between Bucklersbury and Change-alley—he crossed us several times, and went round and met the prisoner—I was two or three yards from the pri<lb></lb>soner—the other man did not speak to the prisoner—he made signs; and I went up to him and said, "It is no go"—when we were in Change-alley, the prisoner said to me, "What is it o'clock?"—I said, "I don't know"—at that time there was a sound as of money falling on the stones—there was no other person standing near us—we were quite alone—the prisoner was standing over a grating at that time—after I heard the chink, the prisoner left Change-alley and walked by the side of the Exchange—I saw an officer and gave him in custody—I then went with the officer to the place where I had heard the chink of money—I pointed out the grating to the officer—I looked down and saw the half-crown lying down the grating—I went in the house and got the housekeeper to get the half-crown—I gave it to the officer—I was close behind the housekeeper when she picked it up—I never lost sight of it—I then went back to the warehouse—I there saw another half-crown taken from the till, and also a florin—I did not receive them; they were given to the officer—I think Mr. Parry gave him the half-crown, and Mr. Clegg the florin.</p>

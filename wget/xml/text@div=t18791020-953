                  </hi>. I am an oilman, at 63, Cannon Street Road East—on 20th August I was in Aldridge's yard, St. Martin's Lane, and saw the prisoner and another man, who in the prisoner's presence said to me "Will you just come out and see a horse at the back; these men want to buy it; they say the horse is 10 years old; it was only five when I bought it, and I have had it nine months, therefore it cannot be more than six; would you mind coming round to see it?"—I said "All right"—I had had no conversation with them before—I went round to a place in Newport Market, Prince's Road, at the back of Aldridge's, leaving the prisoner in the yard, and when I got there I found the owner of the horse and the prisoner and another man together, but do not know how they got there—I do not know the neighbourhood—I was taken to a shed, and the three men were bartering about the horse—the owner wanted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and the prisoner offered, him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he would not sell it on any terras, as he</p>

               <p>paid they hud cheated him by charging him with the trap to try it in for two hours during the day—they all three wanted me to Buy it, and the prisoner said 'If you will buy it for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we will give you 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I will not have anything to do with it,; get one of your own men to buy if—he said "If one of our own men got hold of it he would not turn it up to us again, finding it was such a good one; besides, it is no use us trying to buy it, the man won't sell it to any of our men"—he said this in the owner's hearing and the others' in the shed—eventually the prisoner and the other man said "If you will buy it we will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for buying it, as we want it for a traveller's trap in Canterbury to-morrow, and it must go away to-night"—the owner was still in the shed, but not in earshot, but it was said again afterwards in his hearing—I did not agree to it then, but they fetched me round there again shortly afterwards—they fetched me from Aldridge's five or six limes, and kept repeating the offer till it got from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., until it reached 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the premium they were to give mo for my foolishness, and I said "Well, I'll give it you," and I paid the money in cash to the man as we were walking together from the shed about 20 yards from the Cock public-house, and we all went in together, and the seller asked for pen and ink—the prisoner's friend said to him "I'll be back in a minute, Tom; stop there," and went away—the seller of the horse instantly handed me the receipt signed in the name of Smith, and then he went and the prisoner followed him immediately, and as he was leaving I said "Where are you going?"—he said "The master is at the next public-house; you had better come down there and have it settled, but first look after the horse"—the horse was in a shed about 20 yards away—I went to the next public-house, but saw none of the three there—I did not follow the prisoner as I had the horse to look after—I thought I had better take the horse, as I could see it was a sell—I took it down the court and led it rouud to all the public-houses I could find to see if I could find the men—I took it to Aldridge's and explained matters to Mr. Freeman, and it was put up for sale next day and fetched 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next saw the prisoner on 11th September standing against a wall in Stapleton's yard, Bishopsgate, talking to another man—I started to fetch a constable—as I passed him he paw me and turned round arid made for the street—I followed him closely and gave him in charge—I had been to Aldridge's almost every sale day since 20th August to look for him, but never saw him—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I parted with my money because the man who was selling the horse appeared to be a gentleman, and was dressed well and spoke well—he said his conscience would not allow him to take the money these people had offered him—I was induced to part with the money first because I thought I was doing the man a service and secondly because of the temptation of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium.

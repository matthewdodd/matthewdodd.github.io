I am a manure dealer, of 35, Room Street, Limehouse—on 25th March, about 11 p.m., I was at the corner of Cromer Street, having previously been into a public-house with a woman named Sarah Verden—she was still with me—some one tripped me up, and gave me a black eye—I felt my watch go from the chain—this is the chain—I was stunned—I had my watch quite safe when I came out of the public-house—the woman could not have knocked me down—I suffered much pain and weakness from loss of blood—I was attended by a doctor.</p>

               <p>between 11 and 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the next bar—Mr. Oakley was with us—he went away—I left the public with Stone—Stone was tripped up from behind—I was walking in front—I saw the prisoner and another man—the other man ran away—the prisoner snatched Stone's watch and ran across Gray's Inn Road—I informed the police and gave them a description of the prisoner—I met him the next day and gave him in charge.</p>

             . On the second of this month I had been taking leave of my brother in the Minories between eight and nine at night, who is gone on board the Inspector privateer; and as I was coming towards Simmond's Inn in Chancery Lane, I crossed the Fleet Market, and saw several girls together: I asked them whether that was not the way to Gough's Square? they told me it was. I went seven or eight yards up the alley, and they told me I must turn on the left, which is an alley called <placeName id="t17451016-23-crimeloc127">George Alley</placeName>

The next day, which was Thursday, I went out of town, and did not return till Saturday, and then I applied to find these women out, but could not find them: and on Sunday I went again , and found these two women in a mob in a quarrel between seven and eight in the evening. I got a constable, but when I went there they were gone. I went again on Monday, and saw them at the end of George Alley with two or three more with them, and took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Priscella Saunders. What gown had I on then?</p>

               <p>Q. When you were got into Shoe Lane, don't you think if you had made a fresh pursuit then you would have had more probability of meeting with them than four or five days afterwards?</p>
               <p>Russell. My Lord, through the Timination and the terror of it, I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you mention this to first?</p>
               <p>Russell . To one Mr. Porter, who keeps the coach and horses near St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going then?</p>

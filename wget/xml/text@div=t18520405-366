                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 225). I attended at the police-office, at Brentford, when the prisoner was examined on this charge—Ann Sullivan was examined in the prisoner's presence, and the prisoner was asked if she wished to put any questions to her—Ann Sullivan's deposition was taken down in writing—she is not here—she has been recently confined—I have a certificate here—I saw her in bed this morning—I saw the baby.</p>
               <p>The deposition was read, as follows:—Ann Sullivan saith, "I am the wife of William Sullivan, of Old Brentford, greengrocer; the prisoner and her husband had been lodging at my house; on 27th Feb. the prisoner's husband left to go to work, and on Monday the prisoner came to fetch her things; I purchased some little books of her; she gave me two shillings to pay the rent; a person came in directly afterwards and said one of the shillings was bad; the shilling produced is one she gave me; I gave it to the policeman."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at Old Brentford. The prisoner came to me on 1st March, between 1 and 2 o'clock, just before I went to dinner—she tendered me eight shillings—one was bad, this is it—here is the mark of the "trier" on it—the date was 1818—when I told her it was bad, she asked me to wrap it in a piece of paper, and keep it separate from other money—she said she took it in change for a half sovereign—I gave it her back.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house at New Brentford. On 1st March the prisoner came and called for half a quartern of gin, two <hi rend="italic">outs</hi>—she had another woman with her—the prisoner gave me a good half crown—I gave in change two Queen's shillings, and fourpence in halfpence—I am positive the shillings I gave her were good—the prisoner took up the halfpence first,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050013"></xptr>
               <p>and then she took up one shilling—my attention was called to the other customers in the bar—I just turned my head and heard the prisoner chinking the shillings on the bar-door—one of these fell down—I stooped and picked it up, and found it was soft, and a bad one—it was not one that I gave her—they were Queen's, and this was George III.—I said, "I suspected this a long while from you, I have been watching you from information"—I went to the door to look for a policeman—I did not see one—I came in again, and the prisoner still persisted that she did not give me a bad shilling—having many customers, and my wife not there, I gave the prisoner another shilling, and kept the bad one, and marked it.</p>

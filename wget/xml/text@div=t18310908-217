On the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came there with a person taller than himself, and had a pint of beer; they went away at eleven, came again about two, and had a glass of ale; I then went into the back room, leaving them alone in the front of the bar - I returned in about five minutes, and the prisoner was gone- his companion asked for a glass of gin and water; I went to call somebody to make it, then he said, "Never mind, I'll call again in five minutes," and went away; between four and five o'clock somebody came to borrow some money -I got the till out from under the counter, and there was only five or six new sixpences in it; the money-box was gone - I saw it there between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did not the prisoner frequent your house? A. No, never; I have been there two or three years - I am not quite sure the clock had struck three when he left; I was backwards and forwards from the bar to the room behind.</p>

            . I am the son of the prosecutrix. -On the 18th of August, in the afternoon, a woman came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080099"></xptr>borrow some money; I examined the till, and the tin box was gone, which contained about 25l. in money altogether, besides papers - there were half-crowns in it, one of which I had marked overnight - I gave information to Brown almost directly; when the prisoner was taken I saw three half-crowns, one of which I had marked - (looking at it) I cannot positively swear this is it, but think it is.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Would he not have to reach over a considerable way to take it? A. No, I could do it - the mark on the half-crown is a scratch on the rim; I made it with my teeth - it is the mark, to the best of my belief; - there were a great many half-crowns in the box, and a bill of 300l.; I have found none of the contents.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q.What is your belief of the halfcrown? A. To the best of my belief it is the one I marked overnight.</p>

             I am an officer. I went in pursuit of the prisoner and his companion, and took the prisoner opposite the prosecutor's house on the following morning; I found this half-crown, with three others, and 10s. 6d. in silver besides; I found some keys, which he said belonged to his tool-chest, and went to his lodgings, but there was no tool-chest there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You ascertained from himself where he lodged? A. No - the key fitted a box I found there; I found no money.</p>

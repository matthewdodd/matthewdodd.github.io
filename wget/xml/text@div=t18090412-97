            . On the 14th of January the prisoner lodged in the same house with me; she asked me to come and nurse her child while she went to market; she asked me if I had locked my door; I told her yes, but I had left the key in it; I asked her to leave the door ajar, that I might hear if any body went up stairs; she returned in about half an hour, and said she did not get change for a one pound note, would I stop a little longer; I said I would; then she was about three quarters of an hour before she returned again, and in that time my husband came home. I went up stairs to my room, leaving her room; my husband was never out of the room, nor I was never out of the house after that. On Sunday morning my husband asked me to give him a waistcoat out of the drawer, I went to my drawer, it was stripped. I lost all the articles contained in the indictment.</p>

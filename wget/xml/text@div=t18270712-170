            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Sunday, the 1st of July, about half-past ten o'clock I and Parker were at Hornsey-lane-end, and saw the prisoner driving a cart, apparently loaded with hay, towards town; we stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said nothing but hay, which he was taking to his master, at the Sluice-house - I turned the hay up, and found a quantity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120063"></xptr>of timber; I asked whose cart and horse it was; he said he did not know. There was no name on it - he said his master had bought the timber of Mr. Fox - I took him back to Fox - he then said he did not buy it there, that he got it at the Jolly Butchers public-house; the cart and horse turned out to belong to Faint, of the Sluice-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not you know he was a servant at the Sluice-house? A. No. I saw a man on Fox's premises that night - he has absconded.</p>

            . I am an officer, stationed at Southgate. I met the officers with this cart and timber - I went to Fox's, and searched the premises - I found marks of a cart wheel at the back of the premises; they were very recently made, and the timber there appeared the same sort as that in the cart; one piece is large, and would take two men to put into the cart; the rest are planks.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and keep the Sluice-house. This cart and horse is mine- my wife had lost the number of it; I had sent to Somerset-house for another, but it had not come. I had my brother from the country shortly before, and sent him for the hay. I know nothing of the timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the gardener on that day? A. Yes; he had an opportunity of speaking to the prisoner. I had told my brother to fence the field round, that the cattle should not go out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for the hay, and some person at Fox's took the cart, and put the wood into it- the hay was put on the top.</p>

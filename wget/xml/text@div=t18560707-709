                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at No. 2, Dorset-street, Ratclife. On 24th June I was with William Leonard, at the Turk's Head, Caroline-street, about 2 o'clock in the night, but it was daylight—a few minutes after I had been there the prisoner came in—I had never seen him before—we were talking about sailing up and down the river—the prisoner interfere, and made out that we knew nothing about sailing—there was a little dispute between me and him, and he called me a black legged son of a bitch—no blows were exchanged, but I left the house, and Leonard came out and sat on a step close behind where I was standing—the prisoner walked by me, and passed down the street—I followed him to the Ship public house—he stopped, and I came up to him—ho had his hand behind his back, and said, "You are a b—black leg," and struck me on the upper lip with a pen<lb></lb>knife—I fell from the blow, and, before I had time to get up, he struck me another blow on the cheek—he also struck me, just as Leonard came up, on the back of the head, and said, "Take that"—Leonard called out, "Police!" and "Murder!"—a policeman came in about five minutes, and the prisoner was taken—I had not struck him, or given him any provocation whatever—I had been drinking a little, but was nothing the worse.</p>

               <p>Dorset-street very nigh five years—my mother keeps a house there, a respectable private house—I do not know any person that goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Scotckey</hi>, but I have heard them talking about her—I was not with any woman that night, nor was Leonard while I was with him—I had not seen Leonard for two years, but met him that night, about half past 1 o'clock—that was the first time I had seen him, and we went into the Turk's Head to have a drop of brandy—I did not meet him near the Turk's Head, but very nigh a quarter of a mile off—when he came out of the public house, I followed him, because I did not know what he wanted of me—I followed him twelve or fifteen yards; Leonard was about a yard and a half behind me; he was about twenty yards behind me when I got up to the prisoner—I said nothing to the prisoner; that I swear; not half a word; but he said, "You are a b—old black leg"—I was not able to defend myself being rather the worse for drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you ask him for his money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me ask him for his money!—Leonard and I did not follow him, and ask him for his money—the prisoner was not down on the ground to my knowledge, but I was; he was never on the ground at all—if the policeman says that when he came up I was on the top of the prisoner, that is false—I did not call out, "Police!" Leonard did—I had not my hand in the prisoner's pocket, that I swear, nor ever in any other man's—that is Mr. Keefe, the landlord of the Turk's Head—I know him well—I mean to say that a single word, and a score of words, passed between me and the prisoner in that public house—I there was a quarrel, just a sort of argument; it seems to appear that it was a very angry one—I saw no woman there—there was not a woman with the prisoner whom I had been speaking to before I went to that public house at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Caroline-street, Ratcliffe, and have been in the service of the Trinity Company twelve years, and am still On 24th June I was with Neil at the Turk's Head, about half past 2 o'clock in the morning—we were talking about sailing, and the prisoner came in and interfered with us—Neil went out, and went down our alley—I waited while the prisoner went out, and walked out after him—I sat down on the butcher's step, and saw Neil leaning on a post—I had had a drop to drink, but knew what I was about—when the prisoner and prosecutor were together, I came up with my eyes as if I had just woke up, and ran down, and saw the prisoner strike Neil with his hands, I thought, but I took the prisoner by his hands, and he had a knife—Neil was lying on the ground, bleeding—I saw him strike Neil one blow, but what he gave him before I cannot say—I never saw so much blood in a human being in my life—I shouted, "Police!" and in four or five minutes a policeman came—I had been drinking, but had a good deal of my senses about me—Cox, the police constable, gave nie a very nice rub with his elbow, and I got a very nice character from the prisoner, but I am not a paramour of women, though Mr. Pelham stated it in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi>, and I may lose my character through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Neil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since his infancy, we were brought up together—I met him going home that night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070060"></xptr>
               <p>but had only seen him twice these five years—I was with him about a minute before we went into the Turk's Head—it is about 120 yard off and I walked there with him—I did not see the prisoner before we got into the public house—there was no female with him—I do not know a person who goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Scotchey</hi> a prostitute, I do not know who the girl is at all—I had been with no woman but Cox—the policeman took me for a person who had been with <hi rend="italic">Scotchey</hi>, he swore that I was there, but I was not—we were in the public house about half an hour—the prisoner left not half a minute before I followed him—I was sitting on the step when Neil crossed over, I do not know what he crossed over for, on my oath—I saw him leaning on a post on the opposite side of the street, as we men do for hours at a time—I did not see Neil go down the street, I dozed off for about half a minute's sleep—I went down the street because I saw Neil receiving a blow, but I did not know that there was a knife—I only saw one blow—there was not another blow after I got there—I heard a rumbling noise which opened my eyes when I was in a dream, and happened to look at these persons, who were about twenty yards down the street—I just opened my eyes in time to see a blow struck, and before he had time to strike another I had him by the wrist—I did not see where the prisoner went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any pretence for saying that you were with a woman named <hi rend="italic">Scotchey</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, and no other girl, it was not me I can swear, and bring witnesses to prove it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN'M'KEW</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 87). On 24th June I was on duty just outside the Turk's Head, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor there—I saw a blow struck, but as I came to the end of Narrow-street, I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor on top of the prisoner, and the prisoner with a knife in his hand—the prosecutor was bleeding very much, there was a great quantity of blood, Neil was quite insensible—I lifted him up and gave him to Leonard, who came up just at that time and kept him up, as he was not able to stand—I did not see him lay hold of the prisoner—I saw this penknife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, he opened his hand for me to take it—neither of them said a word, but I took the prisoner in custody in consequence of what I saw—Leonard assisted the prosecutor till we met a policeman—he went about 200 yards and was obliged to fall, we took him on a stretcher to the station—the prisoner said going along, that he was on his way home when he met a young woman who asked him for a pint of beer, and said that he would give it to her if she could find a place open, and she took him into the Turk's Head, and that on his way out he was followed by three, who knocked him down at a little distance from the shop, and he had nothing else to defend himself with but a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

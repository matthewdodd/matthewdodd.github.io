From information I received, on Tuesday, 22nd Aug., about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to No. 13, Ealing-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey—Florio lives there—I was watching—before I went to the house I observed Foreman draw up to the house with a van belonging to Mr. Pyle—I was in private clothes, and was within about twenty or thirty yards of the house—MR. Pyle is a ginger beer manufacturer—I saw his name on the van—when the van stopped I observed Foreman go info Florio's house—he came out in a few minutes, and took a box, con<lb></lb>taining ginger beer bottles, out of the van—I afterwards saw a boy, who was with Foreman on the van, take in two other boxes—after the third box had been carried in, I went in, in company with another officer—I found Florio taking the bottles out of the boxes which had been taken into his house—Foreman was in there also—I told Foreman that he must consider himself in my custody, for stealing the boxes and bottles from his employer—he made no answer—I afterwards told Florio that he must consider himself in custody also, for receiving the same, well knowing them to be stolen—he made no answer at the time—I searched the premises, and found three other boxes belonging to Mr. Pyle, with the name defaced—the name had been branded on the boxes, but there were no remains of the name—I found them in the front room—one of them was full of bottles, containing ginger beer, and the others were empty—Florio said they were his own boxes—a wooden tray was there also, which he said was his own make—I found about twelve gross of ginger beer bottles—MR. Pyle said, in the prisoner's presence, that he believed all the boxes to be his, and likewise the bottles, from the system of robbery which had been carried out—Florio said, I will give you half of the bottles, and the boxes you have got, if you will not charge us"—we were then taking the boxes out at the door—I have here a printed bill which was posted on the shutters—I also saw this card in the front room—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Foreman and Co., from R. Pyle's, improved ginger beer makers, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bottle; manufactory, No. 3, Parrot's-buildings, Willow-walk.")—I afterwards examined the van, and found that it contained eight dozen of ginger beer—I took the prisoners into custody, and took them to the station—I had sent for Mr. Pyle, and he came to the shop about an hour after I got there—he gave them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ginger beer maker, at No. 12, Willow-walk, Shoreditch. Foreman was in my employ at this time; Florio had been in toy employ about eighteen months before—from information I received on 22nd Aug., I went to Florio's house, in Ealing-place, Bermondsey, about 2 o'clock—I found two policemen there, and the two prisoners—I saw three boxes there, with the name cut out of them; they are here—the name was on each side—I made the boxes myself, and put my name on both sides with a branding iron—I have the pattern here by which I used to cut out the holes (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it exactly fits—a carpenter, who used to work for me, made this pattern two years ago, and left it behind, and I have made use of it ever since—I saw a tray, and some ginger beer bottles—bottles are things that we cannot swear to, when they get out of our sight—I firmly believe they are mine, they are the same kind of bottles—I have missed a great quantity; it has cost me 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for bottles this</p>

               <p>season, and it has no business to cost me so much—my bottles have no peculiar mark—the maker's name, "Vaughan," is on a great many of them—he is the maker I have my bottles from, and that name was on a great many of the bottles I saw at Florio's house—I missed about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bottles in three or four weeks—Florio is not a customer of mine; I was not aware that he carried on business on his own account after he went over the water—he was on this side of the water—Foreman left me for a week, and they went partners together; then he came and asked me to take him back, which I did, because it was very inconvenient; I did not know half my customers—Florio then went over the water, and it seems they have been carrying on business with my van and my bottles—Foreman had no authority to take any of my boxes or bottles.</p>

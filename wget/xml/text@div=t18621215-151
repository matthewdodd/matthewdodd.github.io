                  </hi>. I am a-ticket writer, of 3, Essex-street, Mile<lb></lb>end—on the night of 23d November, I was at the Durham Arms, Salisbury-street, Strand, about half-past 11—to go home I had to go along Northamp<lb></lb>ton-street—the turning goes round, and leads right to my house—at the corner there is a door which goes back, where two or three could stand—as I was passing there I was pounced upon by two men—one I can recollect; the other had the goods—I was hit under both ears—I can't swear with what—they swelled immensely—it appeared something harder than a fist—I fell down from the blows, and one of the men fell on me, and covered me, being a big man—he tried to throttle me under the ear, and I lost my senses—when I recovered I found myself at my own house, with two police<lb></lb>men, and my neck bruised—I was only confined a day to my house—I lost a hat, a handkerchief, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—the prisoner is the man who fell on me, and who was found on the top of me—I described the persons of the men who had attacked me, and was afterwards sent for to Bethnal-green—I attended there, at the station, and picked the prisoner out from four other men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 133). I received a description from the pro<lb></lb>secutor of the men who had attacked him, and also from a witness who is here—on the 30th, after having that description, the prisoner was taken up for drunkenness, and was at the Bethnal-green station—I went and fetched the prosecutor and the witness West—the prisoner was placed in a room with three other men—Mr. Sparks said, when he saw him, "That is the man who knocked me down," and West looked at him, and said, "To the beat of my belief, that is the man"—the prisoner had been locked up on the Saturday night, for being drunk and riotous, and this was on the Sunday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 3, Northampton-street—on Sunday night, 23d November, about half-past 11, I was in that street, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and a man on top of him—I could not swear to the man—the prisoner very much resembles him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Waterlow, stationers, London Wall—on 19th November, about 12.30, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a sheet of penny postage stamps—I gave them to him, and he tendered a coin which purported to be a sovereign—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found it to be light—I asked the prisoner to stop—he made no reply, but opened the door and ran out into London Wall, taking the stamps with him—he ran as fast as he possibly could—when he got a short distance ho dropped the stamps—I picked them up, went after him, and caught him—I said "Come back"—he said he did not know it was a bad one—I had not said anything to him about it—I took him back to the warehouse, and gave him in charge to a constable with the coin.</p>

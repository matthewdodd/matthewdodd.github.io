            . I was going to Hackney to see some relation there the 15th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Waters. I live with Lady Essex. I stopped at London Wall with some acquaintance drinking. and got rather too much liquor; I wanted to take a coach in Bishopsgate-street, but could not get one. Going up <placeName id="t17630114-12-crimeloc60">Shoreditch</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17630114-12-crimeloc60" type="placeName" value="Shoreditch"></interp>

I asked her, what kind of a room she had? she gave it a very good character, and said, she would use me very well. I went with her to her room, then she asked me what I would give her to drink? I said, what she liked she should have; she said, she would only have a quartern of gin. Then I said, I would go to bed; said she, you will pay me for the room first; I asked her, what she must have? she said, half a crown; I said, I would not give her above 18 d. she agreed. Then I went to bed, she began to undress herself, and I fell asleep in a minute or two I believe; then she took my buckles out of my shoes, my watch, and about 7 s. in money, and this hat that I have in my hand; one of the buckles was left under the pillow: when I awaked there was no body in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took the things, you did not see her?</p>
               <p>Waters. She was found drunk, rolling in the channel, a person went to take her to a public house, and the watchman hearing a knocking at a door, went and took her to the watch-house, as I was afterwards informed, there my things were found upon her. There came two watchmen to me and awaked me, I was surprized and did not know where I was; they told me, I had been robbed; I went to search my breeches, and found no money left; I went to the watch-house with them, and there I found the prisoner, my watch, one buckle, and my hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blisset. I am constable. Between 11 and 12 at night, I think the 15th of November, two of our watchmen brought the prisoner into the watch-house, in a very dirty condition. I said, what have you brought here? We took her in; she had a black cloak or capuchine on, under which I saw a laced hat. I said, what have you got here? how came you by this hat? Said she, it is my husband's. Said I, is your husband a gentleman's servant? Yes, said she, but what is that to you? I said, I had a suspicion she had taken it from somebody, and ordered the men to search her pocket. She pulled out the key of her room. I saw the string of a watch hang out. Said I, you have a watch there. She said, yes, and what is that to you? Then in searching we found an odd silver buckle. I asked her where her husband lived? She said here and there, and gave very different accounts. Some of our watchmen happened to know that she lodged in Shoreditch, I sent them to find her lodging out, and gave them her key; they went and found her lodging, and this man in bed asleep, they brought him with them; he owned the things we found upon her. ( Produced in court and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say upon seeing him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140010"></xptr>Blisset. She said very little then; she had been very saucy when we took the things from her.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether I did not deliver them, and the key of the room to go and fetch the man?</p>
               <p>Blisset. She did not deliver them, we took them from her; she gave me the key of the room to go and fetch her husband. When the prosecutor came, I asked him if this woman was his wife, he said, No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The man asked me to go for a pot of purl, I said I did not care to go to leave him in my room; he gave me the things out of his pocket, to satisfy me he would take nothing while I was gone, I could not find my own hat, he put his own hat upon my head; I went out, and got into company, and was ill used in the street; I had no occasion to be taken to the watch-house, I begg'd of the watchmen to take me there.</p>

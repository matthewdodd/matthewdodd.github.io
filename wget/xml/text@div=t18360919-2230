                  </hi>. I carry on business in Tower-street. On Thursday last I was at a subscription skittle-ground, at the Mason's Arms, in Horse<lb></lb>monger-lane—I played at skittles—the prisoner came in after had been there some time—I had been drinking—I left off playing about half-past nine o'clock, and sat down on a bench on the right side of the ground, and went to sleep—my diamond pin was then in the breast of my shirt, and when I awoke it was gone—I received information, and on going to the bar I saw my pin in the possession of Cook—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in these grounds to set up the skittles—I saw the prosecutor there and the prisoner—I saw Mr. Price fall asleep—I saw his diamond pin in his shirt—after he was asleep I saw the prisoner sit down by the side of him, then put his hand up to his breast and take the pin out gently—he sat down there for half a minute—he then crossed to the other side—I did not se what he did with it—I looked at the prosecutor's shirt at the time, and saw that the pin was gone—I let the prisoner be in the room five minutes, and stuck up the skittles again—I then ran out and called my master, who came up to him, and I saw the pin taken from the prisoner by Cook.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Masons' Arms, to which this skittle ground is attached. Johnson came to me that night, and gave me information about the prisoner—I went to the prisoner, and met him coming out of the skittle-ground, while the boy was telling me the par<lb></lb>ticulars—I said to him, "You have got Mr. Price's pin"—he said he had not—I took hold of his right hand, which was in his pocket, and just at that time Cook, the officer, came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I drew his hand out of his pocket, and he had the pin in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I came up and took the prisoner's hand from his pocket—Mr. Ionn said, "You have taken Mr. Price's pin"—he said, "I have not; is is not likely a gentleman of my respectability would be guilty of such a thing"—he produced nothing—we were obliged to draw it from his pocket—I told him I was on officer, and must see if he had the pin—he still denied it.</p>

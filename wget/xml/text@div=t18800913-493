I live at 2, Harriet Street, Lowndes Square, and at had not been sold at Tattersall's—early in the year I had a mare called Morna stabled with him—I told him to sell her 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give me the money—about 11th May I offered to led Morna to a friend, not knowing that the prisoner had sold her—I did not know that he had received any offer for her till I received a letter—I have never received any money for her—I have not the remotest idea where they are; they are gone, including the mare and I have received nothing in respect of them.</p>

               <p>in the dark as to the reason Mrs. Dilke returned it; I certainly did not know at the time why it was returned—I do not think that was the pony that letter relates to; I think there were two ponies—Mrs. Dilke saw several ponies, and bought one—I don't know who Colonel Ellis is; I know several Colonel Ellises—I do not remember which Colonel Ellis it was who saw the ponies—I do not know which pony Mrs. Dilke returned—my memory is bad—I did not tell pegg not to tell Colonel Ellis why Mrs. Dilke returned the pony; I do not remember it, and I don't think I did—I do not think it is possible that I, knowing that Mrs. Dilke had returned the pony for a failing, told Pegg to show it to Colonel Ellis, and not tell him the reason it was returned; I cannot swear to a possibility, and there are no impossibilities—Mrs. Dilke told me that she returned the pony to Pegg because it had the staggers—I do not remember whether I was in close communication with Pegg at that time—Mrs. Dilke may have sent a telegram to me to communicate the contents of it to Pegg; I forget—I remember all I can; I can't remember everything—I have read this telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mrs. Dilke communicated with me because she did not know Pegg's address—I was not in partnership with Pegg; he had my horses—we were not under a mutual agreement, he to take my horses and sell them at a profit, and I to take his and sell them at a profit—we were not in partnership at the time Mrs. Dilke returned the pony—in all probability I wrote to him and enclosed a list of the horses which I entered at the Ranelagh Club sale, and said that if he had any to show he must place them in the list and send them to the secretary of the club before Thursday, or as early as he could before that date, because he would not be able to send his horses there without their being entered in the name of a member of the club—the great thing is to get as many entries as you can—it was not for my sake; Mr. Pegg would get the prizes—my horses were standing in his stable, and I thought he would like to enter his horses in my name—I wrote this: "Colonel Ellis would like to see the grey pony Mrs. Dilke had; don't say anything about why it was returned. Colonel Kingscote also wants to see the grey ponies you drove yesterday. Please be down at Marlborough House to-morrow and ask for Colonel Ellis"—I did not know who you meant when you asked me about Colonel Ellia—I believe horses were taken to the Ranelagh Club to be sold in my name which belonged to Pegg, but I was not there and did not see them, and don't know their names; I think I was out of town; I am quite sure I was. not at the show—I remember the show at the Agricultural Hall in 1879.—a horse of mine named Perfection was entered, No. 116; I do not know whether it was entered in my name; I did not enter it, Mr. pegg did—I bought a catalogue when I went in, I suppose, but I do not know whether it was entered in Pegg's name—there were two horses there, Morna and Perfection; at least I believe Perfection, and I know Morna was there, I saw her; I do not know about Perfection—No. 116 entered as Perfection was not Morna; Morna was a chestnut mare and Perfection was a bay—I know Morna was there; I cannot swear whether Perfection was there—I cannot remember whether two were entered or one—I bought a catalogue; I do not know that Morna was entered under the name of Perfection—I do not know that Mr. Sheward was manager to Mr. Robert Perceval, of Eaton Place—I have been to Mr. Perceval's, but do not remember seeing Mr. Sheward there—I know Mr. George Cox, the horsedealer, of Stamford</p>

               <p>Street, Blackfriars—I do not know Mr. Maule, the veterinary surgeon; I may have had a conversation with him without knowing his name—I do not know Mr. Youngman or Mr. James Ennis, familiarly called "Sandy," nor Mr. Hunting, a veterinary surgeon, of Down Street, Piccadilly—I never remember seeing that man (<hi rend="italic">Ennis</hi>) before, nor that man (<hi rend="italic">Sheward</hi>); he may have been at Perceval's, but I should not have known him—I do not know Ennis as Pegg's foreman—I did not know he had a foreman; I never saw him at Pegg's that I remember—I was at Pegg's day after day—I did not buy Morna from Mr. Perceval, nor do I know that Sheward negotiated the transaction; if he is the man who showed Morna to me I forget his face altogether; as far as I know I never saw him before in my life—I took Morna down to the Prince of Wales; J went down at the same time for him to look at her for the Princess of Wales to ride—I don't remember how long I had had her—I had sold her once before, and she was returned—I did not buy her back at a loss of 100 guineas—she was sold at Tattersall's, I forget for how much—I took her back because the gentleman who bought her did not want her, as she would not go in harness—I did not warrant her quiet to ride or drive—I never warrant a horse at all—I do not think I took her back at a loss—I did not tell Pegg that I was going to sell her to the Prince of Wales for the Princess to ride; I told him to take her down for them to look at; how were they likely to buy her without looking at her—he did take her for the Prince to see her, and I went with him—I did not say to Pegg "You ought not to sell that horse to the Prince of Wales for the Princess to ride, because she is not safe"—I made a statement on oath before a Magistrate before he granted a summons against Pegg—I believe I said in my information "The said Arthur Pegg was immediately on the sale being effected to hand me the money, and was previously to inform me who the purchaser was; any offer for the purchase of the mare was first to be submitted to me for my ap<lb></lb>proval"—I don't think I said in my evidence before the Magistrate in reference to the sale of Morna "Nothing was said about the offer being submitted to me, I never said anything about the payment of money"—this is my signature to my deposition; I may have said so—there were accouatfl between Pegg and me—I have charged him at this Court with stealing a horse called Perfection—I do not know that he sold that horse in August, 1879, and accounted to me for the proceeds—I don't know what he has done, I charge him with stealing it because I do not know what has become of it, he has never accounted to me for it—I swear that to the best of my belief—I do not know what I paid him in August, 1879—I believe there was an account settled between us in September last; I know I paid his bill, but I do not know whether it was by a cheque, I know it was all paid up; I paid him the account he brought me, but I do not know how I paid it—I do not remember whether he brought me an account in which the mare Perfection was entered in my favour on the contra account as being sold to Mr. Jones for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; how should I know? I do not remember it, that is all I can say; it might have been—I want to know where the animal is—I do not remember that there was a contra account against him, there was the account he gave me—I do not remember anything about Perfection—that was the only account I know of—I find in this account "By contra account 313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., balance 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., paid Sept. 22nd, 1879, Arthur Pegg"—I know a horse called White Cockade, and all I know is that it is missing</p>

               <p>pegg has never accounted to me for it—the balance against me in this account is 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the contra account is 313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that leaves a balance of 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I certainly paid him that account, because here is his receipt, but I do not know how—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mrs. Dilke's writing; she told me she had sent the pony back to Pegg because twice out of the four times she drove it it had the staggers—I do not know that that was the same pony about which I wrote "Show the grey pony which Mrs. Dilke had; be sure you don't say the reason why it was returned;" it is not possible that I should do so—I am sure I did not say "Be sure you do not say why it was returned," I could not have—it could not be he same pony—Mrs. Dilke saw two or three ponies of Pegg's—I could not have known the reason why the pony was returned, and I do not believe I told him to keep back the reason—I cannot explain it—I have had no dealings with the Duchess of Newcastle, I have not the honour of her acquaintance—I swear I was not at the Eanelagh Club sale at Fulham in Pegg's company, but he rode my horse for me—I was out of town when Morna was sold—I went to Manchester races, and I wrote to my butler, James James, and told him to get the money for Morna—he either wrote or telegraphed to me that she was sold; that may have been on 13th May—I know now that the horse was sold to the Duchess of Newcastle on 12th May, but when it was sold I don't remember—I told James to get the money immediately the horse was sold—I was not then in Pegg's debt; it was directly the other way—if he had any account against me it could only have been for the keep of the hones; there was generally a balance in my favour, and when I wrote to James Mr. Pegg had sold some horses—there was a balance in my favour when Morna was sold; he had got my horse and he had not paid me—I subse<lb></lb>quently heard that the Duchess of Newcastle had bought Morna for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know from who—Morna was not the least unsafe; she was perfectly quiet—she was not <hi rend="italic">nappy</hi> and false; I have ridden her myself—I said to-day that she was to be sold for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I corrected myself and said 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made it a strong point at the police-court that Pegg had sold her against my orders for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—James told me that Pegg told him that on 12th May he had sold the mare, and that he asked him for the cheque, but I do not know what he said to the Duchess of New<lb></lb>castle—I don't think he knew who she was sold to till much later; you had better ask him—I know he was there the morning she was sold—I don't think he told me by letter or telegram that she was sold to the Duchess of Newcastle; it is some time ago, and I forget—I never heart from James that Pegg refused to give him the cheque because his account with me was not settled; he promised to send the cheque every day—I have charged him with stealing a horse named Drake and a pair of ponies—I swear that I have not had the money for thorn, nor have they been accounted for to me—I swear that distinctly—I do not know that Pegg entered horses at shows for me in his own name; I entered horses for him in my name at the Banelagh Club, but nowhere else as far its my memory serves me—Pegg bought a team of four roans for me and sent them over to Homburg—I paid him for them; I do not know whether I kept him waiting four months for his money; when he asked me for it I paid him—I did not sell some horses belonging to Pegg; I took two down to Captain Machen; one was a brown hunter; I do not know whether the other was called "The Swell"—I may have recommended horses for him which he</p>

               <p>sold, but I do not know what he got for them; I never had any profit on them—I was going to ride the horses which I took down to Captain Machen to try them; he looked at one and bought it—I never heard that an anonymous letter was sent to the Duchess of Newcastle about Morna I did not instruct Pegg to look after stables in order that I might carry on horsedealing on a lofty scale—I wanted stables for my own horses because his stables were so small, and told him to look out for me—I never had any dealings with Cotterell; I know his yard, and I have seen him—I went to a yard off Down Street, Piccadilly; I do not know who it belongs to, or whether I went with Pegg—Morna was not returned to me by the Duchess that I know of—I had sold her once before to General Paget—I may have gone to the show at the Kanelagh Club and gone to Homburg the same day—I do not know the date or whether I saw Lord Dupplin that day; I see him very often—I do not remember whether I sold Morna to him that day; the only time I remember selling her was to General Paget, and I had her back from him because she would not go in harness; he wanted a Newmarket hack, and then he wanted a hack and a harness horse in one—I do not remember that I sold her to Lord Dupplin and had her back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The horse was kept for some time; her Grace rode it for a fortnight or three weeks; it was then sent away because it did not suit her—Mr. Hohler thought it was not quite the thing for her to ride, though she is a very good horsewoman, because the mare was not certain—he said he thought it was dangerous for her to ride her, and he did not want a scene in the park; it might put her Grace off—her Grace was not thrown by the mare—I heard that on some days the mare was a little mischievous; some days she would go well, and at other times she had not had work enough—I believe one day when her Grace came home Mr. Hohler said that he would not allow her to ride the brute my longer—I never heard that the mare was sold to Lord Hastings.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD AYLESFORD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I did not sell the mare to Lord Hastings, I only lent her to him for a day or two.</p>

On 23rd July I received from Giles, the warrant officer at Westminster Police-court, a warrant dated July 19, for the prisoner's arrest—Giles is laid up ill—on 30th July I met the prisoner in a Hansom's cab in Rochester Bow, took him into our office and read the warrant to him—he made no answer.</p>

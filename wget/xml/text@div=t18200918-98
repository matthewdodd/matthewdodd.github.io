            . I am the prosecutrix's servant. On the 31st of August, at a quarter past three o'clock, I saw Lee in Hill-street, looking into the front room, outside the area wall, talking to some one, but I did not see who. I could not see the side door when I was passing by him. I went and looked out of the side door, and saw the feet of two men, who were in conversation. I did not see who they were. I went in, shut the door, and went up stairs to the nursery, and in twenty minutes after I saw Lee go out of the front court, he looked up at me and shut the gate after him with both hands in his pocket. He went up Hill-street. I missed the clothes in about ten minutes. I had seen them in the wardrobe a day or two before. I found the window open, any one could get in there; it was over a cellar window, a man might step up from the ground and get in.</p>

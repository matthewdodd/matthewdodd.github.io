               <p>Shadrack Hammond.

In the Evening the Prisoner came, and desired me to let him have a Lodging; I asked him where the Watch was, and he said he had given it to one

I sent to this Rye, but she had it not ; I carried him, for that Night, to the Watch-house , and the next Morning before Mr Justice Fowke , who committed him to New-Prison. The Prisoner confessed, as we were carrying him thither, that he had taken the Watch out of the Cabbin, that the Gentleman whom it belonged to could not speak English, and if we would go back with him, he would shew us whereabouts it was that he took it. This Watch was produced by 2 Men before the Justice, and is the same which the Prisoner's Father shewed to me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down to Brown's-Wharf with my Lighter, and this Watch dropped out of the Cabbin Windows; there was a Man in the cabbin at the same Time, catching Rats. I carried the Watch to my Father, and then went on Board the Vessel, but nobody was there. I had it again from my Father, and went to my Master's where I served my Time, to fetch my Cloaths away, intending to go on Board a Man of War, but as I was returning, 2 Men met me, and took the Watch from me. <rs id="t17401015-48-verdict252" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am servant to Mr. Long. He sent me with the prisoner to take the knives and forks. When we got out I asked him where they were going to? He said they were going to some young people, who had just set up in business, and he would take me there. He said my master had allowed him 2 s. 6 d. for getting their custom, and I was not to say a word about it to the people. He took me up a passage leading from Holborn into Hyde-street, gave me 6 d., and told me to go into the front door of the Bull's Head, public-house, as that was the house - I was to call for a pint of beer, give him the knives, and he would take them in at the side-door, to prevent suspicion of our coming together - I gave them to him. I stood at the corner of the house to watch. Instead of going in at the side-door, he ran down the passage into Holborn. I pursued, and took him at the corner of Newton-street. He resisted - I took him back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Daniel O'Sullivan, who keeps the Horns, public house, in Petticoat-lane. On a Monday night, in Oct., about the 6th, we had a silver watch, with a white face, at our house, for a raffle, which was to take place on the next Monday—it was placed in the bar—it hung over the parlour door, that the customers might see it—the prisoner was standing at the bar, drinking with some others—they went out, and then the prisoner and another man came in again, and the other man put his hands on the bar—the prisoner went to the watch and took it, and they both walked away together—there was no noise nor disturbance then—that was the first time—thoy were out about ten minutes, and then the prisoner and the other man came in alone—there waw not a number of per<lb></lb>sens</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270125"></xptr>
               <p>there the second time, but there was the first—the second time he took the watch—the first time there was a fight—there was a row with some of their friends—after the row or disturbance, I saw the watch safe—the prisoner went out and came in with the other man, whose name is Michael Barrett—I believe he is not the prisoner's brother—I think he is his cousin—I did not see anything that happened outside, but when they took the watch I went to the door to see if they would come back with it, and they did not—I told a policeman—when the prisoner took the watch I went under the parlour door, because he used a bad expression to me—the watch hung over my head—Michael Barrett was drunk, and the pri<lb></lb>soner had hold of him—I was frightened that they would not bring it back, and my master was out—they did not come back, and I told the policeman of it about an hour afterwards—I shut up the house when all the people were out, and I went with the policeman to Barrett's house—I forget the name of the street—we found him at home, in bed—that was about half past 8 o'clock.</p>

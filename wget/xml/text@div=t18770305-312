                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 102, Clifton Street—on 10th February, about 1 a.m., I was in Great Eastern Street, and a man asked me for a light, I gave him one and found him feeling my pockets—I told him I did not know what I had there, and did not want him to feel—three other men rushed across the road—the prisoner was one of them—they struck me on my eyes, nose, and mouth, and one of them placed his hand across my mouth, tore open my great coat and took my watch away—I got up and saw a policeman running, who brought the prisoner back in about three minutes, without a hat—I picked up a hat at the spot, it was taken to the station, and the prisoner first said that it was his, and then he denied it.</p>

I do not think I could have recognised him after any long interval, because his countenance would have gone out of my bead, but I recognised him there and then—I did not see the men after they hit me because they placed something over my mouth and eyes—I cannot say whether the prisoner had his hand in my pocket or not—I made no noise while I was on the ground, because one held his hand over my mouth.</p>

I heard cries and saw Nunn on the ground—the prisoner and another man were with him—they ran towards Shoreditch—there was nobody else in the street—I pursued them and called "Stop thief"—they separated at the corner of Great Eastern Street, I pursued the prisoner and never lost sight of him till he was in the custody of 30 GR—I took him back to Nunn, who had a hat in his hand, which the prisoner acknowledged belonged to him, but afterwards denied it—he did not say where his hat had gone—Nunn's mouth was bleeding.</p>

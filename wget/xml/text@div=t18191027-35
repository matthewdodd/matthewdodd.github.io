             (in continuation). I am a widow, and live at Homerton. In September last I lived in the same house with the prisoner. It was the house of his wife's father, whose name is Sole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner and his wife going out together at the latter end of September - A. Yes. They went to town on the 28th of September - they went out together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is false, for we did not go out together.</p>

            . They went out together about three o'clock, and returned to the house again about half-past five; I did not take much notice whether they both came in together or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see them together - A. The first time of my seeing them, was when I opened the door, and saw somebody talking by the stile, which is facing the house. This was about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one or two persons talking - A. Two; the prisoner was one - his wife stood by the gate; I did not see her when I first came out. The prisoner went across the road, and staid talking by the gate to her, and a man who stood by the side of her - they stood talking there near a quarter of an hour; the prisoner and his wife then came into the house, and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man - A. He is a man, whom the prisoner was jealous of; I think his name is Lawrence. I heard the prisoner say he had caught him with her that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner say this - A. When he came in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he caught him with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went in did you hear any thing else pass between the prisoner and his wife - A. I heard him call her a w - h - e, and tell her that she had been with this man. She said he was a liar; they had a few words after they came into the house - he called her a w - h - e, and she called him a liar. He asked her if she would go to bed? and she said, Yes. They both went into the bedroom, and I thought they were going to bed. She went to bed, and he undressed himself to go to bed to her - I was in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there in the house - A. Two below stairs, and one above, My Lord - he and his wife sleep in one bed below stairs, the children, and the prisoner's father-in-law sleep in the other room. His father-in-law is a watchman - he was on the watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the children - A. A little boy and girl, who are the prisoner's wife's brother and sister. I was in the room, going to sleep that night with the children. The prisoner came out of his wife's room, and sat himself on the bed where the children were; he asked me if I was going to bed? I said I believed I should. He then went into his bed-room, came out, and sat himself on the bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back the second time, was he dressed or undressed - A. Undressed. He sat himself on the bed, and said are you going to bed to the children? I then heard his wife say,</p>
               <p>"I will get up." He went back into his room, and presently after I heard a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it - A. I thought it was with his fist, by the sound. I got up and went to the door - the little boy, who was in the same room that I was, hallooed out,</p>
               <p>"Murder!" I went to the door, the prisoner came out with an axe in his hand, and said, if the boy hallooed out murder again he would murder him - he went back to the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw him come out with the axe, you heard one or more blows - A. One. He went back into his wife's room, and while he was there, I heard her halloo out, very faintly - I thought she said,</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon me!" I think I heard her say so three times. The prisoner came out, and said he had done for her, and he should be hung. He asked the boy where his father's money was? he said he did not know, The prisoner said he wanted money, and money he would have. He took a chisel out of a box, and broke open his father-in-law's box with it, which stood in the room, and took some money out. After that, he asked me for the pen and ink, and wrote two notes - he got the paper out of the baker's book. I was sitting in a chair by the back-door; he brought the axe, held it up to me, and said if either of us spoke a word we should be dead; he said he would go out at the back-door, and listen if he heard us speaking - he went out with the axe in his hand. I gave the alarm over the way to Colleson, at the Crooked Billet, public-house, as soon as I possibly could. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What relation are you to the unfortunate woman - A. None, I merely lodged there. They went out together about a quarter before three o'clock, and said they were going to town together.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that they continued together all the while - A. No. I next saw them about half-past seven o'clock - it was then dark. They were talking with another man on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a cow-house near where you heard them talking - A. Just across the field. A very little way from where I heard them talking; I heard some of the conversation - it was in an angry tone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear enough to know that the prisoner was accusing his wife that he had caught her in the act of wh - edom in this cow-house - Q. Yes. I do not know that he mentioned Lawrence's name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Tell us the words he said - A. My Lord, he said he had caught her in the fact along with this man. The prisoner shoved her into the house angrily.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. After he was in the room with her he came out two or three times; was it not with great agitation of manner - A. He seemed very uneasy, and I heard him say he took her pocket up to see what money was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she was dragged into the cow-house by the man - A. She said she was carried in. The prisoner said if she would swear a rape against the man, he would take him to Worship-street - she said she would not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not add that she loved that man's little finger better than her husband's whole body - A. I did not hear it. When he came out of the room the second time, she said she would get up.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270019"></xptr>Q. Did you not also hear her say that she would go to the other man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you could not hear all the conversation, did you hear enough to know it was the continuation of the same angry conversation down to the time the blow was given - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am turned twelve years of age. I am brother to the prisoner's wife, who was killed. I was at home about half-past seven o'clock, when my sister and the prisoner came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room was you in - A. In the front room, where I sleep - I was up. I went to bed about a quarter of an hour after they came home. My little sister was in bed with me; Mrs. Surry was in my bed-room. My father was gone out to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came home, did you hear them say any thing to each other - A. Yes; the prisoner and his wife went into the back-room where they sleep - they said nothing then; they both came out into our bed-room again. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to Newington to buy a pair of shoes;" they then went out together. Before they went out they were playing together, pushing one another, and kissing each other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been married - A. Three years. I went to bed after they went out; I was asleep when they returned. They were jangling, and awoke me; they were then in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us all that passed - A. He then went out at the back-door, and said to his wife,</p>
               <p>"Don't go to make away with yourself." Mrs. Surry said,</p>
               <p>"No, she won't go to make away with herself" - they were both at the back-door at the time - she went to the door with him. Then my sister came in, and sat by the fire in my room; the prisoner afterwards came in and said,</p>
               <p>"Are not you coming to bed?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, and are not you coming and all?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am coming to bed directly" - she then went to bed. He undressed himself; I saw them go into their room - I could see into their room, and saw him undress himself. He did not go into bed, but came out again into my room, he then went and looked all the house three times.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean - A. He went all round the under room, as if to look for the axe; he went to the cupboard under the stairs, where the axe was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing away - A. I did not see; he then came to my bed and sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the axe was there that night - A. My father had used it that night to chop some wood, and put it there. My sister asked the prisoner if he was coming to bed? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am going to sleep with the children." She said,</p>
               <p>"I shall get up then" - he said,</p>
               <p>"No, no, don't get up, I will come to bed to you." Then he went in and out of my room to her two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q, What next - A. He came out and went in again. I then heard him hit her very hard - then he hit her again; I got out of bed, hallooed out Murder! and saw the axe over his shoulder, as if he was going to hit her again. He then came out to me and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d young rascal, if you offer to call out Murder again I will serve you the same." He then came into the room where I sleep, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have done for her!"</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else - A. He came to Mrs. Surry and me, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to stir or move I will serve you the same." He then went into the room where the deceased was, put on his stockings and breeches, went out, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"Tom, where is your father's money?" I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't take father's money, because he has got to pay his men." He then said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to stir or move I'll serve you the same." He sat down on my bed, then went and fetched father's box, in which he keeps his tools, took out a chisel, opened father's box with it, and took out a 1 l. note - he put his hand in again, and took something else out, but I could not see what. He then put on his jacket and shoes, went out at the back-door and said,</p>
               <p>"I will stay out here and listen, and if you stir or move I will be the death of you." He went away. Mrs. Surry and I went into Mr. Twigg's house next door, directly, and gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your sister's name - A. Ann.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. What time did your sister and the prisoner go out first - A. About three o'clock; they had been together all day - he did not go to work as it rained; he was a bricklayer's labourer. They were very good friends before they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went out to buy the shoes they were kissing and playing together - A. Yes. I was in bed when they returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a violent noise when they came in - A. No; the least thing awakes me. He was scolding her, and was very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard about her going with another man - A. I heard a little about that, but not much. The prisoner went in and out of the bed-room, and from one part of the room to the other. The head of their bed is close against the door; I sleep by the side; the door does not shut close.</p>
               <p>Q. They had words in the bed-room - A. Yes, they were always quarrelling. He once turned her out of doors. They had a few words before he came out of the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; do not you remember her saying she loved the other man's little finger better than his whole body - A. No, I heard nothing of the kind. She said she would get up if he did not come to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words they had in the bed-room - A. He took her pocket away, and she said,</p>
               <p>"You shan't have the money, it is my father's." I heard nothing about any other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say,</p>
               <p>"I have been the death of her?" - A. No, he said</p>
               <p>"I have done for her."</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did she not desire him to come to bed, and he said he would - A. Yes, they were then quiet with each other.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock of the night in question, I remember an alarm being given. I went to the house, Mr. Colleson's servant-boy went with me, but did not go into the house. I found a little girl in bed in the other room; I found Mrs. Surry in the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find things in the house - A. When I first opened the door I found two puddles of blood near the door. I turned my eye on the right side, and saw the deceased lying on her back on the bed - she was quite dead. I had a light. On the right side of the bed there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270020"></xptr>was a great deal of congealed blood - there was the mark of her head in it. She was quite naked, except part of her shift being over her breast. The surgeon afterwards saw her. I found an axe in the room, which I produce - it was between the two doors, just over the threshold of the door where the children sleep. There was a great deal of blood on the back part of the head of it - there was none on the edge.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I saw the deceased. There was a wound on the back part of her head, another on the forehead, near the left eye, and another on the temple. The wound on the back part of the head must have been made with a blunt instrument, there was a violent concussion; the others appeared to have been made by some sharp instrument - I should suppose that on the temple to be made with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your judgment, what was the occasion of her death - A. Evidently the blow on the temple; it perforated quite into the brain. There was a compound fracture of the jaw in two places.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might it have been done with the axe - A. The blow on the back of the head might have been done with the back of it.</p>

                  <persName id="t18191027-35-person386">Q. </persName>
            Could the other wounds be made with the edge of it - A. I think it impossible, for the axe is large and thick. The wounds appear to be more a stab than a cut.</p>
               <p>Q. The jaw was fractured in two places - A. I should think that to be done with the axe. I certainly think some sharp instrument besides the axe had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the cut be made with the edge of the axe - A. It could not have been cut that depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bruises which you think were done with the axe sufficient to cause her death - A. There is no doubt of it; the violence of the blow on the back of the head would break the jaw.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer. I found the prisoner at Sandwich - he was delivered into my custody there; I accompanied him to town.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road, without any promise or threat on your part, did he say any thing on the subject - A. He said, that sometime previous his wife went out for a pail of water; she need not have been gone half a minute, but she was gone half an hour. He suspected something, and in the morning he found some cow-dung on her bonnet. That on the evening of the murder he went out to buy some shoes; she wanted to leave him, and sent him to purchase the shoes - on his return he saw she was not in the house, and went to the public-house, she was not there; he went to a cow-hovel just by, looked in, heard a breathing, and saw something white, he went in, put his left knee on the man, and his left hand on her breast; that the man got from her, and was going along by the stile, she kissed him, and wanted to fondle over him (the prisoner) but he told her to go about her business; but previous to that, he said, when he put his hand on her, she said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you, John?" he said it was, and she said she was forced in there by the man, and he said if she would swear that he would forgive her - they both walked to the stile, she wanted to kiss him, but he told her to go away; that they went home, and she said the man forced her into the cow-house, and he said if she would swear that he would forgive her, but she said No, she would see him d - d first, for that she loved that man's little finger better than his whole body. He was going to strike her, but she said if he did she would send him to prison, and there he might rot; that was too much for him, and he up with the axe and struck her, and she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you rogue!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. He had surrendered - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday, the day before I saw my wife in the evening, she went out for a pail of water, and had no occasion to be gone above a few minutes, she was gone a long while; when she came back I chastised her for it, knowing she had been guilty of what has been stated. She came back and said,</p>
               <p>"I am going for Rumble's clothes to mangle." I thought to myself that she was going after some of her men, as she had acquaintance with several. She was gone a long while - I went out to the gate, looked towards the left, but did not see her. I suspected she was gone to the cow-hovel - I went that way, and saw Lawrence, (whom I afterwards caught in the act of adultery), I did not then know any thing was between them. She came running from the cow-hovel; I told her she had been after no good, and if I caught her she would not like it. She said I might be d - d, and she would do as she pleased. On the Tuesday morning, being wet, I stopped at home till three or four o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, I am going to town to buy a pair of shoes, and you may as well walk me" - she wanted to pledge some things to get money. I said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well walk with me." She said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed I shall not, I shall ride up with one of the coachmen." (She was very intimate with several of the coachmen, and I believe they did as they liked with her). She started off about half an hour before me, we did not go out together; I was to meet her by Shoreditch church - instead of meeting her there, I wandered about a long while, and met her coming with a girl from towards Bishopsgate church. I asked her why she deceived me so for? I should have gone back for nothing if I had missed her. She said,</p>
               <p>"And if you had, you would only have had your walk for nothing." I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you go with me and buy the shoes?" she said</p>
               <p>"No, you may go where you like, I shall go home." She turned back, and said she would go with me. We went to some shoe-shops - I bought none. I said I must go to a man in Globe-fields, who owed me some money - she went home. I could not get the money, and went straight home. I thought she might have been home full two hours before me, but she did not return until almost dark. I asked her where she had been? she would not satisfy me. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is pretty goings on, for you to gad about, and not let me know where you go; if I was to do it how uneasy you would be." She said she did not care, she should do as she liked. We had tea, and had words all the while. She said, as I had not got my shoes I might as well go to Newington. I said there was none there that would suit; she said there were some that would do for me, and my father-in-law said I might get them near the church. When I got there I found no such shop or place. Her being anxious for me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270021"></xptr>to go arose my suspicion. I made all the haste back I could. On my return I opened the gate gently, looked through a crack in the shutter, and thinking she was not at home, I went to the coach-yard, as she was there almost every evening. I then went to the public-house, to see if she was with one Coulson, the hostler, whom I once caught with her at Edmonton - I then thought of the cow-dung I had found on her bonnet. I then went to the cow-hovel softly, put my ear to the door, and heard a panting for breath - (Here the prisoner minutely described the situation in which he found his wife with

            ). She said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will forgive me, John, for who can I live with better than my dear husband?" I used several bad expressions, and said I would forgive her. She said the man forced her there. I said to the man,</p>
               <p>"Did you or did you not do so?" he said he did. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will freely forgive you, my dear, if you will swear a rape against him at Worship-street. The man then escaped about twenty yards across the field - we came up to him again. She said to me,</p>
               <p>"You may be d - d, I don't care for you. I love his little finger better than your whole body." The man said it was all his fault, and went away. I got her something to drink, and said she should go home immediately, until I had made up my mind about leaving her - it was all in the heat of passion. I got her some gin and peppermint, and told her the man might go, for I knew where to find him, and would have him up to-morrow. I took her to the gate, and certainly used bad language to her, and said I would forgive her if she would live with him or

            , or who she liked. She said,</p>
               <p>"there is Mr. Pearson going by, and he well knows what I am." I told her to go in doors, she swore she would not - I pushed her in, and told Surry of the adultery - she said she pitied me. After that she got up and cried, and went into the yard very much enraged. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make away with yourself, we will part peaceably." She came in and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't think I am going to make away with myself for such a d - d **** as you." I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't use that language, or you shall feel for it." She went to bed, and asked if I was coming? I said I did not know that I should, for I might as well have a prostitute. She said if I did not come to bed, she would get up, and go to the man she loved. I said I would come to bed if she would appear against the man at Worship-street; she said she would not, for he had treated her well. I went in and out of the room in a great rage; she was exclaiming the bitterest oaths. I went to her, and said I would come to bed if she would not use such language. She said,</p>
               <p>"You may be d - d, for I don't care for you." At last she said,</p>
               <p>"As you have struck me, you shall lay in prison and rot." I said,</p>
               <p>"Say that again!" she said it, the axe laid by, I took it up and struck her once; she said,</p>
               <p>"You *****!" I struck her two or three times. After that was done I put on my clothes, and moved her to the right side of the bed, kissed her, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my dear; you was once my comfort, I have been the death of you, and you will be the death of me." I came into the room, the boy was crying Murder! I said</p>
               <p>"Say nothing, or I shall be the death of you all." I asked him where his father's money was? for money I must have, in order that I might have time to repent for what I have done. I took the chisel to open the box, it was not locked. I took a 1 l. note out, and asked Surry for a pen and ink; I told her to say nothing, that I might not be detected yet, and I dare say I should soon be caught, for I dearly loved the girl, and should not he happy. I wrote on a piece of paper,</p>

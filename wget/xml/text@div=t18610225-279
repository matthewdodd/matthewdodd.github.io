                  </hi>. I was formerly inspector of the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police—I am now engaged by the Mint authorities in apprehending persons engaged in making coin—on 4th February I received some instructions and went at 10 o'clock at night, with other officers, to the first-floor, 5, John-street, Cornwall-road—it was locked, I believe, for I could not open it—we broke it open, and upon entering, saw on the table, by the side of the fire-place, a galvanic battery in full work, with seven counterfeit sixpences on the wires, undergoing the process of electro-plating—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cylinder in which they were deposited—there was an earthenware jar outside, in a position to accelerate the process—I saw some counterfeit coin on the mantel<lb></lb>piece,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250076"></xptr>
               <p>and on the shelves, and in the cupboards, on each side of the fire-place—on the table was a plate, a cup, and a saucer, all containing wet sand and water, with some pieces of coin in it—on the same table were two files with white metal in their teeth, as if recently used, with a large quantity of white metal metal filings on the table—near the fire-place I found this ladle con<lb></lb>taining white metal which was warm—in the cupboard I found these pieces of plaster of Paris, which I believe to have been moulds—some with two or three channels for the purpose of testing two or three pieces at one time, but the impression is obliterated—there was no person in that room—I had seen the male prisoner go out at about twenty minutes to 9, by himself—he was running—we had been watching the house all that time, and for a long time before—I did not see the female prisoner leave the house—I went down-stairs, leaving Inspector Fife and Elliott to watch the rooms—I sent some other constables to search for the prisoners, accompanied by Rope, who lived in the house, to point them out—about an hour afterwards I heard Bryant's voice in the court downstairs, at the door—the male prisoner was coming into the house with Bryant, who held him by the hand, and called me—I heard Bryant say, "I do not live here"—I opened the door and said, "Bring him in, Mr. Bryant, that is the man I want"—at that time Inspector Fife was coming in at the side entrance with the female prisoner—we pro<lb></lb>ceeded up stairs—I opened the door of the back-room, and said, "Mr. Vowell. I received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you as dealing largely in counterfeit coin; there is pretty good symptoms of it here," pointing to the battery and counterfeit coin lying in all directions, and the implements on the table—(his name is Vowell)—he said, "I do not know what you mean; somebody must have put them here since I have been gone"—I said, "Oh! that is what you mean, is it, <hi rend="italic">Mr. Frenchy</hi>; what have you got about you?"—I put my hand to his waistcoat-pocket while Bryant held him, and in it I found seven good sixpences, loose, and ten bad sixpences in another pocket, wrapped separately in paper—I said, "Perhaps somebody put these in your pocket since you have been out"—he said, "Well, it is no use, Mr. Brannan, I will plead guilty to it ail, if you will spare my poor wife and child"—I said, "I can hold you out no pro<lb></lb>mises "—he said, "I only sell, I do not make"—I said, "This is pretty good proof," producing the moulds, the impressions on which were effaced—he said, "Well, it is no use, I will plead guilty to it all: when I came out of prison last time, I met a man who taught me; I am a brush-maker by trade; I am badly off for work"—I have known him since 1849, and believe the female prisoner is not his wife—she has lived with him perhaps a couple of years—I produce a large quantity of counterfeit coin—one packet contains five half-crowns, two finished, and two unfinished: ten florins, nine of which were counterfeit, and the other, I believe, to be the pattern piece, it was wrapped in the same paper with the bad ones—here are twenty-two counter<lb></lb>feit shillings, some finished, and some unfinished, and considerably above 100 sixpences—here are all the necessary implements for casting and clean<lb></lb>ing counterfeit coin.</p>

I got near the door—when I took Powell ho said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "Here is a gentleman down here wants to see you"—he, said, "You have made a mistake"—I said, "No;" I said, "Are you not Mr. West"—he said, "No; you have made a mistake; you had better let me go"—I said, "Do not you live here?"—we had then got to the house, and Brannan opened the door, and I said, "Mr. West has come home"—Brannan said, "Very well, bring him in"—we took the prisoners up stairs—I held Powell, and saw Brannan take six or seven sixpences from his waist-coat—pocket, and afterwards a paper parcel containing ten bad sixpences, wrapped up separately—I found seven half-crowns, and seven sixpences on the table, all counterfeit, close to where he was standing.</p>

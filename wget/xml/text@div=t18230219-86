            . I am butler to Mr. Phillips. I paid the prisoner a sovereign and a half, on the 14th of January, and took his receipt. I paid him at Mr. Lewis's house. I did not see him write the receipt. He brought it down stairs to me ready written.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was five years in Mr. Lewis's service as porter - he then placed me in this situation, which was rather a dangerous one, without advancing my salary, and being told I must move my lodgings, and make myself more respectable. I was told if I gave and account of what I had received it would be better for me. I delivered one, but it has proved contrary to my expectations.</p>

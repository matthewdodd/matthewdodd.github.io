On the 23d of October these tools were at home in my chest on that evening: on opening my chest I found they were gone; my chest was in my bed room. There were some bricklayers in the house repairing it. The next morning I went to the pawnbrokers, they told me they had taken a sash saw in of an old gentleman; the prisoner lodged in my house, he sold the duplicate, and the saw was taken out afterwards by Cairns, an old Iron shop man. I went to Cairns and saw my saw hanging up in the window for sale, and another of my saws; I told him I had lost more tools, he brought them out and shewed me them.</p>

I gave him four shillings for the small tools; I bought the duplicate of the two saws, had them taken out of pawn; the saws cost me three shillings and a halfpenny. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I feel the seriousness of my position, and I am prepared to give you, without any solicitor being present, the fullest information, to enable Stead &amp; Co. to recover back the monies which I have defrauded them of"—I said that before my clients could determine what course to adopt, they must have a full investigation made into their books, and the course I had advised them to adopt was to place the books in the hands of an accountant; that if he was disposed to give every information and assistance to that accountant to make up the books, he could do so, but he must plainly under-stand that that course would not prevent, in any shape or way, the adoption of criminal proceedings if they determined upon investigation to adopt them—he said he was willing to assign all his property over to Messrs, Stead—I asked him whether he owed anything to anybody else—he said nothing but a few trifling debts to his tradesmen—I declined to listen to any assignment, and said, "I only want to know what are the assets in your hands belonging to Messrs. Stead"—I went through the list of assets seriatim, and he stated that each of them was the produce of monies belonging to Messrs. Stead—I mean the list appended to the letter which he produced on the first occasion—he said as to one of them, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from himself, he would give a bill or a bond for it, which I pooh-poohed, and said it was nonsense his proposing to give security to my clients—as to the others, he said they were all the produce of Stead &amp; Co.'s money—I said I would appoint an accountant, and make an appointment for him to go into the matter, and if he chose to attend, I would give him notice, so that he might do so—I appointed Mr. Harper, and gave notice to the prisoner to attend—I believe he did attend at Mr. Harper's, according to Mr. Harper's report, that I received from him on 10th February—I have it here—substantially it amounted to what the prisoner stated originally, with some trifling difference—it has been sub<lb></lb>sequently mentioned by Mr. Harper that there was some discrepancy which arose on a question of discount being allowed, that would reduce the sum</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260008"></xptr>
               <p>with which the prisoner debited himself some 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think with that exception the list of defalcations he had furnished was substantially correct—no doubt as to sums debited to any particular firm it could on inquiry have been ascertained whether they owed it or not, but I did not examine the books myself—the prisoner offered on that occasion three bills of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, accepted by a person of the name of Gillard, that he said he had discounted with Messrs. Stead's money—I made inquiries about Gilard, found they were worthless, and refused to take them—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been received from one of the sureties, and Mr. Hodson received some 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, altogether about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been realized—I subsequently put the matter into the hands of Mr. Humphreys, and about the 24th February, by his advice, a warrant was applied for and obtained—that was after I had received a communication with regard to Mr. Tabet, and after I had entered into correspondence with Mr. Benham.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLIANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a solicitor? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I was admitted in Trinity Term, 1852—I carry on business at 8, Tokenhouse Yard—one of the first things I saw, in this matter, was the prisoner's letter—I subsequently saw the detailed list of his defalcations—these matters have been gone through by an accountant, and it turns out that the account that the prisoner gave Mr. Hodson was correct, with the exception of the overcharge to himself of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that there was any difference in the prisoner's position, in a legal point of view, when I gave him into custody, than there was when he first admitted his defalcations—I did not give him into custody at first, because I did not know whether the defalcations might not have been ten times as much; it was therefore necessary for the firm to have the whole of their books amply investigated by an accountant—I advised my clients to give him into custody at once, but they did not do it; that was for the purpose of using his information—the list he gave contained, as he posi<lb></lb>tively stated, property which was my client's, not his—they took it—I told them not to refuse anything that he said was theirs—we gave him into custody because we found he had deceived us in every respect about than various sureties being forthcoming—we did not find any deception as to his defalcations—I do not say that we should not have given him into custody if there had been no deception as to the sureties—I advised my clients throughout to prosecute him—I should not have advised my clients to let him go—I was simply dealing with what was their own property, not his—I took care, throughout the whole interview, to state that I would not have anything to do with any property of his; I only wanted to know what was the property of my clients—I know nothing whatever, personally, about the state of his property, or of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. realized by it—I heard from Mr. Hodson that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid him, and that the prisoner had told him how he had raised it on his property—it was not earmarked as his property—I did not advise Mr. Hodson to take it; he took it without my know<lb></lb>ledge—I did not recommend him to return it—I must have known about it before the warrant was applied for—I had interviews with Mrs. Ewin—I don't think I ever wrote to her; she wrote to me—I did not tell her that if Mr. Stead could see her husband an arrangement would be made, nothing of the kind—I probably wrote to her to call on me; I can't tell; if you wish to know I will refer to my books—I may have written to say I was ready to receive her—I certainly never wrote any detailed letter—I really am in doubt whether I wrote at all or not—I have had notice to produce</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260009"></xptr>
               <p>certain letters, and they are here—I will refer to my letter-book—here is a letter that was written by a clerk of mine—Mrs. Ewin called on me, and I read to her extracts from a letter from Mr. Stead—I may hare read words to the effect: "Mr. Hodson will be in London shortly, and if he has any interview with Mrs. Ewin, an arrangement may be effected, and the matter must stand over till then"—I have no doubt that was about the 22nd July—I acted in two actions as the prisoner's attorney under these circum<lb></lb>stances, he stated he had applied some of Stead &amp; Co.'s monies to dis<lb></lb>counting a bill for a man named Austin, and he brought an action against him—the proceeds of that action were Stead &amp; Co.'s, and he himself sug<lb></lb>gested that I should be changed as the attorney, so that I might carry on the action that was virtually Stead &amp; Co.'s action—I acted in his name, but it was an action simply brought by him as trustee for Stead &amp; Co.—there was another case in which I acted in that same manner; that was an interpleader summons under precisely similar circumstances—I got 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid to Stead &amp; Co.—I did not get my own costs, not a farthing—it was an interpleader summons, and the money was in Court—the pri<lb></lb>soner told me he had made an advance of Stead &amp; Co.'s monies to Benham, exceeding 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which Benham had agreed to give him a mortgage—upon that I gave Benham notice that the advances were made out of my client's monies, and that, in point of law and equity, they were entitled to the charge—Benham proceeded to give me evidence of his title—the other letter appeared long after the prisoner had absconded—I stated that I refused to enter into the title until I had received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing so—Mrs. Ewin told me her husband was in France or Spain, and out of our reach—I did not entertain some proposals by which he should give information—I told her I would not put my clients to any-further expense, because I believed it was all moonshine about Benham't security, unless she deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me—I may possibly have said, "I won't open the papers unless you give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was at a very late period, when he was in Spain, or Pimlico—I had opened the papers, and considered them—I did not hear from Haydon that he could serve the warrant when it was obtained—I did not instruct him, Mr. Humphreys did—I learnt from Haydon that he could not find the prisoner anywhere until three or four days before his arrest—I did not tell Haydon not to serve the warrant, or hold it over; I swear that—Haydon asked me if the reward was still in existence—we had offered 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in February, and advertised for the prisoner continually—Haydon said that persons came and volunteered to give information if they could get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would communicate with Mr. Stead, and see whether he was tired out of the matter, or whether he would still insist upon prosecuting—I did communicate with him, and in the meantime the man was arrested—I did not tell Haydon not to execute the warrant, or to delay it—he told me the parties would not give information without know<lb></lb>ing that the reward would be paid—I did not convey to him that I wished it delayed, not in any way—I told Mrs. Ewin that we were willing to keep the warrant back for two or four months—she did not say that if we did so he would be able to clear the whole debt, nothing of the kind—I offered to hold over the warrant because she told me he was in Spain, and we were unable to arrest him—I wanted information about these various securities—I suppose there is a firm of Tabet abroad—I don't know it of my own knowledge; I have no doubt of it—I presume they are merchants at Beyrout—I don't know whether they are Greeks; the name is more like</p>

               <p>a French name—I had negotiations with a view to utilize the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Goodman &amp; Co.—we have got the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from J. Ewin—Ball had made a deed of composition—the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Benham referred to the Grapes public-house—I investigated the papers with reference to that so far as to see that it was all moonshine—I don't mean to say there are no transac<lb></lb>tions between Benham and the prisoner—I know nothing about that, but the security offered to me was entirely imperfect, and the title worthless—I required the 30. because further information was volunteered to fill up the gap in the title, and I would not put my clients to the expense of investi<lb></lb>gating it—there was a letter from Messrs. Tabet Brothers in which they stated the account had been settled long since—no doubt there was an account two or three years ago—the transaction as to Goodman &amp; Co. was this: the prisoner stated that he had advanced money to Baker, trading as Goodman, Baker &amp; Co., and that, to cover him, he had taken the house and business of an auctioneer carried on under that name—the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered for that, under the guarantee of possible possession by Mr. Stead; that I advised him not to give, as there were rival claims to the property—there was an assignment of a debt due from Warry &amp; Burgess for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not get a farthing from that—I did not demand 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Ewin in reference to that transaction; I swear that; nor any other sum.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Comersdale—there was no writ<lb></lb>ten agreement between myself and the prisoner when he was engaged—the statement made by Mr. Hodson with regard to his duties is correct—in 1867, in consequence of finding there were very small remittances, I sent Mr. Hodson up to town, and in consequence of what I heard, I came up to town—I was present at the interview with Mr. Hodson, the prisoner, and Mr. Bailey, at Mr. Bailey's office—I have heard what Mr. Bailey has stated—with regard to what took place it is perfectly correct.</p>

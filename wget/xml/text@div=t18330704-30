             (police-constable H 61). I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Flower and Dean-street; I found her, and said I wanted her to go with me to Wentworth-street; she went and I took her up stairs, and asked the prosecutor if she was the woman; he said, she was - I found this watch in her bosom, which the prosecutor claimed - I found two half-crowns, and four-pence in copper in her pocket; my brother-officer then felt round her, and five medals which the prosecutor claims, were found in the pocket of her stays.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

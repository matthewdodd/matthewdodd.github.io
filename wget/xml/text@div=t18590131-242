I live at No. 6, Devonshire-terrace, Victoria-park-road—on the morning of 30th November last, I was awoke about half-past three by cries of "Murder" and "Stop thief"—I got up and looked out of my window, and saw the back of a police constable running out of the garden gate—I then went downstairs into the sitting-room, and there found the cheffoniere broken open, and the contents scattered all about the place—I missed two decanter stands—I then looked at the window of the stone passage, and found one of the iron bars that go across it broken away—the window was quite safe the previous night at half-past eleven—about four o'clock I saw the police-constable Evershed—he came in—he was dripping with blood, from a wound in the head—he showed me these decanter stands (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—they were safe the pre<lb></lb>vious night.</p>

On 30th November last I was passing the house No. 6, Devonshire-terrace, about 3 o'clock, when I observed a light over the fanlight of the door—I watched it for about five minutes—I then went into No. 4 gate, the gates of 5 and 6 being fast—I went across the gardens towards No. 6 area-door; I tried it and found it was fast—I then turned my light down towards South Hackney Church, to see if a sergeant or constable were coming that way—I turned my light off and got on the wall, and turned on my light again—I then saw a glaring light coming through the staircase window, and saw the prisoner Williams coming downstairs with a lighted candle in his hand—he was dressed in a suit of black—I took him to be the master of the house—I jumped off the wall and went round to the back, and there saw the little window open sufficient to admit a good-sized lad through—I then went to the back-door and found it ajar—I pushed it open, went in, and saw Williams on the last step but two, standing, with a lighted candle in his hand, looking at me—I took hold of his scarf and threw him down in the passage; and then he took hold of me and the candle went out—I then got to the kitchen-door, turned</p>

I am a surgeon, at Clapton-square—on the morning, 30th November, I examined Evershed at the Hackney Police-station, he was in a state of considerable exhaustion from loss of blood and the injuries he had received—I examined his scalp—he had four severe contused and lacerated wounds, which had been bleeding very freely, they extended to the bone, varying in length from an inch and a half to three inches—a blunt instrument like a crowbar or jemmy would be, just the sort of thing likely to produce such wounds—I have attended him up to the present time—the sight of one eye was impaired at one time, but it is getting better—he is decidedly improving, but still very weak—at times suffering a good deal still from the general shock to the system.</p>

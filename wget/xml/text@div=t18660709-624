                  </hi>. I am a nurseryman, in Bow Road, Mid<lb></lb>dlesex—about a quarter-past twelve, on the night of the 12th June, I was standing in the Royal Exchange—the prisoner came up and spoke to me, and placed her hand in my left hand trousers pocket—I had in that pocket a bag containing two half-sovereigns, two shillings, eleven sixpences, and a threepenny-piece—I ran after her and saw her stopped by a policeman—the bag was in her hand, I believe—it contained my money—this is the bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that the bag was found upon her and the money too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had not been drinking—I had had a little, like other men, but I was not drunk—I might have had two or three glasses of bitter ale in the course of the day—I did not speak to the prisoner first—I did not put my arm round her neck—I did not ask her to go and have something to drink—I was waiting for an omnibus—I did not tell her I had buried my wife, nothing of the kind—I lost my wife about six months ago—I don't recollect mentioning anything of the kind—I did not say that if she went home with me I would give her a sovereign—I am quite sure of that—she did not say I must give her the sovereign first—I did not take the bag out of my pocket and say, "There are a few sixpences in it; you may as well put it in your pocket"—I did not see a cab—the prisoner did not give me the bag, the policeman seized it—the prisoner said I had given it her—she had gone about half-way down Bartholomew Lane when the policeman took her—I ran after her—she put her hand quite openly into my pocket.</p>

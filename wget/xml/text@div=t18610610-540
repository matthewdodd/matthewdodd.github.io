                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Vickery, who keeps the Corner Pin beerhouse, Union-street, Southwark—I remember the prisoner and another man coming there at the latter end of April, or beginning of May—they had a pint of ale—the prisoner gave me a half-crown—I put it in the till and gave him change—he went away—my husband took it out of the till and said it was bad—there was no other half-crown in the till—on Monday, 3d June, I saw the prisoner again, alone—he asked for a glass of old ale, and gave me a half-crown—I kept it in my hand—I knew he was the man that had been before—my husband stood at the parlour door close by, and I passed it to him to look at—he asked me who I took it of, and I told him the man at the counter, and that he was the man who passed the bad one before—the prisoner heard me say that—he made no answer—my husband brought it to the counter, and told him it was a bad one—the policeman came, and he was given in custody.</p>

Q.</hi> Was your husband there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not when you brought the first half-crown—he was the last time—he was about an hour before he came in the first time—I did not notice the other man so much as you—he was rather taller than you.</p>

"—she pointed to the prisoner, and said, "This is the party I took one of before"—I put it in my detector and bent it, and then I was going to show it to the prisoner and my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> took it and held it till a policeman came—I told the prisoner, it was a bad one—he made no answer—I gave him into custody—the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> gave the second half-crown to the constable—change was given for the second half-crown.</p>

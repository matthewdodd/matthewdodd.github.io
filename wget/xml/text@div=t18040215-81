             sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Charlton: On the 17th of February, about half past nine in the morning, the prisoner came down the area steps; he pushed the door that goes into the servants-hall (it runs on a pulley), and came in; I was coming out of the kitchen with a tea-urn of water to take up stairs; I saw the prisoner; he asked me if Mrs. Moffat lived there; I told him, no; he said, he believed she was a fresh comer in the street; I told him there was a fresh family come to live at No. 17, but I did not know their name; he thanked me, and I thought he went out, but I did not know whether he did or no; I went up stairs with the urn; coming down stairs for the toast, I saw the prisoner come out of the housekeeper's room with this box; I cried out, holloa; he threw the box at me, and cut my face on the side of my nose; he went out; I pursued him, and took him; I have the box here; it was kept in the housekeeper's room.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

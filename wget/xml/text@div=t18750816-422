                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers at Coutts'—Mrs. Williams, of Queen's Gardens, Hyde Park, kept an account there, and the form of the cheque was delivered to her with others—on 2nd July, at a little before 10 o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque filled up as it is now—I examined it, doubted the signature, and handed it to another gentleman, asking him to examine whose book it was from—after the prisoner had been waiting three or four minutes I returned to my seat, and the prisoner said "Shall I have to wait long?" I said "Not longer than is necessary"—he said "If I am likely to be detained long, I have to go a little further and will call back"—I said "There is no occasion for that"—I saw him making towards the door and followed him as quickly as possible—when he got to the inner door he was walking, but when he got between the two doors he ran, and I followed him into the Strand and looked each way, but could see nothing of him—I had asked him who he brought the cheque from; he said "From Mr. Clark, of Oxford Street"—it is drawn to Clark &amp; Robinson for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and</p>

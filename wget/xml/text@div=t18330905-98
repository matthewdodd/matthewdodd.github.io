On the 11th of July last, I had some things to wash for Mrs. Cardosa - I fetched them myself from her house; I found them in a bundle, on a chair, in a room on her first floor; there was nobody in the room - I never opened the bundle; I took it to my own house and put it in the back-kitchen; there was nobody in the kitchen - I then went up stairs; the back-kitchen is part of the house - I shut the door leading from the passage - I don't know whether the door leading from the kitchen to the yard was shut; I shut the door leading to the passage; I did not lock nor bolt it; I came down stairs afterwards and found the things still there; I went up stairs again and shut the door - then I came down again, on being alarmed, and found the door shut - (I rather think the yard-door was open,) the witness asked me if I had sent a woman out with a bundle - I then looked and missed it; the street-door was open.</p>

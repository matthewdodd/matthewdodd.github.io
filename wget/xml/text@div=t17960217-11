They made use of Abbot's name to me; I have known him twenty or thirty years; and I should not have taken the cart in, but their having made use of his name; we take a number of carriages into our yard, many that come to Mr. Brewer's meeting of a Sunday; our gates are generally open from morning to night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say Ashley was present? - A. I cannot say; I believe he might be gone out to buy some bread and cheese at that time; I don't recollect that he was by at that time; Smith brought the cart to the yard.</p>

             (the Accomplice), sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 11th, or 12th, of last December, Ashley and I went to Low-Layton; and we broke into an out-house belonging to a person, near the Red-lion; and we stole a parcel of fowls from there, and a coachman's box-coat, and a green baize covering of a chaise, or a chariot; we could not bring them home conveniently; we had a horse, harnessed, with us; we had looked at the cart in the day-time, and took a collar with us to put upon the horse, to put him into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went with that intent, did you? - A. Yes; we took the cart from a carpenter's yard at Low-Layton, near the three Black-birds, below where we committed the robbery; we brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170017"></xptr>cart and property to town; and we out the cart into one Zorble Phillips's yard, in Petticoat-lane; he turned the cart out of his yard, and put it into Tripe's yard; he would not let it stand in his place; he said it was a stolen cart; it staid there about two days. Then Mr. Abbot, the publican, asked me if I had a mind to sell it, he would give me sixteen shillings for it; I told him I did not want it; I used to use his house; he keeps the Duke of Argyle, in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did he ask, you or Ashley? - A. Ashley and me were together; and he asked me in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he offer the sixteen shillings to? - A. He told us to take it to one Prior, and give his compliments to him, at Stepney, and leave it there till he went for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he offer it to? - A. To both of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ashley say he had a share in the cart? - A. Yes; Abbot knew that Ashley and I had stolen the cart, and brought it there; he knew it was a stolen cart; we had taken the number-board off, and we told him it was a stolen cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Abbot long before? - A. I had used his house for some months; we put it in Mr. Abbot's yard till he called for it; we both rode in it there; when we came back Abbot paid for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is the first time you have made your appearance in a Court of this sort, I take it for granted? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you have been examined as a witness, or been at the bar of any Court? - A. No; it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been at the bar of this Court, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be at the bar of this Court? A. I did not come of my own accord, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you brought here for? - A. For what I was cleared of.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it for? - A. A felony; I was cleared of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for stealing any thing? - A. I was charged by a gentleman at Hammersmith, for break ing his house, not stealing any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you have been here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What else were you here for? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here often, perhaps? - A. The more is my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been convicted for? - A. I have not been convicted of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. I was confined six months for buying some pigeons.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you may have been on the other side of the water; you were never tried in Surry, were you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you tried in Surry for? - A. A thing I was not guilty of.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the charge against you? - A. For burglary, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How may times have you been charged in Surry? - A. Only that once.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other things you can remember; how many times have you been in custody in your life? - A. Not above half a-dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you had the good fortune to escape? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been convicted? - A. Only once.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Is not there a woman, of the name of Smith, lives with you? - A. No woman in particular lives with me now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since there has? - A. Within these three or four weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not your wife, I take it for granted. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was unfortunate enough to take lodgings at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This good lady does not live with you now? - A. She could not live with me in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Now and then this woman had an opportunity of going about the house, and the lodgers of coming into the place where she was? - A. I cannot answer for that; nobody had any business in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. They had no opportunity of coming there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You would not be jealous of any man coming to visit this lady? - A. If I had catched them there I should have paid them for their trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not you be angry, and jealous, if another man came to visit this lady? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is certainly not a regular mode of examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not this man, Ashley, visited this lady? - A. Not to my knowledge, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, have you not threatened him for visiting this lady? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, if you got him into your claws you would be up with him? - A. No; he has loaded a brace of pistols to shoot me; I have heard or it, I did not know it.</p>
               <p>For Ashley.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170018"></xptr>Q. In what manner have you known Smith behave towards the prisoner at the bar? - A. I don't know any ill conduct, but when Smith and I have had any words; he has said, damn me, (pardon me, my Lord, for repeating the oath), he would do for him if he got him in his power. The prisoner Ashley has often saved my life, by taking my part against Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. You have lived with Smith as your husband? - A. He drawed me away before I was sixteen; when Ashley first lodged with us, I believe he worked in Falcon-square; he has cut his hand, and been unable to work for these six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any intimacy between Ashley and Smith? - A. Ashley never was in the house from morning to night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they out together of a night? - A. He was never out of a night, in general; I never knew him out but two nights, and then I knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew them out together? - A. Never; unless I was out with them, taking a walk.</p>

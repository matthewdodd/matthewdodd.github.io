                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Stewart Robertson, who keeps an hotel, in Little Brook-street, Hanover-square. The prisoner was our house-maid—she left on the 2nd of December—in November, in consequence of something that passed in reference to an old lady named Williams, from Bath, who lodged at car house, a servant of ours, named Hudson, was taken into custody, and made some statement, in consequence of which the prisoner was taken on the 9th of December, and the officer Fraser produced a cambric pocket-handkerchief to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is it—it was missed about the 27th of November—I had not given it to the prisoner, nor was I aware she had it—it must have been taken from my room—she had to clean the rooms—she left at a week's notice, which is not usual—she gave as notice on account of our leaving the hotel—she did not wish to live with our successors.</p>

               <p>there that night—she had three boxes, which I searched, and in one which was locked I found this handkerchief, in a reticule—I observed a mark on it, and asked If she knew it—she said, yes, it belonged to Mrs. Robert<lb></lb>son—I asked how it came into her box—she said she did not know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man named Taplin was in the habit of calling there for the shopmen's linen; and on that day he called for 17s. 6d. due to him, from Mr. Ware, but he found he had been discharged. He then met me at the gateway, and asked me to pawn his watch for him, as he had not received his money - and said, he would give me the guard and key, if I would pawn the watch; and he would see me again in the evening, and receive the money, and the duplicate. I never saw the watch till Taplin gave it to me, and the witness cannot deny that he had been in the kitchen, where she says she had placed the watch.</p>

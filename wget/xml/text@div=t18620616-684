                  </hi>. I am a ham dealer, of 239, Shoreditch—on 13th May I went to Smith and Payne's bank to meet Mr. Freeman—he was standing outside when I got there; and I saw a short stout person within</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160085"></xptr>
               <p>one or two yards of Freeman, and who was afterwards taken in custody, named Harper—I believe I said to Mr. Freeman, "Hand us over the money, Charley;" and we both went into the bank—they were both standing there with their backs to the wall—inside the bank, Mr. Freeman had a bag containing a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, eight tens, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I took that money and went to Mastermans, in Nicholas-lane—I did not notice when I went out whether Harper was outside—I went to the last desk but one to take up a bill—there was no person at all at that part of the counter; I noticed that particularly—I opened my bag, took out the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and eight tens, and was counting out 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, when I received a sharp touch on this shoulder, as if it was a friend, not as a stranger would touch me—I turned rapidly round and saw the prisoner—in his right hand he held a slip of paper and he seemed to cover me with his left, as he was so close to me; his left hand seemed to pass to the back of me—he stood within two or three inches of my face—he spoke in an assumed tone, I think, saying, "Sir, can you tell me where I can change a draft?"—I believe those were the words—it was a sort of drawl—I do not know who he imitated, but it was as if he was trying to speak like a foreigner, I think—I said, "I do not know; the next desk"—I thought he was very rude, and I answered him irritably—I am positive no other persons were near me—there were no clerks behind the counter at that part—I turned fully round, looked at my notes, and missed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I had just placed on the counter—I did not like to charge him immediately—I folded up the other notes, put them in the bag, and went out after him, but he was gone—I immediately gave information to the police—I ascertained the number of the note within a few minutes—on the following Tuesday, 20th May, I was shown fifteen or twenty strangers, and immediately pointed out the prisoner and Harper—I am positive of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to include Harper and the prisoner in the twenty you had not seen before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw the prisoner in the bank after I missed the note, but while I was satisfying myself that the note was really gone I saw him pass out at the door, and it took some few seconds to pick up the notes and gold and put them in the bag—I saw him pass out while I was searching my pockets—his manner was very suspicious, coming so close to me, and he held a piece of paper so close to me that his left hand certainly touched me, covered me—I could not see his hand behind me, but I had a sort of inanition—I did not like to look at his face.</p>

Bank of England notes," producing them from his trousers' pocket—I said to Harper, "What is your business here?"—he said, "I came with my friend to show him the way, as he is an American and a stranger in London"—I said, addressing both, "What was your business in the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank?"—Weston said, "I thought that was the Bank of England"—I said, "You were also in the Joint Stock Bank and in the Union Bank, what business had you there?"—Weston replied, "I thought each of them was the Bank of England"—I told them that the account was not satis<lb></lb>factory, and I should charge them with being in the Bank of England and other banking houses for the purpose of committing felony, and also a suspicion of having stolen a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the counter at Mastermans' bank about a week previous—neither of them made any reply—I obtained assistance and took them to the Bow-lane station, the charge was read over to them, and they made no reply—I found on Weston four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, three Scotch 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two Irish 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some jewellery—on Harper I found 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English gold, 65 francs in French gold, a bill case, some articles of jewellery, and a passport—he was not committed on this charge, and I have not succeeded in finding him since the indictment has been preferred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first see the bank note which has been put into your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a fortnight ago—Harper signed his name in the book some time after he was apprehended; not on the day of his arrest—I think it was on 20th May (<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>)—I have com<lb></lb>pared the writing—I formed my judgment originally by the comparison, having in my mind another writing—Harper made application for the return of his money on 2d June—I do not know whether the application was appointed to be re-heard, but I found afterwards that it was—a portion of the money was handed over on the 9th, upon which he gave the receipt, and in the mean time I had seen the note.</p>

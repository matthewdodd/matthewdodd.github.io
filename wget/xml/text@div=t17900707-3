               <p>Court. Could a man get into your house from that scaffold? - No, my lord; he might get the things out with a stick, or any thing of that sort; I saw them on the Saturday following; I found them at a pawn-broker's in the Minories; they were pledged for one pound five shillings; the pawn-broker is here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son to Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker, in the Minories. I received these clothes of the prisoner, on Monday, the 21st of June, about noon; I lent him one pound five shillings upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the value of them? - I would not give any more; I am sure he is the man that brought them; he was in the shop about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ATKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the things about half an hour before they were missed; it was between ten and eleven; I missed them about half past ten; I had been several times to put them away, and was called out.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said if I would send him five guineas, he would acquit me; I am innocent; there were several other men at work there.</p>

               <p>Court to Atkins. Is this true; did you offer to make it up? - I did not, my lord, nothing of the sort; I was informed he would bring a person to prove it: a person came to me, and offered me five guineas; and I refused to do any such thing.</p>

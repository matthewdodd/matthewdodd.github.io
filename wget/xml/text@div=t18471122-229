On 4th Nov. the prisoner Jones came in for one pennyworth of pudding—she gave me a George the Third or George the Fourth sixpence—I turned it over two or three times, and doubted it, by its being worn so smooth—I put it into the till, and when I had taken up the halfpence, took it up again, and thought it was good—I gave her the change—she left the shop—there were two Victoria sixpences, not worn at all, in the till, and some other silver; a policeman came in, I took the sixpence that Jones gave me, from the till, tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—I threw it into the till again—the policeman told me to take it out; I did, and put it on the shelf—I afterwards gave it to Rowe—I am sure I gave him the same I received from Jones.</p>

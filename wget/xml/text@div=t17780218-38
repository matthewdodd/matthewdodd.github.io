I then called out very loud to Mrs. Robinson, that the man had a pistol; upon this, the prisoner pulled off his great coat, and I saw him cock the pistol which he held in his right-hand; I went towards my bed, and said, pray don't kill me, and I bid him put away his pistol, for that if any one saw it he would be hanged; I drew up as close to the curtain as I could; the prisoner then stood at about the distance that the counsel is from me (about two yards); he ran up towards me, and fired the pistol which he held in his right-hand at me; I fell against the wainscot; I was sensible of the stroke of the ball; the prisoner threw himself across the bed, and I heard another pistol go off, but I did not see the second pistol in his hand. Upon this, the washer-woman came up, and broke the lower pannel of the door of the bed-chamber, and dragged me out through the hole; the prisoner followed me through the same hole, and then went out.</p>

               <p>I have the care of Mrs. Draper's house; I was in the fore-room of Mrs. Knightley's apartments, between ten and eleven in the forenoon, on the Queen's birth-day, the 18th of January; the prisoner came into this fore-room; I asked him what he wanted? he asked for some person; he mentioned a name; I told him that no such person lived there; he then ran to Mrs. Knightley's bedchamber door; he went into the room, and I heard the key turn; I tried to open it, but found the door fast; I called to the prisoner to open it; he answered, that he would not, for that she was his wife; Mrs. Knightley cried out, that it was no such thing; I said, that if she was his wife he should not be there; Mrs. Knightley again said, she was not his wife; I heard many other words between them, which I did not understand; I said, if he did not come out of the room, I would call Mr. Robinson; Mrs. Knightley desired me to call him, and said you know what I mean.</p>
               <p>What did you understand by that? - She afterwards said she meant a constable. I desired him to open the door, or I would alarm the house; he gave no answer. Mrs. Knightley cried out, Christ Jesus, he has got a pistol! I went to the window and cried out, fire, murder, thieves, to alarm the street. I went up stairs to call some one, and heard the report of a pistol; the chairwoman broke the pannel of the door, and called to me to run after the prisoner. As I was coming from the garret, I saw Mrs. Knightley at the door of the fore-room, upon the landing place; she said, see how the villain has murdered me; she opened her handkerchief, and the blood was running down. I had never seen the prisoner at the house before; I had never seen him before any where to the best of my knowledge; I have lived in this house near a year and half; Mrs. Knightley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180041"></xptr> has been there somewhere about three months.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; I was called on the 18th of January last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, to see Mrs. Knightley; I have attended her ever since; I found her sitting in a chair with a wound on her breast; the wound was through the breast-bone; it appeared to me to be a gun-shot wound; it had something of a burnt appearance; at first, I thought she was in danger; she is now recovering; here is the ball I extracted (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Court. The degree of the wound is totally immaterial; the offence by this Act of Parliament is maliciously shooting at any one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. The ball passed through the cavity of the thorax, and lodged about eight inches distant in the side; I apprehend it missed the lungs; the ball passed in at the left-side into her right, at the distance of about eight inches, and lodged in the integuments; I made an incision upon the part where the ball lodged, and extracted it.</p>
               <p>Does any of the linen or wadding remain now in the wound? - There was a little piece of linen I took out after I had enlarged the wound.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cross is the landlady of the house where I lived ten months before with this lady (Mrs. Knightley); she can speak for the lady, and for me too. This lady, after living with me ten months, and had promised me marriage, removed from this Mrs. Cross's house to Mrs. Robinson's, and cohabited with a Jew, a Mr. Leverman; he is an artificial flower-maker; she removed her lodgings, and cohabited with a Jew, because the master this Jew worked for would not let him be in Mrs. Cross's house; so the Jew took that lodging at Mrs. Robinson's, and I followed her there, and she even the day before promised me matrimony, and promised me a sum of money, that she always told me she had; she succoured me with money at many times; I went with an intent to kill myself before her, and not to kill her; I appeal to her myself, whether I did not go with an intent to shoot myself.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. What do you say to that? - I do not know what he meant to do, but he shot me with a pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to believe that what he suggests is truth, that he came with intent to kill himself? - I do not know whether he might, or might not, with the other pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Three nights before this happened, I attempted before her to shoot myself, and hit my head against the wainscot; and she asked me if I was mad.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen him three nights before? - He did not come three days before as he says; it was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a German; I am very sorry to say any thing; the prisoner and the gentlewoman lodged in my house both together, and very happy, I believe; they came there in the beginning of last summer; they staid there till a month before this unhappy affair happened; but she spoke to the prisoner in my house but two days before this affair happened; she called several times.</p>

               <p>Court. Mrs. Robinson speaks of her being at her house three months.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Robinson. She came the fortnight before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Cross. She left him in my house with me; he was exceedingly fond of her, till she wanted to get shot of him; she did not like to stay with him any more; they behaved very quiet both of them; she then told me that she was not his wife; but before that, she had the receipts given her in the name of Mrs. White, which she said she did that her relations should not know she was married to a foreigner; it was after she went from my house that she told me she was not married to the man; before she went, I understood that she was; and they both lived very happy together; she called upon him several times, and two days before this accident happened; she called upon him the Friday before this happened upon the Sunday; I had much trouble with him, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180042"></xptr> he said he would hang himself, would kill himself, or would shoot himself; so I made him leave my house, because I was frightened. On a Friday, two days before this happened, both this gentlewoman and he came together to my house, and he told her he would buy, or had bought, pistols, or something of that sort; and he would go into her lodgings and shoot himself in her presence, and if one pistol would not do, he would have another, and he would lay his dead bones on her side; and the gentlewoman was very angry that he should be so foolish; he said he could not live without her, for he would kill himself; and I told him he was a fool, and he should not come any more into the house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. This woman says, that you and the prisoner came together to her house on the Friday preceding the day on which this happened? - That is not true.</p>
               <p>Was you at Mrs. Cross's house the Friday before this happened? - No; it was on the Saturday week before this happened; the prisoner told me, Mrs. Cross wanted to speak to me; I saw him in the street; I went to Mrs. Cross's that same day about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner with you? - No; I came just by the door, and saw him coming up the street towards me.</p>
               <p>What happened? Did he talk about shooting you? - No; he never mentioned a word,</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him say then, or at any other time, that he would come and shoot himself, and die by your side? - He told me about ten days before, that he would come and shoot himself, and me first; I met him then accidentally; he did not say any such thing at Mrs. Cross's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no other witnesses here; but I could prove what Mrs. Cross has asserted by twenty people.</p>

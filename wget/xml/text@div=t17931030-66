               <p>Q. Did you lodge there? - I did not, but I was in the same room in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300076"></xptr>evening between the hours of nine and ten, I think it was ten o'clock; there were about three gentlemen in blue coats came into the room, Holmstans and I were sitting on the bed, and several more followed them, I don't know how many more, they were in short jackets, Holmstans and I were sitting on the bed, and this gentleman came in and made mention of this word, here they are, and Holmstans was undressed going to bed, he had nothing on but his shirt and drawers, with that they came in and got hold of this man's shoulder and me immediately; they never asked what we were, nor who we were, but bundled us down stairs, and in the mean time they were shoving us down stairs, there were several of them struck both him and me over our heads as hard as ever they could with both sticks and fists.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass in the room before you came down stairs? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got down stairs what passed? - I was shoved out of doors, I saw no more of the affair, and three of them were jumping on my breast with their knees, and beating me over my head with sticks; I saw no more of the deceased, till I was brought into the house, when I saw a man laying over a chair, and all over a gore of blood.</p>
               <p>Q What countryman was the deceased? - A Swede.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used in the room, on the part of yourself, or the deceased, to these people that came in? - No, I saw no more of it than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How many Swedes do you think were in this house, on the night that this happened? - A great many, above twenty as nigh as I can think.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room where they assembled? - They were all in bed in the room that we were, except two; there was a great many in another room, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lodged there any length of time yourself? - I had lodged there before, but at that time I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that died I believe could not speak a word of English? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were in the room where the deceased was? - There were not above three more, and all the rest were in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more besides Holmstans that was up, and the rest in bed; how many beds were in the room? - Either four or five, I am sure I don't know, either three or four I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get up immediately? - There were three or four up.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - There was one of them cut in the head most shockingly, and he is gone to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe what was done with the other three? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. My good man was not there immediately on the stairs a very considerble confusion, and a great many people come out in their shirts? - There was not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who made use of this expression, and when it was first made, as Swanskey come out? - After I came out in the street, I said for God almighty sake come out and help me, in English, and afterwards I said it in Swedish; and if a gentleman had not come from the other side of the way I should have been murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not hear the Swedes call out in this way? - In the street, but not before.</p>
               <p>Q. On the stairs immediately at the entrance of the door did you hear no voice at all call out to the Swedes to come out? - No, I did not till I got out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think were in the room, so as to force you and the whole down stairs? - There were three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300077"></xptr>gentlemen in blue long clothes, they were the three first, and several more which I cannot tell how many they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light on the stairs? - There was light in the room where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this was instantaneous, took up but very little time? - It was all done in a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore when you came out of your room on the stairs, did you observe whether there was any light or not? was it not all confusion on the stairs, a vast number of people there, Swedes and of others? - There were no Swedes that I saw; I was shoved down stairs as hard as ever I could, and got several blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you don't know the gentleman at the bar, whether he was one of them or not? - Yes, he is one of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know him? - By his face, just when he came into the room there was a light standing right before him, and he said, here they are, here they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the language used, was here they are, how did you understand it? - I don't know what they meant by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any language at all made use of by any other man on the stairs, or was you quite ignorant of what passed till you got into the street? - When I got into the street, I said, I am a protectioned man, I have got this protection, and one of them hit me on the head and called me a Scotch buggar.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Swedes have you reason to think were in the house at that time? - There were only three up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think were in the house of Peterson at this time? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other Englishmen there? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. English seamen did visit that house sometimes? - Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Peterson is what they call a crimp? - Yes, he gets seamen for captains.</p>
               <p>Q. And English seamen come under his view as well as you foreigners? now I want to know whether it past within your hearing or not, that they did not come for foreigners, they wanted to look after somebody else? - I did not hear that, neither in the room nor on the stairs, nor in the street at no way.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. Did you know the prisoner before? or do you know him now only? - I recollect his face very well, he had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I caution you to be a little aware; in the first place you said you did not know him, will you take upon yourself to say that that gentleman had a stick in his hand, supposing him to be the man? - I am sure he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that that man had a stick in his hand? - I never see him before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say before to any body that he had a stick in his hand? - Every man that I see had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. You was examined before the magistrate, you gave in your information on oath before him? you have told us of your having been very much beat, and of your seeing the deceased struck by several of the gang? how happened it when you delivered in your account to the magistrate that you never related one circumstance of that sort, because I have your information here? - I don't understand you, please to explain it better for me.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man was killed there was a coroner's inquisition held? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you did not tell what you do now, that you was struck, and that you saw the deceased struck? - I did say so then as I say now.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other light in the room before you came? - I am not certain there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the gang go up at once? - No, Mr. Watts and Mr. Tuart and another that I did not know, they three went up first, after they were up, Mr. Watts or Mr. Tuart called out to them to come up, he called one man by the name of Baker, and then all the gang came running up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed before the rest came up? - I took the candle in my hand then, and went out of the room, I was very bad with a cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what passed below stairs? - I did not see till the gang and men were out in the street, when I saw Mr. Tuart beating the deceased, I went then to the street door, he was beating him with a stick in the street, the right side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to this man in the street? - In consequence of being beat he tumbled down, and then he came and crawled to the bar, and then he tumbled down again, and then he crawled to the stair case, and tumbled down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Tuart after the deceased was in the house again? - Mr. Tuart came in, he said dear sir, dear sir, what is the matter, I said you are the man that has killed the man, and half murdered him; he said I have got no stick, I said that he was the man, for I saw nobody else strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him that you had seen him, and only him strike him, what did he say? - Dear sir, I have got no stick.</p>

               <p>Q.

We pass the tap room first, before you get to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be talking to you? - He never stopped a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him when he said that? - Watts was with him, he did not speak a word, but I don't know whether Tuart spoke or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Watts pass before Tuart spoke to you? - Tuart followed Watts.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether at the time Watts was going up stairs, Tuart did not stop to speak to you? - They followed one another as quick as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Tuart did not stay a single minute speaking to you while Watts was going up stairs? - He did not, I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not hear somebody call on the stairs before Tuart left you? - There was not, I swear that positively, nobody called out before Tuart went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up with a candle? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room where these Swedes were? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Swedes were there in that room? - I cannot positively say, there might be about twenty men at home at that time, but they were not all in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath cannot you say there was a dozen in that room? - I cannot say that, I have only three beds in that room, and two men in a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not a dozen Swedes in that room? - I never go up with the people to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Tuart, Watts, and the other got into the room before you came there with a candle? - They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried that candle lighted down stairs? - I did, I was first down stairs, I was obliged to let the candle and candlestick all go just at the bottom of the stairs, because they came so fast after me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were coming down stairs after you very fast? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a croud coming down after you? - I cannot tell whether there were two or three, ten or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that, why did you go down stairs with this candle a light? - Why should I stay in that room when I saw a croud of people coming after me.</p>
               <p>Q. A very good answer, on your seeing a croud of people after you, of course you made your escape as well as you could? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the croud coming it was that you put out the candle? - It tumbled out of my hand, I did not put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the expression, that when you was in the room, one of them saying to you, how is this, we don't want any foreigners? - They never made that expression to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that expression made use of? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first of all to say it was not made to you? - I did not give you that answer, I give you no further answer but that I tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was it not your first answer to me? - I never heard them say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell me they did not say so to you? - I tell you to my knowledge what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that expression was not made use of, we don't want foreigners, or something like that? - I will swear it never was to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - To my knowledge I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that expression<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300080"></xptr>was not made use of? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath will you say that that did not pass in the room while you was in the room? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, on the stairs, when you got down, was not that expression made use of? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it asked you for the candle? - Mr. Watts, he held one part of the candlestick and I the other, and I would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you let him have it? - I was not insured a shilling, and that was the reason, I told him I would go up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Watts want the candle for? - He said there was a man that had gone up stairs before him and he wanted a candle to go up to see who that was, I said I would not lend him the candle, I would go up with him; I refused him the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any scuffle ensued between you two? - Not at all, he let go the candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he was sure that man that had gone up stairs was an englishman? - I judge that he supposed the man that was gone up was an englishman by the conversation I had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined in the morning that these men were taken, when the man that was taken to the Hospital died? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say you was so much frightened when you let the candle fall that you could not see how the transaction took place? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drove down the gang that came with these men? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said you knew who drove them down? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never formed any opinion whether the press gang drove down the Swedes, or the Swedes drove the press gang? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor never expressed such an opinion to any body freely? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, you understand a little Swedish? you are a Swede? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect such an expression, Swanskey, come out? - I heard that while I was on the stairs, they said, Swedes come out. I was down on the stairs at that time and the rest were in the room. Watts stood on the landing of the second pair of stairs, and I stood on the stairs, he holding the candle in one hand, and I in the other; the cry was, Swedes. Swedes, come out!</p>
               <p>Q. And then they came out of the room? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call to them to come out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, did not you call to the Swedes to come out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you speak on recollection? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any knives, or poker, or tongs? - I did not; I positively did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps none of the men who were with Tuart were cut with knives? - I don't know whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Watts in the street? On your oath was not Watts's forehead cut across and bleeding at that time? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you, at any time, see Watts with his head tied up and bleeding? - The next day I saw him with his head tied up, but that night I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you think it would hurt you in your business a good deal? - I think I must be a very ignorant man to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. It would hurt your favour with these people that frequent your house? - How is it possible I would venture my getting my living.</p>
               <p>Q. To be sure it would be a bad thing, and they would resent it. You never had any conversation with Tuart or Watts, or any body in your house? - I have often treated the gang civilly in my house not to take them out. The night before that I went down Thames-street to buy some china, and I saw them at the door of the City of Bristol, and I went in and treated Watts and some others with a shillingworth of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never did, on that occasion give them any information of persons in your house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perhaps tell them of any persons that were on board the Lioness? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they at that time knew that you had only Danes and Swedes drinking? - I don't know what they knew.</p>
               <p>Q. It was well known that the persons who appeared to be at your house, appeared like foreigners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet they came that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not come after foreigners? - Yes, they often press the foreigners as well as others, to over haul them, to search them, to see whether they are or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any englishmen in you house that night? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had such a thing as this happen in your house before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath had you any man in your house who was not a foreigner? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - On my oath I don't know that there were.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you on your oath believe you had an englishman in your house? - I am not certain; I was very ill; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Peterson, mind well the answer you give on this occasion. Upon your oath had not you told some persons that there were some englishmen escaped out of your house that night that press gang came? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor out of the top of your house? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You know a man of the name of Miller, of the Green Dragon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know his wife perhaps? - I know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you, to these two persons, declare that some englishmen escaped out of your house? - If I tell things at random, I tell at random, but when I am on my oath, I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then declare it at random or not at random? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not declared that some sailors got out of the top of your house that night? - I never did to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I get in the street talking to a man I forget it before the next day; I may remember it or I may not; how is it possible to remember it?</p>
               <p>Q. You know this accident has made a great noise, and is a particular thing. Don't you know whether you have had any particular conversation about this remarkable subject? - O yes, I have heard often talking of one to another about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never given in the names of persons that got out of your house that night? - I never did to any body whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You took this man up at the City of Bristol, the inn called so. Did not Watts produce to you the names of four men that you had given information of at your house? - He did either produce it there or at the justice's, he said three names; but I never did such a thing; I never had such men at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Upon your oath don't you know, and verily believe this, that they came there in search of an englishman, and that the Swedes, to a great number in your house, being alarmed there was a great commotion, and that what happened was in consequence of this sudden affray? - I don't know what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know on your oath that they would avoid troubling in any degree a man that they knew to be a Swede.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you was taken up for receiving stolen goods? - It was a heap of nonsense; they took me up, but what could they do?</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you taken up afterwards? - There was something concerning smuggling some worsted over to France.</p>
               <p>Q. You will say butter is not lead, it don't weigh quite so heavy? - How do I know about that; I was not tried for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your general way of getting your living is as a crimp? - I sell beer and brandy, and other things as a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you do you act as a crimp? - Yes, they call it a crimp; landlord is the common name.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. We have heard something about your being tried at Hick's Hall? - I was, and was acquitted without calling any witnesses for myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he fall on his face? - I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you a question, and I can prove it I promise you; how long was it that Mr. Tuart, the gentleman at the bar, was in conversation with Peterson before Watts went up? - They had no conversation of any length.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know if you heard this; that when they came in, addressing themselves to Peterson, they asked him where the four men were? - I did not hear that.</p>

               <p>I live in Limehouse, Narrow-street, four or five doors from Mr. Peterson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in this street on Sunday the 18th of August? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Holmstans in the street that afterwards died? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw him in the street, who else did you see there? and what did you see done to him? - I heard a cry of murder! and I went out of doors, the first thing I saw was several candles, and I went a little further and the deceased was leaning over a post and there were two of the gang beating him with sticks over the loins; one I should know again if I was to see him, the other I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of that one that you should know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the man that afterwards died, when you saw these two men beating him? - He could not get away from the place where they were beating him, till he was fetched away by two men; I went and saw him after he was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Tuart coming into the house afterwards? - I don't remember seeing any of them, because they went away directly the man was taken in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did you see in the street besides these two men and the deceased? - I saw some of the gang, but I should not know them; there was only one man that I minded in particular, that was a shortish man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Swedes in the street? - Yes, I saw one of them looking after a shoe, with a candle in his hand after the gang went away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pupil to Mr. Blizard. I was at the hospital, and attended a person of the name of Holmstans on Sunday the 18th of August; he was brought in Sunday evening about twelve o'clock, in a state nearly of insensibility, on examining him, I found a wound appeared on the lower, and a contused one on the upper part of the left side of the head, it was rough and bloody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300087"></xptr>Q. Had he any other wound? - No, except a bruise on his right arm; he died on the 20th of September, a month and two days after he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his body after he died? - Yes, it was examined, I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the contusion the cause of his death? - The immediate cause of his death, was a disease and bleeding of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say from what cause was that bleeding and disease? - It is likely to be from the injury that he received at the time of the bleeding of his head. On examination the lungs were found very much diseased, and contained a great quantity of matter; Mr. Blizard was the principal, and I attended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You see a blow on his head, could you say, or can you say that bore it an appearance, such as you could determine on your oath, whether it was received by a blow, or whether it might have been by a fall? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>- BLIZARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon to the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember attending the deceased when he was brought there? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open him after the decease? - I did. The immediate cause of his death was certainly a bleeding of the lungs; I suppose the lungs might have received an injury at the time he received the hurt on his head; he had a wound originally on the left side of the head, the symptoms impressed a strong suspion of a fracture, on opening the body a fracture was discovered very low down, under the right ear, and under such circumstances that induced me to believe that it was not received by a blow, but that in all probability it was from a fall, because it would be very difficult to induce a blow there, so as to give a fracture; in this fractured part there was a portion of wound intirely surrounded, and the fracture could not have been in consequence of a blow the opposite side of the head, but it must have arisen from a distinct blow, or hurt on that part.</p>
               <p>Q. To which of the bruises do you ascribe his death? - I ascribe his death to the bleeding of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that complaint on the lungs likely to be produced in consequence of a blow on the head? - An inflammation might be produced there in consequence of violence, as well as from many other occasions.</p>

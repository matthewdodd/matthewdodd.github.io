               <p>Does that happen sometimes? - Yes, sometimes, according how the bells are fixed; about half an hour after the last tingle, I heard a crash in the kitchen window where I lay; I heard the shutter fall in, and some plates fall; I sleep in the kitchen below; and I got up, I put on my stockings and breeches, and went up stairs and rang the parlour bell; nobody came down; I went up and told my father that somebody had broke into the house, and I looked out at the garret window and I saw the shutters of the kitchen pulled off; about half an hour after, I went down in the two pair of stairs room; and then I heard the plates crack again, which I thought was somebody coming in; when I was opening the two pair of stairs door, I heard like the handle of a drawer go; I said, there is somebody in the house, for they are at the drawers.</p>
               <p>Where did that noise seem to proceed from? - From a room that adjoins to the parlour; my father and me went down stairs, and looked about the parlour; we went into the surgery, and found the door open, and a green slider taken from off the drawer; says I, there certainly must be somebody in the house, for they have pulled this drawer out; there was a shutter that gives light to this room; I saw some clothes packed up, and a chair cover; they were laying on a chair in the study; I was going into the study, and the door would not go back; says I, there is something behind the door; I looked behind the door, and I saw the prisoner behind the door; with that he came out, and he said, let me go out, let me go out; my father and me would not let him go out; he had a scuffle in the passage; and there is a hatch door with spikes, and he tried to pitch my father's head on these spikes; I had a piece of marble hearth in my hand, and I hit him over the head with that, and staggered him; he recovered that, and ran to the street door, and tried to get out; my father ran to the door, and snatched the key out; then I ran to the parlour window, and opened it and let in a person; then he was quiet; he was taken into the parlour; in two minutes, he said, let me go, you have not got a constable; I got a constable and took him to the watch-house; I examined the kitchen window, and the bar of the window was broke near the middle; the sash was not fastened, so that he lifted that up.</p>
               <p>Is there an area to your kitchen? - Yes, he got down into the area; the bar is here; the things that were packed up were two coats, and two waistcoats belonging to my father.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light? - It was day-light when he was taken in the house.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light when he broke in? - It was twilight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not the gentleman take his oath at the office that it was half past<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250074"></xptr> six? - I took my oath it was between the hours of four and six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire you will enquire into this young man's character; here are people now in Court to prove, that he has been committed for robbing a man of his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the impudence to talk about a man's character, when you was caught in the house, how came you into the house? you ought to have some sense of your own condition!</p>

               <p>At about half after five I received the prisoner into custody; I locked him up safe; I attended the best part of the day, and in the evening I saw many different people there; in the evening I applied to our clerk to have assistance; I thought I should not be safe; accordingly he ordered me to get three or four men; when I came back I got one Johnson, one of our patrols, and several of our neighbours came along with me; when I opened the watch-house door, the iron wicket door was broke down on the ground; one of the staples of the lock-up door was drawn; the cross bar that goes across, that was likewise knocked down; I looked at him, says I, my friend, you have been at work here, you must have some working tools; I must see what sort of working tools you have; he looks through the wicket door at me, says he, d - n your eyes, the first man that enters in here to me shall be a dead man; and I says to our patrol, draw your cutlass, and we will see who is to be the dead man; he drew his cutlass, and I said, if you see him lift up his hand, cut him; three or four of us went in and searched him, and I looked down and found this large iron crow; I imagine it had been handed through the door; the watch-house is contiguous to the street, and has iron bars about an inch asunder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Boyden. Did not you say, that if I would give you three guineas, you would let me go? - Never was any such proposal; I have been thirteen years watch-house keeper.</p>

               <p>What value do you set upon them? - It is a tender point, as it touches life; I would be as humane as I could be.</p>
               <p>Answer the question, what are they worth to be disposed of? - They may be referred to any gentleman; I am upon the point of taking a man's life though he had no mercy upon me.</p>
               <p>What did you pay for them? - Four pounds ten shillings, when I have the breeches to them they generally put six pounds to me.</p>

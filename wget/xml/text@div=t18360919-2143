I have a son of the name of Thomas Welsh—he is married to Elizabeth—they have a little boy called Thomas, three years and a half old—he is not baptized—I have the care of him—on the 1st of September, between five and six o'clock, he was safe at my house—he went into the street to play—I missed him between five and six, and found him at Bow-street between seven and eight—his clothes were all on when I found him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Moor-street, St. Ann's, Westminster—I keep a grocer's shop. About half-past six o'clock on the night of the 1st of September, I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner pass, and she ap<lb></lb>peared to be in liquor—that is about fifty yards from King-street—she walked across the street. and stood there a few minutes—the little child was sitting on the steps of a door—I saw her take the child up and carry it off—I do not know that she spoke tom it—the child was quite quiet all the time—she went up Moor-street, and turned round to Greek-street, into Litchfield-street—she then turned off to the back of Newport-market, through Princes-court, and into Porter-street, and from there to Great Newport-street—I there stopped her—she was walking fast, with the child in her arms—I told her to set the child down, and said, "I don't think that child is yours"—she said it was; I might follow her, or go home with her, if I chose—I followed her down St. Martin's-lane, into the Mit✗ public-house, in St. Martin's-lane—I stopped about ten minutes till she came out again—she then went on, down St. Martin's-lane, into Bedford<lb></lb>bury and Bedford-court—there were a good many children at play—she took one by the hand, and it began to cry—I reported in the court that I thought she was a child-stealer—the children all set up crying, "A child-stealer, a child-stealer"—she turned back into Bedfordbury, and there was taken.</p>

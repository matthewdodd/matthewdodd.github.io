            . I saw the deceased coming up from the workhouse. [she belongs there] as the dray was turning at a corner; the drayman call'd to her to turn back, but she would not. She was about ten foot before the fore-horse. She kept forward, and he could not stop his horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she have avoided the dray in the condition she was?</p>
               <p>Wells. Yes, if she had turn'd back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pett. Could she hear well?</p>
               <p>Pett. Yes, she had her hearing well.</p>
               <p>Wells. The dray was going down hill, and the cattle were strong; the prisoner call'd to his horses as much as he could to stop, and he pull'd the horse he had hold of; the place being so very narrow, people could not meet a dray as it comes down without running a hazard. She got as far as the dray-man; he clap'd his hands on her shoulder to get her clear if he could, but he could not; the dray took her against her stomach, just as the horses had turn'd the corner, and the dray stop'd against her, and her back drove in a plank of the boards she was drove up against. As soon as the dray was drawn back, she drop'd down, and I saw her carried away for dead.</p>
               <p>Pett. I saw her after she was dead.</p>

            . On the 16th of January, between nine and ten o'clock, the deceased came up on the same side the prisoner was on; he was driving his horses, gave her a shove, and said woman where are you going? But she did not stop, but went forward, up to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he shove her?</p>
               <p>A. Littleby. To go from him; he pull'd with the halter and call'd wo! but the horses were going down hill, and he could not stop them; it jamb'd her to the corner of the wall. She had a tin pot in her hand, and when the dray was drawn back, she fell down dead with it in her hand; she never stir'd afterwards, for the dray took her by the breast.</p>

            . The prisoner was going to turn down the gateway; the horses turn'd in very short, it being a very narrow way. I heard him hollow to the woman, and I saw him shove her to clear her, but could not. I don't think there is room for any body to pass a dray there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does that dray belong to?</p>
               <p>Howard. To Duffill and Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they furnish the horses, or does the dray man ?</p>
               <p>Howard. They do. I saw the dray take the woman, and jamb her up. We drew the dray back, and she fell down dead.</p>

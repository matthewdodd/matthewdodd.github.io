                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Christopher Fryer, who lives at North-bank, Regent's-park. On the 20th of March, the prisoner came to the house, about six o'clock (he had called on the 18th, but I did not know him—he was dressed as a sweep, and said it was time for the chim<lb></lb>neys to be swept)—he came on the 20th in the name of our sweeper, and swept the kitchen chimney—the spoons were then on the shelves, and the knives and forks on the table—I left the kitchen for two or three minutes, and when I came back the other boy who came was up the chimney, and</p>

The prisoner was out of place, and he asked me to let him stay with my boys at my place—I knew they went to the prosecutor's on the 20th, but I did not send them—when I heard of this I went and saw the prisoner in the station-house—I then went home, and found the two spoons and one fork under the bed on which the prisoner had slept, and the other things were in my cellar.</p>

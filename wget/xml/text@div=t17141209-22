The like Word were sworn to by another Witness; but there was none swore to the Wound given. On the Prisoner's behalf, it was sworn, That the Deceas'd and another Man, being drinking at his House, he refus'd to let them have any more till they had paid for what they had; whereupon the Deceased had him give him 2s. saying he had given him Half a Crown; but that in Truth he had given him nothing; whereupon a Quarrel happen'd, and the Deceased struck the Prisoner; throu which the Prisoner ran and fetch'd the Ax to frighten him, but could not tell how the Wound came. Others prov'd, That the Wound had but just cut the skin and that he was up and down very well, and often in Drink, and had agreed it with the Prisoner for a Guinea.

                  </hi>. I live on Sydenham-hill, and am overseer of the poor of Dulwich parish, in Camberwell. I know the prisoner perfectly well—I have heard he has been in the police—he has not been chargeble on the parish since my time—he was employed on the parish roads to do work—I was on the committee of the highways—the sweepings of the highways were sold for the benefit of the parish it was the duty of the persons employed on the roads to put the sweepings in heaps, and leave it for the contractors, who come and take it away—I saw the prisoner to engaged on Saturday fortnight—I think that was the 13th of February—he was in company with a person named Dowse—I saw them wheeling the road-stuff off the road, towards the Greyhound—the prisoner had just returned—the other man had the barrow in his hand—seeing them so engaged, I first asked the prisoner where he was wheeling it—I understood him to say, "You may fined it out"—nothing more passed between me and the prisoner—I went a few yards distance, and thenasked Dowse where he was wheeling it—he pointed do the place where he had been—the prisoner might be near enough to hear that—Dowse did not say, to the Greyhound—he pointed to the place—I made a report of what I had seen to the Board—the result of that was, that the prisoner was dismissed by the chairman and the committee at large, (the committee of the highways)—on the following Monday—I left the vestry on the Wednesday evening, the 24th of February, on horseback—I went in the direction of my house—when I got past East Dulwich chapel, and the Plough public-house, I observed something on the road—it was half-past eight o'clock, and quite dark—immediately a voice called out to me, "Who are you?" or, "Who comes here"—I do not know which—I immediately drew up to the person addressing me, quite close—I could have touched him—I then saw distinctly who it was—it was the prisoner at the bar—I observed he had a gun in his hand—he said something, but I cannot recollect what—I was agitated and touched the more very quickly, and when I got a short distance I turned my head, and saw the prisoner levelling the gun, pre<lb></lb>senting a at me—I immediately threw myself on the neck of the mare,</p>

               <p>and hung on—I got about the distance of the mare, and then fell on the road—I immediately scrambled and got up and ran off—I distinctly heard the snap of the gun—I am sure of it—I then ran on as fast as I could to the toll-gate—I was about 300 yards from it—the keeper's name is John Morris—I took shelter and remained there about twenty minutes—I saw the prisoner outside the gate while I was there—I heard him say to Morris he might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and he was invit<lb></lb>ing me to come out—he was continually talking to Morris, but I did not hear what he said—he was full twenty minutes outside the toll-house—I had him taken into custody that night—I saw nothing more of the gun till it was produced at Union Hall—that was on Friday, I think—Simmonds, I belive, took him.</p>

On the next day I met John Jones—the prisoner was not with me. I got the gun I now have in my hand from Mrs. Dowse, who lives on Dulwich Common. I got it on Friday morning about ten o'clock—I examined the gun—it was not loaded—I examined the pan and touch-hole, and there was black powder—it presented the appearance of having been recently discharged.</p>

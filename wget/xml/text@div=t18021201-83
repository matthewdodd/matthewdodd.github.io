             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Barnard; On the 1st of Novemebr, between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see some figured sarsent ribbon; when they looked at it sometime, Barnett asked Fisher to take off her bonnett, for them to seen which ribbon looked best; they looked some time, and Barnett took Fisher's bonnet in her hand; I suspected them, and put the drawer away, and put other ribbon before them; after looking at that sometime, I observed Barnett take a piece of pink searsent out of the drawer, she had

            's bonnet in her hand at the time; she was very particular how she returned the bonnet; and by Fisher being so particular how she put her bonnet on, I suspected the ribbon was in it; they looked at the drawer of ribbon sometime after, and rather scrupled the prices; I told them they and better look at some narrower ones; when I put the articles before them, I asked the young woman of the shop to serve them, and fetched Mr. Irving, and then I went to Fisher and desired her to pull off her bonnet, for I suspected she had a piece of ribbon in it; she pulled it off, and I saw the piece of ribbon drop on the floor; it was about sixteen or seventeen yards; I then went for a constable, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Which got hold of the ribbon first? - A. Ann Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other took the bonnet; is it not usual to take off the bonnet to cotnpare with ribbon? - A.Some do, and some do not. (The ribbon produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Q. You know ladies wear bonnets with false linings, and it might drop in? - A. No; I saw her take it, and found it in the bonnet.</p>
               <p>Why did you not tell her? - A.She took it; I did not know where she put it; I suspected them I did not ask her for it; I saw it drop out of the bonnet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Who enquired for the ribbon? - A. Ann Barnett, her bonnet was taken off, and the ribbon was in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Did he charge the woman who pulled off her bonnet with taking it? - A. Yes, I think he said you have taken a piece of ribbon.</p>

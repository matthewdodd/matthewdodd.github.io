Going a little farther I met a gentleman and a watchman; I said I had been robbed; the gentleman said he had just been robbed; we went back to the corner of the road; there was a man that stood by and saw me robbed; then the watchman came up; I bid him hold his lanthorn up to look at this man; I said I know you by sight; yes, said he I water the horses at White-Conduit-House; the watchman said if I would give charge of him he would secure him; the people there said he was an honest fellow; I did not care to have any more trouble about it and let him go.</p>

            . On Thursday the 22d of April the prisoner came to my house, the White Lion, at Dover (I keep a hatter's shop likewise) between half after seven and nine, and asked for a lodging; he asked if there were any watch makers in the town, or any pawnbrokers; I told him there were no pawnbrokers, there were two or three watchmakers; he said he had walked all the way from Stroud; that he stopt at Canterbury, and called upon a watch-maker, and asked him whether he would buy this watch; he put his hand in his pocket and took out this watch (producing it); the man said he would not, for he had paid a fine for taking in silver without a licence; he gave me the watch to look at; he desired me to keep it till morning for he had no money; he told me he had a rich uncle at Paris, and was going over to see him; I told him he might depend upon it he would be a French soldier as soon as he got to Calais if he had no money. In the morning he asked me to lend him something on the watch; the watch-maker said he would lend him 15 s. upon it if he would draw a note; he came to my shop and said he would be glad to have his watch again, for he had something else to dispose of; I asked him what it was; he said my uncle will not like to see me in such coarse linen as I have got on; he took out a Manchester note for 7 l. 7 s. and asked me to change it; I told him he might go to a Mr. Law, a draper, in the town, and that if it was good he might change it with him; he went there: as he was a stranger Mr. Law would not change it; he told me he went to Mr. Farley, Mr. Factor's clerk: he came back and said d - n the notes, I wish they were burnt or lost; he said pray get me a horse that I may go back again, and trembled, and seemed frightened; I thought there might be more than this by his saying notes; I said lend me that note I will get it changed; he gave it me; I said upon second consideration I could not change it, but I had dealings with Mr.

I told him I would endeavour to get him cash directly; I slipt out to the Mayor, and shewed him the two notes and the watch; the Mayor got two Justices to the Court-Hall; I had the prisoner up there, and they examined him; he said to the Mayor that he followed a gentleman through a street, and saw his pocket book fall out of his pocket; that his brother took these notes out and sent the pocket book back to the owner; he was committed to gaol.</p>

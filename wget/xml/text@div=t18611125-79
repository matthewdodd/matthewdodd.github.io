                  </hi>. I live at 42, Blackman-street, Borough—on 21st June last I was in partnership with my brother, carrying on the business of ironmongers—on that day the male prisoner came into our shop—he said he was about being married, and wanted his house furnished—he gave his name as Edmund or Edward Low, salesman, in the market, and had a banking account with Hill's—he requested that some party should be sent out, as he did not know much about that business, and he wanted one of us to come and see what he wanted; he said the house was 5, Grove-terrace, Peckham—I went to the house, and I there saw the male prisoner and a woman whom he represented as being his servant—he ordered the furnishing of his house to the amount of 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he said he was about being married—his intended wife was not there then, but about a week afterwards the servant that I saw there, called at my house, and introduced the female prisoner as the intended Mrs. Low—she then selected some things, and took some away with her—there was a good deal of electro<lb></lb>plate which he said he thought beat to leave to her—there was also a dressing</p>

               <p>case, a razor strop, and a pair of razors—she said she wanted the dressing case for her intended husband—I fancy she said, "To make a present of it"—I, on that occasion, asked her when I should go for payment of the goods that had been seat before—she said if we would send out a bill no doubt Mr. Low would like to look over it—I went to the house that night, saw the female there, and requested her to hand it to Mr. Low—she said that Mr. Low was at that time at Romford, and he might go on to Leicester—I went again a day or two afterwards, and only saw the servant—I did not see either of the prisoners again after that—I called several times—about four weeks after the goods were supplied I went to the house, and found it shut up—this dressing case, razors and strop (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the goods that the female prisoner took away with her—what induced me to part with the goods in the first instance was the female prisoner's reference to the bankers, and in the next instance it was the male saying she was going to be married to Mr. Low—I made inquiry at Hill's, and parted with the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elbow-lane, Shadwell. I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—she attends the markets—she is single—she sells fish and fruit, and all things that are in season, and that is my employment also—last Tuesday I employed a porter to carry some oysters for me to the Duke of York public-house, Ratcliffe-highway—I went to the place where I had appointed to meet him—he had come with the oysters, and had them on the pitching block—it was between five and six o'clock in the evening—I had seen the prisoner about nine or ten o'clock that morning, by the Duke of York door, at the same place—I had not seen her between that time and five or six o'clock—I had no difference or words with her at all between nine and ten o'clock—in the evening, as I was coming out of the Duke of York, I saw the prisoner sitting down by the side of the door—she got up off the seat—before she got up, she said, "You have most likely taken part with your mother"—(my mother was not there then—I had not seen my mother since the morning)—I said to the prisoner, "You had better leave my mother alone"—I was walking away from her, and she followed me with an oyster knife—she was not selling oysters then—she was sitting there with red herrings, but she had the oyster knife in her hand as she sat there—she said she would stab the one eye out my head—I did not say any thing—my face was to her then—I put up my hand to save my eye, and I received the wound from the knife in the thick part of my hand—she had followed me about two yards, and got me close up against the pump, with the knife in her hand—my back was to the pump—she was quite close to me when I received the cut in my hand—she had followed me up as close as she could, and I went up against the pump, as she <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> the knife into me—she was not half a yard from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 36, Angel-gardens. Last Tuesday the prosecutor was taken very ill, and asked me to follow the porter home with the oysters, and I followed the porter to the Duke of York, with the oysters—I was there when Donovan came there—the prisoner was sitting down by the Duke of York, alongside some red<lb></lb>herrings—I do not know whether they were hers—they were for sale—Donovan went into the Duke of York to get change for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to pay the porter—I saw him come out to pay the porter—I heard the prisoner say "I suppose you mean to take up your mother's cause?"—she was sitting down—he said, "You had better leave my mother alone"—she instantly got up, and followed him with the knife in her hand—she said she would <hi rend="italic">job</hi> the other eye out of his head—he put up his hand to save his eye—he was drawing himself back—his face was towards the prisoner—he went back a very little distance—he was close against the pump, and the prisoner followed with the knife—he put up his hand to save his eyes, and received the blow in his hand—I saw the blow made—it seemed to be aimed at his eye—I could see that—she was very close against him—I was so frightened I could not stop to see any more—she sat herself down again after striking the blow—his hand was bleeding terribly after she made the blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She was not there at the time at all—she is evidence against me because he could not get any body else—she lives with him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not—I am sure of that—I never lived with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday afternoon, between five and six o'clock, Donovan came to the station-house for me—it is three or four hundred yards from the Duke of York—he was bleeding very much at the left hand—it appeared to have had a severe stab in what I believe is called the ball of the thumb—in consequence of what he said I went to the Duke of York—the prisoner was sitting by the door—I told her I was come to take her into custody for stabbing Donovan—she said it was as much his fault as it was hers, and with that she said she stabbed him with the knife—she had no knife with her—I took her to the station-house—I then returned and found an oyster-knife lying in a basket on the top of some oysters in a tub on the pitching-block about two yards from where she was sitting—she was apparently perfectly sober—quite so.</p>

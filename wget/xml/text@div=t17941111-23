             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let lodgings to the prisoner? - I did, on Tuesday the 19th of September; she did not take it for any certain time; she said perhaps for two or three years, she did not take it for herself, but for her niece, who was eleven years old, and was coming from a boarding school; the niece never came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner there? - About one hour on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your things? - I missed them that night; she came at five, and I missed them about eight; she went out at seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been alone in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be alone? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts was the room in the house? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss? - One bed quilt; three sheets, two pillow cases, and two wine glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover them? - No, never found them since.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never came back? - No, she never came.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen her since? - I saw her when she was taken, I am very certain it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the wife of William Gale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see any one of the people before they swore to me at the office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am positively sure it is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witness to send for; my sister is in confinement at present.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure that these things was in the room when the prisoner went in? - I am sure of it, and there was no person but her and me in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a sister that is a twin, that was born half an hour after me; and our parents did not know one from the other, we are so much alike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. She is in custody for a similar offence; I have seen her, it is impossible for to know one from the other.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you tell of any body else that can identify the prisoner at the bar? - I have no witness but myself, none belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. The sister was stopped at Newgate; we had intelligence of her offence; and we were afraid of letting them see each other almost, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110055"></xptr>fear we should not know them again.</p>

I said, "Yes, it wanted washing;"—something was said about some boots which were left on the roof, and he said, "I bought them in Westminster yesterday morning, and gave 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—we had the boots with us in the cart—he was quite sober—it is three and a half miles from Hammersmith to the prosecutor's.</p>

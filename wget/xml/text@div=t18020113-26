When I recovered myself, I followed, crying out stop thief, to Rosemary-lane, and to Salt-petre-bank, but was afraid to go any further, being a stranger. I have not the least doubt that Brewer was one, and that Doyle took my watch. I was perfectly sober, if I had not been so I could not have acted as I did. I have never had the things again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Was your comvanion drunk? - A. Yes; I had been drinking with him in a public-house about two minutes before, we had sixpennyworth of rum and water; I had been drinking some beer in a private house, but I drank no more than I thought would do me good, I cannot tell how much; I did not drink three quarts, nor two, but cannot tell how much; I only drank sufficient to quench my thirst, I was not drunk; there might be seven or eight pots among four or five in company.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw either of the men before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it not? - A. It was starlight enough for me to distinguish their faces; and there was a light from the public-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who took your watch was in sailor's clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common dress in that part of the town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did the first scussle last? - A. Not two minutes; and the second not a minute. I have no doubt they are the persons with whom I had the two scussles.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is Leman-street lighted with lamps? - A. It was at the bottom, in the very darkest part; there was one lamp belonging to the sugar-house that gave a bad light; I trusted to the star-light, and the light of the public-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell: I had information, and went to Salt-petre-bank, and on the Tuesday evening I apprehended Brewer in St. Catherine's-lane, I knew him well before; Doyle was in company with another man, I had an information against him at that time; I found on Brewer a black crape round his hat, he said, he was in mourning for his mother; and upon Doyle I found two keys, one he said belonged to his house, and the other to a lodging in St. Catherine's-lane.</p>
               <p>Brewer's defence. I had been two days locked up before they took the crape from my hat; and the prosecutor at first said he did not know either of the men, and took a man with a green coat on, because he said he did not know either of our faces.</p>
               <p>Doyle's defence. A man, named Farmer, asked me if I wanted a constant birth, I said I did, and he took me to Shadwell office; I staid at the White Lion while he spoke to the clerk, as he told me; he came to me, and said he had got me the birth; we had some beer, and in about five minutes the officers came in; they called Brewer by name, he got up, and they hand-cussed him; they said, young man we want you, but did not know my name; Cook said they wanted nothing with me, and I staid there till near ten o'clock; I met Brown, and said, what did you want with me; he said, nothing of no great consequence, but I want you now, and he took me; I have people to prove where I was at the same time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know him before that time? - A. I cannot say I did, ever to be in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. An unfortunate woman; St. Catherine's is about half a mile from Leman-street; Doyle has lived along with me three months; I did not attend at the Justices; I told he officers he was with me all day, to the best of my knowledge, but cannot be positive; I don't know how he has got his living; he went to the water-side umping, and sometimes to biscuit-baking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he came from? - A. I heard people talk; he told me he came from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other day you can tell me, when he was with you all day? - A. No, I cannot tell any day but that; he dined, and drank tea with me; he drank tea with me often; I know Brewer of further than seeing him in the public-house with thers; a woman drank tea with me that day.</p>

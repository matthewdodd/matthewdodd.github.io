               <p>Q. At what time of night did you see this before it was broken open - A. Between eight and nine o'clock at night on the night before; in the morning I found the bar raised, and a crooked hole cut in the gate; a person could get at the bar to raise it up, by means of that hole, by cutting away the gate: the hole appeared crooked as if cut with a knife; the knife I believe was found in the prisoner's box; the gate was cut with a knife, the hole was big enough to put a hand in; that I saw between eight and nine in the next morning; I went into the waggon office and saw Mr. Greenwood looking over his papers in his desk. I found his desk had been broked open.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the person get at the waggon office - A. By breaking away some brick work and forcing some boards down; a partition divided the waggon office and stables, that partition was made of wood, there is some brick work at the top of that, there had formerly been a door there, and on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110020"></xptr>top of that brick work, the brick work had tumbled down, it appeared to be tumbled down by a dung fork the point of the fork was bent. Mr. Greenwood also observed there was a box broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose box was that - A. It belonged to the witness Smith, and the things were taken out, and on looking down by the side of the box, I found an iron pin that was used in binding the waggon, that iron pin appeared to have opened the box and the desk; there were marks on the box and the desk that corresponded; then I went into the accompting house, and compared the pin with the desk, it had been used as an iron crow to the desk; the marks in the desk also corresponded with the pin; some money was taken out of the desk, how much I cannot say, the time piece was laying on the desk in the accompting house, that was gone also; from knowing the situation these things were kept in, I knew the robbery must have been done by some persons well acquainted with the place. I knew that the prisoner had been in Mr. Willan's employ. and was out of work, and having seen him in different company, my suspicion fell on the prisoner on the Sunday following I understood he had gone down to Marlow; I went down to Marlow after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him at Marlow - A, Not at that time, I found him at last at Bisham it adjoins Marlow; I saw the prisoner there at Bisham, he was very bad in bed with the small pox, his box was in the house with him;

             the witness got the key of his box from Mrs. Creswell, in his box there were several shirts and a great quantity of wearing apparel, which wearing apparel turned out to be the property of Smith, the witness in court. He was ill, we did not remove him then: when he got well he was brought by Clark to London. The prisoner confessed to having done the whole thing himself, it was perfectly voluntary on his part; he said he had broken open the place himself, he was distressed for money it struck him he might get some money out of the waggon office to take him home to his friends, I asked him whether he did not expect at that time there was one of the bankers boxes of silver; he said he did, he knew very well they frequently came there by the coaches, he said he did expect that. On the last day of his examination, I took the shirt off his back, it turned out to be Mr. Smith's. marked S. S. No, 4; I have the shirt here; he broke through the gates into a stable.</p>
               <p>Q. He broke through a door way - A. Yes; that door had been railed up some time, he got over the door way into the waggon office in the door way: there is the coach office on the right, and on the left hand the waggon office, they are all fenced in with a fence.</p>

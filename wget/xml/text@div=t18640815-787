I am a shipbuilder at Sunderland—on 13th July I was stopping at the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street—about 2 o'clock on the afternoon of that day I was on Fish-street-hill, and saw the prisoner Gunn close to me—he went away suddenly, and I looked and discovered my watch was gone—I followed him into the crowd, called out to a policeman, and caught him—my chain was hanging down as I held him—I observed the watch pass from his hand into the prisoner Ansell's hand—it could not</p>

I am a carman in the employment of the Great Northern Railway, and live at 34, Carlton-place, Kingsland-road—on the afternoon of 13th July I was on Fish-street-hill, between a quarter and twenty minutes past 2—there was a regiment of soldiers coming along, and a band playing—I heard the prosecutor say something about his watch, and saw Gunn step out into the road and the prosecutor after him, immediate followed by Ansell—Ansell caught hold of Gunn by the collar and put his right hand down, and Gunn dropped the watch into it—I thought Ansell was a detec<lb></lb>tive at first, but I sprang upon him in the same manner, and he dropped the watch into my hand from his—he did not see me; I was behind him—I gave the watch to the policeman, who came through the ranks of the soldiers from the other side of the road.</p>

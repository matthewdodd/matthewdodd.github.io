               <p>Q. Did you miss any property of your's? - A. I missed the gratings from our area, on Good Friday morning, about half past six; I had seen them about ten o'clock in the evening, before they were missed, over the kitchen area.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they iron bars? - A. Yes; in consequence of information from Mr. Wood, I went down to Mr. Wyllie's, a smith, in Golden-lane, where we found the iron which we supposed to belong to our area.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us why you supposed they belonged to your area? - A. Because they fitted in exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were fitted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. At ten o'clock on Thursday evening you saw them safe? - A. I did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a victualler, I keep the White-lion, in Brick-lane, Old-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Chant? - A. Yes; I saw him on Good-Friday morning, nearly about ten o'clock, he had a sack which, by the appearance of it, contained iron, it appeared to be very heavy; I saw the corner of an iron bar through the sack.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see it through the top or the bottom of the sack? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the end of the iron bar pierce through the sack? - A. No, there was a hole in the sack; it was a very little bit through the sack, and that led me to a suspicion that it was iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a hole at the top of the sack, or the bottom of the sack, or the side of the sack? - A. Very near the bottom part of that end that was hanging behind him; I followed him about twenty yards, and sometimes ten, to a yard in Golden-lane, to a smith's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Wyllie's shop, was it? - A. I believe it was Wyllie followed him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the shop? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What length did the bars appear to be? - A. Four or five feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they straight? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Allcock.) Q. The bars you lost, of what sort were they? - A. They lay in a frame upon the ground, with a turn up towards the house of about five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What inducement had you to follow the prisoner? - A. Because I had come down Gee-street, and coming round the corner to Noble-street, I saw Chant; I had seen the grating was gone from this house before I saw Chant.</p>

               <p>Q. It was Wyllie's? - A. Yes, he was not in the shop; I looked through the shop-window, and saw bars that I thought very likely came from this house; I am in the iron way myself; I stopped at the shop that nobody should take the bars away while I sent Mr. Allcock for the constable; Mr. Allcock returned with the constable,

            , and there found all the bars belonging to the two areas.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you find the bars belonging to Allcock's area? - A. Yes, they had been broke up; soon after Mr. Wyllie came, and his wife, the constable took him into custody; then, from the information I received from him, the constable, and me and Wyllie, went to Chant's house in the Yard, in Old-street, it is just under the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Chant's, was Chant at home? - A. Wyllie knocked at the door, I believe Chant opened the door himself; Wyllie says, what a pretty mess you have brought me into by buying this iron of you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first thing that was said by Wyllie? - A. The first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made known, at that time, to Chant, what sort of bars they were? - A. No; then the officer took Chant into custody; Chant said, we must be quiet, do not make a noise, and I will take you to the man that brought it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in Chant's house? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080093"></xptr>A. No; at that time we all went with Chant to No. 41, Noble-street, Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the house that had been robbed? - A. Not more than a hundred and fifty yards; Chant knocked at the door, but the house was close shut up; Chant, and me and the constable, went to two or three public-houses; Chant said, he made no doubt but we should find him, his name was Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. Phillips was the man that he supposed to whom the house belonged? - A. Yes; there were several people in all the public-houses we went into, but he could not identify the man at all; then we took Chant and Wyllie, and conveyed them before Mr. Kinnaird, at Hatton-garden; after that, I went with George Longden, that same day, to No. 41, Noble-street, and found the house shut up as it was before; Longden searched the house, he got in at the back-door, he forced it open; I saw Longden pull some pieces of iron out of the closet; there was one piece of iron, a square bar, as if it belonged to the area; he found a great number of duplicates; then we went to Chant's, and found some pieces of lead which had the appearance as if iron bars had been fixed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try these pieces of lead with the iron bars afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the bars, found at Wyllie's, were fitted to the area? - A. Yes, Mr. Allcock's area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. They fitted, did they? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many areas in London do you suppose they would have fitted? - A. I cannot suppose that they would have fitted any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not off the corner of his house? - A. They were the same bars as near as could be, representing the other grating.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that the common size of area bars? - A. I do not know that it is a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a smith? - A. An edge-tool-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that was not a common size area bar? - A. It is the same size with the rest of the bars in the street; the whole grating is made alike nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. And like the areas in many other streets? - A. It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you not believe it is a common size area? - A. I do not think there are any of the same size areas round about your neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it is a common size area bar? - A. I do not doubt of its being a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. The bars that are not quite large enough will fit, because it is fixed in with mortar and lead? - A. No, the knuckle of the bar must fit exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other iron at the prisoner's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bars were there? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a very large quantity of iron? - A. I dare say there might be a ton or two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were there any other area bars missing in the street? - A. No, mine were forced but not taken away; except Mr. Doyle's and Mr. Allcock's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observations upon the sack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether there was a hole in the sack or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What length might the iron be? - A. Some of it might be four or five feet long, and some of them turned up; he had brought me a lot of iron; he and I broke it up to weigh it, because my scales would not weigh above a hundred and a half at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at all at the time you were breaking it up? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same iron that was afterwards found at your house by Allcock? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the iron? - A. I laid the iron down in the shop, and he told me he had got another load of iron for me, down at his shed; I went and fetched that up, and this man came and picked the iron out, and said, that was iron that was stole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the other iron? - A. I laid it down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Mixed it with the other iron? - A. No, I threw it down by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. And that iron that you placed by itself in the shop, was the same iron which Allcock, and the constable, came and took away? - A. Yes; I went with the officer to Chant's, and said, Mr. Chant, what a mess you have brought me in about buying this iron; Chant said, he could take the gentlemen to the man that he brought it of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Nine months; he keeps a horse and cart, and collects iron; sometimes he has brought me iron, either upon his back, or in his cart, as it suited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the fair regular price for it? - A. I gave 16s. and 6d. per husband for it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the fair regular price for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was for working up in the course of your business as a smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was brought perfectly open in the day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080094"></xptr>time? - A. Yes, between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no concealment about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you not to make a noise when you went to his house? - A. I never heard such a word.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am rent-gatherer to Mr. Christopher Norris. I was in company with the officer when he searched the prisoner's house; we found some pieces of lead, which appeared to me as if they belonged to Allcock's grating; I saw the iron bars at the office, I tried them the next day with the area, and they fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they strait bars? - A. Some strait, and some round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you not in the iron way yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About these pieces of lead, you cannot say any thing about? - A. No, because they were broke to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a large quantity of iron there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found the things lying in a proper place for them for a dealer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the Magistrate thought fit to commit him for receiving, did he not? - A. The Magistrate did as he thought fit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that he was committed for receiving, and not for stealing? - A. I understood the term was a misdemeanour.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was admitted to bail, and comes here surrendering himself to take his trial? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp I am a constable of St. Luke's: At the desire of Mr. Allcock, I went to Wyllie's house, and apprehended him; we found this iron lying upon the ground (producing it); they afterwards went to Chant's house, and took him into custody, I did not find any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Wyllie and Chant were together, do you recollect Wyllie saying any thing to Chant? - A. Chant said he had a journeyman of the name of Phillips; I went in search of Philips, but could not find any such person; he said he lived in Noble-street; there was nobody there; I then took Wyllie and Chant to the Sitting Magistrates in Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Wyllie saying any thing to Chant? - A. No; I tried the bars at Mr. Allcock's; there were twenty-two of them, and they fitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You live near Chant's? - A. Some little distance.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a smith: I made a number of grates for Mr. Norris, but there is only one of those that I can swear to, (points at it): I know it by this end being twisted; I turned my man away on account of that particular mistake; which house it came from I do not know; I made it for Mr. Norris about ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jones.) Look at that piece of iron, did you sit that at Mr. Allcock's house? - A. I marked it with a file.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of the houses he took it to you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you will not swear there are not other areas in that street with twisted bars like that? - A. I can swear to that being the bar I turned my man away for.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been and examined the other areas in that street? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About the 1st or 2d of March, my wife was brought to-bed of twins; her illness caused me to pay great attention at home; I used to be frequently at home by eight, or half past even every night. On Thursday night before Good Friday, particularly, I went to bed about eight o'clock, and laid till about seven in the morning. On the Good Friday, I came down stairs, got my breakfast at home, and then it might be a little after eight o'clock; a person came enquiring after the welfare of my wife, who stood in conversation with me; at the same time, a person came up of the name of Philips, and told me he had got a load of iron that would suit me, if I thought proper to go and look at it; I asked my friend, who was in conversation with me, to take a walk with me; accordingly he did; we went with Philips, who I am not able to produce, to No. 41, Noble-street, where I saw Mrs. Philips, as Philips called her, and a man standing close to the fire-place; he produced a load of iron, and I agreed with him for fourteen shillings a hundred, which is a very fair price for a man to support a horse and cart, and get his living out of it. The iron was weighed, I paid him for it, I brought it upon my shoulder, and carried it to Wyllie's, which I had frequently done, sometimes in a cart, and sometimes on my shoulder, which was most convenient; but it being Good-Friday, I thought it was not proper to bring my cart out that day; I have two witnesses, if your Lordship will hear them, that I hope will give your Lordship and the Jury the satisfaction that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080095"></xptr>I had not been from home any of these nights during my wife's illness, which is the nurse.</p>

             sworn. - Q. I was nursing Mrs. Chant; she had lain-in three weeks and four days before Good Friday; she had twins, this is one, the other is at home: On the Thursday evening he came home a little before eight o'clock; his wife and he were having a few words, and he left his supper upon the table, and went up stairs to bed; I took particular notice of it, because it was the only time I had ever observed any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did his wife go to bed? - A. It might be ten or half past ten; I went to bed about half past three on the morning of Good Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner sleep? - A. In the same room with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the wife to bed? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I warmed the bed, and felt his feet in the bed; I slept in the same room with the twins, and three small children; besides, I gave my mistress some caudle, and I am sure he was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time he got up that morning? - A. It might be seven, or a quarter after seven, as near as I can recollect; he could not come down, without coming through the room where I was; I was up at half past five to feed the children; as they did not suck, I was obliged to be up very often with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he breakfast that morning at home? - A. Yes; he did not go out till half past eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any family yourself? - A. I have one son,

               <p>Q. When did you see your son again? - A. On the Friday morning, to leave the key, when he went to work; Mr. Chant was coming down stairs at the time, and he gave me some breakfast; on the Friday evening my son came back again about the time that Mrs. Chant was going to bed, and he had one of the children for near two hours after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times has he begged of you to speak of what you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not talked with any body about what you should give in evidence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. and Mrs. Chant fell out that evening? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that Chant, any morning in the course of that week, did not go out at six, or between six and seven that morning? - A. I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. But this morning, Good Friday, you are perfectly certain about it? - A. Yes, because of the boy getting up.</p>
               <p>Q. So you warmed the bed, and he in bed? - A. Yes.</p>

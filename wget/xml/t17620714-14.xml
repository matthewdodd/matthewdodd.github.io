We have found great deficiencies of gold and silver wanting, according to what was given him to make his work. We sent for him to know how he could account for it. He said he himself was innocent of it; but he mistrusted Orput his servant. On which, we thought it most adviseable to take up Orput upon suspicion. When the boy came to our warehouse, my partner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140007"></xptr> said to him, you are now going before a magistrate to give an account of the gold and silver you have taken. He said he knew nothing of it, but seemed much confused; we carried him before Sir

             on the 12th of June. When we got him in the coach, I told him, that the only way to have any favour shewn him, was to confess the fact, or otherwise he would be hanged. The boy immediately confessed a little before me, his master, and the officer; that was as we went along to the justice's. He confessed he had taken the gold and silver, and given it to an aunt of his, who sold it for him at sundry times; for which she sometimes gave him eighteen pence at a time, and sometimes half a crown, and that very rarely, I believe not above once; this he confessed again before the justice. On which we had a warrant to take up his aunt, who strongly denied the fact, or that she knew any thing of it, during the time of her being taken up to the time of her coming before the justice: but on confronting them before the justice, the boy taxed her so close, that by degrees she confessed almost as much as he.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the confession taken in writing?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I cannot tell whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she confess?</p>
               <p>Jennings. She confessed to have received the gold and silver at several times, to have burnt it, and to have sold it to Mr. Smith, a silversmith, under pretence of being gold and silver lace burnt, and that she had received more money than she gave him for it.</p>

               <p>Q. At first, when Orput was taken up and brought to your house, did he deny it?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes, he totally denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before the lad had made an confession, promise him, that if he expected any favour he must confess?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On that the prisoner Orput thought, if he did confess, he must receive favour?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I cannot tell. I did intend, if he confessed, to have shewn him favour, not to make him exempt from any punishment.</p>

I had complaint of the gentlemen I work for on carrying home the last piece that I made during the time the prisoner was with me: they sent for me after I had carried it home, and said, there was a great deficiency. On the tenth of June I carried it home; when I came to the warehouse, it appeared by the books that there were 36 ounces deficient in the gold and silver: on that they agreed with me to take him up upon suspicion.

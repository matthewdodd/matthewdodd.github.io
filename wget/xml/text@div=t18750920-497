                  </hi>. I live at 33, Soho square, where Mr. Mintorn carries on business—I looked, over the premises on Monday night, the 30th August, at 11.30; about half an hour before I went to bed—when in bed I fancied I heard a noise similar to the breaking of a door—I was after<lb></lb>wards awakened by a ringing at the bell—I went down and found a police—man at the door—the front door was broken open, and an inner door on the right belonging to Mr. Mintorn—I went into the shop with the constable, and found the drawers upset and articles gone—I do not identify the clock.</p>

I was on duty on the night of the 30th August last, in the neighbourhood of Soho square—about 2.15 I was called by a constable to No. 33—I found two marks from some instrument between the door and the door jamb—a piece of beading broken away near the small spring lock, and the bit that catches the spring broken off—the door had been opened—I went in and found the inner door completely forced away all round by some instrument—I went into the shop and found the desk had been ransacked—a drawer on the right of the desk had been drawn out, and the contents strewn about—two small cases at the back of the desk on a shelf had evidently been opened to see the contents, and left in a disordered state—constable Radley called up Mr. Bacon previously to my arrival.</p>

I was on duty on the night after the robbery (the 31st August) in company with Pickles, and saw the prisoners at the corner of St. Anne's Court and Dean Street, at about 10 o'clock—we followed them up Dean Street to Carlisle Street, when they went towards Soho Square—I walked slowly down to 61, Frith Street—there were three men altogether—one was on the east side of the Street, apparently watch—ing—they remained about two or three minutes—they then went to a public-house in Queen Street, where they stayed three or four minutes—they then came out, went along Queen Street, and turned into Frith Street again to Soho Square, and stood at the corner for some time, then past Charles Street, and stood there for about a quarter of an hour and sat on the railings—they then went to a public-house at the corner of Oxford Street—we then took them into custody—the third man when he saw we <hi rend="italic">were</hi> following went away—Mace said he had only just come out of a public house, and had only been in the neignbourhood five minutes—Crossley said nothing—I told them we should take them into custody for loitering—I took Crossley, and the other constable took Mace—I found on Crossley this small bar (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>), and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> used by housebreakers—I</p>

I was with the last witness and saw Mace go into the second public-house—I waited while the last witness went for assistance—I came up when they were in Carlisle Street, after they were in custody, and Mace looked round and saw me, and he said "What is this for?"—I said "For being suspicious persons loitering about the neighbourhood"—a constable in uniform had got him—I searched him and found on him a latch key and two duplicates relating to his own pro—perty—nothing that concerns this charge—Mace and Crossley were not put in a cell together—Crossley sent for me at the police-station and said "I want to go to 103, Lillington Street, Pimlico, to see my wife, that man is a bad man—I met him to-night and he asked me to carry those things, but if I had known they had been the proceeds of a burglary I would have had nothing to do with them—I will tell the Magistrate all about it in the morning"—he did not mention what "things"—when the Magistrate remanded them, through their conduct before him they were ordered separate cells again—I was with Crossley in the yard, and I then said "There is a clock also taken from No. 33, Soho Square," and he said "Yes; I don't know what was done with it, it was of no value, and Mace broke it up and threw it away somewhere close by"—we made enquiries and the clock was found by a person who is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mace's Defence.</hi> I met Crossley, about 10 o'clock that evening, and as I had to be at the corner of Charles Street some time after, we were just killing time by strolling about. The things belonged to the third man who went away; Crossley said "This man has picked up a cheque-book in Soho Square," and he gave it to Crossley, thinking a reward might be offered for it; I was not aware that he had anything in his possession; it is not likely I should have stood within twenty or thirty yards of a place where a burglary had been committed, had I known that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crossley's Defence.</hi> I have known Mace for some time, and the evening we were arrested I met him, somewhere between 9 and 10 o'clock; after we had strolled about together for sometime; he said to me "Just take care of these things for a little while; it won't do you any harm." While I was hesitating he said "Go on, its all right; in fact Mr. Pickles wants me, for one or two little things." I did not know what he meant at the time, but having known him, as I thought, as a respectable man, I took them and had not had possession of them, but a very little time when we were arrested. I said nothing when I was arrested, but after being searched and taken to the police-court, I sent for one of the detectives, and told him that</p>

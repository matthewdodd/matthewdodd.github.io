                  </hi>. I am a seaman, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Brunswick.</hi> On Thursday, 17th May, six of us, including the deceased, were in a boat along. side a vessel—the deceased was drunk—he tried to get on board, but dropped down into the water; I pulled him out, and the prisoner, who is the mate, told me to put a strap round him to hoist him up—he was not able to get up himself—I put the rope round him, the mate pulled him up, and give him a dipping—as he was pulling him up, the hook dropped off the strap, and the boy fell, and was drowned—he sunk like a stone or piece of lead—we could not get him—there had been no ill words between him and the mate that I know of—he belonged to the ship—I did not see his body till the Monday, it was then laid on some pieces of board in the churchyard—I am sure it was the same.</p>

On Thursday, 17th May, about six in the evening, I saw the prisoner by the side of the Surrey-canal it Rotherhithe, and told him I had received information that a boy had been drowned off his vessel—he said yes, he was sorry for it—I asked how it hap<lb></lb>pened—he said, "The boy was drunk, and in putting him out of the boat with I a <hi rend="italic">burting</hi> (that is a rope with a hook to it) the hook caught the vessel's side, unhooked, and he was drowned"—he showed me the place where it hooked into the vessel's side—there was no mark, but a place where a hook might I have caught—he said he was very sorry for it, and said several times he would sooner it had been him than the black boy.</p>

            . On the day in the indictment, about the middle of the day, the half seive in question was standing on a board on my ground in the market; I saw them safe about twelve o'clock, and missed them about ten minutes after; I did not see them again until I saw the prisoner in custody, which was about ten minutes after they were taken away. I saw the seive and the currants when the prisoner was taken; I knew the seive again, and she owned she had taken them.</p>

               <p>Who did? - The prisoner Hurt, there was another man with him on horse-back, they met me, I did not stop the first time, the second time he came to my horses heads again, and said if I did not stop he would blow my brains out; he met me coming down, and he turned about and threatened me again, and then I stopped; he presented a pistol into the coach on the left hand side, and said he would blow the lady's brains out, if she did not give the watch and the purse.</p>
               <p>Who were in the coach? - Mrs. Walker, and Mr. Walker, young Mr. Walker, and Mr. Collison, I saw two watches taken out, and two purses, I saw my mistress give him her watch and purse, I was upon the saddle riding postillion; next my young master gave a purse and a watch out, he put the watches and purses in his pocket, he went down the hill, and I went up the hill; the other man was down with my fellow servant the footman, he ordered him to get down or he would blow his brains out, and he stood by my fellow servant all the time, I saw them both go from the coach together; the prisoner Hurt was one of the men, I saw him at the Bull at Tottenham, about an hour and half after.</p>

               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Coachman, be so good as to take this along with you, that in all that I am asking you, you must state what you know of your own knowledge and observation, and not what other people have told you; how long were the people that you suppose robbed your master and mistress, with the carriage? - Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Were there three persons or two? - Two only.</p>
               <p>Were they both disguised? - Yes.</p>


               <p>What sort of handkerchiefs, and what colour? - One was a speckled handkerchief, and the other a black one.</p>
               <p>Have you always said it was a black one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never said it was brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said you did not know whether it was either black or brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say that to Stubbs? - No.</p>
               <p>I will repeat that question once more, have you ever said, you did not know whether it was black or brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Which side did your master sit on? - The left hand side, the near side on the back seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Which side was the highwayman on? - On the near side, my master fell out of the coach, and hallooed out for a gun, he went to step upon a rail, and he tumbled down, I kept looking round all the time.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that you saw any living creature give a purse to this man? - Yes, I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Have you always been in that story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many conversations have you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120072"></xptr> with your master and mistress about this robbery? - None at all, only speaking to them, not to ask my master or mistress, or their saying any thing to me about it.</p>
               <p>But you have talked to them about the robbery? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>I believe they are of the description of people called quakers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They do not choose to swear about it, but they told you what they knew about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is not your memory very much assisted by the story they have told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you believe what they told you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I thought you did; I suppose your mistress told you she gave her purse, did not she? - I saw her.</p>
               <p>Has not your mistress told you so? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that she never told you so? - She never told me she had a purse.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did she never tell you she gave her purse? - I never spoke to my mistress that night.</p>
               <p>That will not do coachee, I am not quite so young as that neither, has she told you she lost a purse that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought so; when did you first say you saw your mistress give the man her purse? - I said, I saw her give him a purse.</p>
               <p>Did you say it till you heard your mistress would not swear it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you said it before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever mentioned it to any human being that you ever saw the purse delivered till you knew she would not swear it? - To my master.</p>
               <p>Describe a little with your own handkerchief, how much of the man's face was covered? - So much.</p>
               <p>Do not you know him by his voice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought you did, that is right, you have heard him speak when he had not his mouth covered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that the voice was the same? - I swear that was the man.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, this, do you mean to swear that the voice of the man that was covered with the handkerchief, was the same voice you afterwards heard? - He could not speak so plain then.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot swear to his voice? - I can swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Now having sworn to his voice, you abandon that; he had a round hat and a great coat muffled up? - No, the coat was not buttoned.</p>
               <p>But he had a round hat? - Yes, a very little flapped, turned up on the sides.</p>
               <p>It was a round hat, and his face covered so high with a handkerchief? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>I wish you would follow the example of your master and mistress, and not swear upon such subjects; do you mean to swear to the identity of such a person, whom you never saw before, whom you did not know; was you always as sure of him? - Yes, since I saw this man.</p>
               <p>Did you swear positively to him the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he had not a handkerchief put on at first, he had not a handkerchief put on at Covent Garden? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where then? - Why never, at no place.</p>
               <p>Did you never see this man in custody with a handkerchief on his face, any part of his face? - No, the handkerchief was not put on.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? - I never saw his face with a handkerchief on, before any Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Where did your master sit? - My master sat on the near side, with his back to the horses.</p>
               <p>How was it that you know who gave the purses? - I saw my young master's hand give him the watch and purse too.</p>
               <p>You saw his coat? - I saw his coat, and some part of his hand, and likewise I saw my mistress's ring on her finger.</p>
               <p>Was you never at the public office in Bow-street, when this man refused to have the handkerchief put about him? - I was not there then.</p>
               <p>Whose purse was it that was given out? - I saw my mistress's purse given out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120073"></xptr>What colour was it? - A blue, a kind of sky blue.</p>
               <p>Did you know that purse before? - Yes, there were some trinkets of gold about it, or it was gilded a little.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to the gilding of the said quaker purse? - It looked like gold.</p>
               <p>What coloured purse was young master's? - Green.</p>
               <p>Have you the confidence to state that you should know either of those: purses again? - I have seen it upon the table, and I have carried it to him into the other room.</p>
               <p>It was a common green purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hurt was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hurt was searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of watch was it you saw given? - It seemed to be a worked watch.</p>
               <p>What sort of case had it? - I do not know, I have heard say it was metal, I never had it in my hand, I knew it was my mistress's watch by the case, it is a worked watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see that as you set on your horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know what money was in the purse? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Walker, I was very near the carriage with a dung cart and two horses, I was about thirty yards off, and I saw Mr. Walker's coach stopped, and that man at the coach window, put his hand into the coach window, and then into the Lady's left hand pocket twice; and understanding they were robbing the carriage, I unharnessed a horse and rode after them, they were about two minutes with the carriage, there was another man with the prisoner, but he was at a little distance with the footman, he made him dismount his horse; I do not know what he took from the coach, I rode after him as fast as I could, I did not get sight of him till rather better than a mile, or thereabouts; I kept in sight for forty or fifty yards together, and then by the turn of the hedges I was out of sight again; I got sight of both the men, they kept the road to Tottenham High-cross, and kept up a lane that goes to Mount-pleasant; they came back again the same lane into the road, I cannot tell why, but I imagine they could not get through; they went full speed as fast as they could into Tottenham town; when they came to some trees called the seven sisters, they turned to the left hand, and a gentleman desired me to go back, and up the next lane, accordingly I did and gave them the meeting in the road to the mill; the one went over the bridge and through a toll gate, this man could not get through, and he turned upon me again, and said, if I offered to stop him, or molest him, he would shoot me dead in a minute; I told him I did not want to stop or molest him, for I expected my death; and he said damn you, for what did you cry stop thief! because I alarmed the town, and cried stop thief all the way I rode; my horse at that time making a blunder in the water, and pitching his nose in the water, and I having no saddle was almost off, and at that time he rode by me into some closes, where he was apprehended and taken by some men that were out after him.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that was taken? - That is the man in the red waistcoat that was taken; they tell us his name was Hurt, I am sure it is the man, his face was only covered up to his mouth.</p>
               <p>Can you, at the distance of thirty yards, take upon yourself to swear to the face of a man that was partly covered? - I am sure it is the man, I was not quite thirty yards off, I speak at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of hat had he? I cannot tell that upon my word, if I die for it, I do not know.</p>
               <p>But you know very well what sort of face he had? - Yes, his face was covered with a black handkerchief, either crape or black.</p>

After the prisoner Hurt was taken, I went down and saw the mare at the Bull at Tottenham, the hostler shewed her to me.</p>
               <p>Is any body here that was present at that time? - I believe Williams was.</p>
               <p>Was that your mare? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Williams. The mare that the last witness looked at, at the Bull, was the mare that the highwayman had, I was at the taking of it, and I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court to Acksin. What horse did this man ride? - The horse that this man rode was a bright bay, with a star in his forehead, I saw him again at Tottenham; it was a mare, it was the same mare, I am clear in that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you always clear that that was the mare? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was his hand, and not Mr. Collison's? - Mr. Collison was not in the coach, Mr. Collison fell out of the coach.</p>

               <p>You did not say a word about driving up to the door? - I drove up to Mr. Collison's door, who was in the coach, I drove to his door before I was stopped; he bid me stop before I came up to the gentleman's door, and I drove up to the door, thinking it would save us; I was twenty yards off.</p>

               <p>Why did you omit so very extraordinary a circumstance as that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Relate again now how the robbery happened? - I was coming along the road going into Southgate, the young man stopped me, and said he would blow my brains out; I went up to Mr. Collison's door, and he followed me up and said, I will blow your brains out; my master opened the coach door with his right-hand and slipped down, likewise Mr. Collison got out; the man then said he would blow the lady's brains out, if she did not give her watch and money, he had a pistol in his hand and a stick.</p>
               <p>Then your master and Mr. Collison were both got out of the coach? - Yes; my master hallooed out for a gun, but we had none; the other highwayman was down with the footman.</p>
               <p>What at Mr. Collison's door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts is the house situated? - Going up Southgate-hill: then after they had robbed the coach, I drove up the hill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120077"></xptr> to go home, and left my master and Mr. Collison behind.</p>
               <p>What after they had been just robbed? - My master came across the road, the two houses are not two hundred yards apart: Mr. Collison and my master were both out of the coach before the young gentleman and my mistress were robbed; I am quite sure of that.</p>

Taking it that the evidence in this case was free from all exception, it seems to me, with great submission, that they have not proved the facts necessary to support this indictment: suppose they had laid it to have been a robbery on the person of Mr. Walker, and taking from him a watch, the property of a person unknown, and it had been proved to be his watch, or any other person's it would not have sustained the indictment. According to the evidence, it proves no one fact which calls upon the prisoner to answer to the charge, and to fix the having made an assault: it depends in the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Walker, and their son, and Mr. Collison, who are Quakers, and the footman, who it seems will not swear to the prisoner, though he is not a Quaker, it depends on the evidence of this Acksin; first, as to the assault, says he, he came to the coach in which Mr.

            , and that he did not intend to take the goods of Mrs. Walker, or putting the case the other way, but on his applying the threat to Mrs. Walker, the son gives his goods; would your Lordship hold that was a threat to him? Now, my Lord, here is no property found on this man, here is none produced, not a single article; then it rests on the evidence of a man, on which it does not become me to make any observations. Says he, I saw the watch given out; says he, it was a watch with a worked case, by the which I suppose he meant a chased case; it is clear he did not mean to describe the watch which is the subject of the indictment, for if there was a threat, the Jury must be convinced there was a taking by this threat of a metal watch from the person of Mr.

            : says the man, I do not know it was a metal case, otherwise than I was told; and in order to try it and to see whether the Jury can by possibility depend on the evidence of that man, I gave him my watch; why he cannot tell whether it is gold or metal, nor can the Gentlemen of the Jury: then, my Lord, is there evidence to go to the Jury on the indictment which charges this man with this specific offence? I submit there is not; and I submit, that metal to this purpose is contra distinguished from gold.</p>

               <p>Court. You are aware of the general form of distinguishing it in the indictment, when contra distinguished from gold, it is universally stated of base metal, then consider whether the word metal is not a general word, comprising all metals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I take it to be a leading rule of all criminal law, that there must be certainty; if a man is charged with stealing a gold watch, he knows what he has to answer; but a man is charged by an indictment, that he had stole a metal watch, says he, I can prove gold or silver, but if they state it generally metal, why I am to take in all the metals that ever were in the bowels of the earth. If it had been clearly upon evidence to be a gold watch, it would not have been a proper description of it; and I contend, that the Jury cannot upon this indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120078"></xptr> have any evidence that can satisfy their consciences, either that the watch was the watch of Mr. Walker, or that it was a a metal watch as described in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. You have had ground enough in this case, Mr. Garrow, to intitle you, in point of law, to observe upon the evidence by a side wind, which you have done very sufficiently. It is not in practice for the prisoner to know the precise charge against him; if it was, your objection would be decisive, and it would be an unanswerable reason why it should be described, in which case it might be doubtful: but in this case, there is certainly evidence enough to go to the Jury, and it will be for them to decide, whether they are sufficiently satisfied from the evidence of Acksin, that this was Mr. Walker's son's watch, and that it was a metal watch; and he swears to his belief, founded on what he saw at the time, and these will be circumstances for the consideration of the Jury. But with respect to your first objection, I am most clearly and decidedly of opinion against you in point of law, because I do not hold it necessary that there should be a distinct and personal threat upon every one, but the stopping a coach with several persons in it, is putting every person therein in fear. I shall leave it to the Jury.</p>

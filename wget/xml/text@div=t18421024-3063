                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Sherwood, a wire-worker, of No.5, York-street, London-road. Thomas Wellings was my nephew, and was a wire-worker—on Monday night he was up in my room doing a little work for me—his wife called him down—I went down about ten minutes afterwards, and saw him and Heskett fighting in the middle of York-street—a great many people were standing about—I saw them strike each other—they were perfectly sober—they continued fighting twenty minutes or half an hour—Wellings fell down nearly every time—the pri<lb></lb>soner fell down sometimes—they kept on fighting till they fell—there was a number of falls, I cannot say how many—they fell from the blows—Wellings was the last that fell—he fell with the back of his head against the curb-stone—he then said, "I will have no more," and I never heard him speak afterwards—I was not with him when he went home—I went up stairs, and they took him home as well us they could—I was with him when he died—his nose and eye bled—he lived a very little way from me—I sat up with him all night—he never spoke, moved hand or foot, or opened his eyes—I and his wife went for a doctor about eight o'clock—we got Mr. Gale—he came with us—the deceased was about thirty years old—the prisoner had married Wellings' sister—they were on friendly terms before—the prisoner shook hands with him after he fell the last time, when he said he would have no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with Wellings as his wife—he was with Sherwood, and I called him to his tea—he came down—the prisoner was in the street—they had a few words—they began abusing one an<lb></lb>other and then fought—I do not know which struck first—they both fell—the last time Wellings fell on the curb, and cut his head, and it bled very much—they both had hold of one another and both went down together, Wellings undermost—they were always very good friends—they shook hands first.</p>

I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in York-street—I saw the fight—I was standing at ray door about half-past six o'clock, and heard the prisoner and deceased's wife, as I thought, talking about fighting—the prisoner said he would fight him when he liked—with that the deceased's wife went and called the other man down stairs, and said, "Come down stairs and give him a good <hi rend="italic">hiding"</hi>—he came down stairs, and said, he did not know what he was going to fight about, but if the prisoner, wanted to</p>

               <p>fight he would fight him—they pulled their jackets off, and fought the first and second rounds—I did not see a blow struck either way—some blows were struck in the course of the fight—when the man was thrown they closed and went down—the prisoner threw the deceased every time—they were both sober—the prisoner was uppermost every time ex<lb></lb>cept once—the last round they closed and the prisoner threw him, and the back of his head came against the curb stone—he sat up, and said, he would have no more—the prisoner shook hands with him, and asked if he would have anything to drink, but I believe the deceased never spoke afterwards—he went down the last time from a throw, and not from a blow—I should say there were not more than half a dozen blown in the course of the fight—I should say the deceased struck about oneor two blows—his relations and family were all standing about, but they did not not like to interfere—they might have been picked up once or twice, but I cannot say—there were many people round—the deceased's wife got in before they commenced fighting, but she was away again in a minute or two—she got in between them to prevent their fighting, but some called out for her to come away and let them fight—that was at the commencement of it—she at first called Wellings to come down and fight him, but afterwards she tried to prevent them—she stood by the deceased all the time they were fighting—after they made her come away.</p>

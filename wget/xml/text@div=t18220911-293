I saw the prisoner about three yards from me. I did not see him take them, my brother said he had got them, and we asked what he was doing with them - he said he was going to do nothing with them.

I took him immediately, and locked him up - he afterwards told me he took the shoes, and gave them to one Smith.</p>

I had a full view of him. He pulled my watch with his other hand; it was in my fob; there being no glass in my watch, the ring got off the watch, and he got the chain and two seals, they were worth 4l. or 5l. together. All three ran different ways. The prisoner ran towards Fore-street; one of the others crossed over, and ran the same way. I called out, stop thief! just as I got up to the prisoner, he called out, stop thief! I collared him; he had not got above a dozen yards - I did not lose sight of him. He had an oilskin hat and a blue neck-handkerchief. I am sure I never lost sight of him; I charged him with being the man, and collared him. Mr. Carter took him into custody. I thought I had lost my watch at the time. He was searched at the Counter, and a tobacco-box found on him, which smelt of snuff, and corresponded with the smell on my face; his coat cuffs were also covered with snuff.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL CARTER. I live in Great Bell-alley, Coleman-street, I am bricklayer. On the 13th of December, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw people running towards Fore-street. I saw the prisoner standing, facing the prosecutor, between Great Bell-alley and King's Arms-yard; a man had hold of him; the man let him go, when I came up, and the prisoner wanted to get away, saying, he was innocent; the prosecutor gave charge of him, for robbing him of his watch, chain and seals. I searched him, and found a tobacco-box in his left hand breeches pocket-it smelt of snuff; and his sleeves and hands were also very snuffy. The prosecutor's face and neck-handkerchief were marked with snuff.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Angel. I was crossing from Lothbury to Coleman-street, I heard the prosecutor call stop thief! I ran after a man who I saw running, with an oilskin hat on; when I got to King's Arms-yard, the prisoner called, stop thief! when I came up the prosecutor stood facing him, and said he had robbed him of his watch, chain and seals; he called for a constable, and Carter came up and took charge of him. As we were going to the Counter, the prosecutor found his watch was not gone. I saw the box found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has spoken false. I am not guilty. I was in company with the man who did it, and I can give information where the seals were disposed of; they were sold for 24s., they have sent me four shillings of the money. Being innocent of the robbery, and knowing the party who committed it, I hope I shall be allowed to give up their names in evidence.</p>

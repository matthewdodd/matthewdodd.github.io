I am one of the military police in the Royal Artillery, Woolwich—I was on duty with gunner Ross taking an artilleryman to the guard-room—I saw the prisoner, who said that if I did not let my prisoner go he would stab me—he took out a knife and struck me on the left temple—I lost about a pint and a-half of blood—I became insensible, and have not been on duty since.</p>

I am one of the military police—I was with Hill—we had a deserter in charge, and the prisoner came and said to Hill that if he did not let the deserter go he would stab him to the heart with a knife—he had a knife in his right hand, caught him by his hair, knocked him down, and stabbed him—he got up bleeding, and I took him to a friend of mine who dressed his wound—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—he went away with several girls.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Hammond, of Rope-yard-fields, Woolwich—on the night of 12th September I saw Hill and Ross conveying a deserter, and saw the prisoner, who I had seen before, stab at Ross, but I did not see the effect of it—I saw a weapon in his hand, but cannot say what it was—I am positive he is the person who did it—I did not see him stab at Hill.</p>

On the morning of the 14th the prisoner was brought to the station by two military police, dressed as he is now, except this smock frock, which I took from him: it is covered with small marks of blood—I told him the charge—he said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

I had a knife, which I opened, but I did no harm with it. I went out and came in again, and the mistress of the house gave me in charge. I never saw it. I do not even know whether this is the man or not.</p>

On Saturday night, the 2nd of May, I went to Mr. Garrett's shop, at eleven o'clock—I gave a sovereign to Mary Pickering—she turned round, and I heard a sovereign drop—search was made for it, and a young woman said something—a boy said Hannah Levin had got it, I offered her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—she denied having it, and was taken to the watch-house—her sister stood outside the watch-house door.</p>

Having frequently been robbed, on the 25th of January, I went into Mr. Gough's room, which commands a view of my stable. At seven o'clock I went into the stable, and asked the prisoner about the horses; he said they were all well, except the mare. While he was gone to water the horses, I saw an empty sack in the corn-binn - it was not mine, and there was no name on it; the people I buy my corn of, have their sacks marked. I told him to do the horses up, and let them go to rest. I left the stable. went into the garden, and looked through a crevice; I saw the prisoner take the candle and the sack, and go into the loft, which joins the granary. I climbed up a pear-tree, and could see what passed in the lost and granary; he put some hay down the rack for the horses, then went into the granary, mixed some oats, beans, and chaff, and put it in the corn-binn for the horses; he then opened the loft window, and threw a truss of straw out; he then scraped a quantity of oats into the sack, from the rack, twisted the mouth of the sack round, and threw it down after the straw. I then went to Gough's window, saw the prisoner come out of the yard, and go into the Roebuck, public-house, next door. He soon after went into the stable-yard, and came out with the sack on his back, covered with a dark great coat; I followed him about 100 yards, then collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Robert! what do you call all this? it is some of my corn;" he said</p>
               <p>"How do you know that?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Because I saw you take it, and you have not been out of my sight." He said</p>
               <p>"If it is your's, take it," and let it fall. I picked it up, and he went off. I had him secured about five o'clock next morning.</p>

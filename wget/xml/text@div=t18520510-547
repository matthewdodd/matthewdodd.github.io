I employed the prisoner in my service—I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I have sent for Mr. George, my clerk, who is the attesting witness—the prisoner entered my service a week or two previous to this agreement being signed—he was in my service on 13th and 14th March last—on 13th or 14th, Miss Huggins, of West Green, sent some furniture and goods to my place to be sold; they were sold on the 15th—I made an advance of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to her upon it, I paid it myself—part of</p>

               <p>the furniture was sold, and realised 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after deducting my commis<lb></lb>sion, and the cash advanced, there was a balance of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave that to the prisoner on the 17th, to pay the lady—I gave it into the hands of a friend of mine who was in the counting-house, and he passed it to the prisoner in my presence—on the following morning I asked him for the receipt, he told me he had mislaid it on his bed, and could not find it—three or four days afterwards, he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in consequence of complaints which I received, I afterwards went to the house of Miss Hug<lb></lb>gins; that was in April, I think—I produced this receipt to her, she com<lb></lb>plained that she had not received her money—I went again on another occasion and took a witness, Mr. Dever, who is here.</p>

               <p>say just now; I do not think it was more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not been in difficulties before that—I was carrying on business in partnership with Mr. Devey, not at the time I took the prisoner's premises—we are not in part<lb></lb>nership now; we have never been exactly in partnership, we have had our names up together—that was in Salisbury-square, about nine months back—I believe the names are not up still—we left the premises about a fortnight previous to my going to Gray's-inn-road—we did not put our names up there—I am carrying on business there now in my own name—Mr. Devey is not in partnership with me, he is acting for me—the prisoner was the auctioneer in the sale of Miss Huggins's goods, employed by me at so much per week—I was the clerk; the man was the master, and the master was the man—I will not be certain when it was that he was taken up the second time, but I think it was on 27th April last—he was discharged then on his own recog<lb></lb>nizances, and appeared again, I think, last Tuesday week, I will not be cer<lb></lb>tain; he had been out for a week on his own recognizance—I did not ask him to give up the premises before that; I swear that—I did not ask him to go off the premises, I had hardly seen him—I have not paid him any money for the premises—I am in possession of them now, and my name is up—the lease is not a valuable one—I did not offer 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; a friend of his asked whether I would give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable him and his wife to get out of the premises, and I said yes—I do not know that Mr. Curtis had had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for the lease—it is a broker's shop—I am going to carry on business there, if I can keep it—there was no name up before I put mine—the pre<lb></lb>mises were very old indeed; I had them done up and repaired.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that the prisoner was the auctioneer, and you were the clerk; I do not know whether you meant to say that: what wages did you receive as clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Instead of employing a young man to be clerk, I took the book myself and watched the sale, and took the money—he sold for me; I meant to say that I acted as clerk—I know now that I did succeed the prisoner in the business—I sent him with the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay Miss Huggins—he had no right whatever to put that in his pocket.</p>

Q.</hi> That agreement purports to bear date 15th April? was it signed till the 19th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was signed, I think, on the 19th; the prisoner was at the counting-house when it was signed—I did not know about this charge of forgery—the prisoner was not told that, if he did not sign this agreement, he would be charged with forgery; not a word was said about it—Mr. Hawley, my master, was the attorney that drew it up—he is not here—I do not know why the agreement was not signed on the 15th, the day it bears date—Curtis never refused to sign it.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here read. It was dated 15th March</hi>, 1852, <hi rend="italic">and was between Curtis and Cullen. After reciting that they were joint tenants of the premises in question, it proceeded (in eight articles) to state in substance, that for five years the business of an auctioneer, &amp;c., should be carried on by Cullen, he paying the rent</hi> (50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year) and all expenses; that Curtis should have the use of the upper part of the house, and assist Cullen in the business, at a salary of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week; that he should take out his auctioneer's license at his own expense, and should not carry on business as an auctioneer, broker, or furniture dealer, there, or within a mile thereof.</hi>)</p>

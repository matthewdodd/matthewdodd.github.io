Do you remember the prisoner coming to you on the 4th of October? - Yes, very well; she came into my shop and asked the price of some cheese; a customer of mine that was there told me she had taken something; I looked about and saw the pot was gone; I immediately went after her, and caught her at the corner of Duke-street, and found the pot on her; I took her by the shoulders and dragged her to Mr. Ling's door, and Mr. Ling came out and took her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Scott. That is the pot I took from her, I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your property? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that pot worth? - Thirteen pence they stand me in, when they came in new, and this is as good as when it came in first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say for myself at all. I have got two sons at sea, and I was so overjoyed at hearing from them, I was intoxicated with liquor, and what she say may be true, but to my knowledge I know nothing at all of it, my lord and gentlemen, I leave myself to your mercy.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. Was she in a state of intoxication? - Not that I saw.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not think that I should have any hearing at all here; I had gentlemen attended both Thursday and Friday, and I did not think I should be tried till next month.</p>

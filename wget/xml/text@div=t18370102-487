                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Salter, of Lambech Marsh. The prisoner was six months in my employ, as waiter, and he assisted in the kitchen—on Thursday evening, the 10th of December, I found, in a cupboard in the bed-room, a tub of fat, weighing twenty-six pounds, it had no business there—he had not the least right to take fat—my kitchen produces no waste of fat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brookes-court, Upper Marsh. On Saturday week the prisoner came and asked if I would let him leave a small tub of fat while he went to fetch a clean apron—I said he might, he went in next door and got an apron, then came to me, and asked me if I knew a boy who would take it to York-road for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I called in a little boy, who took it—the prisoner said on the Sunday before that his fat brought him about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

               <p>Carpenter. My Lord, though I am prosecutor of Hogbon, I have known him ever since he came out of the country, I never saw any harm of him before; I wish to recommend him to mercy, he is a young fellow.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon my word it is become a most iniquitous trade, to steal horses and sell them to the dog's-meat men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kent's-place, Paddington, and am fore<lb></lb>man to Mr. Thomas John Bolton, an omnibus proprietor. Clipsome was a washer of carriages—Louke and he were in Mr. Bolton's employ—three Chinese pigs were in the body of an old omnibus in Mr. Bolton's yard—on the 22nd of January, Monday morning, about seven o'clock, I missed one of the pigs—there were two left—I searched for the lost one, but did not find it—in consequence of suspicion I went to Mr. Feltham the inspector, and we went to Clipsome's house in Kent-place, on Tuesday, a little after six o'clock in the evening—Clipsome was at work in the yard—Mr. Feltham went up stairs—I remained down below for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I afterwards went up, and saw some pork in Clipsome's room, and the entrails of a pig in a dish in a bed-room, on a sideboard—the other parts were in the front room—there was a fore leg, and a loin—I cannot say whether there was any more—Mr. Feltham asked him how he came possessed of it, and he said, <hi rend="italic">big Jem</hi> brought it to him in a sack—that man's name is Goatley—I know Goatley—he is a horse-keeper in Mr. Bolton's employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. I went with William Conzens to Clipsome's house—I went up into the room by myself—Clipsome's wife and two children were there—I saw some pork fn the cupboard—here is a fore and hind leg, a piece of a flap, and a fore-loin—I found some pork that did not appear to belong to the same pig—that is not here—I desired the woman to call her husband, which she did—I said to him, "I have every reason to believe this is part of Mr. Bolton's pig"—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said it was some he had bought of his master, and some that <hi rend="italic">big Jem</hi> had brought up—I said it had never been killed by a butcher, I had every reason to believe it was Mr. Bolton's, and I should take him into custody—I do not remember that Clipsome's wife said any thing in his presence, except that part of it was the lodger's—I then handed the prisoner to the police-constable, and directed him to take him to the station-house—his wife said paft of it was purchased of Mr. Bolton, which I have no doubt of—I then went into the back room, and found the chitlings, the internal part of the pig, which had been killed, were in water, in a dish—I then went to Louke's house, and the foreman and I went up stairs—his wife was there—I asked if she had any pork in the house—I found there two pieces—one is part of a loin, and the other the fore-leg—Couzens brought Louke to the room—I said to him, "I have no doubt the pork I see here is part of Mr. Bolton's pig, and I shall take you into custody"—he said he knew nothing about it—he made some hesitation about going, but I said he must, and he did go—I did not go to Cooper's—the hind-leg of this pig some time before had been broken, and this leg that I found at Clipsome's is broken, and one of the toes which the constable found at Cooper's, was trod off by a horse—the pork found at Louke's exactly corresponded with the other parts found at the other two prisoners'.</p>

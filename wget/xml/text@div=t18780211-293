               <p>I was told by the postman I concluded that it was George Costin that must have been there, from the description he gave me—at 1.30 I, with Detective Barry, saw the two Costins speaking to each other on Deptford Bridge—we walked up to them, and before we got to them George walked away—I said to Barry "Follow him, and bring him back"—I said to Hugh "What is the matter with your hand," seeing it bound up—he said "I jammed it two or three days ago in the docks''—I said "What have you got on it?"—he said "Nothing but a bit of rag"—I said "It appears not to have had proper treatment, let me see it"—he said "Certainly"—I said "I don't want you to show it to me here, just walk on and come into the police-station," which we did, and before I had any conversation Barry brought in George Costin—I then examined his hand, and found it was injured by cut glass—I said "It couldn't have been done in the way you describe; it is evidently done by broken glass"—he said that he was attacked last night by a lot of donkey drivers—I said "You must know them"—he said "No"—I said "must make inquiries"—he then said that he was assaulted at Forest Hill—I said "You have made three statements to me, and you will probably be charged with committing a burglary last night in Granville Park"—I put the prisoners amongst others at the station, but the postman failed to identify them—he was prepared to identify a man with a white muffler on, but previous to my bringing the men into the yard George took off his white muffler—George said "You see I am not identified"—I then took off their boots and proceeded to Granville Park, and compared them with the footprints, which corresponded—Hugh's boots were very pecu<lb></lb>Iiar, and the marks were very distinct, but George's were not so much so—I returned and told them they would be charged with committing the bur<lb></lb>glary—I commenced to search them, and in Hugh's jacket pocket I found two or three tablespoonfuls of cake crumbs—a cake had been stolen from Mr. Fuller's—on George I found a quantity of bird-seed and dirt, which was compared with that found, and corresponded—I then asked each of the Costins to account for their time the previous night—Hugh said he was at a public-house at Greenwich until 12.30, and after that at his father's, Trafalgar Road—I found that statement to be false on proceed<lb></lb>ing to 29, High Street, Deptford, where I ascertained Hugh lived, as also Chapman—I told her Hugh was in custody, and asked if there was anything in the room which didn't belong to her, and she said "No<lb></lb>thing"—on searching I found the stand broken up, which has been pro<lb></lb>duced, and four meted labels, and some calico in a box close by—she said "Yes, I knew it was there"—this was 8 o'clock at night—I took her to the station and charged her—from statements made by Hugh I directed Woodley to be taken to the station on the Wednesday—I then told him he would be charged with being concerned in the burglary, and he said that he knew nothing of it—I took his boots off and compared them with the footprints at 81, Granville Park, and they exactly corresponded—when I told Hugh he would be charged, George said "Don't put me along with him, I am his brother; I am not responsible for anything he has done; I wouldn't be seen with him anywhere; we are not friendly."</p>

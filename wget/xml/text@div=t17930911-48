               <p>I am a nurse at St. George's Hospital, the prisoner came on Saturday afternoon into my ward; I don't know the day of the month, six weeks ago, and he said that he was married, and that his wife was gone in the country, and that he had brought the caddy from his wife, he went away to see an acquaintance in the Hospital, and he returned about four o'clock in the afternoon, and then the constable came and took him up, he had also two spoons that were broke in two; large spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure as to that? - I am sure that there were two spoons that were broke, one a large spoon, and the other rather less; I see nothing more, I should know them again, for the justice made me mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the spoons without the mark? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the spoons that you saw him bring, the same as were delivered to the constable? - I gave them to the head nurse, and she gave them to the constable; she is not here, she is laying dying on her bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the caddy? - I gave the caddy and the two spoons to the head nurse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are nurse to St. George's Hospital? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner at the bar? - He had been a patient in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had he been a patient in your Hospital? - I don't know whether it might be two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he been in the Hospital for? - The first time he came into the Hospital he was sent to Bedlam; the next time, whether it was a fever or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard several times that this poor unfortunate man has been out of his mind? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the spoons, and caddy, you would not have known any of them, nor could you identify them except the justice had told you to mark them? - Not without that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they belong to the prosecutor or not, of course you cannot tell no more than the justice told you to mark them when you was there? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. George's, Hanover-square. On the 6th of July I had an information of a pair of sheets being stole; I took him in our Work-house for that charge, and I found upon him these two spoons, not broke, two tea spoons; these broken spoons, and this caddy was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110070"></xptr>brought after me, I don't know who gave them me, the nurse of the ward gave me part of them, it was in the evening when I took him up, for when I had taken him to Marlborough-street I was too late, I was obliged to bring him back again; I think it was our watch-house keeper gave them me.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you say you took him in the workhouse, how came he there? - I cannot say, I believe he came there to drink tea.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were the spoons that you found? - In his pocket; these four tea spoons, two are swore to, and two are not.</p>
               <p>Q. In this watch-house, or workhouse, what account did he give of the two that were sworn to? - He said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Upton. They are my mistress's spoons, I can swear them to be my mistress's, I have cleaned them so many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any name on them? - No, one of the spoons is plain, the other is worked.</p>

Can you tell us of any fact that Sunday before this happened? - Yes, he dined with us, he behaved in a very improper manner, putting victuals to his mouth, and then flinging it about; I said to my husband he never can be right in his mind, or he would not behave so; he said directly he had been in Bedlam, I never knew it before, and in the afternoon he came again with the constable's staff in his hand, and said he would take us all up, he did not say what for, my husband said he can never be right, or else he would not behave in that manner to a friend; in the afternoon when he came again there was a man there cutting my husband's hair, Mr. Lesley, and he behaved very improperly to him, he told him that he would take him, and kick him down stairs, and many other improper things.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason he assigned? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason why he should kick Mr. Lesley down stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing else? - No further than that he went into the street, and behaved just the same with the children, and grown people, with his staff in his hand; I did not hear what he said, because I was in my room, but I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then from his whole conduct, judge fairly that he was a madman at that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think so now on your oath? - I do, this was only the Sunday before this happened.</p>

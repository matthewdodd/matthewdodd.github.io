               <p>JOSEPH STELL. I live at Prestwick, four miles beyond Manchester. I came to town on the 18th of April, and about seven o'clock that evening, I was on the other side of the river; I came over the iron bridge and soon after saw Rose standing by the side of a cart; I asked him to direct me to the White Horse, Fetter-lane, where I had put up; he said he was going past Fetter-lane, and if I would wait a few minutes, he had a friend coming, and we would go together - I waited three or four minutes, the prisoner Williams came up, and we all came on together towards St. Paul's - they asked me if I had ever seen that church; I said, No; we then went on, and I treated them at two public-houses - Rose then took my right arm and we walked on some distance, I then found his right hand near my pocket; I felt in my pocket, but I had not lost any thing - I shortly afterwards felt my watch drawn from me; I seized Rose by the breast and charged him with taking it; he began to strike me, and struck me many severe blows in the face; I had two very black eyes; I still held him and called for assistance; the officer came and took him - Williams was on his right hand and he made his escape with the watch, which was afterwards found in his possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you ever been in town before? A. No; I did not ask any one to go to the play that night - I cannot swear I had not been in three public-houses; I was in one after I left the prisoners; I can't tell how many I had been into in the day; I had had two pennyworths of gin at two vaults before I met them - I had some rum and water after I met them; I don't know whether I went to the George and Dragon; I don't know the signs - I remember a pretty landlady, but I did not try to be intimate with her, nor take any liberties with her, no further than speaking to her - I don't remember her husband threatening me if I did not leave her alone - I was not refused half a pint of rum that night to my knowledge; I called for no liquor but what I paid for, and what I called for they brought in; I don't remember asking Mrs. Barton for any money, nor dancing in the street - I was sober, but I don't know how much I had paid for liquor that day; I drank three or four glasses of gin and water in the length of the evening; I think not more than four, but I will swear not more than five - I treated the prisoners for them to direct me in my way, I had told Williams where I lodged, but upon my oath I did not give him my watch.</p>

            . I am a parish watchman. On the night of the 18th of April I was on duty in Fetter-lane, and saw Williams talking to the waiter at the White Horse; the waiter gave me a wink to stop; Williams offered him this watch, and the waiter would not have it; he then offered it to me, and said he had been with a companion, and they met with a countryman, and had shown him the way; that he went to the Bell, in Holborn, where he wanted to speak to a female, but he had persuaded him not - that he had given him his watch to take care of, but that going under a gateway he had lost him and his companion - I said, "You must be a very honest man, and no doubt the gentleman will reward you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not hear him ask if the gentleman lodged there? A. Yes; he might have gone off with it.</p>

               <p>William's Defence. I solemnly declare I am innocent; when the prosecutor and us came out of the Queen's Head, he took hold of a young woman and asked her to go to the play, and he gave me the watch, telling me to mind it for him - the young woman got from him and we went on to Museum-street, where I stopped - I lost the prosecutor and my fellow-prisoner - I then went to the play-house, but could not find them; I went into a public-house to have a pint of porter; I fell asleep and when I awoke I hastened to the White Horse, where the prosecutor said he lodged - I asked the waiter if a gentleman from the country lodged there; he said, yes; I said I had a watch of his, which I wished to deliver up, but he would not take it; I was coming out, and two policemen were at the door, who said I had better take it to the station, which I did.</p>

I remember the prosecutor being at my house, about nine o'clock on that night; he was very much intoxicated, and was disgusting to every body in the tap-room; he sat down and called for half a pint of rum; I told him I would not draw him any liquor, but to go and get sober where he got drunk - I went into my parlour, and when I came out he was standing at my bar quite in the way; I pushed him on one side and told my wife I wanted 2l. 2s. for the Sick Society, which was in my parlour - the prosecutor pulled out a 5l. note, and said he could lend me 2l. - I said I did not want him nor his money; he then went away with the prisoners.</p>

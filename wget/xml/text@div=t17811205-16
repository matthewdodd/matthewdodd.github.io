               <p>Did it appear doubtful who took the money? - She did not own she did the robbery, the justice asked who she said that woman there perhaps, the prisoner accused the other woman, and the other woman accused her.</p>
               <p>Was Todd there? - Yes; he said he was robbed by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>How came this other woman to be charged? - She had been drinking with them before, and she was in the room with them when they went up that night, she lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you understand at the justice's, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050038"></xptr> went up with them to the room that night? - Yes, together.</p>
               <p>That was the account Todd gave at the justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say they all went to bed together? - No; he did not say the market woman offered to go to bed at all, the market woman stopped the other.</p>
               <p>What became of the market woman when they went to bed, did he tell you that? - No.</p>
               <p>To Todd. How came you not to say any thing of this other woman being in the room with you? - She was up in the room, but she did not come to bed, the light went out, the market woman went down stairs, and in about two minutes this woman, that is here now, went down stairs, and had the money, the other woman took it from her; she brought it in her hand.</p>
               <p>You do not know who she took it from? - The prisoner, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you feel your breeches taken out? - I felt them taken; I called out directly.</p>
               <p>Had you no hands to lay hold of her? - Before I could get out of bed she was gone.</p>
               <p>Had you not hands to stop them, if you felt them? - They were snatched in a moment; she was half-way down stairs, and then stopped.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you felt them taken away? - I felt them go, and called watch.</p>
               <p>Now you say you felt them taken, before you said you missed them? - I felt them pulled away from underneath the pillow; snatched out underneath my head.</p>
               <p>The room was then dark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In what condition was he? - He seemed to be muddled, but gave pretty reasonable answers; he said he had been robbed of twenty-three guineas; and said, after he recollected, he had changed one guinea.</p>
               <p>Did he say when the other woman left the room? - No; but I understood they had both been in the room.</p>

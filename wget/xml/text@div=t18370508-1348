                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. James Butler, of Aldborough Hatch, Essex. The prisoner was also in his employ—on the morning of the 8th of April I saw him come out of master's granary with a sack partly full of oats—he placed it under a truss of straw, which was going in a cart to market—he had no business to take it—he had the allowance for bid horses in the nose-bags—I saw master, and told him what had happened.</p>

               <p>before it got to Ilford—the prisoner was with it—I told him he had got something on the cart which he ought not to have, and to get up and throw it down—he got up, but would not look for it—I got up, and threw down the sack, with about a bushel and a half of oats in it—he had no business with it—he had the nose-bags and a bundle of hay for the horses.</p>

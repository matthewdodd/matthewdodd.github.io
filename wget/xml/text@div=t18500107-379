                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Mortlake. On Sunday; 16th Dec, a little before ten o'clock, I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read—addressed,</hi> "Mr. C. Cain, cow-keeper, East Sheen, Surrey. Dec. 15,1849. Sir,—If it be convenient and agreeable to you, I will beg the favour of you to lend me the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and likewise a further sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my companions, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, who are bent on your ruin unless you comply with our request; for we intend <hi rend="italic">splitting</hi> on you buying corn of Barclay and Perkins's men, when they were drawing turf from the New-road. The 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be returned the 19th Jan.; if you will lend it me, I will return it personally: if not, either let me have a note to what terms you mean to come. It is not six months since a man was transported for a much less quantity than you have received. Bury the money, or a note, by the common gate adjoining Pocock's Meadow, close to the gate-post; where the sappers and miners have cut across. It must be there by ten o'clock on Sunday morning. We are your humble servants, G.H., J.M. G.W.'s mark x.")—I immediately went to Sergeant Finlayson, and asked his advice—he wrote me a letter, of which this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it being over the time on that morning, he advised me to bury it, according to the instructions, on the Monday—I put three farthings in the letter, and buried it at the place I was told to do so—I am quite satisfied no one saw me bury it—I returned about one o'clock, and found it in an undisturbed state—I walked down the Richmond-road a little distance, and then met Holland, who was watching it—in consequence of what passed with Holland, I went and took the farthings out, and deposited the letter again in the same place—no one was near at the time—I went again the following morning, found the hole disturbed, and the letter gone—on the Thursday after, by the twelve o'clock post, I received this second letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Dec. 19. Six,—As we have not received the money or note, we take the trouble of writing to you again. We all came down on Sunday morning, and stayed till nine at night; but you neither placed the money or a note. If you think that place not safe,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185001070112"></xptr>
               <p>place it by that little gate opposite the lane, the Richmond side of the Five Awls; you will find a piece cut off one of the posts; we mean a narrow place leading to the railroad. It cost us 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. coming on Sunday; you must, therefore, put the money or the note on Thursday evening, or early on Friday morning, so as we may know what to do; for we intend giving infor<lb></lb>mation at the firm on Monday, where we shall get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and our expenses paid. If it cost us any more coming down, we shall expect it from you. We remain, your humble servants (<hi rend="italic">not signed</hi>). You will get off so cheap with them.")—I do not know the writing of either of the letters—I inclosed that letter, with a note, to Sergeant Finlayson—two officers came to me, and, by their advice, I marked five farthings, folded them each up in paper, and sealed them with wax—I then folded all five in a sheet of writing-paper, and secured the folds and ends—I wrote outside, "To be left till called for," and under that, "Police"—in the morning, at a little before six, I went and put it in the place described in the second letter, by the gate under the post that had the notch on—it was impossible to mistake the place—I made a hole, and buried it four inches under ground, returned the mould on it, put my foot on it, and went away—I am quite sure no one saw me do it—it is a place by the high-road side—about eight o'clock I drove my cart round that way, looked at the place, and saw it was undisturbed—I returned again about ten o'clock, found the place open, and the packet gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 282). In consequence of a communication, on 21st Dec, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to Sheen, and went to a part where I could see the post described in the second letter—I con<lb></lb>cealed myself where I had a clear view of the place—I saw Mr. Cain go by with his horse and cart, and several other people—about ten, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner coming up the road from Richmond—he came to the corner of Blind-lane, made a stop, and looked about him, directly opposite the post—he then turned up Blind-lane, and passed very close to me, which enabled me to have a clear view of his features—he stayed up the lane four or five minutes, out of my sight, and then returned again to the main road—he then crossed over to where the post was, looked down at the bottom of the post, and bent himself a little down—he then went down Forty-alley, (which leads from the post,) about 150 or 200 yards—he then came to the top of the alley, and stood at the side of the post, looking about him again—he then bent himself down, and with his righthand raked the mould away from the bottom of the post—he took something out that appeared to me like paper—it was white, he put it into his righthand pocket, and turned down the alley again—I gave Holland, who was at some distance from me, a signal to go and see if the letter was gone, and I kept sight of the prisoner—as he was going down the lane, I saw him move his hand, as if throwing something away—Holland got a-head of me, and I saw him stop the prisoner—we then returned together, and near the place where I saw him make the motion, I found these pieces of paper(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), which have the appearance as if coin had been folded in them—I took the prisoner to Mr. Cain, and then to the Richmond station—when I went on watch, I examined the place—there was nothing to attract the atten<lb></lb>tion of a person who did not know anything beforehand—no one disturbed the place before the prisoner came—I never lost sight of the place all the time.</p>

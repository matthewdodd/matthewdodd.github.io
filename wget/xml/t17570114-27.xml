I thought people were getting into the house I went into the next room to listen at the sash window I thought the more I listen'd, the more I heard them. Then I went down stairs and got my gun, which was charged the day before. I open'd the window and made a great noise, but could see no-body. I went down stairs and out at the door. Then I saw another door open which was not lock'd, belonging to a little house where I put my tools; when I suspected somebody had been in the yard. Then I went and found the door of the hen roost broke open, and the staple drawn; the hens and five ducks that where in it the over night were gone. I could trace two mens feet, the one a long, the other a lesser one, in several places.</p>

               <p>Stone. There was a game cock lock'd up amongst them, which also was missing. I enquired about at the cockers, and desired if such was brought to a match to let me know; this cock had been in my custody about three years. About a week after this,

            . On Friday night came five sailors. I sell fruit at the door where they asked for lodgings. I directed them into the house, they were entertained there. They asked if they could dress a fowl or two, and pulled them out of their trowsers. I was call'd backward and forwards, they offer'd to sell there fowls to the man of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Allen. This was at the Cock in Thieving-Lane, called Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they ask to dress them?</p>
               <p>Allen. The maid of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the fowls dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Allen. They were alive. The maid said, she could not dress them, because the house was very much in trouble, her mistress was dying. After the prisoner found the man of the house would not buy them, he bought two fowls of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know them, if you see them?</p>
               <p>Allen. No. I saw this gentleman (pointing to Mr. Stone) there, he saw the skin of the cock that was dressed at the sign of the Cock, he knew it by the skin of it to be his pile cock. I smiled to think a man should know the cock by the skin of it; it was dressed with bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Stone. Did you see a skin, and say it was the skin of the cock you lost?</p>
               <p>Stone. I know nothing of any cock that was dressed there. I went there, and there was a piece of bacon and some fowl, but no-body said any such thing; and I insist upon it, it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the very cock that you lost, that is here?</p>
               <p>Stone. I am positive of it, this is the very cock.</p>
               <p>Q. To Randall. Was the cock that you bought of the prisoner, alive or dead?</p>
               <p>Randall. It was alive.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stone. Did you see this witness Allen in that house?</p>
               <p>Stone. Upon my word I don't remember I ever saw him in my days before?</p>

            . I have known Eagle about seven years. I know he did not lay out of the barracks, except he was on duty, for I call'd him over every night for above a month.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stone. Did you enquire at the barracks after Eagle?</p>
               <p>Stone. I did on the 19th being a Sunday. I saw a great many soldiers, serjeants and corporals. I took care to ask serjeants and corporals after him. They said he had not been there for a fortnight, and that he had thrown up his pay, and left the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you?</p>
               <p>Stone. Mr. Castlet was.</p>
               <p>Q. to Castlet. Was you with Mr. Stone on Sunday the 19th of December?</p>
               <p>Castlet. I was, we enquired after Eagle, we asked every body that we thought would inform us, such as serjeants and corporals. They said he owes a trifle of money here, and has not been here for a fortnight. We were informed he went with drays about, and in general he threw up his pay.</p>

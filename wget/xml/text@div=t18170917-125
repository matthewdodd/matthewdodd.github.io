He died before one o'clock.</p>

            . I was attending to the music. There was two or three hundred people collected in the road - I first saw the caravan about fifty yards off-it came in a canter; there was a general cry of "Stop!" he drove on and did not slacken his pace - I did not see him whip his horses-the crowd gave way-it could easily make way. The deceased was getting out of the way and ran against the horse, the collar struck him on his breast, he fell on his back, the front wheel went over him, the hind wheel bruised his shoulder and turned him on his side-he got up, pressed his breast-the prisoner stopped about six yards from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The horses stopped immediately-I believe the driver stopped them; I saw him look behind, go on about six yards and then stop - He appeared to pull them up to prevent the hind wheel touching him. I think he made two efforts to stop, before he succeeded.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the crowd have got out of the way, if disposed? - A. They might get over the rails.</p>

            . I am master of the band. I was on the right flank of the second rank; the caravan came in at the Piccadilly gate - We were about three parts up Constitution-hill; when the caravan got through the gates, in a smart trot, the guards occupied one half of the road, and the crowd the other, the crowd were on the left by the low rails - They gave way on each side; the band was playing, I heard them call out but did not hear what they said; I looked round and saw the deceased lying under the hind wheel; the caravan appeared to be in the act of stopping-the prisoner did not appear frightened, but kept the same as when I first saw him.</p>

I saw the caravan coming through the gate at a very quick rate - I heard the people calling out, "clear the way," here is a coach,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170040"></xptr>I distinctly heard it. The driver still kept his pace. The crowd endeavoured to make way. I saw the near horse upon the deceased-his back was towards the caravan, and his face towards the horses-the fore wheel went over his body, and the hind wheel lodged on his left shoulder.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought into the hospital about half-past eleven o'clock. There were some marks on his body; he could hardly speak, for pain. He died at one o'clock. I examined the body, and found the liver torn completely across, which I have no doubt was the cause of his death. There were other marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry for it. I made my best endeavours to pull up. I got off as soon as I could stop.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COOMBS. I am a soldier in the Third Regiment of Guards. I was on the box with the prisoner. He was employed to carry bread for the soldiers. He did all he could to stop the horses the instant the man was down. I do not think he could see him, as he was on the off side. The man made a great noise. He got off, and went back to where the accident happened.</p>

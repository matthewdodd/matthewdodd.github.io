The prisoner was a private in my regiment, and lived in my house, as my backman or servant. On the 30th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went out and left him at home - I returned between one and two; he was not then at home. I did not see him again till I saw him at Leeds on the 13th of November - I had no expectation of his leaving; I had missed my keys after going out that morning, and immediately on my returning I went to my scrutoire and found the key in it, and the scrutoire shut. I missed from a drawer in it where I kept my money, a green purse, which I know contained a 100 l. a 50 l. and ten 10 l. Bank notes, of which I had the numbers, and several other notes and sovereigns; also a diamond ring. On receiving information of his being apprehended, on Sunday fortnight I arrived at Leeds, and next day saw my ring in possession of the constable.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. James Thomas Hawes, a pawnbroker, in Old-street. On the evening of the 31st March, I was outside the shop—I saw the prisoner come and look at the things in the shop—she went on to the coffee-shop next door, and looked in at the window—I saw that she watched me, and I watched her—some one came and stood between me and the prisoner—she directly lifted up her apron and let it fall over this looking-glass—she took up her apron and the glass, and walked away—I stopped her, and asked what she was going to do with the glass—she said she had not got it—I took hold of it from under her apron—she pulled it, and I let it go—I thought it might be broken—she put it down behind her, and said she had not had it.</p>

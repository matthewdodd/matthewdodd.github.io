On Saturday, the 10th of February, this calico was about two yards within the door, when I went out about three o'clock - I returned late in the evening, and it was gone - Kilby, the street-keeper, brought it to me on the following Saturday; it has my private mark on it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bridge Ward. On the 10th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner on Fish-street-hill with this calico in her apron, in consequence of information which I had received - I asked what she had got there; I took her into a house; she then said she had picked it up in the street, but could not for her life recollect where - it was rumpled up as if snatched off a rail - Mr. Briant claimed it on the following Saturday.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up between the bridge and St. Thomas' Hospital; a woman followed me, and wanted part of it - I said I would not give it her, as she did not cry Halves! a gentleman, who heard us talking about it, gave me in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sail-marker. I came on board this vessel on the 13th, about ten o'clock in the morning—I had been there some times when Samuel Haslip called me into the cuddy—I went down to the sail-room again, and found the wrapper of a parcel cut open—the prisoner and mother man were in the sail-room—I saw a piece of silk hanging our of the prisoner's bosom—I took it away from him, and put it into the boat<lb></lb>swain's store-room—I went and informed the chief officer what had hap<lb></lb>pened.—the prisoner went on with his work till all the sails were out before he was taken—I cannot say why it into the boatswain's store-room—there I took the silk from him, and put it into the boatswain's store-room—there was no other silk in the store-room—I am not sure whether I gave the same silk to Mr. Haslip—I gave it him about half an hour afterwards—there were no other pieces there—I doubted, because there was more missing, the people in the sail-room might have put more there—I was away for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I then went with the third officer, and found a piece of silk there, but I did not go in the way that I put it in—there is no doubt but that it is the same piece.</p>

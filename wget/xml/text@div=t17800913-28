            . On the 13th of July, at about twelve o'clock, I was informed a person had come out of my house with a bundle. I got several people to go after her; the prisoner was taken and brought back with the things mentioned in the indictment upon her; some of them belong to a Mrs. Vallans, the rest belong to Mrs. Blewett; I had them to wash.</p>

               <p>As I was going along to my work I happened to meet a woman with these things; I am partly sure it is the prisoner, but I cannot swear it is her; I met her just above Harrow Stock-hill, Hempstead. The girl, who belonged to the house the linen was taken from, desired me to stop her. I did, and took her to Mr. Edwards, the constable; there I saw her searched, and the things mentioned in the indictment were found upon her; they were loose in her apron.</p>

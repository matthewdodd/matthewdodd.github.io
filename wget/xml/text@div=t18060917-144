She came into the house with an old man, she asked for a pint of porter: I had seen my things in the yard not a minute before she came into the tap room for the porter. She staid there about five minutes and went out, she came in again and called for another pint of porter, after drinking part of that pint she had another pint, she fat about five minutes, she asked if she might go into the back yard, she went into the yard and was there about ten minutes and then she went into the street, my mistress told me to go into the yard and see if every thing was right; I went into the yard and missed the things, I pursued the prisoner and overtook her in a chandler's-shop, six doors off, I charged her with stealing them, she swore at me and said she had not got them, I pulled her pocket-hole, I saw the apron wound round her middle, my master brought her back and sent for Chapman, he took them from her person.</p>

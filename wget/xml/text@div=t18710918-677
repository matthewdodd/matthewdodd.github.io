I keep the Victoria public-house, 46, Bucking<lb></lb>ham Palace Road, Pimlico—on the 5th July, about 5.10 in the morning, I found my house had been broken into—an entrance had been gained by the landing window at the back of the house—the window had been shut the night before, but I can't say that it was fastened—I missed between 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, silver, and copper, and a gold pen—the money was taken from a desk in the counting house, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bar, which had been left for the morning's use—an inner door had been forced with a chisel, and the desk likewise—I know the prisoner—I have seen him in the company of a man named White.</p>

On the morning of 5th July, at 3.15, I was in a water closet at the rear of 62, Buckingham Palace Road—I heard something on the roof of the closet, which is eight houses from the Victoria—I saw the prisoner come off the roof of the closet into the yard, from the direction of the Victoria—he looked round at me when he got into the yard—I had a good view of him, and away he went—I am sure he</p>

               <p>is the man—it was a very fine morning—I did not speak to him—I then saw a man named White, whom I knew, come off the roof of the same closet—I said "Halloa! what are you up to?"—he said "I can't get out," and he went back again—I took him into custody—he has been tried, and got five years for the burglary—the money was found where he was appre<lb></lb>hended—on 21st August, about six weeks afterwards, I went to the police-station, and picked out the prisoner from several others—I found 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the area where White was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no windows to the closet; there was a door—directly I heard the noise I jumped up, and I was about a yard and a half from the prisoner—I am certain he is the man—I never saw him before—he had on a dark coat and waistcoat, but I took more notice of his face than anything—he had a moustache and a slight imperial—White was taken the same night—we never left the spot until we searched and found him—the prisoner was in my sight about a minute or a minute and a half, but I had a good view of him—I will pledge my oath he is the man, although I only saw him for a minute, and did not see him again till six weeks afterwards—he had a <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat on at the time—he had the same kind of hat on when I picked him out—I did not notice what trowsers he had, I looked more on the face—he had a black coat and a turn-down collar; I don't remember what neck tie—I recognize him by his face, his moustache, and imperial—I could see the imperial from where I was that night—it has not grown, it is near about the same now. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was daylight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at Chelsea. On the night of 2nd June, I was in Edge ware-road, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the New Inn—we spoke to each other, and tossed for a pot of beer—I lost, and we had a pot of beer which I paid for—we came away from the New Inn together, and walked in conversation as far as Upper Seymour-street, and all on a sudden he tripped me up, fell on me, struck me in the mouth, put his hand in my pocket, and took out a little tin box containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there were eight half-crowns in it, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, and the rest in shil-lings and sixpences—I felt his hand in my pocket; I called, "Police!" as loudly as I could—the prisoner made off—I went after him as fast as I could, but I did not know which way be went—I had had two or three half-pints of beer—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I was on duty, and saw Bennett lying on the pavement, and the prisoner on him, at the corner of Upper Seymour-street; the prisoner was attempting to pick his pocket—when I came within four yards of Upper Seymour-street, the prisoner got up and ran away—I followed him, and called, "Stop thief!"—I saw him stopped by another officer—I had not lost sight of him—when I came up to the prisoner, I asked him what was the matter; he said the other man had struck him—I took him back to Bennett, and he said, "That is the man that tripped me up, and robbed me of a yellow box, containing</p>

I was sitting in my shop, 8, Adam-street West, I heard a cry, opened my door, and saw the prisoner running—I ran towards him, saw him throw something down an area, and heard the crack of a pane of glass—I saw him stopped, he is the same man that threw the article in the area—he was asked why he ran, and he shuffled, and made out that it was something of a quarrel—I showed the policeman the area.</p>

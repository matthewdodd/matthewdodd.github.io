               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you used to be pelted? A. Never before; I keep a house and let two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your lodgers women of the town? A. I never ask them questions; they do not walk the streets to my knowledge; I have no company in my house; people live with them; whether they are their husbands I cannot say- it is not a house for the reception of bad women; I had no girls with me when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not pelted for behaving improperly to two girls who were with you? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutrix met me in Bow-street, and said her pocket had been picked; I went up and took the prisoners; her bonnet and cap were quite muddy; Ryan ran away when I came up, but I caught him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know this woman? A. I have seen her before; I did not know where she lived before; she keeps a bad house, for the reception of street-walkers; I did not ask why she was pelted; I certainly would not believe her on her oath, as I have heard her swear to day that she did not keep such a house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Before you met her on that day had you been in the habit of speaking to her? A. I believe I have; I have seen her in the saloon of the theatre, and in the boxes. I know that girls, who frequent the theatre, use her house, and have seen her night after night, in the saloon, as mistress of the girls there.</p>
               <p>CARNEY'S Defence. I met her with two young women standing by the play-house; some boys pelted her; she bit one on the head with her patten; a crowd came up, and they went away; we remained; she went and got an officer, and pointed us out.</p>

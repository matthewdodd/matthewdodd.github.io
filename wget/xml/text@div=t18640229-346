                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, at 132, Holborn-hill—the prisoner was employed by me as shopman, and occasionally went out, at his own request—he was employed as traveller by me on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> December—he was to remit all moneys received by him by the evening post, if in time for it, with the exception of enough to carry him on to another town, enough for his expenses—on this occasion, he took goods with him I believe some<lb></lb>where to the amount of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not pay over to me a sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Masters, or account to me in any way for it—he did not tell me that he had sold him any goods—on the evening of 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, I asked him if he had sold anything—he said, "Yes," and he took a little book out of his pocket, and called out various sums, which I can give you from my day-book—he represents, in this little book, having sold goods to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Gray—he has never accounted to me for that in any other way than saying that he sold them—I gave him into custody for these robberies, without saying anything to him—before that, I found out that he had been robbing me in other ways, and I forgave him—at the police-station, I asked him if those were all the accounts he had embezzled, speaking of the accounts at Aldershot, Gray's and Master's—he said,. "No, they are all wrong, except Nurse, of Lynn"—I had forgiven him for taking goods out of my place and making away with them—I had not forgiven him in respect of these particular sums.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Bond and Co., No. 8, Finsbury-place South. William Dimsdale Child is one of the partners—we had books in the warehouse belonging to the firm of Whitmore and Wells—previous to the 15th of Nov. I observed the internal part of three of those books cut out, and made a communication to my employer—on Wednesday, the 15th, there were others of those books in the warehouse—the warehouse door was kept open during the day—about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening I was in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the warehouse, which is on the ground floor—I went up towards it, and heard persons talking; and as I was on the top stair of the kitchen, a man rushed past me towards the street door, and escaped—I had fastened and chained the street door about half an hour before, when my employer left—I got a cutlass, and sent my wife for a policeman, who came, and he and I entered the lower warehouse together—we found the prisoner standing, I think, on the second stair of the warehouse, and on the third stair were these two ledgers, which I am certain had previously been in the ware-house—I gave him into custody—I had not fastened the warehouse—next morning I saw some footmarks in the yard—a person, by getting into the yard, could get into the warehouse, by the back door, which is always left open during the day—he would have to get over a wall nine feet high to get into the yard—the wall leads to West-street, Finsbury-circus—there are four rooms—these books were kept in the third room—there is a door, which was open—he would not have to go through any door to get at them after entering the back door.</p>

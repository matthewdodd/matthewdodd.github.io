                  </hi>. I am a baker, and lodge at a coffee-house at the corner of Christopher-street and Wilson-street, Finsbury-square, kept by James Merry. On the 2nd of March, I left my room between six and seven o'clock in the morning, leaving nobody there—I shut the room-door when I came out, but did not lock it—I latched it—it is on the third floor—the window looks into Christopher-street—an old lady and gentleman lodge on the second floor—there is only one servant—it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—I returned home about seven o'clock in the evening, and went up to my room about eleven o'clock to go to bed—I then found the door standing wide open, and a box of clothes which I had left locked in the morning, broken open, and the things stated gone—the window-blinds were shut down in the sash with the window, as if it had been put down in a hurry—there are two windows—only one was so—some clothes and a hat-brush were gone out of a drawer, and a coat, waistcoat and trowsers from a peg—the articles are worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I came down to inform the landlord, and the officer was standing at the bar—I went with him to the station-house and saw the prisoner, and all my things there—I did not know him before—these things were all safe when I left in the morning—I found some old rags left in the room which did not belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at the time in question. On Monday night, the 2nd of March, I was on duty in Clifton-street, Finsbury-square, and about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock saw the prisoner come from the door of Merry's coffee-house, which is at the corner of the street; he looked round, looked up at the house, and then looked down and picked up a bundle which I had seen fall down on the ground from some part of the house, but I cannot say exactly which window; when he picked it up he looked up again and caught two other bundles, one after the other—he picked up the first one which he had, and put with the other two and ran away with them—I saw a handkerchief and stocking fall from the bundle—I took them up, followed him, and stopped him in King-street, Finsbury-market—I asked him what he had in his bundle, he said, "Dirty linen," that it was given to him by a young man at the Finsbury coffee-house—he said he knew the young man but did not know his name—I asked him if it was his dirty linen, he said "Yes"—I saw the sleeve of a coat and of a clean shirt hanging out—I thought it was not right, and took him to the station-house; in going along we passed the Finsbury coffee-house, and I asked if he had been in there he said "No"—on going further, he said two of the bundles he had brought from St. Paul's churchyard, and the other he had given to him by some young man his mother used to wash for—I examined</p>

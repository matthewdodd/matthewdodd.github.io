            . I keep a goldsmith's shop on St. Margaret's Hill in Southwark. On Friday the 23d of March, in the morning, the Prisoner brought this lid of a tankard to me to sell. Finding it was wrenched off by force. I asked her some questions , to which she gave me but very indifferent answers. I suspected she had the other part of the tankard about her, and asked her if she had not? She said , No. Then said I, you must give me leave to search you. She very readily let me search one side, but was very unwilling that I should search the other. I put my hand over the counter, and struck it against the edge of the tankard; and then I told her, I must stop her and the tankard. She said, I should have the tankard if I would let her go. I said, that would not do for me. I sent for a Constable, and had her before Justice Clarke, who committed her. I saw by an advertisement that was published that day, who was the owner. I sent to him, and the gentleman came to me, and said, it was his tankard . She said before the Justice that she took it out of the Prosecutor's house; there's the tankard with the name and number that was in the advertisement.</p>
               <p>White. That is my tankard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was given me by a woman who lodged in the house where I lived; I told the gentleman so; they bid me confess the thing, and said, I should be safe; and I said what was not true .</p>
               <p>White. The woman, who she says gave her the tankard, has been with her in the New Goal two or three times. <rs id="t17440404-14-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

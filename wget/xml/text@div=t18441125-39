                  </hi>. I am a laceman, and live in Edgware-road. The prisoner was about six weeks in my service—on Saturday last, I sent for a policeman, in consequence of suspicion—when he arrived, I asked if the prisoner and another shopwoman had any objection to be searched—they said they had no objection—the policeman went up-stairs with the prisoner and my wife—I went up shortly after, and there saw some ribbons and other things laying on a box—I claimed them as my property—the pri<lb></lb>soner said she could not deny that they were mine, and begged for pardon, saying they were the first things she had ever taken—she wished to pay me for them—she went on her knees, and asked to be forgiven—I refused—their value is about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable, D</hi> 7.) I was applied to, and went up<lb></lb>stairs with Mrs. Hartley, the prisoner, and another shopwoman—I saw the prisoner unlock her box—she took something out which she carried to the bed, and put it under the mattress—I saw the searcher take a parcel from under the mattress, where I had seen it put—the prisoner said there was nothing there—the searcher began to open it—the prisoner laid hold of it, and said she should not look at it—she said she must—she opened it—Mr. Hartley came up and claimed it as his property—the prisoner said it was the first sixpence she had ever taken in her life—she fell on her knees, begged to be forgiven, and said she would pay for the things—she said, "You have children of your own."</p>

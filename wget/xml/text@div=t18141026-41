On the 2nd of October, I got up at nine o'clock in the morning, and brought the watch down in my hand. I went out to light my candle, and when I went in, I missed the watch off the mantle-shelf. I saw the prisoner go up the court where I live. My husband went and found out the prisoner. I got information that the prisoner lived in Dean-street, Soho. A constable went, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at the bar - A. My husband saw the prisoner come out of the public-house. The prisoner is the man I saw in my court; he has a wooden leg. He said, he had given his wife the watch, she has it in her boson. I went up to the prisoner's wife, and took the watch out of her bosom. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I gave the watch to my husband, and went for a constable. I asked the prisoner what possessed him to take it; he said, a young man gave it him at the bottom of the court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me before - A. Never, until the Sunday morning; you were within eight or ten steps of my door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked the watch up in a dust-hole in a court in Barbican; in about an hour after, a man and a woman came to me, and said, I had picked up a watch; I delivered the watch to them. They gave me in charge of a constable. I am innocent of the charge against me. I have served my King and Country fifteen years, and lost a leg in that service.</p>

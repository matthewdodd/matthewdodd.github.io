On the 10th of January I got up about seven o'clock; the prisoner was in bed then; I kept my clothes in a box by the side of the bed; I went to work, and left my box unlocked; I returned about nine o'clock; the prisoner was out then; I went up into my room; I saw some of my things throwed about the room; my box was shut down as I had left. I examined my box and missed two coats, and a pair of small clothes; and two shirts were laying upon the box; I missed them; I saw them there when I went out.</p>

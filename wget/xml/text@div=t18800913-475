                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on the Saturday night before the Bank holiday I went to 3, Gray's Buildings for my children—about 40 minutes afterwards my husband came in the worse for drink; he did not speak to me—he had a small pocket-knife in hi* hand; he struck me, but what with I don't know; it was on my forehead—I fell off my chair, and said to my brother "I am stabbed"—I know nothing more—my brother picked me up—the prisoner ran downstairs—I followed him and gave him into custody—I did not know I had another wound in my neck till the doctor saw it; it was at the back of my neck—I was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was married in 1867—my husband was then a sailor in the Royal Navy; he was discharged in May, 1868, with a first-rate character—five or six years ago he joined the Phoenix Temperance Society—on 10th June last he left me and went to America—I don't know what he went for; he did not tell me he was going—he wrote to me from America and said he had no thought of leaving me and the children, and he would send me money when he got work—he was at one time employed at a coffee tavern, also as clerk of the works to a builder, and received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the work was finished—he had a medal; all the men teetotallers have</p>

               <p>medals—he never stabbed me before, he has assaulted me—he came from America on the Tuesday before this Saturday that he stabbed me—I was then living with my sister-in-law, in Gee's Court, Oxford Street—I know a man named Thorn, he is a mate of my brother's—he was not living at my sister-in-law's while my husband was away—when my husband came back he wanted me to live with him again; I refused—we were drinking together on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, not on the Saturday—I saw the knife on the Saturday morning, a young man gave it to my hus<lb></lb>band, not to me—there was a scuffle when he stabbed me; I tried to get away, my brother knocked my husband down with a chair—I was just going to leave the room with my child when my husband came in—I charged him with stabbing me in the arm 11 years ago—I did not make that wound myself—I did not make a false charge against him two years ago for stabbing me, my head was cut—I lost a baby a few months ago—an inquest was held—I said then that my husband had struck the baby—I did not hear anything said about prosecuting me for perjury—I am not a teetotaller—I took the pledge once, and kept it for about an hour—I might have taken it twice, I don't remember—I have been in the habit of pawning my husband's things, and his medals, and he has done so himself, for food and drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my sister, the prosecutrix, on Saturday, 31st August, at 3, Gray's Buildings, when the prisoner came in—I saw him make a blow at her—I did not see what with—she said "Jack, he has stabbed me"—I saw her bleeding from the neck and forehead, and tried to stop the prisoner—I ran for a policeman, and came back with two—as I was coming back I saw the prisoner coming down, and my sister following him—she charged him—I did not do anything to him, I only stopped him—I did not hit him, he was too strong for me—I did not knock him down.</p>

I was called to Gray's Buildings on 31st August about 11.40, and there saw the prosecutrix bleeding from a wound in the forehead and one in the back of the neck—she gave the prisoner into custody—I said "Have you a knife?"—he said "I have," and he handed me this small pocket-knife; it was shut—she had said "My husband stabbed me with a knife"—the brother fetched me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of police—on 31st July, a little after 12 o'clock, I was called to see the prosecutrix—she was suffering from a wound over the left eyebrow, about an inch and a quarter long, of a lacerated and contused character—on the back of the neck on the right side there was a small wound with incised edges, about a quarter of an inch long and a quarter of an inch in depth—I dressed both wounds—the wound at the back of the neck healed by first intention within a very few days—a knife was shown me at the station—I measured the size of the wound—the large blade corresponded with the wound at the back of the neck—the other wound did not correspond with a wound by a knife—blood was flowing from both wounds—the prisoner was in a state of great excitement; I should think induced by drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound at the back of the neck might he self<lb></lb>inflicted; it must have been done with a cutting instrument—the prosecutrix seemed labouring under excitement from drink—I remember an inquest before Dr. Hardwicke on a child of the prosecutrix—I was examined as a witness on it—I examined the child to see whether there was any amount of force from a man's hand on it—there was a very slight bruise on one cheek; not such as would be inflicted by a blow—I heard the prosecutrix give evidence—she charged her husband with having killed the child—I think a question was raised as to whether she could be indicted for perjury, but I will not swear to it.</p>

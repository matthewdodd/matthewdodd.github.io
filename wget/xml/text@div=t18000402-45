               <p>JAMES HOOLE sworn. - On the the evening of the 13th of March I was desired by one of the workmen in the shop to observe the prisoner, for he was secreting some metal about him; and I observed him put something as I thought into his waistcoat-pocket; I was at one end of the shop, and he at the other; I went nearer to him; I observed then that it was not into his waistcoat-pocket that he was putting the metal; I went down and informed my master of it, and when the prisoner went out of the shop from work, between seven and eight in the evening, my master followed him; he brought him back, and sent for a constable; the officer searched him in the presence of me and another man, and out of a pocket which was fastened to the inside of his waistcoat, there was some plated metal concealed; that pocket was concealed inside his breeches; I afterwards went with the officer to his house; I had been there before with him; and between the bed and the sacking we found a part of a canister-cover.</p>
               <p>Q. What is meant by the half-pound of base metal in the indictment? - A. There were some pieces of metal that were not plated found in the pocket; I can swear to its being my master's property; there is one article found in the pocket which I can swear to having made myself.</p>

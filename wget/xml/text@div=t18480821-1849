                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my father and the prisoner, who is my mother, at 27, Carburton-street. I recollect the doctor coming—after I had had tea that day, I was very sick and in pain in my belly—I have two younger brothers—they were sick at the same time—my mother was in the room with us, and no one else—after we had tea, my mother gave us something like milk to drink—I tasted it and said, "Mother, it is nasty"—I said I could not drink any more—she gave me a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to drink some more of it—I did not drink any more—my mother told me to go to my aunt and tell her to come round.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. On Tuesday evening, 18th July, I went to 27, Carburton-street, and saw the prisoner—the children, the aunt, and, I think, the uncle were in the room, and one or two others—the eldest boy was vomiting very copiously, and writhing with pain in the bowels—the symptoms indicated the presence of some metallic poison—the other children were crying, whether with pain, or with the noise that was going on, I cannot say—when I went in, the prisoner called out to me, "Save the baby! save the baby! I gave him most of the poison"—I asked whether she had taken any of it herself—she said, "Cer<lb></lb>tainly not"—she was not sick, and showed no symptoms of having taken poison—I administered emetics, and the second child was well next day—this boy was tolerably well next morning, but was still in pain—there were teathings on the table, and a jug, containing what I at first thought was milk—I asked what it was, and was told it was not milk, but a solution of sugar of lead—I tried it by chemical means, and found that account was quite right—it was a very powerful solution—I gave the contents of the jug to a woman in the next room, who said she would lock them up, but they have never been found, she says some one came for them, in my name, and she gave them up, and they were thrown away—I think this boy would have died, if medical assistance had not been at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The stomach was rejecting the poison when you arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not think the stomach would have gone on to reject all the poison, it is not impossible—the room presented the appearance of poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—this boy had vomited a great deal I was told, and was still vomiting when I was there—I did not analyze anything which was rejected from his stomach, or preserve any of it—the three children were vomiting all over the room, and on the beds—there was no vessel used—what was in the jug was cold, it appeared like milk, slightly curdled, it was of a light colour towards the top—if sugar of lead is dissolved in water, it would be opaque—goulard water is made from it—that is a solution of acitate of lead—it is not a sub-acitate—it has been called a super-acitate—I am acquainted with Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence—I do not know that he says goulard extract is formed of sub-acitate of lead—it would not make any difference in its poisonous qualities—I tasted it, it had a sort of sub-acid sweet taste—I tested it by litmus paper, to ascertain whether it was a more active poison—it slightly reddened it, which denoted the pre<lb></lb>sence of acid—oxalic acid would have made it very red—any mineral acid would produce redness in different degrees—I tested it to influence me as to the antidote—I afterwards added a solution of hydro-sulphate of potash, which precipated black—the boy's symptoms were, rolling on the bed and drawing up his legs, a sort of convulsive appearance—the mouth was of a grey colour, he had great pain in the abdomen—it is not the effect of taking sugar of lead that the pain is eased by pressure—I have known cases where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210046"></xptr>
               <p>persons have taken sugar of lead accidentally, and I think the pain has been increased by pressure—I will not be positive—I should think twenty or thirty grains would be sufficient to produce the effect I saw on this boy—it would take an ounce of water to hold that quantity of sugar of lead in suspension, that is two table spoonfulls of water—that would make the sort of solution I saw—about three grains will render a quart of water milky—I said to the prisoner; "What induced you to do this?"—she said she was in distress, and had been threatened with a distraint for rent—she expressed great anxiety about all her children—she seemed in strong bodily health, but very distressed and excited—she was rocking backwards and forwards on a chair, and exclaiming against her folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What should you judge of her mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not im<lb></lb>paired—I should say she was distressed—I do not think she is insane—the woman who said the prisoner had given the child sugar of lead, was standing close by her—it was then that she said, "Save the baby, sir, I gave that the most of the poison."</p>

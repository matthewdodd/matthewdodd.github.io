                  </hi>. I live at 18, Whitechapel Road, and am a shoemaker—on, the night, 19th September, about 12 o'clock, I was in Osborne Street, about 150 yards from my own house—I heard a noise behind me of tramp<lb></lb>ing of feet, as if several persons were running towards me—I was about to turn round to see who it was when I was tripped up from behind—I fell on the ground heavily, knocking the side of my face, and breaking my hat—I felt a tug at my watch chain—I put up my hand to stop my watch—I received two or three kicks while I was on the ground, and I remember no more after that—there is a wound on my hand—I missed my watch and chain when I came to myself—I received one kick on the left hand, one on the right knee, and one on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say anything about the kicks before the Magistrate—I was too ill to talk about it—I gave my evidence as shortly as I could—I had hold of my chain two or three minutes before—I am quite sure I had my watch—when I came a little bit to myself I found there was a constable there—when I first got up I told the constable I had lost nothing—I did not know where I was—the fall was so severe that my senses were gone—I might even have told the constable that I was not hurt, and that I was all right—there was a lad with me at first—he was not at the Police Court—I had left home in the afternoon, about 4 o'clock—I had been out on business; business was over between 6 and 7 o'clock—I was away from home from 7 o'clock till 12.30—my watch was worth four guineas—the chain was gold—I had been into one public-house that evening—I was there something like an hour—I was quite sober—I know nothing about the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, at 56, Britannia Street—on 19th September, a little after 12 o'clock, I was in Osborne Street, White<lb></lb>chapel Road—I saw seven or eight lads, aged about eighteen to twenty, or twenty-four, in a gang—I saw them rush across the road, and attack Mr. Hale—they knocked him down—the prisoner fell on him—I saw him rise up, leave Mr. Hale, and join his companions—the prosecutor remained on the ground about five minutes after he had received the blow—I went across to him, and raised his head off the ground, to sec if he was hurt severely—he had lost his senses completely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see anyone walking with the prosecutor before the rush took place—I can swear he was walking alone, because he crossed from the side of the pavement I was on to the opposite side—the seven or eight young men came from the direction of Whitechapel Church—there</p>

               <p>was one young fellow coming along a little behind me—I heard the prose<lb></lb>cutor say he had lost nothing; but he was so as he could hardly tell whether he had lost anything or not—he said he was all right—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I am a shoemaker—when this took place I had no proper home, but I live now at Clifton Hill—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the night of 19th September, I was in Osborne Street—I saw the prosecutor going towards Church Street, Shoreditch—I was going down to Whitechapel, to obtain a lodging, when I saw seven or eight young men, such as the prisoner—they pounced on the prosecutor, as if they were playing at leapfrog, and then the prisoner, with a few more, knocked him down—I saw the prisoner kneel on his breast—he got up, and left him—the constable took him close by where I was standing; and as regards the prosecutor not being able to give evidence, I believe it was a miracle he came here at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner stopped by the constable—the prisoner was the last one to run away—the constable came up as he was making his way off—there was a lad behind the prosecutor, who came up when he was knocked down, and cried over him—Mr. Matthews was standing close by—I did not see the watch, or the chain—I saw a bit of the chain which was found on the spot afterwards.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was leaving work about seven o'clock last Wednesday, and in Groveend-road saw the prisoner with two deal boards on his back, about one hundred and fifty yards from Hall's house; he said he had brought them from Kilburn, where he had been working for Mr. Pitts, and had come by them honestly - he went on; a person was with me; we followed, and asked where he lived; he said in Boston-street. Dorset-square; I told a watchman, and we followed him - he went to Boston-place instead of Boston-street; we stopped him at the door, and marked the boards - he gave me Pitts' direction; I went, and could find no such person; I returned, and told the watchman; we then went to his house, and took him and the boards; he then said the man he had them of lived in Brownlow-street, Seven-dials. I went there, and found one Pitt.</p>

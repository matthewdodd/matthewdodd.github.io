               <p>(The witnesses on both sides desired to withdraw, except those who are only for character.)</p>
               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Sheppard. And Mr. Rous of council for the prosecution opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; you have heard the indictment opened by my learned friend, and are acquainted with the crime on which the prisoner stands charged. This transaction arises out of a festivity observed by the people called Jews, at a particular period of the year; and the rulers of the synagogue have thought it their duty to bring the case before you for your judgment; it will not be expected from me to aggravate the unfortunate situation of the prisoner, I shall think it my duty only to state the case so fair and so simply as to direct your attention to the evidence on which alone I am sure your judgment will be founded: The Jews have an annual festivity religiously observed on their part, some time in the month of October; the prisoner lives in the neighbourhood, where that festivity creates necessarily some little disorder, he has lived there I believe twenty years, and has been constantly a witness of the return of it. In this festivity some persons unquestionably had exceeded the strict bounds of propriety, squibs and crackers had been thrown, and it seems Mr. Ridout in this last month on the last return of that festivity endeavoured to apprehend some persons who had fired those squibs, in doing so a little scuffle ensued, several fell, and among others Mr. Ridout, they arose however from the ground seemingly without injury, and Mr. Ridout returned to his house and shut the door; some few minutes afterwards he appeared at the window of the room on the first floor, and from thence discharged a gun loaded with shot among the crowd, several were wounded and some fell; and one unfortunate youth of the age of thirteen instantly expired: you will hear the law much more accurately delivered from the learned Judge after you are possessed of the evidence, and therefore can with more correctness apply it; it is however my duty just to observe, that it is not necessary to constitute the crime of murder that there should be a malignity directed against an individual; if a man commits an act from which death may ensue, which from the nature of it marks a wanton disregard of the safety of others, that is equally immoral, and the public safety requires it should be classed in an equal degree of guilt with the premeditated destruction of an individual; I fear it will be difficult for the prisoner to extenuate this case: some expressions will be given in evidence that seemed to shew a deliberate purpose of longer duration than the day; but as these expressions ought not to make any impression upon your mind till you have them in proof, I shall not mention them, but wish you to hear them only from the witnesses.</p>

               <p>I shall not ask you unless I think it necessary any other question, but state yourself what you saw pass on that day? - I was going to synagogue the 7th of October between five and six in the evening and I saw a parcel of boys as usual, setting off squibs and crackers.</p>
               <p>I believe I must desire you will explain that expression as usual? - As they do among our people once a year, that is at the feast of Tabernacles, and I stood there a little time to see them.</p>
               <p>Is this a customary annual sport? - Yes, I was standing in Broad-place, I saw Mr. Ridout come out of his house with two men with him, one had a staff and the other had not, I could not tell whether they were constables or not, I saw Mr. Ridout go and lay hold of a man that had just let off a squib, after he had laid hold of this man he called for these two men to assist him, and a scuffle ensued, and three of them laid on the ground, one of which was Mr. Ridout, I saw the two men get up first, and afterwards Mr. Ridout, I saw him go strait into his house and shut the door hard after him; in three or four minutes after I saw him up one pair of stairs throw up the sash and fire out a fire-arm which appeared to me to be a blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>How was the gun directed? - Towards the middle of Duke's-place Broad-place.</p>
               <p>Were there many people there? - Yes.</p>

               <p>There was a good deal of noise, I take it, by the two men that were down on the ground; you mean the two men that came out of the house? - I cannot say they were, I did not take notice what two men they were, but among the three one of them was Mr. Ridout.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200006"></xptr>Do you remember seeing him before the festival, on the 7th of October? - A great many times before, I have known him these twenty years, and upwards; about a fortnight or three weeks before this affair happened, I happened to go into Mr. Ridout's house for some liquors, the discorse fell out about some holliday, he asked me in Hebrew, what I meant to make Skoke yonck of, that is, we always preserve fruit, a fruit which we never eat till that time comes, it being the new year, to make a bl essing off; I told him, your time is coming on, that you think so troublesome, that is, Simka sacra we call it in Hebrew, it is the Rejoicing of the Lord, in English; I asked him, if he remembered the time that he run after a boy into the Synagogue, with either a sword or cutlass, he said, he was better provided for them now, for he had a piece that would carry a ball or two now nicely; and he would take care some of them should have it among them.</p>
               <p>(Cross-Examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>

               <p>You know how troublesome these returns were to Mr. Ridout? - I know that he thought it so, because he run into the Synagogue after a boy, I left Broad-court, that very afternoon at three, on account of those words; I always take care to be out of the way of any quarrel, I never affronted a neighbour in my life, I knew Mr. Ridout always thought of that night, and had always said, he would put this night aside.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect that there would be a riot? - I do not know what you mean by a riot.</p>
               <p>A tumultuous quantity of people? - There is always a quantity of people assembled in that place, there are three synagogues that have no yard or settled place of meeting, we go about five, about an hour before the people say to their wives, we are going to synagogue, they go to Duke's-place, and stay there till the clock strikes, then they all go to synagogue.</p>
               <p>You appeared before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you there? - I came to Mr. Ridout's, a day or two before, and I told Levy what I had heard, and he told me to appear before the Coroner, I was not present, at the time of this unhappy affair; about three o'clock I came to the top of Duke's-place, and I met Levy there, who is a constable.</p>
               <p>I want to know, how it was that you came to go before the Coroner? - That very night, I knew of it, about half an hour after it happened.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - He is a man that deals in fish.</p>

               <p>Where did you go immediately? - A man came and run out, and said, the report is given, that a boy and two men are killed, upon which we run to Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Where did you go immediately with this man that gave you the intelligence? - I did not see him after he gave the intelligence, I run immediately into Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation with any body before you went to the Coroner? - No, Sir, I did not tell any body to my knowledge, before I came into the room at the Compter, where Mr. Ridout was; I might say before I went up, I heard him say so and so before.</p>
               <p>Did you listen to the report as it was made by any body; and had you much conversation on this melancholy affair, before you were induced to go before the Coroner? - I had not with any body.</p>
               <p>And yet you went before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rous. Who directed you to attend before the Coroner? - I attended entirely on my own account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not you take the constable away with you at that time, when you expected a riot? - I do not tell you I expected a riot or disturbance.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear so before the Coroner? - No, Sir, I said upon Mr. Ridout's words, and seeing him stand at his door, I resolved that I would not be seen in any quarrel whatever.</p>

               <p>Thinking that there would be a disturbance at three o'clock, you desired the constable of Duke's Place, Levy, to go along with you? - I desired him to go along with me, I expected no more disturbance than there was every year, I thought nothing of the constables being there to prevent disturbances, he is the constable of Duke's Place, I was not to order Levy to be there.</p>
               <p>He is the same man that you appeared for last Monday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you observe about the body? - They told me he had been shot, and I observed several small wounds about the body, but they were so small I could not introduce a probe, in the cavity of the breast, on the right side we found a quantity of blood and small shot.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other wounds? - There were several other wounds, but I believe his death was occasioned by that, it occasioned a large effusion of blood which I believe was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>What shot was this? - Such shot as they clean bottles with, these are the same size.</p>
               <p>(Producing some bottle shot.)</p>

               <p>What was the state of his health at that time? - He had several bruises about him, I was desired to call at the Compter to look at him, he had two at the top of his head, and what they call a black eye, a settling of blood under his eye, as if there had been a contusion there, and a pretty considerable one upon his leg by his knee, and a large graze on his shin, and several marks upon his legs, and one particular upon his right leg, which was exceeding tender to the touch.</p>
               <p>Is not he afflicted with the gravel and stone very much? - He is afflicted with a violent pain in his back, whether it is rheumatism or the stone in his kidneys, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Long before this he had complained to you of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then a man in that situation, thrown down and beat, could not lessen that pain I should suppose? - No, it could not, more likely to aggravate it, and I suppose it did, because when I saw him he could not sit upright, I never saw him so bad with it before.</p>

               <p>Did you at that time think there was danger by this multitude of people that were assembled? - I thought there was danger, it was a coffee-house called Tom's coffee-house; they sell wine and brandy.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you thrown down? - No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200010"></xptr> I had my shins kicked, but I got out of the way as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>What was it you said of that wooden house that you named? - That was Hyam Joseph's near the pump, where they threw the serpents, that was a wood front, my back was towards Mr. Ridouts, that house was on the left hand side of Mr. Ridout's, near the synagogue.</p>
               <p>Jury. The Jury would be very glad to know after Mr. Ridout got up in the situation you describe him to be in, whether they assaulted his house after? - I never looked, my back was towards it.</p>
               <p>How long was you there after? - A very little while, a great many Jews persuaded me to go away for fear I should get an accident, they begged of me and took me by the arm and led me away, they behaved very well to me.</p>
               <p>- SAUNDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable, I remember Mr. Chapman's application to me, to take my long staff and go to this place, I went there, there were some hundred in the place, throwing squibs and crackers about, some of them hitting Mr. Ridout's house, then the Gentleman you examined last, says to me, the first man we see throw one, we will lay hold of him, immediately one was thrown very near us, we laid hold of the man, and several came to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Were they men or boys? - All men as it appeared in the front of them; we knew a man that threw a squib, and we let him go, then we went towards Mr. Ridout's house, and the mob followed us, and hissed us as we went along, and hooted; then Mr. Ridout spoke to us, he told us he would assist us, if we would lay hold of another, he came out and immediately another was thrown by another man about thirty years of age, a serpent was thrown, and we laid hold of him directly, a great number got round us to rescue him from us, in the skirmish they got Mr. Ridout down, there were several at the top of him I could not discern to see whether they struck him or not, and he had several marks on the legs as if he was kicked, when I helped him up, I fell down atop of the others, Mr. Ridout was down in the kennel.</p>
               <p>How long might he continue in this situation? - I believe about two minutes, and several were upon him.</p>
               <p>How long did you make observation of Mr. Ridout? - I helped him up, he told me he was almost killed, and he walked lame, they dragged him along a foot or two when he was down.</p>
               <p>Where did he go to? - Towards his own house, and several followed him immediately.</p>
               <p>In what manner did they follow him? - They were talking very loud, and looked very vicious at him, but what they said, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were those people that followed him those that had him down in the kennel? - I cannot say, they followed him close up to the door, then he got into his house, and I heard the door shut very sharp, but the mob surrounded me that I could not follow Mr. Ridout.</p>
               <p>Were the numbers at this time diminished or increased? - They seemed rather to increase.</p>
               <p>Were serpents and crackers thrown at this time? - I did not see any thrown I think after that.</p>
               <p>What became of you; how did you escape? - When I found that Mr. Ridout had got to his own house, and I had lost Mr. Chapman, I was for getting away, but I could not, the mob was so thick, and for a couple of minutes I saw Mr. Ridout again, before ever the alarm of the piece was. When I lifted him up, he told me that he believed he was robbed, for his pockets were turned inside out.</p>

(Producing them.) I shut the door with the assistance of Mr. Ridout; when he came in doors, they broke two panes of glass in the glass door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. You was examined before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. We have a number of other witnesses to prove the throwing the squibs at Mr. Ridout's house, but as that has been proved by two or three witnesses, we will not trouble the Court with any more on that h ead.</p>

               <p>MRS. CHASEN. On the 24th of October last, at about a quarter past ten at night, I sent my servant girl into my bed room; as soon as she unlocked my bed room door, she saw two drawers open, and likewise one of the front windows open, and the shutters, which at nine o'clock had been shut; I had seen them shut at nine o'clock. She immediately came down, and told me that my drawers were open. I was still in the bar, and I heard some one jump from the bed room window into the street; I should think that is a height of nineteen feet. I ran up stairs, and saw the drawers as the girl told me, and likewise the window. The property in the indictment was missing. The drawers had been opened apparently by a chissel. I had seen all the articles that very afternoon about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>- FLETCHER. On the night of the 24th of October, about twenty minutes after ten, I was walking along <placeName id="t18161030-142-crimeloc700">Russel-street, Bloomsbury</placeName>

            . I remember the prisoner being brought to the watchhouse on the 24th of October;</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts desired that I would go and search the prisoner, and I did so, and found on him a pair of silver salts, a box with phosphorous, two pieces of small wax candle about the length of my middle finger, a small chisel, and one pound thirteen shillings in bank tokens. The prisoner several times attempted to put his hand to his pocket where the pistol was. I afterwards saw the pistol, and it had two balls in it, and was loaded to within half an inch of the muzzle; the hammer however was down, so that the powder had fallen out of the pan.</p>

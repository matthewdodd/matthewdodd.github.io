               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are quite sure your mother did not know you were going to buy them? A. No; they were kept in the stable of the man I bought them of: I do not know what I was to pay for the keep - I had once mentioned to my mother that I wanted to buy the donkey and cart; she said, "Puff, puff, I don't want you to get such a thing - I want you to go to a trade;" I bought it of Anderson, in Belton - street.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Belton-street, Longacre, and am a costermonger. In December last, I sold a donkey and cart to Aaron, by his mother's desire; the prisoner was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the mother desire you to sell it? A. About a month, or five weeks before that, she met me in Crown-street; the boy said, "That's the donkey and cart;" she said to me "Is this the donkey and cart you want to sell?" I said Yes; she asked what I wanted for it - I said, 3l.: she said Pooh, she would give no 3l. - I said, then she need not alarm herself about it, I could keep them, and she could keep her money; she went away about fifty yards - the boy then came back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Say you will take 2l. 10s. for it, and mother says she will have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150088"></xptr>it:" I said, "No, your mother shall not have it for less than 2l. 12s.;" he said he would give me the 2s. out of his own pocket, and I could give him a receipt for 50s.: that he would come for it at night, and he accordingly came at night, and said his mother and aunt wanted to see it in Piccadilly- I sent my servant for some Duke's groom to look at it, to see if it was worth the money: they brought it back, and said it would be bought.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take 2l. 7s. for it? A. Why I was distressed; I did not sent to say he should have it for that; when he bought it, he brought it back to my stables two nights, and after that took it to Hopkins-street; he was to pay me 1s. 6d. a week for keeping it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give this account before the Magistrate? A. Yes, part of it; the Magistrate would not hear the whole; I did not know the prisoner before, and am no friend of his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to represent that you wanted to tell the Magistrate all this, and he would not hear it? A. Yes; he said he did not want to hear it all - that I must find bail.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS, Q.Was he to keep it for you? A. It was to stand in his stable - he said he would keep it two or three days for me; I do not recollect that I was to pay him: for the keep, but he said the day after that I was to pay him: a boy who worked for him got me a stable in Howard-street, which I was to pay half a crown a week for: I was to give Anderson 1s. 6d. for the stable alone - I did not take it away one night before I bought it: his boy asked me to say I was going to shew it to my aunt, because he wanted to shew it to another boy, and I did so.</p>

            . I heard nothing said about 1s. 6d. a week for keeping the donkey - I did not know Anderson before: I did not hear the Magistrate stop him for giving his evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day previous to the robbery, Sullivan was in my company all day; I can prove I never saw the boy - when he says he met me, I was going to the Dispensary, when he came up and asked me to pawn the clothes; I asked whose they were: he said he was sent to pawn them; I went in, and gave him all the money - he insisted on my having some drink: I went and had some rum, and then did not know what I was about - he made me go to the play: I said I had no money, and he lent me three half-crowns; I persuaded him all I could to go home, but could not, as he said he was going to buy a donkey in the morning; and being afraid he would be robbed, I remained with him all night, and in the morning went with him to buy the donkey.</p>

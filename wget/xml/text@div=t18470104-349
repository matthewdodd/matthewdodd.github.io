                  </hi> I live at 31, George-yard, Shoreditch—I deal in lace and haberdashery. On 16th Dec. I attended Romford-market—I packed up the articles I had not sold in a basket, wrapped in two green covers and a cloth—the outside wrapper was corded—I put it into Mrs. Calcraft's cart, which has framework round it—I drove the cart to London—Mrs. Calcraft and Mrs. Lowe were in the cart, and the tarpauling which covered the basket and other goods came on the seat they sat on—they sat on the tarpauling, and I sat on the other end of it—I stopped near Whitechapel church to take some things out of the cart, and then saw the basket safe—this was on the other side of the turnpike by Whitechapel church—I stopped about five minutes after in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, to take out some things—on arriving at Worship-street I missed The basket—I afterwards saw the goods at Bishopsgate-street station—the Basket contained the articles named in the indictment—they are worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am a straw bonnet-maker, and live in Bunhill-row. On 16th Dec. I returned from Romford market in my cart with Maurice and Mrs. Lowe—I saw Maurice's bundle put in—I felt it under the tarpauling just On the other side of Whitechapel church—I sat on the tarpauling, it came Directly over the seat which I sat on—I removed from it in Brick-lane to get a bundle out—I did not get out of the cart, I shifted my place—Mrs. Lowe did not get out, but the horse was very fidgety, and I think during that time the basket must have been got out—there was a large basket against it—the tail-board was shut up even with the cart, nothing could drop out—the large basket was as much as two men could lift.</p>

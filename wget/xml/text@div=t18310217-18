I said, "Yes, I have had one stolen from me;" he said he did not think it belonged to me or he would have given it to me - he said it was in the name of Deane, not Dee - I had seen it safe on the Saturday evening, after the robbery, in a mustard-pot on the mantel-piece, and on the Sunday I suppose it was taken - on Sunday, the 7th of February, I went to the prisoner's house and I saw my bracelets were made into a necklace, and were round his child's neck - I had not missed them; I had not seen them for a week before, but he said he had taken them from the drawer on the Sunday - they had been in the front room; I told the Police-officer to come to my house on the Monday - the prisoner was not in my house then; he was taken in Finsbury-market - I pointed him out: he walked away, and I sent the officer after him -I went to his house with Inggall that Monday evening - I found there this child's watch, which was part of the property lost on the Saturday night, from the box, from which the dresses were taken - I cannot tell the exact value of all we lost; the dresses were worth 2l.; the officer took the bracelets off the child - we have found no more of the property.</p>

             - we keep a baker's shop at the corner of Clifton-street, Finsbury. I know the prisoner as a customer - he came to our shop on the 29th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - he left a basket containing some clean clothes; he said, "Will you let me leave this here, for the people it is for are not at home, and I will call again;" he came again between nine and ten o'clock with his wife and child, and they took away their basket - they bought three hoaves and half a quartern of flour: they left the bread and flour, and he called again in about ten minutes for them.</p>

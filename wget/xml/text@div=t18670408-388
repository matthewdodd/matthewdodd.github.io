                  </hi> (32 <hi rend="italic">D</hi>). On 22nd February, about eleven o'clock p.m., I saw a Hansom cab standing without a driver outside the Western Stores—the prisoner came out while I was making inquiries, and I asked him if he was the driver; he said, "Yes"—I asked him where his metal ticket was—he said that he had none, as he was not out for a job—I asked him if the cab was his—he said, "Yes"—I asked him who he was driving for—he said, "Mr. Buscall"—he was not sober.</p>

               <p>—I met him at the cattle market that day—I bought two horses and showed them to him—I do not recollect asking his opinion on them—I had some drink with him—I asked him to help the other man to trail the cart and harness home, and I started him and walked home—I got home about seven, and the cart and harness were there—I saw him again that evening—I put one of the new horses into the cab—I did not drive four in it to a public-house, because it is a Hansom—I drove it to Guildford Street—Cook is one who was in it—I do not think the prisoner was in it—I think he was standing on the spring, he went with me—I then went into a public-house about eight o'clock, but was not there above fire minutes, and he drove the horse and cab away from there without asking me any<lb></lb>thing about it—I did not tell him to drive the horse up and down to keep him warm—while I was drinking he drove the cab away without my knowing anything about it—when I drove that Hansom cab there were four of us, with myself, in and upon it; one was on the springs, but I cannot say who, and two were inside—I have not told the prisoner's friends or mother that I should not object to take him into my employ again—I was not drunk, nor was he—he did not go inside the bar—I do not know a Mr. Flowers—I did say in the Court, when I first went, that I did not think he took it to steal it.</p>

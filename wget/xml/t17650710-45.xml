            . I live with Mr. Jervis in Fetter-lane: I took in two copper sauce-pans of the prisoner at the bar, on the 27th of May, between nine and ten in the morning, both within a quarter of an hour of one another.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been Apprentice?</p>
               <p>Chore. I have been apprentice fifteen months: I have known her ever since I have been apprentice, and my master says he has known her two years; she has brought things at several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon her to be a poor woman?</p>
               <p>Chore. I always did.</p>
               <p>(The goods produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Court. How could you think such a poor woman should be possessed of such sauce-pans as these? You are a young man, and I would advise you for your good, as you are coming into the world; you must think these things could no more belong to her, than a piece of plate. Tell your master to be more careful, or bad will be the consequence.</p>

I pawned one stew-pan and one sauce pan for her: when they took me up, they would not give me leave to stay to look for her; and they made such an oration in the neighbourhood, that the woman has got out of the way.</p>

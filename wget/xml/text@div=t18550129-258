                  </hi>. I keep a public house, No. 28, Little Moor-fields. On 29th Dec. the prisoner came, with another man, about 5 o'clock—they asked for half a quartern of rum—the prisoner gave me a good sovereign of William the Fourth—the other man said, "I have got coppers; return the sovereign to my friend"—I gave it back to the prisoner—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290025"></xptr>
               <p>was then some shuffling between them, and the prisoner said, "Never mind about the coppers; take it out of this sovereign," throwing down a sovereign of Queen Victoria—I saw immediately that it was bad—I said, "I must keep this, and I shall lock you up"—I sent My potman for a policeman, and put the sovereign on a shelf—the prisoner and the other man went out, and met a third man, dressed like a carman, but I think he was a companion of theirs—I went after them, and they returned into the house—the prisoner desired to see the sovereign—I showed it him at a distance—the prisoner then went out, leaving the other two men at the bar—I followed the prisoner fifty or sixty yards, met a policeman, and gave him in charge—I gave the sovereign to the policeman—the other man escaped during my absence.</p>

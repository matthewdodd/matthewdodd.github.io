I am one of the chief clerks at the Post-office—the prisoner was one of the letter-carriers there—he was on duty on 6th August—letters sent from Paris on the afternoon of the 5th would arrive at the General Post-office about half-past 6 the following morning—they would be sorted about 7, or just before 7—about 5 o'clock that afternoon I had occa<lb></lb>sion to speak to the prisoner on another matter, and I asked him if he had anything at home belonging to the Office—he replied, "No, nothing that I know of"—I sent Smee and Rumbold, the officers, to search—they brought back this letter; it was in the same state as now with these documents in it, and the envelope open at the end—I said to the prisoner, "That letter has been found at your house by the police-officers, how do you account for that?"—he replied, "Oh yes; it was given to me by a labouring man, who said he picked it up in Wilson-street; he looked like a bricklayer's labourer"—I said "When?"—he replied, "About twenty minutes past 10"—I said, "It is open"—he said, "It is just in the very same state that I received it"—he was asked whether he took the name and address of the man—he said, "No, 1 did not; I am sorry that I did not, for I thought I might get into some trouble about it"—the letter bears the London post-mark of the 6th, and the Paris post-mark of the 5th—the prisoner's district is Wilson-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer attached to the Post-office—in consequence of instructions, I watched the sorting of letters by the prisoner and Panton on the morning of 6th August—they began about ten minutes before 9—the sorting-table is a long table with separate places for each sorter—after they had been sorting about five minutes, Panton left the table, leaving the prisoner there—the prisoner's back was then to the table—as soon as Panton was gone, he turned round, and took two or three letters from Panton's table, and took them to his own seat—I saw him go out of the office on his delivery about 10 o'clock—in consequence of instructions that afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, 61, Cumberland-street, Hackney-road, soon after 5 o'clock—I searched the back-room, a bed-room—the prisoner's wife was present—I got up on a chair, and looked on the top of a cupboard, where there were two hat-boxes and a bonnet-box, and underneath the hat-box I found this letter concealed—it was in the same state it is now, open at the end—I took it back to Mr. Gardner, and heard the conversation he has related.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant-inspector of letter-carriers on 6th August last—when the French mail comes in, about half-past 6 in the morning, it would be opened about 7; there would be two sortings—this particular letter would be left till 9 o'clock to be sorted, to go out at 10 for delivery—the letters would be left from half-past 8 on a table opposite my desk in the letter-carriers' office, under my own supervision—the letters are placed on two or three seats for the letter-carriers—there were only two that morning, Panton and the prisoner; they commenced sorting about ten minutes past 9—the prisoner had no right to remove any letters from Panton's table—the table where the prisoner was sorting is not the table the constable alludes to when, he speaks of seeing him remove the letters to his seat; that is where be arranges his own letters for delivery—no letter-carrier sorts his own letters—the City is divided into four sections; A, B, C, and D—these letters were on the table in the A section—there had been a previous sorting in the Inland-office, commencing soon after 7—most of the Paris letters were sent out for delivery at 8·30—these letters were placed in the A section to be sorted into walks, and they are collected by a man who takes them to the seats in the A section, where the letter-carriers arrange their letters—the prisoner and Panton were sorting letters for the A section, but they deliver in B section, in a different part of the City alto<lb></lb>gether—a letter for Ely-place would, in the ordinary course, be among the letters which Panton and the prisoner were sorting—the prisoner would have no right to take from Panton two or three letters, and take them to his own seat; it would be entirely contrary to the regulations—Wilson-street, Finsbury, is in the prisoner's district, Ely-place is not—if he received a letter for Ely-place from any one who had picked it up, it would be his duty to bring it back to the Post-office; it would not be contrary to the regulations to take it borne if he was going home, especially, if, as he said, the letter was open, but it would be his duty to give it up the first time he came to the office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the first of June, I believe it was about eleven at night, I was robbed in <placeName id="t17840915-21-crimeloc103">Pall-Mall</placeName>

               <p>Court. Had your Lordship any opportunity of taking notice of the persons of any of these robbers? - I had of one.</p>
               <p>Please to look at the prisoner, do you know any thing of him? - Yes, my Lord, I am very confident that is the man that robbed me of my watch.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery had you an opportunity of seeing them? - I called after them, the opera was not over, and some of the chairman knowing me, as I turned the corner of that lane said, do not go down that lane, if you do you will be murdered; they all got through the chairmen and escaped; I then thought it was a very proper step to go immediately and write a description of the robbers to Sir Sampson Wright, which I did immediately after being robbed, as he had something very remarkable about him, this particular man had, that was the only man that I knew; he was apprehended, I had a letter from Sir Sampson Wright, telling me he was confident that the man that robbed me was in custody by my description of him, and begging that I would attend the next morning in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did your Lordship attend the next morning? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - I did.</p>
               <p>When you saw him, had you any recollection of him? - I had.</p>
               <p>Please to look at him, and see whether you are confident or not he is the man? - I am very confident, it was a full moon, or within a day of it; and, added to that, it was immediately under a lamp, and having been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150059"></xptr> robbed before, within a short time, of another watch, I particularly remarked the man; I marked his hair very particularly.</p>
               <p>Does your Lordship take this man to be one of them that passed you, or that came up behind you? - No, my Lord, I think he was not one of the first, he was, I believe, on my right-hand.</p>
               <p>In that manner, what opportunity had your Lordship to look at him, or to see him? - It was, as I say, either a full moon, or within a day of it, the clearest night I ever saw, and there was a lamp or two immediately over him.</p>
               <p>Did they run off before you, or behind you? - They ran off before me, and I turned down Market-lane.</p>
               <p>Have you found your watch? - No, I was informed that if I applied in a particular manner I should obtain it; but as for the watch it is very immaterial to me, what I want to have is to have the people convicted if possible, therefore I was determined to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Was it explained to you what that particular manner was? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. This was not one of the people that passed you at first, my Lord? - No, I think not, I am pretty sure it was not, they were lower.</p>
               <p>They rushed by you at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did that surprise or alarm your Lordship? - No.</p>
               <p>These two men turned back on your Lordship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was a little alarmed? - Yes, they came very quick behind me, there were a great many coaches, a whole line of them.</p>
               <p>Nothing was said to your Lordship? - I do not recollect one word.</p>
               <p>The person, whoever he was, that snatched the watch from your Lordship's person, you did not see him perhaps before the watch was gone? - He came up to me quite to my breast, he turned round upon me, the other was stooping, he put his hand to my watch and snatched it.</p>
               <p>It was gone in an instant I suppose? - Yes, and the two men.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship's description I believe chiefly was, that he was a tall young man? - Yes, and his hair I described particularly.</p>
               <p>I believe Sir Sampson's assurances that he had got the right person, made your Lordship more positive, thinking Sir Sampson had a knowledge of the man? - I cannot say; I should not have sworn to him if I had not been very confident of recollecting his person, and the description I have given in my letter of his being tall.</p>
               <p>This was about eleven, and the opera was not over, five people were concerned in it, you, my Lord, must have been under some little surprise? - I was under a surprise when they all ran upon me and squeezed me; I think he is a very remarkable figure, and his hair, his heighth, and looks, are remarkable.</p>
               <p>Yes, he is remarkably tall; Sir Sampson Wright's letter had a little effect upon your Lordship? - Only as to my going to him.</p>
               <p>Court. There were two seals, my Lord, were not there? - There were two, one white and one red, set in gold, one was a post-office seal, I was Post-master General of Ireland then; it was a repeating watch.</p>

               <p>Have you been much at home? - I have been in the Guards from my infancy; I have been abroad in another regiment.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You are the father of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Give the Court an account where he was on the evening of the 1st of June? - On Tuesday evening, on the 1st of June, I came home, and my servant maid let me in, about thirty-four or thirty-five minutes after ten in the evening; as soon as I came in, which is my usual method to see that my family are regularly in bed, I asked the maid if my two sons Andrew and George were in bed, she answered me in the affirmative; I took the candle off the table, and opened the closet door, and I saw them both in bed, on the evening of the first of June, on Tuesday evening; then I went up stairs and went to bed, as I am here upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear of his being taken up? - On the 3d, in the evening.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - About eight.</p>
               <p>Did you go before the Justice? - I went to Bow-street to see to extricate him from being taken up, and he was in Covent-garden watch-house in bed.</p>
               <p>Did you attend the examination before the Justice? - I did not, they did not give me liberty to be there; I was there, but it was after Lord Clermont had deposed that he was the person; I came in and spoke to his Lordship; his Lordship recollects me at the examination.</p>
               <p>What way of life have you bred up this young man to? - I kept him constantly employed in one thing or another, reading or writing, and doing any thing that was necessary about the house; I intended him to have been a soldier, to bring him up to the army; I have a great family.</p>
               <p>Did you think of no other employment for him? - I should have done it.</p>
               <p>Did you in fact put him in any way of life except that? - No, my Lord, not at any time as yet.</p>
               <p>What age is he now? - My Lord, he is seventeen, he was born at

               <p>And he has been employed in no other way? - No, my Lord, in no other way; I have another son alive who is a soldier.</p>
               <p>Have you any other that lived to be ten, twelve, or fourteen years old? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever think of putting either of your sons to the business of a plaisterer? - I had an inclination, and he was along with a master, but the master was bed-ridden, and he was not able to take him.</p>
               <p>What was that master's name? - Horax.</p>
               <p>Where did he live? - He lived in St. Martin's-court, I think it is called, by St. Martin's-lane, it goes through the churchyard.</p>

               <p>How long might that be? - About three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Was he so long at Mr. Horax's as three quarters of a year? - Yes, backwards and forwards, he boarded with me during that time, washed and every thing.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention that when I asked you; I asked you very particularly? - Really it is foreign to my idea at present, because it is some time since he quitted it.</p>
               <p>How long is it since? - Better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>How much better? - About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>His master was ill, you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, there is a very material piece of evidence, which I think proper first to mention to your Lordship; there was a young man that very much resembled the prisoner at the bar, that was lately executed for a highway robbery, and he communicated something to Mr. Villette, the Ordinary, concerning this robbery; his name was Edwards, he was lately executed, and it was in his last moments he communicated this, and he died with very great contrition, and with great marks of penitence; he told Mr. Villette he could not die in peace until he had communicated something to him, relative to this very robbery; if your Lordship will please to examine Mr. Villette as to that matter.</p>
               <p>Court. To examine a witness to the declarations of a man attainted, and in the moment of suffering execution, cannot be permitted; that would be carrying it farther than if the man was alive, for he could not give evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. It is the declaration of a dying person.</p>
               <p>Court. But the declaration of a dying person that was not attainted has never been held better than the evidence of the man himself upon oath, although what a man declares under such very solemn circumstances, is presumed to be tantamount to speaking by a solemn appeal to God upon oath: however, the Court incline to go thus far for you; if you have any witnesses to show that a man, nearly resembling in person this prisoner, was executed, within the time, that may make it in any degree probable that he may be the man, you may examine to that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. My notion of law is this; as to the dying declarations of an innocent person, where a man says, I know such a thing, for my father in his last moments declared so, that seems to be equivalent to the living witness; but not in the case of a man that would be incompetent to give evidence if alive: I am, therefore, clearly of opinion with my brother Eyre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, a pardon would have restored him to his former competency.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard the whole of this evidence; and with respect to the proposal of the prisoner's Counsel, to examine some witnesses to prove that a young man, very nearly resembling the prisoner in figure, stature and so on, had suffered very lately for crimes of this nature, and that he had acknowledged that he was guilty of this particular fact, it could not, consistent with the rules of evidence, which are rules of justice, be permitted to examine to the declarations of a person under such circumstances: but, they were told, that they might examine witnesses to prove that a person, nearly resembling the prisoner in figure and stature, had suffered for crimes of this nature, and which might be a circumstance in a doubtful case, in favour of the prisoner, to meet the positive testimony of Lord Clermont; but they have not ventured to examine any witnesses to establish that fact, of the similitude of the persons; therefore, that must be all laid out of the case: and it seems by their not calling any witnesses to that matter, as if it was to have rested not upon the similitude, but upon the declaration itself; and we have had experience enough to know, that not much credit is due to the declarations, that have been lately made at least, even under those circumstances. This case stands merely upon the recollection of the witness the Earl of Clermont, and in a recollection of that kind, to be sure the honest man may possibly be deceived, because there may be two persons which nearly resemble each other, and one may be accused of a fact, which the other has committed; and I wish upon the evidence of the alibi, you had been relieved from any other consideration, but whether you believed that evidence or not; but in this particular case it so happens, that they run the time so near to the time of the robbery, that if it should be clear that the young man was in bed, then it will depend upon the circumstance, whether Lord Clermont is right in his idea of the time, the fact was committed before the Opera broke up, my Lord Clermont supposes about eleven: now when the watchman went half past ten, is not a thing quite certain, or whether the father's watch went right, who says, he came in at thirty-four minutes past ten, (and by the way, it is a singular circumstance for him to note at the time) one thing you have to consider, is in the first place, whether you believe the fact of his being at home, notwithstanding the contradictions of the witnesses; if you think the contradictions may be accounted for, without imputing them to bad motives, and a design to come here to speak that which is not true; and if you in consequence give credit to these witnesses, on the part of the prisoner, that the fact was as they have sworn, then one difficulty is got over: or if you think it is a matter seriously doubtful, if you think in your own minds, that Lord Clermont may be mistaken, in that case you will acquit the prisoner: the whole case is before you, and you will judge of it as favourably as you can, remembering on the one hand, that these kind of street robberies should not go unpunished, and on the other, that an innocent man should not suffer, because the party who is robbed, thinks he is quite sure of the person of the prisoner; as that is certainly a fact, that is liable to be mistaken by the honestest and best intentioned men in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope for the mercy of the Court, I am a young man of seventeen.</p>

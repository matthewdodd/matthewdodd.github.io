I returned to my room a little after four o'clock, and found the door open - it had been opened with my own key, which I had put on a shelf on the landing-place. I found my boxes open, they were shut when I left the room. I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of them; they were worth 23 s. I found them the same day, with the prisoner in custody. She was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            , he rents the house, which is in the liberty of the Rolls, Attridge lodges with us - the prisoner is quite a stranger. On the 22d January I came home at half-past two o'clock, and did not go out after - I am sure I came home as early as that. About twenty minutes after three o'clock I saw the prisoner come into the house, and go up stairs - I have other lodgers. In about twenty minutes she came down and went out. As she passed the parlour window I saw she had a large bundle in her lap, and a hat-box in her hand - she brought nothing in. I suspected her, and gave the alarm - my street-door was open. I described her to Haston, and we both went after her. She was taken at the corner of New-street, Shoe-lane, with the property; she was brought back, and the prosecutrix claimed it. I asked her what she had done with the hat-box which was in her hand? she said she had none.</p>

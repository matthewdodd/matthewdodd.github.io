                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper at the East India Docks. The prisoner was acting as assistant foreman—he is one of those who are not searched—In No. 6 floor there are several chests of indigo—on the 28th of October last, they were re-weighed by order of the broker, having been sold—they were afterwards nailed down, in the early part of November—there was no occasion after that to take samples from them—the prisoner took samples frequently, when I gave him an order—I went hourly into the warehouse, and on the 3rd of December, I tried one of these chests—I found the lid was loose—I tried four others, and found them all open—I had seen them nailed down by George Blair, early in November—I had given no orders for them to be opened—I ordered them to be nailed down instantly—on the Saturday I had them weighed, and missed 87lbs. of indigo, worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—I asked the prisoner if he knew how they came open, and observed that there had been a great plunderer—he said he know nothing about it—I said he ought to know—nothing further passed that day—persons are not allowed to take from one chest to make up another—no one has any business to put indigo into his pockets—In consequence of what took place, I desired the prisoner's coat to be brought first on As—Thursday, and again on Monday, into the presence of Captain Drew and the head warehouse-man—there was some small indigo in both pockets, and a memorandum-book, covered with indigo—on the Monday morning I was going to the Docks, and was accosted by the prisoner—I said to him, "Your conduct this morning will be strictly investigated, I have several</p>

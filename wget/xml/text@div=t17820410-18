               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>It was a very trifling time after the robbery when I got to the watchman, I saw one of them coming through the posts soon after, and I said this is one of them.</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners was it? - The one in the green coat, Hutton, he was just coming out of the gate, I said here is one of them, and the watchman took hold of him, Bailey was close behind him, and the other watchman said, there is the other, he run a few yards, about ten, the watchman after him, I jumped over the post at the time, and said, knock him down, I and one of the watchmen pursued him, he went a few yards; he stopped, the watchman took hold of him and I assisted; I had never seen either of these men before, I walked very fast, I suppose it was not ten minutes past eight, it was not moon-light, neither was it dark, I had perfect light enough to distinguish any person, likewise gold from silver, if I took it out; I suppose they might be with me a minute before they blinded my eyes, I never had my eye from the man with his hair lashing about his shoulders, they are in the same dress, I am as clear of them as can be; the other man never came near me, I never was so certain of any thing in my life as Hutton with his striped waistcoat, the watchman had hold of Bailey in the road when he dropped my stick, a few yards from where I took him; I did not see him drop it, the stick is in court, I said, the stick if it is mine has a notch in it, a yard from the end, it is a holly stick, I have had it several years, I am a cornet in the horse guards, I could have brought the man that made the notch in the stick; the stick was picked up by the watchman who has had it in his care ever since, we found the book and handkerchief, my handkerchief was white and purple border, marked J. D. after we got out of the gate we got a lanthorn from the quarter master of the light horse, it was just coming through the posts the handkerchief was found.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner Hutton. I should be glad to know how he described us to the watchman before we came up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I gave no description of them; it was within half a minute after I got to the gate they came up, I had not time, I was out of breath much, and could scarce speak, I suppose it is three quarters of a mile from the place, it was so light I could distinguish them very well.</p>
               <p>How long were we out of his sight before we were taken up, as he said before the justice he had stopped two men before he stopped us, and let them go again? - The watchman stopped one man that I spoke of, and I said I believed it was not him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after the robbery before you got up to the gate? - I believe it was about nine o'clock when I got to the gate, I asked the watchman as we come along, to the best of my thinking it had struck nine.</p>
               <p>How long time might be taken up before you got to the gate, and how long after you was robbed? - It was about twenty minutes past eight when I was stopped by them, and some little time after I got over the wall and ran pretty fast, the robbery might be about half an hour before I got up to the gate, they were taken about nine.</p>
               <p>From Hutton. I should be glad to know how he knows my voice?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I have no knowledge of their voices, I saw them when they spoke to me, I have no recollection of their voices.</p>
               <p>You did not know them before? - No.</p>
               <p>From Bailey. When we were searched before he left us, whether we had any money or handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. There was none of my money found upon them, there was one remarkable thing, a Scotoh halfpenny, but that I will not swear to, there was a duplicate or two found upon them.</p>
               <p>From Bailey. Ask him, how long he could suppose the prisoner that robbed him, was going from the place where he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100030"></xptr> robbed, to the place where we were taken?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I was twenty minutes going from Kensington church, I walked prodigious fast.</p>
               <p>Court. The people who robbed you, if they had walked quick, might they have got out of Kensington gate before you got to it? - They might.</p>
               <p>There was time enough for them to have got out, if they walked as fast as you did? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I had hold of him by the collar, I said he has just now dropped a stick, the gentleman took it up, and said, this is my stick.</p>
               <p>Did he describe any marks upon the stick? - Yes; he said there was a mark in it about a yard from the bottom, (the stick was then produced in court).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Dent. Is that your stick? - Yes; this is the same stick, they cut the bark at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Hollywell. I asked Mr. Dent to go back, as probably we might find the things lost, we got a candle and lanthorn, and the first thing we found was the book, close by where they were taken, and a few steps farther there lay the handkerchief, here is the book and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent deposed it was his, and marked I. D. said he had the stick almost three years, and that a light horseman wrote his name on the book at the justice's to know it again, the stick was cut to measure a hundred yards, as there had been a race in the Park, it was cut to measure a yard.</p>
               <p>The Jury desired to look at the stick, and one of them measured it by a rule, and said it was a yard from the bottom to the notch.</p>

The day this affair happened I was going to Kensington, I saw this young man in the morning, he went home to dine in the city where he lodged; I promised to meet him in the afternoon, which I did, at the upper end of Bond-street I told him I was going to Kensington to call upon a gentleman for some cloaths; going along Oxford-street we got into Grosvenor gate, and went across, that was about eight o'clock; I heard some people rustling in the grass, two or three, I said here is some people coming, we had better go and see what it is, no, says he, come along, we did, I was stopped coming through the gate, I said, take care what you do; as to running away I had no power to run, it was impossible, they took hold of me; if I had been guilty of any thing of the kind I should not have come that way; I expected a witness here, my attorney was here last night.</p>

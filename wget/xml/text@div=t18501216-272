I am clerk to Mr. John Cassell, the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Standard of Freedom,</hi> 319, Strand—there is a private entrance into Angel-court—on the evening of 11th Dec. the last witness came to me, and in consequence of what she said I went to Mr. Mitchell who works in the office—in consequence of what he said I went to a house in Water-lane—I went into the back room of a shop, where I saw the two prisoners, and a ream of paper on one of the counters untied—the prisoners seemed to be speaking, and Tant said to Walters, "I told you I would have nothing at all to do with it"—Walters was asked by Mr. Mitchell what he did it for—he said he was very sorry for it—I went out to fetch the overseer, and met a constable in the Strand, and returned with him—I then found the paper on the pavement outside the shop—the policeman went into the room, and we went in after him—the room was in darkness—I got a light, and we then found Tant in the room—we took the paper to the station—as we were going, I saw Walker standing at the door—we told him he must go with us—he said he would—he then made a run—he was pursued, and taken back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John-street, Islington. I am overseer at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Standard of Freedom.</hi> On the evening of 11th Dec., Mr. Green made a communication to me, and I went to Water-lane—I saw a ream of paper outside the house, and inside was a quantity, apparently about two reams—the room was dark—a light was brought, and there was Tant—considerable surprise was expressed that another party was not there—I had taken a policeman with me—when we came out, the paper was placed in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we had found about two reams in the shop, and it exactly corresponded with what we had seen outside—it was white paper, and is technically called double double crown, a peculiarly large kind of paper—it is used very extensively by Mr. Cassell—it was regu<lb></lb>larly made for him—very few printers use it, it being very large they must have machinery purposely for it—when I left the house in Water-lane, I proceeded to Mr. Cassell's to put on another coat to go to Bow-street, and at the door of the <hi rend="italic">Economist</hi>-office, which is three or four doors from Mr. Cassell's, I saw Walters standing—I told him he must proceed with us—he went part of the way, and then ran down a court—he was pursued and taken—I had some conversation with Tant at the station with reference to the two reams of paper found in the shop, not the ream that Walters was seen with, which was outside the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who had charge of Mr. Cassell's paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was placed in the warehouse—I cannot say that it was in anybody's spe<lb></lb>cific charge—Mr. Mitchell, the manager of the machine-room, generally comes and takes it from the warehouse—he would put an account in a book of what he took—I cannot tell how many reams of this double double crown were on the premises, without taking stock.</p>

On the 6th of October the prisoner was brought to my house, by a man named Smith, to buy my mare - he offered me a 10 l. note for it; he agreed to give me 11 l. for it if I would grant him three days trial; he said it was for his father, who lived at Whitford, near Ware, in Hertfordshire. I agreed to let him have three days trial if he would let me have 11 l. He requested me to lend him the bridle and saddle, which he was to return in three days. When I expected the money he gave me a bill for 20 l.; I expressed a doubt about it, upon which he referred me to Mr. Kell, who lived a few doors off. My stable is contiguous to the house. I called out of the window to the servant to put on the saddle and bridle, and told the prisoner to go round to the stable; in the intermediate time I went to Mr. Kell to make inquiry about the bill, which was not satisfactory; on my return I found the prisoner gone with the horse, saddle, and bridle. I gave him no authority whatever to take it away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say you was going to inquire about the bill - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did you know Smith - A. No; he had called two or three times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You ordered the servant to saddle and bridle it, and told the prisoner to go round to the stable - A. Yes; intending it to be ready.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had got the money for the bill, you would have been content to part with the horse - A. I was aware I could not get the money, the bill was not endorsed. I found that out afterwards. I was not gone above three minutes to Mr. Kell's. I intended when I returned, to tell the prisoner whether I would take the bill or not.</p>
               <p>Q. On his giving you the bill, you told the servant to saddle the mare, and told the prisoner to go round to the stable - A. I did. The bill was due on the 20th of November, I did not present it - the money was offered to me before it was due, but after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When was he apprehended - A. Near a month after - he never called for the change. I met him in the Old Bailey, and asked him if his name was not Mason - he said it was. I had an officer with me, and gave him in charge for felony. He said,</p>
               <p>"Felony! what felony?" and asked who I was. I said you remember having a horse of me, I live in the Strand. He said he remembered buying it. I told him he would find it something besides buying. My saddle and bridle were sent to me after his apprehension. I have since seen the mare.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Starkie. My master ordered me to saddle the mare, he gave no other orders. The prisoner came into the stable, and girted it on; he said he had agreed that he should have it, and that it was for his father; that he made no doubt but it would suit, and if it did, when he returned to settle for her he would give me 5 s. He rode off with it. I saw it again last Saturday in possession of Moore; and am certain it is master's by a mark on the right thigh.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You let him take it out of the stable - A. Yes, from what he said to me - he said he had agreed to buy it. I should not have let him have it if my master had not ordered me to saddle it, by that I thought it was all correct.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Clare-market. About six weeks or two months ago I bought a bay mare of the prisoner, for 6 l., it had No. 14 marked on the right side of the thigh - I thought it had been branded. I sold her three days after for ten guineas and a half, at Dixon's Repository. She was in harness when the prisoner brought her to me.</p>

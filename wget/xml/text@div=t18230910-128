            . On the 3d of July, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Barbican, and saw the prisoner and another with him go to Brown's shop. When the man crossed the shop with the shutters the prisoner followed him in, and came out with a roll of cloth, and ran down Barbican with it, and I after him, but lost him. I knew him before by sight. I saw him in Bunhill-row several times, and told Van next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him several times; where - A. Walking in Bunhill-row; and always ran for Vann; but he was gone when we came. I thought it was not right to give an alarm till I got an officer. He was about one hundred yards from me. I was by Red Cross-street. It was dark cloth.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live opposite Mr. Brown. I did not see the prisoner go into this shop, but saw him come out with the cloth. He walked towards Smithfield. I had no reason to suspect him; but thought it strange, as the shop was just open, it struck me all might not be right. I fastened my own door, and ran over to White; then ran up Jacob's-well-passage, but saw nothing of him. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. No; I saw his face as he came out. I heard no cry of Stop thief! nor saw the witness pursuing him.</p>

            . I am an officer.

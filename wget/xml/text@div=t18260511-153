The prisoner, whom I had known before, came on the morning of the 6th of May, to fetch a rump and loin of beef, and a lamb, which he had bought the night before; I weighed it and booked it to his employer, Miss Tandy; he took it to the back part of the shop, and I saw him carrying it home in two large trays; I saw that he had got more meat than he should have, and I followed him to the next door but one, when I found he had got a leg and loin of mutton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many men were in the shop? A. Four, besides myself - they are not here; I have got the prisoner's place myself now - I have been there three weeks - the prisoner had dealt at that shop, for Miss Tandy, fifteen or sixteen years; it was not I who helped the tray on his head; I believe some man helped it on his shoulder; there are no legs or loins of mutton in that part of the shop, where he put his tray; he did not say any thing - he returned in a quarter of an hour, and took the remainder of the meat he had bought; he was not then detained, because I was so agitated I could not speak to him; I did not want to let him have the lamb, but he said if Mr. Baker wanted him he knew where to find him - another man was a witness at the office - he is not here - the prisoner was found at home when the officer went for him the second time; I expect to have 10s. a week at Miss Tandy's.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BAKER. I keep this shop. When I came from Newgate-market I told the witness not to let the prisoner weigh his own meat, as I had suspected him for some time - the witness was only there for a short time.</p>

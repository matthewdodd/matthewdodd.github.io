I got rather the worse; we went into this woman's public-house, and had three or four quarts of sixpenny ale. I got very drunk, and the window being up I jumped out, and was nearly drowned. These two men came, and hauled me in. Cohen was there with a chair in his band, which he put at the back of the bar. White was the first man that com<lb></lb>menced the row.</p>

Three other men came, and we had a quart a piece; we walked towards the ferry to go over, but the ferry was fast, and we went and had another quart Lydon got drunk, and jumped into the river. I threw off my coat and waistcoat and jumped in, and caught him by the hand, and Conolly came to my assistance; we saved him, and took his clothes off, and rubbed him. One man was taken. I went to the station that I might tell his wife where he was taken to, and they took me. On the 27th the landlady came forward and swore that I struck the man with a pot On 4th August she swore I struck him with something else, and on 9th August she said it was with a ginger-beer bottle; afterwards she said that it was Lydon who struck him.</p>

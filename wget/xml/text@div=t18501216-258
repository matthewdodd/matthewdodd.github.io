On Tuesday night, 19th Nov., after I had gone to bed, Ash hallooed out that there were thieves in the house—I came down as quickly as I could, and saw three men run into the street—I do not know any of them—I found they had got in at the washhouse window, by taking away a piece of wood which was nailed over it, and the lock of the kitchen door was forced off—I have seen the prisoner about, but know nothing of him.</p>

On Tuesday night, 19th Nov., about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police!" and went to the prosecutor's house, in Sophia-street, and saw Ash in his shirt, and two other persons—in consequence of what he told me, I apprehended the prisoner on Friday morning—he was in bed at his father's house—I told him I wanted him, for breaking into this house—he said he was in bed at the time, and knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and was servant to Mr. Henry Trimble, at the Pier Tavern, at Woolwich—the prisoner is his son, and lived there with his father—on Wednesday, 23rd October, I went to bed about 10.30—the prisoner had gone out and had not returned when I went to bed—about 1 o'clock or 1.30 he came to my bedroom, and knocked very loud, and said "Phoebe, get up, the house is in flames"—I immediately got up, and went to my mistress's bedroom door and rapped very loud, and said "Mrs. Trimble, get up, the house is on fire"—I then went and fetched water—I was afraid to go into the room—it was the next room to where I slept—I knew that by the smoke on the landing coming from the room—I saw the prisoner as soon as I went out of my own room—he was standing at the bedroom door with a lighted candle in his hand—I went down stairs and Miss James and I fetched some water—I did not do anything with the water; Miss James did; I was afraid to go into the room—the prisoner was standing at his mother's bedroom door then—Miss James took the water into the room, and I stood on the landing—Mr. Trimble came up then, and looked at it, and then we called Mr. Baggott in, and he came up, and then a policeman came in and they fetched some more water—I went into Mrs. Trimble's bedroom—the policeman put the fire out, and then the prisoner and the police went down into the kitchen—I went down—they stood talking, and then fetched some more policemen in—he was then taken into custody—I went to bed again about 4.20; about 5 o'clock I heard something like crackling and burning—I immediately got up, and went down to my mistress's bed-room—Mrs. Trimble and her granddaughter put that out—I went into the room—the partition was on fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was three hours after the prisoner had been taken away—I saw where the partition was burning—the second fire was about a yard from where the bedclothes, which had been burning, were on the ground—at the time of the first fire the prisoner, his mother, and father, and Miss James, and I were in the house—no one else—the room where he was sleeping was a front room, visible from the street—it was at the top of the house—the fire was seen from the outside—there are back rooms to the house—there was a room down stairs full of wood and combustible matter—I was on perfectly good terms with the prisoner—if the fire had spread without him alarming me I should probably have been the first person burnt—there were two very large canfuls and two large jugfuls of water taken in to put the fire out—the first fire was limited to his own bedclothes—I did not take much notice, but I think the prisoner was muddled with drink—I did not see a pipe full of tobacco in his room when I went in the second time—I did not notice a candle in the room which had been lighted—there appeared to be some paper torn away from the partition—I had been in the house five weeks—I noticed the paper torn in his room where the second fire was when I first went to live in the house—I said that before the Magistrate and it is true.</p>

I am single and am the granddaughter of Mrs. Trimble—I sleep with her—on the night of 23rd October I was aroused by the servant—I got up and ran up stairs to my uncle's, that is the prisoner's, room—I found the room full of smoke, it nearly suffocated me for a moment or two—I saw the things heaped up on the bed, they were smouldering but not in flames—they were all together in the centre of the bed, not spread out as they ought to have been—they appeared to be gathered up in a heap—I went and got some water immediately—the prisoner was standing outside the room with a candle in his hand, and something on his arm—he did nothing—he did not move or make any attempt to put the fire out—I threw some water on, but when I found it blazed the more I ran down to get help—I saw a man outside the house and asked him to get a police<lb></lb>man—the man came in afterwards and the police afterwards—I was present when the prisoner was taken into custody—my grandpapa went up to the police-station "to give the charge—it must have been after 4 o'clock that we were aroused again by the servant telling us the house was on fire again—we both rushed up stairs into the same room and I found the partition smouldering, red hot—I can't say there was smoke—it was embering, not in flames at all—it had smouldered away—it was very damp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master lighterman, and live at East Greenwich—on 23rd October I was passing Mr. Trimble's house, between I and 2 o'clock—I smelt fire before I came to the house—I looked about some little time, and saw smoke pouring from the window at the top—I heard voices inside—I looked about for a constable—I did not see any one at that time—I called out; some one answered me from the front window—I said "Your house is on fire;" they said "Yes, will you come in and put it out?"—I said "If you go up stairs you can put it out yourself"—I was there about twenty minutes before I got in, and then I went in with a policeman, named Phillips—I went up stairs, and found the bed was all on fire and the room full of smoke—the constable tried to enter, but in hastening up stairs I suppose he was out of breath, and he had to come out again—I tried also to enter the room and could not—the constable went down stairs for some water, and while he was gone I rushed into the room, and took the bed and clothes and turned them upside down on the floor, and stamped the fire out—I burnt my trousers—it was not blazing much, it was all red hot—the prisoner was standing there at the time, and he tried to enter once himself—he asked me for his boots, but I did not see them—I did not notice how the bedclothes were; I could not for the smoke—I could not swear that the clothes were spread out as if a person had been in bed—the prisoner seemed greatly muddled, as though he did not know what he was about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not swear that the bedclothes were in a heap; there was too much smoke—we soaked them well with water after I had stamped upon them, and we looked round, but did not see any more fire—I went to the police-station with the prisoner's father—the prisoner asked him if he charged him with drunkenness—on the way to the station the father walked with me, and he offered me a half-sovereign not to criminate him—he was rather an aged man, about sixty—he said "Ain't you a police<lb></lb>man?"—I said "I am not"—he said "I will give you a half-sovereign if you don't criminate me"—I did not mention that on the first evidence—the father did not appear against the prisoner—when he said he would charge his son, the prisoner said "You will be sorry for this," and the father said he had lately insured the house, three days before, for 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to be careful what he was saying—the father committed suicide a few days after he had charged the prisoner—I saw the room after I had put the fire out—we searched all over the room, and left it safe, as far as we could see—the prisoner produced his shirt at the hearing before the Magistrate; it was all burnt.</p>

When I pulled out this piece of paper out of the crevice it was quite out—it was eight hours after the fire was extinguished—the wood of the partition was charred very slightly—it was turned to charcoal to a slight extent—I think the prisoner discovered the burn on his shirt at Maidstone Gaol—I believe he changed it at Maidstone—I should say that the paper had been ignited after it had been put into the hole—it was invisible—I can offer no opinion as to whether sparks from the burning bed might have set fire to that—if the bedclothes had been lifted from the bedstead, and had come in contact with the paper, it probably might have burnt it.</p>

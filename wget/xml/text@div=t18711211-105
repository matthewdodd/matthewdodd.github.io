                  </hi>.

Pay to Henry Dawe, Esq., or bearer, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which place to my account. Messrs. Williams, Deacon &amp; Co., Bankers, London.

I am in the employ of Mr. Murrell—I was at the office on 9th August—I saw the prisoner in the shop—I went purposely to look at him, as I did not like the transaction—I suppose he was there about twenty minutes—the cheque was presented at the counting-house, and the cashier would not change it—the young man who served him went to see Mr. Murrell, and Mr. Murrell said "Oh, Sir Charles Goring, it is all right," and then the cashier gave him the change.</p>

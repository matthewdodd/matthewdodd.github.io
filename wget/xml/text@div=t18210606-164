            . I am servant to Mr. Newman. On the 6th of June, when my master was out, the prisoner came and asked if my master had cut the glass - I said, I knew nothing about - he went to the place, took three pieces - he measured them and said, they were three feet and a half, and took them away.</p>
               <p>Mr. NEWMAN. I saw him next morning in Cranbourne-alley, and took him. He said, he had sold it for 2 s. - he had said nothing to me about any glass when he called - he had worked for me for five days about six months ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got a job and wanted three squares, and called there - she said, there was none in the binn. I went and found three, and told her to tell Mr. Newman I would pay in the morning. I met him in Ryder's-court, and told him I would pay him, but he would prosecute.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWMAN. I never gave him credit - I said, I would prosecute the first man I found out.</p>

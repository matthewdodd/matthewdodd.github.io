About 10 a.m, on 5th October I saw the female prisoner at Brook House, Snaresbrook—I said "Where is your husband?"—she said "I have not seen him for some time,"—I said, "How do you account for a pocket-handkerchief being found at his lodging at Emery's at Wanstead?"—she said "I can't account for it"—I then left? the house, and kept observation upon it until about 6 o'clock—I then saw the male prisoner come up—I said "Is your name Walker?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are you married?"—he said "No, I am a single man"—I said "Do you know any one living here?"—he said "No"—I said "We will inquire"—I rang the bell, the door was opened, and I took the male prisoner into the dining-room—I was in plain clothes—the female prisoner was called up from downstairs, and, looking at the man, she said "Yes, that is my husband"—I then told him that I was an officer—I showed him an old pocket-handkerchief that had been found, and said "Is this yours?"—he said "No"—it is marked "C.

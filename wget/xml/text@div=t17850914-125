               <p>I am a shopman to the prosecutor, on Wednesday the 31st of August last, about seven in the evening, a woman and a boy came into the prosecutor's shop to buy a pair of buckles while I was engaged with the woman and a boy, the man came into the shop, I looked at him, and asked him what he wanted, and he went down the steps to the door, in the mean while the woman and the boy kept me in conversation respecting the buckles, they bought the buckles, and they went out of the shop, I saw the woman go out of the shop without a cloak on her shoulders; she was a meanish looking woman, I followed to the door suspecting nothing of it, when I returned back I missed the shew-glass.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man that came into the shop if you were to see him? I think I should.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140167"></xptr>Are you sure you should know him? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him since? - Yes, I saw him at Guildhall, and then I knew his face, I think he was but a very little time in the shop, I saw him and another walk backwards and forwards before he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say you should know that man that came into the shop, and stepped out again? - The prisoner I believe is the man.</p>
               <p>From the very slight opportunity you had of observing him, can you swear positively that is the man? - I cannot positively swear it, but I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man go out as well as the woman and the boy? - Yes, he stood with his back to the door, then I spoke to him and he went on the step, then I saw nothing in his hand, I supposed he belonged to the woman and the boy, the woman and the boy kept me in talk for a few minutes after he went out.</p>
               <p>Jury. In what part of the shop was the shew-glass? - Upon the counter, about a yard and half from the door, my back was to the show-glass, I was obliged to watch the woman and the boy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your shop is but a small one I understand? - Yes, in 'Change-alley.</p>
               <p>What age might the boy be? - I suppose about fourteen.</p>
               <p>Did he or the woman go out first? - I cannot say, they both went out together.</p>

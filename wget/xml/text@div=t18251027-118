            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 13th of October, I had some conversation with Mr. Crocker, in company with Weale; I met Mr. Weale the following morning, a little after four o'clock, and we proceeded at a quarter before five along Parliament street, in the direction of Downing-street; when we were opposite Little Charles-street, we heard an empty cart coming along King-street, towards us - there were three or four persons with it, but we could not see who was driving, it was so dark; I stood in front of a house in Downing-street, and saw it go into the Treasury yard. We lost sight of it for a few minutes - it came out quite full of bricks - three persons were in it - we followed it as far as the end of Downing-street, where I left it to go to the other end of Gardener's-lane, by Duke-street; I heard the cart rattling, and the noise of shooting something out; I made the best of my way up to the place, and saw Butcher and Ball throwing bricks into Adams' cellar; it was then just break of day; Cronin and Wingate were standing outside the heap; we secured the four persons; the greater part of the bricks were new, and some were old; I have a brick here which we took from that heap, and one from the stack in the Treasury yard. I took Wingate and Cronin, and as we were going along Wingate gave me a padlock key, which I tried to the padlock of the cellar, and it fitted exactly; I afterwards went back and found Adams in bed. Ball said he was a labourer in Adams' employ.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Handley, and saw what he has stated. I was two or three yards from the end of Downing-street when the cart went into the yard - it came out in a few minutes loaded with bricks - there was a tall, a short man, a lad, and another person, with it; I followed it and saw the load shot down - there were fifty or sixty new bricks shot into the cellar - the rest of the load was on the pavement - it was getting light - there was a gas light burning immediately opposite the cellar; I took Butcher and Ball to the watch-house - Butcher begged very hard that I would not take him; I then went back and met Handley with Wingate; I took Wingate, and then went with Cronin to Adams' - he was not up, but I sent the servant to say we should be glad to speak to him; he sent word he would come down; I said we had stopped a cart loaded with bricks, and I understood they belonged to him; he said "I hope there is nothing the matter;" I asked who he had bought them of - he said "The fact is they are not bought at all;" I cautioned him to be guarded in what he said, as it might come into a Court of Justice. We went towards the watch-house, and I told him I must be under the necessity of keeping him; he said he was very sorry, and asked me to go back with him, to give some orders to his workmen, which I did; the bricks were then lying in the street, and he wished them to be thrown into the cellar; I said I did not know whether it would be proper to do so or not, but I would consult Handley, and we would let him know in a few minutes; we then went out and met Aldsworth; Adams said "That is the man I had the bricks of;" we went into the parlour, and Aldsworth said "I told you last night you could have no bricks;" Mr. Adams made answer that Butcher had come to say he could, and in consequence of that message, he had directed his people to fetch them. I took them before the Magistrate - I do not know at what time the watchman leaves the yard - he ought to stop till the men come - I do not know whether he was there then.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Adams. I was in the cellar about seven o'clock on the night of the 13th of October; Adams was there - Butcher and Kelly came to the door, and said, "Is Mr. Adams at home" - he answered them himself - one of them said, "Mr. Adams, you will send the cart about five o'clock in the morning, a little sooner or later, for a load of bricks; there are some to come away;" Adams said, "Very well:" he then said to me, "George go up to your tea - the cart will be here to-morrow morning at five o'clock, and you must go with them to get a load of bricks." He then went up into the parlour, and I believe went to writing; the next morning the bell to call me up was rung; I came down stairs, and there was no one there; my master called to me, and said "George, is not that the bell;" I said, Yes - he said, "I dare say it is for you to go and get the bricks; here is the key of the cellar." I dressed myself, and went to Downing-street - there was no one there. I came back to Mr. Brown's stables, and saw Cronin, and said, "Patrick,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270047"></xptr>are you ready" - he said it was time enough; Ball was there, and we all three went to Downing-street; Butcher and Kelly were gone on before, and met us there. I was in the cart when it was between the end of Downing-street and the Treasury-yard, making a noise with my feet; Butcher said, "Hold your tongue;" I said, "Where is the harm of it;" he said, "You ought to know better than to make a noise;" I said, "Very well," and we went on to the yard: Kelly told us to back up against the bricks - we did so, and he said, "You are in the wrong place; back up against these; Butcher, Ball, and Cronin were there at the time; when we had backed up against the second pile of bricks, either Butcher or Kelly said, "Now fill the cart;" Butcher and Kelly then loaded it; Butcher then said, "Come on - I will go with you to the cellar, and help to get the bricks in;" it was rather dark, but was getting light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the men were talking with your master the night before, did they not ask for beer? A. Yes, but my master said, "I shall give you no beer - I pay a proper price for my bricks."</p>

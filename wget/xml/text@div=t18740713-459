                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 8, Parker Street, Drury Lane—on 27th June, about 2 o'clock a.m., the prisoner accosted me in Brook Street, Holborn, and asked me where he could get a lodging—I showed him a coffee-house, and he said "You can't get no woman there"—he followed me, gave me a florin, and asked me to go with him to a house in Holborn Buildings—I put it in my mouth, bent it, and found it was bad—I told him it was bad, and he said "Rather than wrong you I will give you another," and took out a handful from his pocket, and offered me another, but I did not take it—I said "You had better come down to a policeman"—he used bad language, and tried to take the bad florin out of my hand—I called a constable, and gave him in charge with the coin—I then saw him throw something away, and heard the <hi rend="italic">jink</hi> of money in the area of a house in Furnival's Inn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 320). On 27th June, about 2.30 a.m., the last witness gave me a bad florin, and pointed to the prisoner—I walked after him, and when I was going to catch hold of him, he took something from his trousers pocket, and threw it into an area in Furnival's Inn—it jingled like money—I left a policeman to watch the area, and took the prisoner to the station, and found a good half-sovereign in his boots, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in his pocket, all good—I afterwards went to the area, and found five counterfeit florins, with a small piece of paper laid between two of them—the policeman was still there when I came back.</p>

I was trying to find out where I lodged the night before, but I do not know a street in London. I told her I would give her something if she would find me a lodging. I suspected she wanted to rob me which is the reason I put the half-sovereign in my boot. I never had bad money in my life.</p>

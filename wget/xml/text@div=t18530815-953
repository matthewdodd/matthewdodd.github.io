On 25th July, I saw the prisoner in custody of the last witness, about two yards from Kennington-gate—I saw him do something to his pocket, and he began beating the policeman; and as he was beating him about, a parcel flew out of his hand—it went down an area in a garden—I ran in the garden, looked down the area, and saw the parcel—I said to the lady, "Give me that parcel," and she gave it me up—I went to the police<lb></lb>man, but did not give it him then, for there were six or seven persons hold<lb></lb>ing the prisoner down—I gave the parcel to the policeman afterwards.</p>

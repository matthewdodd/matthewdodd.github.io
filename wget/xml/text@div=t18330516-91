            . I live at Kentish-town. I was accidentaly passing down Ludgate-hill and saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Hilditch's shop, with the silk hanging down on the ground; and at the threshold of the door I met the witness; he and I went in pursuit of him - he was never out of my sight; I saw him drop the silk - he was secured by two bricklayer's labourers, and brought back to the shop - the constable was sent for - he wished the prosecutor to let him go.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Until the present charge(which is totally unfounded) I have never had a stain upon my character, as I have been employed by many respectable persons in my trade as a working jeweller; I have a wife and two children who are very young, the eldest not being more than five years of age, and my wife being very ill at the present time; and if I should be sent out of my native land they will be left upon the wide world without a friend to give them any assistance, or even a loaf of bread.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wells. On Saturday evening, the 16th of June, the gown was pawned by a woman; I do not know whom - I saw the prosecutrix there that evening, drunk; I cannot tell whether it was before or after the gown was pledged - she called to know if it was pawned, and we said we would look on the Monday morning, when she was sober; I am not able to say whether she herself pawned it - she has pawned things there, and generally in the name of Stevens; I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HILL. I solemnly swear that when I lost it I was sober; but going round with different people I drank a little more than I am used to do; I never authorized the prisoner to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutrix so drunk that she did not know me, though we had lived in one house together, in Charless-street, Drury-lane; she had hold of a woman's arm - we went to a shop three doors from the pawnbroker's, and had two quarterns of gin; she then said, "I have a gown in my basket - I shall go and pawn it;" she took me to the pawnbroker's door, and got me to pawn it for 2s.; we went back, and had another quartern of gin - she had the duplicate, and the rest of the money.</p>

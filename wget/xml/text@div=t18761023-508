                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Little College Street, Wapping, and am a shipwright—I have known the prisoner since 1866—he is a house and—, estate agent—in 1875, he was carrying on business at 37, Essex Street, Strand—in that year I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him—by that agreement we were each to advance 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to be put into the bank in both our names—I paid him the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 23rd of January—he gave me the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid it in Bank of England notes, which I had got from the West of England Bank—he did not pay his own 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him several times, and he said "It's all right"—the memorandum at the end of the agreement was made about two days after he had received the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Mr. Ewens, I must look after your protection, as I am in partnership with Mr. Spiers—I wish to do you a good turn, and I must have this for your protection," and he said "You. will</p>

               <p>have to sign this," and I did sign it—he said (he would pay it in both our names, but in such a way that he could draw it himself—the business was in 37, Essex Street, where he had lived before—I was to look out for buy<lb></lb>ing houses and land—in May of that year I entered into an agreement to buy houses—I applied to him for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit, I got that—I never saw any books or accounts; I asked often about them, but he always seemed to have something or the other to put me off—the last time I saw the prisoner was about 12th May, 1875—I have never seen him since, although I have wasted about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. trying to find him—I have never got any of the money back from him; his sons treated me with contempt whenever I enquired of them—I saw him at Tilbury, and telegraphed to the police at London and he was arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known him since 1866, and had dealings with him prior to this agreement of 1875—in 1874 I had a transaction with him that he should purchase some property in King's Court, Bunhill Row—at that time the property was purchased by him, but I was to be the purchaser; I advanced to him a sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of repairing dilapidations upon the sale of the property, in return for this advance I was to receive a bonus of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in May, 1875 (this agreement being dated January, 1875), the, defendant and I had some property between us at Butcher's Row and Oliver's Court, Bedford—that is the property I allude to on which the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid-after that deposit had been paid, I in the month of May consented to its being treated as had been the Bunhili <hi rend="italic">Row</hi> property. (<hi rend="italic">Document read, dated 6th May</hi>, 1875. "Dear sir,—I agree to your carry<lb></lb>ing out entirely in your own way the property at Butcher's Row and Oliver Court, upon the same principle as King's Court, Bunhill Row-you are to pay me the sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the sale of the ground rent as my share of profit, and I undertake to execute the deeds and do all I can to facilitate your successful disposing of the business. Yours respectfully, David Ewen. "That is in my handwriting at his dictation—it assents to his <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> on the same principle as in 1874, viz., for me to find money for dilapidations and receive a bonus-in May, 1875, I did not know he was being pressed for money—I can swear it; he never told me so—he did not mention that his lawyers were pressing for money, nor that he was going away—I never heard of his being in difficulty until he was away—after May, 1875, his son told me he was—away, but he did not know where he was—I went to Mr. Gwynn, and he asked me what I was going to do with the property—I said "The man has taken all I have got"—then of course the people were writing to me about completing the purchase of property—I went over to the prisoner's son, and he pleaded that his father should send me money to complete the purchase, but he treated me with contempt, and said he knew nothing about it—at last I met a gentleman in Gracechurch Street, and he said he would take the property off my hands—there was to be 10 per cent, profit paid to him for supervision of all the concern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were to be accounts taken—I never saw any this was the Butcher's Row property—I was to do the buying of it—there was to be 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid for it, and it was to be re-sold again.</p>

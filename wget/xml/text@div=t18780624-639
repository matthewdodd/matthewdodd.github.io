I keep an oilshop at 88, Pemberton Street, Islington—about 12 o'clock on the night of 8th June I looked up the doors and windows—between 5 and 6 o'clock I was aroused by Mr. Pettit, and found the prisoner in his charge—I looked over the house, and missed my watch, which had been hanging over the mantelpiece, also 6 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till.</p>

I live at 149, Pemberton street, about 30 yards from the prosecutor—on the morning of 19th June I Saw a man standing in my master's stables—I said something to him—I went to call one of my mates, and I saw the prisoner come out of the [rpsecutor's shop—he went several yards—I followed him, and said "What do you do in that house?"—he said nothing—I said "I shall take you back to see what you have been doing"—I knocked four knocks at the door, and Mr. Archer came down—I took the prisoner insikde, and waited till a constable came.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge—he said nothing—I found on him sixpence and threefarthings in bronze, and this watch down his drawers—I also found a knife in his pocket, which bore marks of putty—I compared it with marks on the back window of the prosecutor's house, and it corresponded—there were also marks on the parlour door which corresponded with this screwdriver that was lying on a chair, and which the prosecutor identified as having been taken from a drawer.</p>

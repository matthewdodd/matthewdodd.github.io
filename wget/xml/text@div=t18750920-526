On Sunday night, 5th September, about 11.30, I was with a friend at the Royal Exchange—I wanted to pat him into an omnibus—one came up and he tried to get in, but it was full—there was a crowd—I saw the prisoner there—she put her hand into my pocket twice—I communicated with Sergeant Beale.</p>

On Sunday evening, 5th September, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the last witness made a communication to me, and I spoke to Detective Smith—the prisoner was afterwards taken out of an omnibus by Smith, and taken into custody—I took her hand on the way to the Station, and opened it, and found this gold locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in it.</p>

I was on duty, on Sunday night about 11 o'clock, at the Royal Exchange, and in consequence of a communication from Sergeant Beale I watched the prisoner for some time—she got into an omnibus going towards the East End from Cornhill—I followed and stopped it—I got into the omnibus and said "Come out, I want you"—she said "What for," and she appeared very indignant—I said "I will tell you what for when I get you outside"—she became very violent, and threw something from her left hand—I took her to the station with the assistance of Sergeant Beale—she was very violent—I took her left hand—I had hold of her right hand also—she got that away, and I saw Sergeant Beale take a gold locket from it—she did not say how she became possessed of it, she only used abusive language.</p>

I am a carpenter, at 2, Umberstone Street, Commercial Road—this gold locket belongs to me—I have not the least doubt about it—I had it in my possession last on Sunday night, 5th September—it was hanging to my watch-chain—I was waiting at the Royal Exchange for an omnibus that night—I got outside, and when I got off I missed the locket—it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

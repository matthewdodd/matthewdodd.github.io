               <p>Q.Has the daughter had access to your workshop? - A. She has, for two years past, I believe. On the 9th of February, I was sent for to Messrs.

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Adams: We weigh silver out to the workmen, and we weigh in again; I have found silver deficient for a year and a half or two years back.</p>
               <p>Q.Lately? - A. Yes; I believe within the last month.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These deficiencies will arise, I suppose, if the filings or scrapings should be taken away? - A. I suppose they might.</p>
               <p>JAMES FARREN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Messrs. Cox and Murle: On Thursday, the 8th of February, the prisoner brought to us this silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state is that silver? - A. It is very badly melted.</p>
               <p>Q.What did it appear to have been? - A.Silver filings and scrapings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What difference is there between the scrapings and the filings? - A. I never was in the workman's line, the prisoner at the bar brought it to me, and desired me to get it melted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had she ever been at the shop before? - A. Yes; she told me she was the wife of a springer and liner, which is a branch in watch making, she left it with me; after she was gone, I looked at the silver, and suspected, from the appearance of it, that it had not been properly come by; she came the next day, and I sent for Mr. Aldridge, in Aldersgate-street, he questioned her about it, and we stopped her; I told her, we suspected it was improperly come by, and she at last confessed that her husband worked for Mr. Adams; she said, he was not in fault at all, and begged we would not hurt her poor girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of favour made her, or did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor worse for her if she did not? - A. No, she kept crying out, her poor girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by the silver? - A. No, we sent for the girl, and she confessed she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing that she said, pass in the presence of the prisoner? - A. No, we kept them separate; she left the silver in the name of Lowe.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Adams.) Q. In what capacity did the husband work for you? - A. As a polisher and filer of spoons.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140068"></xptr>Q. He did not work in the capacity of a springer or liner? - A. No, nothing of that sort is carried on in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference between scrapings and filings? - A. The scrapings are done by an edge 100l that scrapes off long pieces, the filings are what fall from the file.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Are these scrapings and filings? - A. Both filings and scrapings are exceedingly visible.</p>

Mr. Osborne; she said, what she had done, she had done to pay the rent; I asked her, how she came to do so; she said, she was in distress, and she got her daughter to bring some home, to get her out of that distress; and she pulled a bit of paper out of her pocket; she afterwards said, her daughter brought it from Mr. Adams's, she said, it was through her that the daughter did it.</p>

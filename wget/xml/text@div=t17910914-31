The prisoner came to me about five weeks, as near as I can speak, after last Michaelmas; he had one apartment at 3 s. a week; he might continue about seven or eight weeks; he went away the day or two after Christmas. It was a furnished apartment; these things, all of them in the indictment, were let with the furniture; I found it out about a day or two after he went; he took away the key, and locked up the door, and left about half his lodging unpaid. On the Christmas morning I went up, and gave them a glass of gin, and told them to get my money as soon as they could; they said, they would. The next day morning I went up, and the room was locked up. I found an iron saucepan, a gridiron, and bolster, pawned with Mr. Hill.</p>

               <p>There are many saucepans marked like that; and in regard to the sheets, there were two blankets, but no sheets at all. As he was very sharp for his rent, and I being something behind hand, and he threatening me to padlock the door, and he being very sharp with me, and I being dubious of losing my two or three trifles, my working tools, and so I left the room, but I left the key in. I never had any poker nor flat-iron in the room; but I left every thing in the room as I found it, and rather more.</p>

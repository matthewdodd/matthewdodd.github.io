                  </hi>. I am a commander in the Navy, and rent a farm at Upton. Hewitt was my wagoner—I received information, and about six in the morning of the 18th of March my wagon left the farm—I went to the Three Tuns at Bow—I got there about a quarter past seven o'clock—Hewitt was aware that it was contrary to my rule to stop at a public-house—he had been in my employ nearly a year—the wagon stopped at the Three Tuns—I saw Hewitt get on the shaft—his coat was placed on the front of the wagon which comes partly over the shafts—he took a sack from under his coat and handed it down to the ostler Pye, who went up the yard with it—I ran across the road and made him bring it back—I had been on the other side—Pye had got about half way up the yard by the side of the house—I said, "Well, Hewitt, this is your gratitude"—he said, "I hope you will let me off this time"—I sent for a policeman—Hewitt had no authority to take corn out of my stable—he was not allowed to take any thing but mixed food in the nose<lb></lb>bags, and the horses had the proper supply of mixed food in the nose-bags—I afterwards saw this sack—it is mine—it is food of this description that I have for my horses—the Three Tuns is not above two miles and a half from my farm—the cart was loaded with potatoes, and was going to Whiting's wharf—they were to bring dung down, and while they were loading and un<lb></lb>loading, the horses should have their food.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present when the wagon left the farm that morning—Hewitt's orders were not to stop at any place on the road—it was Captain Pelly's custom to give out a certain portion of corn every day—I have seen the corn which my master brought back in the sack—it was his corn—there was about three pecks—the usual supply for these horses was about one bushel and a peck—I saw the nose-bags on the wagon—they were full.</p>

Q.</hi> Who hands out the corn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—it is kept in the granaries locked up by me—Hewitt has the quantity of corn given out to him, and uses it as he likes, but it was to be used in the stable, burring the quantity he takes out in his nose-bags.</p>

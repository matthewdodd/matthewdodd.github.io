                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>.) I am a native of Stockholm—I am a sailor, and formerly belonged to the American ship <hi rend="italic">Actorora</hi>—I lodged at the Swedish Flag public-house, Princes-street, Ratcliff Highway—on the 1st of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was there having some beer—the prisoner was there with two other persons, one named Jackson, the other's name I don't know—I took them in a pint of beer and some rum for which they paid me—I took the money to the mis<lb></lb>tress of the house—I did not drink with them—they staid there till about eleven o'clock—I was not with them during that time—I had no quarrel with them at six o'clock—I never saw the prisoner before that day—about ten o'clock I had been out and was coming into the house, and met the prisoner and the others coming out—the prisoner said, "Now you are frightened because there are three of us"—I opened the two doors which lead out into the street, and the prisoner and his companion went out leav<lb></lb>ing Jackson in the passage—I pushed Jackson out and tried to bolt the</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am single—I was residing at Willow-cottage, belonging to Lady Amelia Shaw, at Twickenham; she is a widow—I superintend a school, which is under her management, near her house—William West was a pupil in that school—on 18th Jan., there was no one residing in Willow-cottage but myself—I left it a little before 2 o'clock to attend to the school—all the doors and all the windows were then fastened—there is a kitchen separate from the dwelling house; I fastened that—when I got to the school, William West was there as usual—before the school was over, he was sent for—I do not know who fetched him—I allowed him to go, and he did not come back—I went back to the cottage between 4 and half past 4 o'clock—there are two front gates, one of them was wide open—I had left it shut—it could not be opened from the outside—there is an iron gate which opens from the outside—the oilier gate that I found open, must have been opened from the inside—the palings I suppose are about four feet high—this boy, William West, could have been lifted over them, and then he could open the gate which I found open—I opened the iron gate, and got in the house by the key which I had—I went in the kitchen, and saw a basin on the dresser with a piece of glass in it—I presumed that the cat had jumped through one of the windows; there was a pane of glass broken, and the glass was lying about the kitchen—I afterwards missed a pair of my own boots—I then had suspicion—I went in the drawing room, and found one pane of glass broken there; there are some steps close to the window, and by means of that broken pane a person's hand could be put in, and the fastening of the window could be undone, and the window could be opened—I missed two dresses, a black cape, a shawl, a shawl pin, and a bag; I have seen them all since.</p>

In consequence of information, I went on Thursday morning, 19th Jan., to a house in Windmill-lane, New Hampton, about 10 or 11 o'clock—I went to a room kept by a person named Middleton—I found the two prisoners there, both sitting on a bed—the first thing I saw was West had this pin sticking in her breast—I took it from her, and behind Cranstone I found this bag, and in it was a dress—I took Cranstone into custody, and she said, "I will tell you all about it"—I had not said anything to either of them before that—she said, "Louisa (meaning West) came to me last night at Hampton-court, and I asked her where she got those things from; she told me she brought them from home, and the dress she wore on leaving home she changed, and the dress she wore at home she had thrown away"—shortly after she said, "That shawl Louisa has got on is not hers, it is one she has stolen"—Louisa West did not hear this, because they were separate—we kept them separate as much as we could.</p>

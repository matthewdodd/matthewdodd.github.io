            . The prisoner was in my employ; he never paid me any money from Captain Simmons in the month of January - I sent to him for money by another person, and then named it to the prisoner, who admitted receiving it, but said he had lost a sovereign.</p>

            . I paid these three bills to the prisoner - there is one for 3s. 7 1/2d., one 4s. 1 1/2d., and one for 4s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that two of these might not have been paid together? A. I cannot recollect - they are weekly bills.</p>

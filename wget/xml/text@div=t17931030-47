               <p>Q. Where did you see the basket? - It stood at the watering trough at the weavers arms, the bottom of Newington; at eight o'clock I heard of the robbery, and I recalled to my mind that I heard some fowls at an uncommon place but I did not see them, my mistress desired me to go in pursuit of these fowls, I went in pursuit after them, and I over took the prisoner with them tied to his back, a little on this side of Kingsland turnpike, and I followed him to the Fox in Kingsland road; I asked him to sell me a couple of fowls? whereof he told me he would sell me a couple of live young pullets at fourteen-pence a piece, he said he bought them at St. Ives market, he opened the basket to me, and the first I took out was an old hen, and then I took out another, and I said I have seen enough, and I took him and the property to my master's house, and my master gave charge of him to Mr. King; I know them to be my master's property, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought them and paid for them, I never said I bought them at St. Ives; St. Ives is about sixty-two miles off.</p>

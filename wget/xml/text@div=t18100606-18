               <p>Q. Did that stranger come home with you - A. No, only Mrs. Lyons came home with me; the prisoner was at home, I think I found him in the back parlour on the sofa; I believe Kelley was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came home did you go to bed. - A. In about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else in the house - A. Yes, Mrs. Lyons slept in the house, I believe she went to bed at the same time; she is a widow, and often visited me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come in the house at that time when you and Mrs. Lyons came home - A. No, only Mrs. Lyons came home with me in the coach; and nobody was in the parlour but him.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was somebody in the house besides him. - A.Just for a few moments, but I never left him, a person that came home in the coach with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nobody came home in the coach with you - A. Yes, I did not think proper to mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. I took it down from your mouth, that only Mrs. Lyons came home in the coach with you - A. Nobody but her and a gentleman, he came home with me and went in the front parlour; he did not stay above ten minutes, he never went into the back parlour; I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lyons can tell better than me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man an acquaintance of yours - A, No, he came home with me from dancing at the ball; when he was gone I went to bed. I got up in the morning about eleven o'clock, I went into the back parlour, the prisoner was not in the house; then I went to the drawer to put my trinkets away; I took hold of the box, when I used to take hold of the box the guineas used to rattle, and then it did not; I said to Mrs. Lyons, Oh my goodness, the guineas are not in the box; I searched and found the bank notes and money was gone. I mentioned my loss to Kelley and sent him to the prisoner; he sent word he would come in a quarter of an hour; he did not return. I went to his master's house; I told him he had taken my money, and asked him to give it me; he said, he knew nothing at all about it. I went to Bow-street, got a warrant, and took him up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two men came home with her, one stopped and slept with her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were two men came home with me in the coach, one never came in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. When you come here to swear upon that oath you have taken, whatever is the consequence to your private character, do not swear that which is false; the prisoner desires me to put this question to you, whether one of these men did come home and sleep with you - A. He remained with me a little time in my bed room; he did not sleep with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness here to prove that he did sleep with you. You asked me to come and sleep with you; I am telling the truth; did not you say in the coach, by God, Harry, if you do not come back and sleep with me, I never will speak to you any more - A. Upon my oath I said to take care of the house; I never asked him to sleep with me in my life.</p>
               <p>RACHAIL LYONS. I am a widow woman, I live with my relations; I have a small pittance of my own; I was in the habit of calling on Mrs. Martin. On the 19th of May, the prisoner was at Mrs. Martin's when I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mrs. Martin desired him to stay in the house that night - A. Yes, she pressed him very much to come and stay in the house with Kelley. I went home to fetch some clean things to dress myself; I went down in the kitchen to put my clean things on; he was in the back parlour with her all the time Mrs. Martin was dressing; and by the time I was ready he went and fetched a coach, then we all three went to the top of St. James's-street; I and Mrs. Martin went to the ball. We returned about half past five in the morning; two gentlemen came with us in the coach, one was an Irish gentleman that lodged at the hummums, I do not know who the other was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home did these two gentleman go into the house - A. Yes, both went into the house, one went into the front parlour, and the other went into the back parlour. Mrs. Martin went into the parlour with the Irish gentleman, the other went away; the Irish gentleman staid almost till twelve at noon; he wrote a note for the man to go to the hummums to fetch his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this back parlour door, did you lock it when you went out. - A. No, I locked it in the morning when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned you found Molloy there - A. Yes, he was in the habit of being there a great deal; when I saw him in the morning, he was coming out of the back parlour, going home.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that this gentleman went into the back parlour, and was for some time with Mrs. Martin, and by his staying till twelve o'clock at noon, I suppose that he went to her bed room and slept with her - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did not get up from her bed till about twelve o'clock - A. No.</p>

             - A. My wife. I have done business for Mrs. Martin for five years. On the 19th of May, the prisoner returned soon after Mrs. Martin had set him off; about twelve o'clock he went into the back parlour, and there he staid till Mrs. Martin came home. I went several times into the back parlour to attend the fire; the prisoner was all the time laying on the sofa, sometimes asleep and sometimes awake. I only went into the room to make up the fire, and came back again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife go into the back parlour - A. No, my wife came to me between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked me when I was coming home: she staid half an hour and went away. When Mrs. Martin and Lyons came home two gentlemen came with them, they both went into the front parlour when I saw them, and then I went down stair. One of them went up stairs with Mrs. Martin, and went away about twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 19th of May I called on Mrs. Martin, she asked me to give her some brandy; I told her I had no money; she gave me half a crown to get some, and then she gave me a shilling. I fetched the brandy; she asked me to stop, I told her I was afraid of losing my situation. I got a coach for her; she said, by God, Harry you shall sleep with me to night; I told her I would come let my situation be what it would. I had been five years about her house, and almost every day there. I laid on the sofa till five o'clock; when she and Mrs. Lyons came home I went down in the kitchen, and when Mrs. Lyons came down she asked me to come to dinner; I said, no, I would call in the evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060015"></xptr>I went home my master was getting up he told me to go to Mr. Obee's, the boot maker; when I returned Mrs. Martin came she said, you have robbed me, give me the seventy-five pounds; I told her I did not know what she meaned, and after that the officer came and took me to prison.</p>

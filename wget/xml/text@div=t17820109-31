               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came from Oxford to Watford, and from Watford to Edgware; I was much tired, it was ten minutes after eleven, I asked a man where I could lay down a little while; the man shewed me this gentleman's house, and said I might lay in the stable; I went there with an intention to lay down, I have no witnesses here.</p>

               <p>Court. In strictness of law, if a person breaks and enters a house, with intent to steal, and is prevented from carrying that intention into execution, and nothing is actually stolen, yet, if the jury are clearly satisfied of that intention, such person is guilty of a capital offence. It is necessary there should be an actual breaking, as well as entering of the house; the lifting up the latch of a door, and entering with intention to steal, is sufficient in law to constitute a burglary; if the prisoner got in by an open window, it was not, in point of law, breaking the house, or a burglary. Here is no evidence of the prisoner's breaking the house, and though there was an entry, you ought to acquit him.</p>

            . Likewise the letter was regularly marked with the post mark, from Hertford-bridge, where he lives. He asked me, if I had received a letter from Mr. Gregory, saying, he worked with him: he asked me, how I liked those stockings that came up the week before; he said, Mr. Gregory was well, he left him the Sunday before. I paid him the money, and bid him witness it; he wrote his name on the top. I said that was not sufficient; he desired I would write again, and he would witness it to my desire.</p>

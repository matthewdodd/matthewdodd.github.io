On the 19th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Cherry Orchard-lane, Eagling, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Raphael's farm, with Roberts, they were both carrying sacks—I took them into custody—I then went to the prisoner's house, and found his wife there—we found about three sacks concealed under the bed in the room up stairs, and another sack, with about two bushels of wheat in it, standing on a chair by the tide of the bed—I have brought a sample of the wheat here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Lewis Raphael, who lives at the late Mr. Mellish's place, at Bush-hill. The prisoner has been in his em<lb></lb>ploy since January—I had made a communication to the police before the 19th of October—the bulk of wheat which we had in the barn has been sold, but subsequent to the committal of the prisoner a man found a sack</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230075"></xptr>
               <p>of wheat concealed under the sheaves in the barn—I have taken a sample of the wheat in that sack, and compared it with the wheat found in the prisoner's house—it tallies in every respect with that, and with the wheat we had—it is Talavera wheat, which is not much grown—there had been some barley sown in the ground, and there are a great many seeds in this, more than is usual in wheat—there are the same appearances in each of these samples, and I hare no doubt of its being Mr. Raphael's—this was not threshed in the barn which the prisoner was at work in, but in a barn on the other side of the yard, by the prisoner's brother, but he could go to that barn when he pleased—in gleaned wheat the seeds of barley would not appear—I can state certainly that this is not gleaned wheat—this sack with the name of Murray on it, and which contained the wheat found at the prisoner's, came to Mr. Raphael's from Spitalfields-market in exchange for one of his own—these other three sacks, found under the prisoner's bed, I have no doubt are Mr. Raphael's—they are of foreign manufacture—we purchased sixty of them in Smithfleld—they are not made of hemp, but of some foreign produce, and are much larger than the usual size—the prisoner knew that such sacks were on the farm—he has filled such sacks with torn very often—three sacks had been missed on the Thursday week before, out of six which had been taken to the potato-field to be filled.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When had you seen the sacks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bailiff had missed them—this fourth sack had been torn, and repaired in a rough way with twine—I never saw another sack marked like it—it is marked "Murray, Staple ford Abbott"—these other three sacks are of an unusual manufacture—I never saw any such but those sixty we bought of Mr. Edgington—if gleaned wheat had been threshed in a barn in which there were seeds of barley and other things, it would not present the appearance that this does—there would not be such a quantity of seeds in it, as the barn is always swept before corn is threshed.</p>

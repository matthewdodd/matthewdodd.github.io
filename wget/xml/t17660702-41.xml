            . Mr. Mason rented a stable of me, at the time this harness; was lost there was an advertisement about some Irish stuffs stole out of my yard; he was stopped about these goods in the Borough, he having offered them to sell; one of our servants went and saw him there in Bridewell; he came home and told me; I then mistrusted he had stole the harness; I went to him, and said, John, you have stole these things; how shall I get you off? he said, master, I wish you could. I asked him about the harness; he told me he had sold them at the Black-horse in Aldersgate-street; I went with two or three of my servants, and found them there, one Green bought them; we took them away. I had five different actions for several things that have been stole out of my yard, and I verily believe the prisoner stole them all.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. I am a master coachman; I bought the harness of the prisoner at the bar some time in April, I cannot tell the day: I gave him 18 s. 7 d. for them,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Green. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a crest upon them?</p>
               <p>Green. No, that was taken off; there were bridles and a false collar belonging to them; he said, he had them to sell for a gentleman's coachman, who was gone into the country, and he was to give his wife the money.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of November about half after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner, and another person, who had very much the appearance of a gentleman, came into the warehouse to me at the Castle and Falcon; they asked me if the Nottingham waggon went from thence? I told them it did not; I believed it went from the Bell, in Wood-street, but was not certain. I had no suspicion from their appearance, therefore did not narrowly watch them. I believe I might turn round to the desk again, and did not look at them all the while they were in the warehouse. They hesitated a little and then asked me some more questions. I turned again to look at them; I missed the prisoner out of the warehouse; the other was there. I was going to step to the door to see where the prisoner was; the other rather put himself in my way to hinder me.</p>
               <p>You had some little suspicion when you missed the prisoner? - It might be more curiosity than suspicion. When the other put himself in my way, that gave me a suspicion; I believe the person who was left in the warehouse said something to me as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060050"></xptr> passed him; I got to the door and saw the prisoner going down the yard with two boxes tied together in his hand. I catched him by the collar and asked where he was going with the boxes? To the best of my remembrance his answer was, to the Bull and Mouth. When I had got him by the collar Mr. Harris and Mr. Mott came up. I delivered the prisoner into their care. They took the boxes into the warehouse; they were two little boxes tied together, and directed to Mr. Barker of Grantham; I had seen them in the warehouse not many minutes before; they were within two yards of me. The prisoner was taken into the tap-room. When the constable came the boxes were delivered into his care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you recollect I bid you a good night, and you bid me good night? - I recollect no such thing.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the warehouse? - I fancy not five minutes.</p>
               <p>(The boxes were produced in court by the constable, and deposed by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mott seems much enraged, because he has been hurt in losing a deal of property; I myself am innocent of what I am charged with; I went into the warehouse to ask a question; when I came out I bid Mr. Foy good-night (it is impossible for a person to take two such boxes out of such a warehouse undiscovered) when I came out they lay in my way; I moved them, as any body else might have done.</p>

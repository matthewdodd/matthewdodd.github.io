            . About a year ago the Prisoner came to my house in order to have a lodging as she used to do now and then: my wife and I had some words, and she went out; I shut the door against her, and kept her out. My wife was afraid I should take the money, and she hid it behind the bed - as she told me: the Prisoner went to make the bed, when she had done she went away, and has not been seen for a year and a quarter till the other day - I saw her take the money from under the bed's head.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my house for a lodging that night, and several other nights - That night was about five weeks before last Christmas was twelvemonth. My husband wanted to go out, and I was not willing he should, and he being angry, for fear he should take the money which I had in my pocket, I put it behind the bed between the wall and the bed's head - There were fifty four shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go out for?</p>
               <p>Currey. For a minute or two, in order to pacify my husband; and he said, if I went out, I should stay till I was cold: the Prisoner came out in two or three minutes after, and says to me, do not go in till I come back again; she then had her hand under her apron; said I, where are you going? she said she was going for water, which was about eight or nine yards off, but she did not come back: when I went in I looked for my money, and it was gone. I told my husband of it, and asked him who had been there; he said nobody but Mrs. McCardell (for the Prisoner went by that name then) - When she was before the Justice she denied she took it, but about two days afterwards in New Prison she owned she saw me put it behind the bed, and that she took it away.</p>

I went several times, and could not find her, but at last I met with her in White Cross Street, by Old Street Church, with a pewter standish under her arm, and she had upon her a gold ring belonging to my wife.

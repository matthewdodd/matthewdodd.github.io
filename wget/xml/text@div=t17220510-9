             deposed that being Servant to Mr. Bowyer, a Printer, Peacock, who was Journeyman to him, often importun'd him to procure him two of Bull's Works, and two of Saxon Laws which at last he did; and Peacock told him he carried them to William Littleboy's House in <placeName id="t17220510-9-crimeloc45">Black Fryars</placeName>

Some time after, by Peacock's Persuasions and Directions, he carried two Books himself to William Littleboy's, one of Bull's Works, and one of Saxon Laws, for which Peacock brought him 8 s. and one Set of Lesly's Works, on Fine Paper, value 4 l. for which he received 17 s 6 d.

            , a Printer, in White Cross Street; for each of which Books, Ball gave him 5 s. the worth being above 20 s. apiece. And likewise left one Set of Lesly's Works, (value 2 Guineas) at Peacock's House, for Bell, which this Evidence afterwards received of Bell himself 12 s.for. This Evidence saw Peacock carry two Sets more of Lesly's Works, to a House in Creed lane, and left'em for Benjamin Littleboy, for which Peacock brought back 20 s. William Littleboy, in his Defence, said, he never received any Books from the Evidence, nor paid him any Money. Bell said, Peacock sent for him, and told him he was under some straits for Money, and therefore would sell him some Books a Penny worth; which he bought, not knowing that he came dishonestly by them. Benjamin Littleboy, in his Defence, said, that three of Bed's Ecclesiastical Histories (value 30 s. each) were sent to his House, and he being a Book binder, thought they were sent to be bound; but Peacock came at Night, and told him he had'em of an honest Friend, and wanted to sell'em. He showed them to a Book seller's Man, who told him they were worth 25 s. upon which he gave peacock 20 s. for them all. He further said, that he received of Peacock, two of Saxun Laws, for which he gave 9 s. apiece, and sold for 10 s. Two Sets of Lesly's Works, for which he paid 25 s. each Set, and sold them again for 30 s. Three of Bull's Works, for 8 s. apiece, one of which he sold for 10 s. another for 11 s. and the 3rd for 12 s. but said, that he did not know that Peacock came by them dishonestly. They brought many Witnesses to their Reputation, who gave them a good Character. The Jury <rs id="t17220510-9-verdict46" type="verdictDescription">

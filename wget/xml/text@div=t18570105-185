                  </hi>. I am car boy to Messrs. Statham and Parker. On Saturday, 15th Nov., I was in charge of a cart of their's, in Thames-street—it had in it four bags of chicory, and a case containing four boxes of tea—it was between 3 and 4 o'clock—I had loaded it at Nicholson's-wharf—shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner White—he goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Sixpence</hi>—he asked me if I had any money—I told him, "No"—he said, "I have got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; let us come and spend it"—that was near Lenham's warehouse—he took me into a public house, and called for a pint of beer—I left my horse and cart outside, close by Lenham's warehouse—I saw Dennis outside the public house—he said to White, "Won't you give us a <hi rend="italic">whet</hi>?"—White said, "Yes, if you come in for it"—he came in, and drank some beer—I was coming out, and Dennis said, "I have had some of your beer; I will have a pint, and give you some"—he called for a pint of beer, and gave me the pot to drink out of—I saw White wink his eye, and Dennis and he were talking about something—I went out, and found the cart was gone—I went into the public house—I found White, but Dennis was not there—I think I left him in the house—I did not see him come out—I told White the cart was gone—he would hardly believe it—he came out with me—he did not remain with me five minutes—he went away—I saw a beadle in Thames-street, and told him—I saw Dennis again on Sunday morning, when he was in custody.</p>

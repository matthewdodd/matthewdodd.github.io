On Sunday, 22nd Oct., I went into Devonshire, leaving him in charge of my place—I returned on the Thursday week following—I found the place shut up—I forced an entrance, and missed a pair of blankets, an apron, and some razors—I found that the prisoner had paid over to my sister the proceeds of the first week's takings, but no more—his wages were 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I allowed him to deduct his wages from the takings—he had the blankets in use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Honorary Secretary to the London Philanthropic Society. Their business is transacted at their offices, No. 17, Ironmonger-lane, Cheapside—the prisoner was in our employment as Secretary, for which his salary was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he also had a commission on collecting; 10 per cent on donations, 10 per cent on new subscriptions, and 5 per cent on old subscriptions—it was the prisoner's duty to attend the meetings of the Committee—the annual revenue of the Society is about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, donations and subscriptions together—it was the prisoner's duty to put the tradesmen's bills before the Committee, and to prepare checks for them, which would be signed by the Chairman, the Treasurer, the Sub-treasurer, and the prisoner—it was his duty to hand the checks over, when signed, to the parties for whom they were drawn—on 19th Oct. he attended the Committee-meeting, and produced this account for coals, due to Mr. Blackhall, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a check-book, with this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), filled up all but the signatures; it was signed, and handed over to him; it has since been returned to me by the bankers, as paid—on 12th Nov. the prisoner again attended the Committee-meeting, and gave in two accounts; one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for Mitchell, for coals, and the other for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for Hall, for bread (the object of the Society is to distribute coals and bread to the poor)—the prisoner at the same time produced two checks, filled in all but the signatures; they were signed, and handed over by me to him, for payment to Mr. Hall and Mr. Mitchell; these checks have both been returned to us as honoured by the Bank—it would be the prisoner's duty to account to us once a month for all payments made and cash received, according to the rules of the Society; that rule has been relaxed in consequence of some excuses made by the prisoner, of illness—I remember a Committee-meeting on 21st Dec., when we felt dissatisfied, and examined the books with reference to the accounts; and the prisoner made a voluntary statement—he was not asked for any explanation; he said, "To be candid with you, Gentlemen, I have been making use of the Society's moneys;" he then took a paper from his pocket, and read various items, which the Chairman took down from his lips in my presence—I saw the paper, and signed it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the items he read were all checks drawn; one for Mr. Cockburn was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner said it was only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Chairman added it up, and said it came to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner said, "You have made a mistake in one shilling;" it was added up again, and it came to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the Chairman then read it over to him; he said he was sorry he had used it, but he had been in an action lately, and had been compelled to use it—here are two letters addressed to Mr. Hall and Mr. Mitchell, both dated 11th Dec, and both signed by the prisoner, and in his writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"17, Ironmonger-lane, Cheapside, 11th Dec., 1852. Sir, I am requested by the Committee to inform you that they will sit next week for the settlement of your account, and express their regret that there has been so much delay in the payment. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, John Fowler, Secretary.")—(<hi rend="italic">The other letter was in the same terms. The checks were here read, and were upon Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He used to conduct all the correspondence of the society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the instructions of the Committee—we used not to dictate the letters to him; we told him our suggestions, and allowed him to write accordingly—three formed a quorum; it happened at times that there were not three; that happened in consequence of the prisoner's neglect to write to some of the Committee—the Committee met on the third Tuesday in the month, and it was the prisoner's duty to send notices round previously to that—it was also his duty to write letters to the Committee—I was Honorary Secretary, and I did my duty—I never summoned the Committee; I used to give instructions to the prisoner to do so—I did not sometimes forget to do so; I have no recollection of forgetting it; but, for some cause or other, it did happen that the meetings were not so regular as we could desire—whatever I do is a purely honorary act on my part; I never received a farthing in my life—I was with the Society at its formation—the prisoner has been with us two years and a quarter; his salary was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he has six or seven children, I do not know which—we never had a settlement with him; we never could get him up to the mark—I am not aware whether, at the time he was given into custody, there was a full twelve-months' salary due to him; our books will show—I do not know whether during the whole two years and a quarter we have paid him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for salary and commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you paid him more than 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary and commission during the whole two years and a quarter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not gone into that part of the accounts to see, therefore I do not know—we used to draw a check for petty cash; it appears by his own book that he was in advance of us for petty cash—I know nothing about the accounts except what the books show—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is our petty cash book, kept by the prisoner; the balance that he claims in it is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the only petty cash book—it was not shown from time to time to the Committee—he never claimed that sum by word of mouth—he made disbursements for petty cash from time to time, and we gave him checks from time to time, "Pay petty cash"—we continually asked for accounts, but could not get them—the prisoner collected subscriptions, and got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in new subscriptions while he was with us—the average income of the Society is between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not his custom, to your knowledge, himself to get the checks cashed before they were paid over to the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless he had a check for several little amounts, which would be drawn for "sundries," when he would receive it, and pay the tradesmen the amount—the balance at our banker's was never very large—we never drew a check without putting the question to the prisoner," What moneys are there at the banker's?"—we had not the banker's book always—I think there was one instance, and but one, in which a check has been drawn by us, and kept back by the prisoner, because there were not funds in the bank—it appears by the banker's passbook that Mitchell's check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid into the bank on Dec. 21st; I do not know on what account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not it paid in on your own account on 21st Dec.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think it was Dec. 2nd—here is, "Per secretary, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is put on one side and then on the other, so that it is of no effect; it might as well have stopped out—we were credited and debited at the same time; the banker's clerk will explain it—the prisoner left our Board on 21st Dec; we ordered</p>

               <p>him to withdraw, and he did so—if he had come back again, we should have told him to withdraw again—he came to the next meeting of the Committee, and we gave him into custody, acting on the advice of Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor, the gentleman who is acting as solicitor for the prosecution—the prisoner did not, when he came, ask permission to look at the books—I really mean to say that—after he had been heard before the Magistrate, he was on bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he come to your office afterwards, and request permission to examine the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know about examining the books; he sent a letter, or brought it; it was brought into the room by the housekeeper—we did not see him at the office—he did not come to the office and make a personal application to look at the books—we have never let him look at the books, either by attorney or accountant—I have no recollection of any application being made to us for that purpose—I really mean to say that no application has been made on behalf of the defendant to inspect the books, so as to enable him to make out his accounts—his accounts could be made out from the books; I have gone over them—whatever I or the Committee have done, has been done in the prisoner's absence, and without any person on his behalf being present—a letter was sent to us by the prisoner—he did not, otherwise than by letter, request that he might have permission to explain his position and his accounts to the Committee.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he given you an account of what moneys had been received and paid, would you at once have written him a check for what was due to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never applied for a check without having money given to him—he has on a great many occasions applied to us for accounts—he would have no authority from us to apply any moneys received on account to his salary or commission—all the books of the Society are here—the prisoner kept them—I produce them—allowing him credit for all his claims, money is due to the Society by him independent of these checks—the balance against him is 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we call subscriptions old ones when they are a year old—this paper which I am looking at is a statement which I have made out from the books—I can only speak from this paper now, because if I were to speak from the books I should have to take each Independent item for two years and a quarter, and see whether they are subscriptions or donations</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you carefully gone through the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I make the result against the Society of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is due to the Society—here is a defalcation between this book and the pass book of 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—by defalcation I mean deficiency—the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against the prisoner includes the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his voluntary statement on the 21st; after allowing him all his per centage and salary, the amount of defalcation, independent of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, is 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is allowing him all his salary and commission, and claim for petty cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not omitted to take into the account (this has been just suggested to me by the prisoner) a sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been due to him for petty cash disbursements for twelve months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have taken his petty cash book, and admitted it to be correct—he has never asked for a settlement of the petty cash disbursements—this is the first I have heard of a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash disbursements for more than twelve months—I know nothing of a guinea with which he has debited himself from a Mr. Cox—I have taken the books just as they are, to make up the accounts—a son of the prisoner was never employed by us, nor was he there working day after day for twelve months—I never saw him there in the daytime in my life—we do not meet in the daytime, and if he had been there I should have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280020"></xptr>
               <p>seen him—I have sometimes seen him there of an evening during five or six months, not extending over a period of twelve or fifteen months—I expected to see the prisoner there every day, but not all day—he had no stated times of work—the office was not always open of an evening—it was when the Committee met, which was sometimes twice a week—I never knew anything of this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the end of 1851, which he says he has never been paid, till after he was given in custody; then I went over the books, and saw it, and in going over the books I have taken the balance as he has stated—I did not see that balance when I went over the books, I saw it before you pointed it out to me—I did not take notice of it because I took the balance as Mr. Fowler showed it—it is as it is there; I should be most anxious to give him every benefit—we were informed that he was busy in apprehending a person who had forged upon us—I do not know whether he paid a reward of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he from time to time apply to you for checks in payment of the petty cash which he expended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we always gave those checks—he never said one word at our Committee meeting about there being 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to him for a twelvemonth—I was almost always at the Committee; I was not away perhaps once in a twelvemonth—I have assumed his accounts to be correct merely for the purposes of my calculation—I have not gone into the items at all, but I assume it in his favour—I am able to say from recollection that we have drawn checks for petty cash in 1852—I or some other member of the Committee have applied to the prisoner for a settlement of accounts I should think twenty or thirty times—we were never able to obtain it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were all these books left in your possession in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in our possession, in the prisoner's possession, and his only—I do not know what he did with them—they were in his charge, and were not accessible to every member of the managing Committee—any member of the Committee could go to the office, and see them if they were there—there was but one key, and that was in the charge of the prisoner—I have often gone there and could not get in, and the other Committee-men as well—there is a housekeeper upstairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any refusal by the prisoner to allow you to see the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have never asked for the books, but we have asked to have them made up repeatedly—the key was not left with the housekeeper that I am aware of—I never knew her to have it—I always considered it was in Mr. Fowler's hands—I never asked him for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> We always give our Secretary's checks for payment of the tradesmen, and never in any other way since I have been connected with the Society, which was from the first day—the late secretary had no authority to pay in cash—the late secretary has had twelve months imprisonment by order of this Court, and now he is abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the whole of the prisoner's time supposed to be employed in the service of the Society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; he was expected to be there some time every day; not at any particular time; if he had to wait upon a nobleman or gentleman at the West End for a subscription, he must be guided by the time that was most suitable; we expected him to be there some part of the day—if we went there in the afternoon we expected to hear that he had been there in the morning—I cannot tell the number of subscribers we had—when he made known his defalcations he did not proffer to repay them by instalments; we immediately ordered him to withdraw that we might deliberate upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not either at the office, or collecting subscriptions, or seeing to the delivery of tickets, and so on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he had all those duties to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he carry on any Other business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he managed the business of Wright and Co.'s, printers, near Aldersgate-street, with a little Institution, and occasionally he made up books—I know be made up the books of one Society and one firm—he was allowed to get employment from other people; we did not expect the whole of his time—the collection of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not take much time, and our subscriptions fall due nearly all at one time—just before the cold weather.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live at No. 17, Camomile-street. I am a member of the Committee of the London Philanthropic Society; I was present on 21st Dec. when the prisoner attended—in consequence of something that had occurred the Committee met to examine the books on that occasion—we told the prisoner that we wished to go into the accounts to see how we stood—he immediately took a paper from his pocket, and said, "To be can did with you, Gentlemen, I have been making use of the Society's money"—the paper produced by Mr. Heeps is the statement that I took down from the prisoner's lips at the time: I was chairman—I read it over to him, and he corrected the error of a shilling that I had made in the casting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many gentlemen are there on this Committee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several, fourteen or fifteen, I think—they do not all attend—sometimes three attended, sometimes five, and sometimes six or seven—they are all men of business, engaged in trade—we meet often—I know nothing of the key being left with the housekeeper—I was pretty regular in my attendance—the books were supposed to be in the room—we sometimes asked for them, and sometimes one of the books would be away, and the prisoner would say," I have got it at home, to make it up"—that might be the case sometimes.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose you had gone there in the daytime, whom would you have asked for the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner; we should not have known where to look for them unless he had given them to us—we should have expected to see them in the office—I have been through the books—on 21st Dec, at the time Mitchell's check was paid into the bank, the prisoner would have about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his hands, moneys that had been collected—he kept the banker's pass book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take an active part in this Society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; the tradesmen are always paid by check, that is, we gave the Secretary checks for the money, and the checks having been returned with the pass book we presumed that the tradespeople had received them, and that they had never been cashed by the Secretary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At any time when you supposed the books were in the office, did you look for them, and find they were not there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but we have asked if our books had been made up, and he would say, "No, I have not had time to do it; I will get it done by the next meeting"—the books ought to have been balanced, and come before the Committee once a month, and we can show by our minutes that they were so up to a certain time.</p>

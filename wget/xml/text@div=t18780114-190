                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live with him at 15, Goul<lb></lb>ston Court—on the morning of 23rd December he was out very late—at half-past 2 I went out a little distance and met him, and the woman he keeps—I asked her was she not ashamed of herself to keep company with the father of 14 children, knowing that I was alive—the prisoner turned round and struck me and kicked me—a policeman came up and said "What's the matter, mistress?"—I said "My husband has kicked me"—I got up and made my way home—the prisoner came in directly after and he struck me violently with his fist and knocked me down, and he took a long piece of wood and beat me with it across the left side as I laid on the floor—he then took a knife off the table and came towards me—I put up my hand to protect my face, and he cut it between the fourth and fifth fingers—I became senseless for some time—when I came to he was sitting before the fire on a bushel basket, and I saw him pour<lb></lb>ing something out of a bottle into a cup—he came towards me as I lay on the floor, lifted up my head backward, between his knees, and said "I will put you in a way that you won't follow me again," and he poured the liquid into my mouth—I would not take it, and he threw it into my eyes three times, and I found out that it was Chili vinegar—I found the Chili's about my neck—he did not go away; he stayed there till half-past 6—I laid on the floor as I was till the morning—it gave me a great deal of pain—I could not find the door to get out—I afterwards saw Dr. Phil<lb></lb>lips—I have been the mother of 14 children to the prisoner—all I wish is for him to give me a maintenance or keep the peace—I am frightened to walk the street or go outside the door, because of the woman he keeps company with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—at noon on 24th December, I saw the prosecutrix at the Commercial Street police-station—I examined her—I found a clean-cut wound between the third and fourth fingers, reaching from the back of the hand about three<lb></lb>quarters of an inch into the palm—her eyes were very much swollen; the skin around both eyes was very much inflamed, and the lining mem<lb></lb>brane of the eyeballs was very much inflamed, and raised with a good of serous effusion underneath—the inflammation appeared to be of a very irritable character—she complained of great itching—the wound was caused by some sharp instrument—if she fell on a broken bottle that was well bevelled off to a sharp edge, and that came in contact with that part of the hand, I see no reason why it should not have inflicted such a wound—the state of the eyes could not arise from any ordinary ailment that I know of—it was evidently produced by some external irritant having been applied there—strong rum, if the evaporation was prevented, might produce it-—the mere throwing rum on would not—she was evidently suffering great pain—I think the injury to the eyes has en<lb></lb>tirely passed away—I have not seen her for some time—she was only casually under my care—Chili vinegar would be much more likely to cause the injury than anything else—I should expect it arose from that—the peculiar irritable state was attributable in all probability to the irritating effect of capsicums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. If the evaporation of the rum had been prevented by covering over the bottle it might have produced some such effect—I saw the woman twenty-four hours afterwards—the effect did not pass away rapidly—I saw her a week afterwards, and it had not passed away then;</p>

I am the daughter of the prosecutrix and prisoner—I was examined before the Magistrate—on Sunday night, 23rd December, I came home about half-past 12 or a quarter to 1—my mother was lying on the bed very drunk, and her hand was by the side of her bleeding—I held her head up, and asked her what was the matter—she said she had been fighting with Moggie Footman, who had struck her with a bottle between the fingers—(I know Moggie Footman, she has a barrow in Salmon's Lane)—that the bottle contained vinegar, and she caught the vinegar in her eyes, and her eyes were affected till the next morning—I left her there, and swept up the room, and lighted the fire—my father came home about half-past 2 or a quarter to 3, and as soon as he came in my mother got off the bed and caught him by the coat, and used most abusive language, and showed him her hand, and said that his woman had done it—he did nothing to her but just pushed her, and she fell on the bed, and her hand began to bleed again—I got a pail of water and put her hand in it till the blood stopped—father sat on the basket before the fire, and there he remained all night—I did not see him do anything to my mother—I stayed in the room all night till the next morning, and mother was all right—she had a bottle of rum by her side—I tried to take it out of her hand, but she would not let me, and I left it there—it was full at night and in the morning it was empty—I did not see any chili vinegar in the room—mother had been drinking for some time before this—she is always drunk—if she only gets a shilling or two, all she thinks of is flying to the public-house with it—whatever she has goes in drink—as for having a Knife in the house, there was none there—I had to send upstairs to borrow one—she has been in the habit of wearing spectacles—the last time she came home she brought a large Bible and a pair of spectacles, and said they had been made a present to her as her eyes had been weak.</p>

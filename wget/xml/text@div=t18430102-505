                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Walter, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone. On the morning of the 22nd of Dec. I was at breakfast with him in the parlour about half-past ten. I saw the prisoner pass the parlour window—I had not known him before, but I am sure it was him—he had some coats with him—I ran out at the private door—I did not see him then—I went through several streets to Westmoreland-street—I there saw the prisoner looking round the corner, and saw part of the coats with him—I came up with him in Weymouth-street—he had these coats—I took hold of him by one arm, and said, "Have you got these for sale?"—he said a man gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to carry them for him—he slipped from my arm while I was looking at them—he dropped some of them, and I dropped the others—he ran down Wimpole-street—I followed him for perhaps 200 yards—the policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I did not lose sight of him from the time, and he dropped the coats—I went home, and looked for the coats, and missed them—they had been outside the door for the purpose of placing them up—I had seen them about an hour and a half before I fist saw the prisoner—they are my master's, and have the tickets on them.</p>

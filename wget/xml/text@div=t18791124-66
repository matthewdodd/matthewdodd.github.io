                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Equestrian, 124, Blackfriars Road—on 31st October, about 8.30 p.m., I served the prisoner with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum; he asked for change for a sovereign; I gave him a half-sovereign, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then went to serve a customer, but he called me back, and said "Miss, will you give me silver for this half-sovereign?"—I said "Yes," but directly I took it I saw that it was bad—I am certain it was not the same as I had given him; it was much lighter, but I gave him the change to catch him—he was talking to a man and woman in the bar; they all three left together, and I went after them—a policeman was at the door, and I gave the prisoner in custody in the middle of the road, with the coin—I noticed it because I had taken two bad open a fortnight previously.</p>

On Sunday the 24th of August, I left home about seven o'clock in the morning, and dined with my father at Thames Ditton - the prisoner was in bed when I went out. I returned on Monday morning at ten o'clock, but did not go into the house till two o'clock. I then received information, and about four I called the prisoner into the counting-house, and told him he had been seen leaving my house with a box or drawer containing something, and asked what it was, and where he took it; he denied taking any thing out; he left the counting-house, and in consequence of what my clerk said, I called him in again, and said</p>
               <p>"I am informed you are rather flush of money to-day; I should be glad to know how you got it?" He said his mother gave it him. I said I would see her in the evening; he went into the shop, and in about five minutes I found he was gone. He returned in an hour and a half in a great perspiration. I asked where he had been - he said, into Shoe-lane to buy oil. I said, it could not be so, and sent for an officer; we examined his box and found several letters, but none of this property. I said I was positive he had taken something, and should give him in charge. He then cried and said, if I would let him remain till morning, he would tell me all about it; but I gave him in charge for stealing a number of panes of glass; and on Wednesday morning, the officer brought me this letter (producing it), which I know to be his writing. I have glass on my premises, and missed two boxes of window glass from a room on the floor he slept; we searched Elliott's premises by a warrant, but could recognise no glass; but I found a box there which I have every reason to believe is mine, but have no mark on it.</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Elliot, glazier Little Gray's Inn-lane. Dear Sir, I am sorry to have to write to you - but it is concerning some glass I sold to you last Sunday morning, which I am now confined about in Gilspur-street Compter, and if you will give me a call before one o'clock to-day, I shall be obliged, as we can settle about it.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Bride's. Mr. Arding sent for me on the 25th of August, to take the prisoner for stealing this glass. On going to the Compter, he said he took it and sold it to a poor man who he did not like to mention, as he had a large family. He afterwards said, it was Elliott, of Little Gray's-inn-lane. I went there next morning, and found Elliott lived near there. The letter was brought to me by the watchman, of Giltspur-street, from the Compter, to take to Elliott. I then went there with a warrant, and found the box.</p>

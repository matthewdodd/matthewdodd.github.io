            . I am clerk to Daniel Richardson - I have a Bill of Exchange (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How came that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100066"></xptr>Bill in the possession of Mr. Richardson? A. It was given to him by Mr. Crook to sue the parties - Crook is an auctioneer in Skinner-street - we were to sue the acceptor and endorser, not the drawer - I think it was placed in our hands for that purpose in the beginning of 1831 - I believe shortly after it arrived at maturity - Mr. Crook held the bill from Radford, a sheriff's officer - I called on him several times about it - proceedings were taken, and afterwards stayed, on an arrangement between the parties - Mr. Noel signed a cognovit - he was a party to the arrangement by which these proceedings were stayed - I never saw Mr. Nesbett, the endorser, in my life, till this indictment was found - I do not know how the bill came to remain in our office for three or four years - I suppose it was by mere oversight.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NESBETT. I am a <rs id="t18340410-136-viclabel758" type="occupation">coal merchant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18340410-136-victim861 t18340410-136-viclabel758"></join>. In 1830 I was acquainted with the prisoner - I knew him for a great many years - he has acted as my solicitor occasionally - this bill is drawn by a Mr. Goldsmid for £30 - the endorsement on it is not my handwriting - I never authorized the prisoner or anybody else to put that name on the bill - Mr. Noel has copied my hand repeatedly, and said, "See, I can do what I like with you, Nesbett" - I never signed this, nor authorized him to do it - I always told him never to do such a thing - I think this indictment was preferred last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. As upwards of three years have elapsed, give an explanation why this prosecution did not commence sooner? A. I was taken out of my bed on an execution of the cognovit - when the cognovit came due I had a letter sent to me- I was sent to prison, and continued in prison twenty-two months - I was compelled to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act - those are the causes why proceedings were not sooner instituted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You speak of being a coal merchant, how lately were you a coal merchant? A. I believe it is ever since I was taken into custody - I could not do business - I believe that is three years ago next July - I have only dealt in a few chaldrons since I have been out of business - I dealt in coals until I went to prison - since I have been out of prison I have been supported by a young gentleman, named McBeath, who is a godson of mine - no gentleman, named Bond, has helped to support me - I know two persons named Bond - I never was in Bond's house knowingly - I was never in a house where he carried on a gaming-table, to my knowledge - I do not know that ever he did keep a house that I was in - I was never in a house where gaming was going on, and where Mr. Bond was present at the time: that I am certain of- I know the Bonds by knowing their mother about thirty years ago - I have heard one of them is named Ephraim, and believe the other is Joseph - I saw them last, three, four, or five months ago - I met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether Mr. Noel has been prosecuting these gentlemen for keeping a gaming-house? A. I know nothing of it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, and tell me if that acceptance is your handwriting? (handing him a paper No. 1). A. Why, really it may be, but I cannot swear positively to it, for I do not know that I ever wrote so bad as this - I do not mean to say that this is not my handwriting - I rather think this one is something like it (No. 2) - on my oath I cannot swear whether it is my handwriting or not - I am doubtful of it, because the N is not like mine, and the W, but it probably may be - I know my own handwriting - it may be mine; most likely it is - on my oath I cannot tell whether it is my handwriting - it may be; but I am doubtful of it - this one (No. 3) is like that - it is doubtful - it is not like my handwriting at all; but it may be - I rather think the W looks like mine, and it may probably be my handwriting; but it is not like my handwriting, which I always generally write - the W is something like mine, but the s is not mine to my knowledge - I never made such an S as this in my life, to my knowledge - but probably it may be - (looking at a paper, No. 4) - this is my handwriting, and yet there is an alteration in the s; but yet I believe it is my handwriting - (looking at a paper, No. 5) - yes; that is my handwriting, and you will see it is not like the rest - this is my handwriting - (No. 6) - the endorsement on the bill in question, is not my handwriting - I never did such a thing - it was through this bill, that I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I think it was in last September, six months ago, that I was discharged - I think it was in September that I appeared in the Insolvent Court - I never knew of Mr. Crook, nor heard of him till I was taken in execution by him through the cognovit, which the prisoner signed - I was taken out of bed through the cognovit; before that I had a letter sent to me - I never signed any cognovit - I never signed that cognovit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The question was, did you ever sign any cognovit? A. I don't recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you sign that cognovit on which you were taken in execution? A. I never knew of it - I never signed it - I never knew of the action till I was taken out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me you were taken in execution and carried to prison at the suit of Mr. Crook on this cognovit? A. Yes, I was certainly - I never was released, and when I took the benefit of the Act, that was against me - I certainly was detained on that at the time I took the benefit of the Act - I don't know to the contrary - I don't know that it was settled in any way before - I had no other bill transactions in any way whatever, in which Mr. Crook could be a creditor of mine, except that Bill of Exchange - I don't believe the writing on these sheets of parchment to be mine (looking at some) - they are not like it - I could swear they are not (looking at one of them) - I think I could swear positively this is not my handwriting - the second is my handwriting - the first is not - I don't believe the third is - here is another, which I rather think is my handwriting - I cannot give you an opinion - there is a great deal of difference in it - there is a great appearance of mine - the top of this, I have in my hand, appears like my writing, but I don't believe the second is, at the bottom - I went into the Insolvent Debtors' Court, and was discharged- I then swore to my schedule.</p>

            . I am a solicitor - I have known Mr. Nesbett as long as I can remember - I don't believe the name Nesbett on the back of this bill to be like Nesbett's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you acquainted with a gentlemen named Bond? A. Yes - I have known them as long as I can remember, only as neighbours<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100067"></xptr>- I don't follow the same calling as they do - I don't know what they profess to be - they lived in Norfolk-street, Strand- I lived there - they also lived in St. James's-street - I have been in the habit of visiting them in St. James's-street for the last three years - I can't say whether they keep the house there or lodge there - it is a private house - the house in Norfolk-street is a private house now, and was so when they lived in it - they did not live in St. James's-street and Norfolk-street at the same time - they lived with their mother in Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Noel acts as solicitor against those persons for keeping a gambling-house? A. I have heard so - I have not said it was for keeping a gambling-house - I never saw the indictment - I have been on intimate terms with Nesbett - I am not the person who introduced him to the Bonds - he has been there with me - I cannot exactly remember when I last saw the Bonds, but it was within a week - we have spoken of this prosecution certainly - it has been a general conversation amongst all the acquaintance - Mr. Nesbett has been present at the conversation - I have been with his solicitor, but cannot say whether he has, when Bonds were present.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you appear as a witness at the instigation of the Bonds? A. No; Mr. Storvill is the attorney, who conducts this prosecution - I do not know whether he is an acquaintance of Bonds - I did not say I had seen them together - I said, it was a general subject of conversation - I never saw Mr. Storvill in the presence of the Bonds - I am very well acquainted with the handwriting of Nesbett - I think he generally writes alike in his signatures, or I could not swear to his handwriting - I could name two or three peculiarities in the endorsement of the bill in question - the W is not like his at the commencement - it is not made like his W - it wants the curl at the commencement - it is not upright enough, nor round enough, nor thick enough - the whole of the signature is not thick enough - it is something like his handwriting - the last "bett" is like it, if it was thicker - he cannot write so fine as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the fineness or thickness of a man's writing depend on how he chooses to lean on his pen? A. I should think so; or the pen itself - I cannot swear he could not write so fine, if he tried - he does not generally write so fine - any person intimately acquainted with his handwriting would say this is not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that (No. 3:) do you believe that acceptance to be in his handwriting? A. The W does not look like it, but I think the "Nesbett" is his handwriting- you see it is crossed over, but I cannot give so correct an opinion on this, as the other, because this is not crossed- I should say the "Nesbett" is his handwriting, but I do not think the W is - it has not the curl - I think the"Nesbett" is his handwriting, and the W not - I will not swear to it as the N is like his writing - he is in the habit of signing "Wm." - the m is not always legible (looking at No. 2), I believe this to be his handwriting this (No. 1) is the most like his handwriting of any - I have no doubt at all about it - (looking at No. 4) I have my doubts about this - I think it is his, but I have my doubts - I should say it was his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the signatures on these parchments: what do you say to those sheets? A. This is decidedly - so is this - so is this; and so is the other - the two signatures on the last page of the parchment are exactly like his- I find two W's with the commencing loop - here are six signatures all together; five on the parchment, and one on the paper - all the signatures are his - the fifth parchment has two signatures - here are more than two W's with loops; for I see two are signed on both sides of the parchment - (looking at a deed of composition) - this signature is the handwriting of Mr. Nesbett.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of seeing the prosecutor write seven years ago? A. Yes, frequently - perhaps infirmity may have made him write more tremulous now - I should think there was no difference in his hand - I cannot speak positively, because men do not always write alike - I have not observed any difference, unless it is more tremulous.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why do you believe it not to be his? A. I have seen bills I have paid him, and bills he paid me - his writing is more likely to be written with a grimey stick than this - it is stronger - the W turns differently altogether - the beginning of the W is different in the turn - this has got no turn at all - he makes an open turn, a turn like that - (writing the letter W on a piece of paper) - I consider it altogether not like his - I consider his W is as open as that I have made - he always writes the W so; and that one letter in particular not being written so, I do not believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the acceptance on this bill (No. 1) - tell me if you believe that to be Nesbett's handwriting? A. No, I do not think this is. - (Looking at No. 2) - I do not think this is his handwriting, according to my knowledge - I do not consider this (No. 3) is his; nor this (No. 4) - I do not believe the W. Nesbett on this first parchment to be his handwriting (looking at the parchment) - I do not believe the second sheet to be his handwriting; nor the third, to my knowledge - I do not believe it is - I do not believe the fourth to be his, not according to my knowledge of his handwriting; nor the fifth.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not believe any one signature on these parchments to be his? A. Not to my knowledge of his writing - I know Joseph Bond, who lives in Salisbury-street - he never lived in St. James's-street to my knowledge - he lodged in Norfolk-street, and kept a house in Salisbury-street, I believe - I never had any thing to do with his brother Ephraim - there is such a person certainly; but I know nothing of him - I have no connexion with him - I have lent his brother Joseph horses and chaises - I know Mr. McBeath very well, and I know his mother - I am bail for him - I do not know whether it is in a civil case for a debt, or for a prosecution - I entered into the bail at the Judge's chambers.</p>

            . I am an attorney. My father was clerk to Mr. Justice James Parke, but he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100068"></xptr>dead - I do not believe the endorsement on this bill, in the name of Nesbett, is the prosecutor's signature - I have seen him write frequently.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Who applied to you to give an opinion on this? A. I was applied to last Saturday by Mr. McBeath, who has been an acquaintance of mine for the last eight or nine years - I sometimes do business for him as agent - I know Layburn - I have seen him here this morning - I was never in any matter concerned for McBeath in which Layburn became bail for him - I should say it is five months ago since I saw Nesbett write - I think I can form a tolerable opinion of his handwriting by the character of the W - his handwriting is stiffer than that signature, and I do not think he writes so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature to that bill (No. 1), do you believe that to be his handwriting or not? A. I do, in consequence of the curl at the commencement of the W - this one (No. 2) is something like it - I believe it to be his handwriting - there is a thick mark, and a slight curl, but not particularly round. - (Looking at No. 3) - I never saw him write in this way before - I believe "Nesbett" to be his handwriting, but not the W. - this looks like his handwriting(No. 4) - I believe it to be his - I believe all the signatures on these five skins of parchment to be his handwriting - (looking at the deed of composition) the character of the W is like his handwriting, but the N is not - it is in the style of his handwriting - I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. These things have all been shown to you to-day for the first time? A. I never saw them before; and this bill I never saw till half-past nine o'clock this morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHN McBEATH re-examined. Q. The witness says he was bail for you, what was it for? A. Keeping a gaming-house - I have not been concerned in keeping a gaming-house - the charge is brought to invalidate my testimony in this case - Mr. Noel, I believe, is the attorney in that prosecution - I know he applied for the certificate of the indictment, and offered the officer a guinea to do it.</p>

            . I am a sheriff's officer. I received this bill from Mr. Noel - Mr. Nesbett's name was on it at that time - I cashed it for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you known Mr. Noel before that transaction? A. Yes; a great many years - I also knew Mr. Nesbett - I knew there were a good many cash and bill transactions between them - I have heard Nesbett say he has endorsed and cashed bills for Noel - I gave this bill to Mr. Crook - it was not paid when it came due - I saw Mr. Nesbett a good many times on it before procedings were taken at all - he said it was an accommodation - he has never denied but what it was his endorsement - only he said it was accommodation to serve Noel - I should not have gone to law with him if I had thought it had been any thing else - he always informed me that it was an accommodation; that I must go to Mr. Noel for the money, for he had accommodated Mr. Noel with it.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he come to you? A. He was afraid I would proceed against him, because I threatened I would, as the endorser of the bill - I was in the habit of meeting him at Mr. Noel's office a good many times - perhaps ten times - it was a long while after he was arrested - I do not think I saw him at my house - after proceedings were taken, the action was stayed on an arrangement.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you present when the arrangement was made? A. I was obliged to consent to it - I believe Nesbett was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. After proceedings were taken, did you see Nesbett on the subject? A. I cannot say that I did - I received the acceptance of other persons, on account of the bill - Nesbett was the endorser of the bill I received- I have one of the bills here - this is one of the bills I received in exchange for this - Nesbett is the drawer of that bill - I believe it is the same hand - no doubt the prosecutor is the person who called on me about the bill.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you had a conversation with the prosecutor about the bill, the bill, I believe, was in the hands of Crook? A. It was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor expressly admit the endorsement was his signature, or that he had authorized anybody to sign it for him? A. He has admitted it is his handwriting, because he said, "I did it for accommodating Mr. Noel - I accommodated him with my name to serve him" - those were the very words he used - I swear positively that the prosecutor made that admission that it was his handwriting, and he did it to accommodate Noel - I do not think there was any body present, I cannot say; when I was talking to Nesbett he was speaking of the indorsement of the bill - I had not got the bill - I had no other bill on his endorsement to which it could apply.(Mr. Alley here withdrew from the prosecution.)</p>

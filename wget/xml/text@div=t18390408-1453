                  </hi>. I am the wife of Dennis Santry, and live at Rother<lb></lb>hithe, in the same house as the prisoner, and Margaret Mulchannaugh. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 15th of March I was lying on my bed—I heard the prisoner outside at the foot of the stairs, calling me by an expression not fit to mention—in the course of ten mi<lb></lb>nutes I heard her again addressing me with the same kind of expression as before—I went down stairs, and knocked at her door, and told her I wanted to speak to her—the second time I spoke she opened the door, and let me in—I told her she deserved a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> for her filthy language to me—she told me to hit her—I said I did not feel myself able to do it, but if I was, she deserved it for her abuse to me—she took bold of my hair with her left hand, took her right hand from behind her back, and I felt her stab me on the left side of my head with a knife, but I did not see the knife till after Mrs. Mulcbannaugh came up and took it out of her hand—I was standing up at the time—directly I saw the blood over me, I got so weak I fell down directly—I had two wounds and a scratch—I put up my left hand in my defence, and it cut through my fingers—I felt pain from the cuts, and was very unwell indeed—I was attended by a surgeon for ten days—the blood-vessel then burst out again, and I sent for the doctor, who is attending me still.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Mulchannangh and lodged in the house. On the morning of the 15th of March, I heard the prosecutrix scream out—I went to her—she was standing in the pri<lb></lb>soner's room—the prisoner had got hold of her hair by her left hand, and had a carving knife in her right hand—I saw her stab the prosecutrix in the left side of the head, before I had power to take the knife from her—I saw blood come from the prosecutrix—I took the knife from the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it inside the fender—I had heard the prisoner come to the foot of the stairs, and abuse the prosecutrix as she lay on her bed.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning of the 15th of March, I was called into the prisoner's house, and took her into custody—her husband gave me this knife—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I asked the prisoner how she came to do it—she said both the witness and the prosecutrix rushed in upon her—that the knife laid on the table, and she laid hold of it to save herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

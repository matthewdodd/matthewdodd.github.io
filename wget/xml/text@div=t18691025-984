                  </hi>. I live at London Road, Southwark, and am a paper manufacturer—on 25th September Green came to my shop, and said his employer had taken a shop in the neighbourhood, and had instructed him to buy papers for him—I said, "Will you take patterns?"—he said, "No,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250125"></xptr>
               <p>he left it to me to select the patterns"—he selected sixty-eight pieces of paper—he said, "Never mind the invoice, send it with the goods, and the money will be paid"—the address he gave me was 98, Kennington Road—I sent them on the Monday following, by Michael Meyers, and gave him instructions not to leave them without the money—Meyers brought the goods back, and not the money—in consequence of what he told me I sent him again, next day, with them—he came back then without the goods, and without to money—he brought this card with him—in consequence of what I read upon that card, I went to Grimscote Street, Bermondsey, and made inquiries for a Mr. J. Perry, but could find no such person there on the following day, Wednesday, I went to 98, Kennington Park Road, and saw Green—I asked him why he took the goods away from the boy—he said, "The money is all right"—I said, "As a man of business, you ought to know better; he told you he was not to leave the goods without the money"—he said I should have the money by 4 o'clock, when he would see Mr. Perry—I left him—he called on me the same evening—he said Mr. Perry had not been to the place, and I should have the money early in the morning—he did not come again—I went to 98, Kennington Park Road again, and saw Perry—I asked him who took the goods in, and he said he did—I said I thought it was Green, and he said, "No, I did"—I told him I had called about the money, and he said he would see Mr. Perry about it—I asked Mr. Perry's address; but he said he could not give it me—I asked for his address, and he said, "You will always find me here, I am employed by Mr. Perry"—I asked him his name, and after some time he said his name was Smith—I asked him who the man was who had ordered the goods; at first he said he was a stranger to him, and then, before I left, he said his name was Green—he did not know where he lived, or any<lb></lb>thing about him—I said, "Possibly Mr. Perry is a myth, and there is no such person"—he said, "Oh, yes there is, I get my money from him, and see him every night"—it was quite contrary to my orders that the goods were parted with without the money—I went to 7, Lambeth Walk, a week or so after, and saw some of my goods there—there were ten pieces of paper—part of the quantity I had sent by Meyers to 98, Kennington Park Boad—about 100 yards altogether—the sixty-eight pieces, altogether, would be about 700 yards.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Robinson—on Monday, 25th September, I was sent with sixty-eight pieces of paper, to 98, Kennington Park Road—I had a bill with the receipt on it—I was not to leave the goods without the money—I saw Perry at the house—he said his name was Smith, and he was doing the paper-hanging, and painting the place, and they were waiting for the paper, as they had got nothing to go on with—he said Mr. Perry had been waiting there all the morning, and could not wait any longer, and had gone home—I said, "Can you tell me where he lives?"—he said, "Somewhere down at Bermondsey"—he said, "You can leave them, the money is right enough"—I said, "Master gave me orders not to leave them without the money," and I took them back again with the bill—I went the next day, and saw Perry again—he said, "I have seen Mr. Parry last night, and he will be here every minute"—I waited an hour and three-quarters, and he said, "It is no good your waiting now, be<lb></lb>cause he won't be here; I think he was going to the bank to get a cheque asked, you had better leave the goods; I would not let you leave them if the money was not all right"—he wrote on a card, "J. Perry, Grimscote Street, Bermondsey," and said he was a miller, is a large way of business, on the right hand side of the way—I said, "Do you know what number?"—he said "I don't exactly know the number, but he is well known down there"—he also said that Mr. Perry was angry because I did not leave them on the Monday; that he would call and pay for the goods, as he wanted about hundred pieces more—I was persuaded to leave them—he said, "How much is the bill?"—I showed it him, and he tore the receipt off the bottom and gave it me back—he kept the bill—I took the receipt and card home to Mr. Robinson—he said his own name was James Smith—I called again the next day for the money, and the prisoner said his orders were that Mr. Perry would call down at 4 o'clock and order some more things—he said, "The money is all right; I would not like to get you into trouble."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. You took her up on suspicion of having a new pair of stays? A. Yes, and other things, as I knew she had no money; I swear to the pencil-case because it is the same as the others; there are quantities of that pattern made - one pair of the gold ear-rings are an old fashioned pattern which you will not find in London.</p>

            . I am the wife of Lyon Samuel. The prisoner lived five or six weeks with us; when she came the first time to us she was very badly clothed - she bought herself several new things; I missed a sovereign on Sunday - I asked how she came by her new stays; she said they were not new; I said, "Now, Susan, have you taken some of my things to get the money to buy these things?" we asked what she had taken - she put her hands into her pocket and pulled out a pencil-case, a pair of scissars, and two or three pairs of silver buttons; I think the buttons were in her pocket, but am not positive - the officer searched her box, which was open - she was present; he found two pairs of ear-rings, a seal, two pairs of cotton stockings, and two pieces of gold - the stockings are both marked B. and were mine; I have eight more pairs like them - my husband bought them ready marked; I do not know whether there were any stockings of her own in the box; I know them by being a particular kind - they have been worn, and are not worth 3s. 6d. - they were fine and not much worn; a key was found in her box which fitted four of my drawers - it would not open her box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any mark on the pencil? A. No; but we have five more like it; I had never worn the stockings - my husband bought a lot second-hand - and I had looked them over and seen them three or four times.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LIGHTFOOT. I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; Samuel charged her with robbing him - saying he had seen her with several new things, which caused his suspicion; he handed over to me a pencil-case and a pair of scissars - I searched the prisoner's pockets, and found two small bits of gold, a few pieces of cornelian, a pair of blue snaps, a small ring, and two or three beads; I found her box open, and in it this purse, with two pairs of ear-rings, a seal and ring, and three pairs of sleeve-buttons - they were all in the purse; I also found two pairs of stockings - I do not recollect seeing any more stockings there; she said she meant to give the things back again - I found 9s. 2d. in money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Samuel sent me out for a newspaper the day before, and while I was gone she and her mother searched my box; they said nothing to me, but when I came home, I found all the things out of my box: mistress seeing me with new stays, asked me where I got them - I said it was not her money that bought them; she afterwards said I had stolen a sovereign, and sent for an officer - they took off the stays, saying it was not my money that bought them, and I should not have the pleasure of wearing them.</p>
               <p>MRS. SAMUEL. I did not search her box in her absence; the stays were taken off her back - they are at my house; she could have put them on again if she liked - her box is still at my house; her mother was to send for it, but has not - her sister called for it once when I was out; I have not looked at her box since she left, and do not know whether the stays are there.</p>

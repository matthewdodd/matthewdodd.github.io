                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Jupp, a silversmith and salesman, High-street, Borough. On Saturday, the 24th of June, the prisoner Lyons came into the shop, with a little boy and Scannell—they purchased a suit of clothes for the boy, which came to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Lyons gave me what appeared a £10 Bank of England note—Scannell had very little to do with purchasing the clothes—he said he hoped it was a nice suit, as it was for a motherless child—on looking at the note I saw it was a very old date, and a bad-looking one—I said to Lyons, "How is it this note, bearing the date of 1832, has not been paid into the Bank of England?" and asked her something regarding her possession of it—I could not exactly say what it was, but I was satisfied with her answer, though I forget what the answer was—she did not ask me any questions—she gave the address Mary Lyons, and said she lived at No. 7, Cornwall-road, Blackfriar's-road—I wrote that on the face of the note—I have since been there, and found no such person living there; and I inquired at No. 7, Cornwall-place, and no such person had ever lived there—the note has been since sent to the Bank of England.</p>

            , I am foreman to Mr. Jefferies, No. 10, Barbican. On the 31st of May, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a pair of shoe strings, they came to two pence, she tendered to me a bad shilling; I then produced a counterfeit shilling that she had brought the over night, and went for a constable. I delivered the prisoner and the two shillings to the constable.</p>

            . On the 30th of May the prisoner came into my shop for a pair of shoe strings, I served her, they came to two-pence; she gave me a shilling and I gave her change. I noticed a C upon it, and put it into my pocket; I had one other shilling in my pocket, that shiling had no mark upon it at all; she went away, and about six or seven o'clock the same evening she came in again for a pair of shoe strings; she was served with them, they came to two pence; she gave me a shilling, I gave her change; immediately upon her going I had a suspicion; I sent my man after her, he could not see her. The last shilling I kept in my hand, I compared it with the other shilling with the C, I discovered they were both counterfeits; I then put them in my pocket separate. I know this shilling with the C upon it to be the first shilling that the prisoner tendered to me. These are the shillings; the first shilling has a C upon it, and the third shilling a P. Sometime after the prisoner was gone a customer came into my shop, she wanted a sixpence in change of the article she purchased; I gave the first shilling with a C upon it to my man to get two sixpences; I saw the same shilling on the next morning, Mrs. Watts said it was a bad one, she brought it back to me. I knew it to be the first shilling tendered to me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ibbett. Your master has told us that he gave you the first shilling uttered with a C upon it, and you got two sixpences of Mrs. Watts - A. Yes; she refused it at the time. The same shilling that I received from my master I gave to Mrs. Watts.</p>
               <p>MRS. WATTS. I live at the Still in Barbican; I received a shilling of Ibbett, I gave him two sixpences; I laid it by itself; afterwards I discovered it to be a bad one, it was marked with a letter C. I returned the shilling to Mr. Jefferies.</p>
               <p>- SUNDERLAND. I am a constable. Ibbett gave me two shillings, and when the second examination was I had another shilling gave me by Ibbett.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ibbett. Did you give the last shilling uttered to you to the constable - A. Yes; it has a letter P upon it.</p>

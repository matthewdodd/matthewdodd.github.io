I have two rooms in the lower apartment; I always bolt my windows when I go out, every one; I am sure I left my room secure; I returned about a quarter before eight.

I did not miss every thing at first, till I came but again; then I missed the blankets, bolster, and two pillows; then I missed my footman, tongs, and fire-shovel; then I missed one curtain of the bed and the tester, and head-cloth; I cannot say I missed any thing more than my son's cloths. The lock was either picked or opened with a false key; it was not broke; the padlock was opened and hung on a ring; my son went to Bow-street; he gave information, and the prisoners were taken. I saw my property again on the Wednesday; it is here. This happened on Monday evening, the 19th of last month; and on the Wednesday following, I saw some of my things at Mr. Wilmot's office in Shoreditch. I saw my footman and my bolster at the prisoner, Hannaway's room, where one of the officers took me; I believe that was on the Thursday.</p>

               <p>What did near you to observe the door? - Sometimes I am up and down stairs twenty times in the day, and I observe it on account of my neighbours, because her door is near the stairs; and between seven and eight, I went down, and saw the door open, and the padlock hanging.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know that Mrs. Hilton was out that afternoon? - I did not know she was out; then my fright was so great, I hastened up stairs as fast as I could to call assistance; and about two minutes after this, when we came down stairs, the fore-door was wide open, and all her things were gone; that was about half past seven. I am sure, upon my oath, that at six I saw the door secure.</p>

There was a knock at the door; that was about eight; we were there before day-light. Lucy and Harper went down stairs: I heard a noise; I went to the assistance of Harper; I took Cole from him, and brought him up stairs, and searched him immediately; and found in one pocket this black silk cloak, and this waistcoat in another.</p>
               <p>Was it you or the other officer that knocked at the door first? - All of us.</p>
               <p>Did you get in immediately? - No, Sir, they answered, they would not let us in, Lucy called to me, they are throwing something out of the window: I being the lightest, went round, and secured the property.</p>
               <p>Was there any body with Cole? - I was not soon enough; they took him from Harper directly.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in Hannaway's lodgings? - I saw a number of things found, which Shakeshaft has got. The things that were thrown out, are nothing in this business at all. I searched the prisoner Happy, after he was brought up by Lucy and Harper: I found this pincushion upon him; that was all I found upon him; that was in his pocket. I asked Cole where he lived; he gave me his key, and and a direction to Marybone; I went, but could find no place. Happy refused giving us any answer at all. I never found their lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. What alarmed you first, was a noise in the street? - Yes. Here is a bit of lace, which I found in Cole's pocket; it was doubled up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These things are mine; this bit of lace I know; I sewed it together to make a lappet to a cap; I have had it many years; I could swear to it any where; and I know it by having sewed it together: there are two yards of it, and another two yards of another sort. The cloak I know by my own mending and making. The waistcoat I know; it is my son's: I put a piece of dimitty down the back, to keep him warm, one day when it was cold.</p>

               <p>I am another officer of Justice Wilmot's. I went, in company with Armstrong, and Shakeshaft, and Lucy, on Tuesday, the 30th of December, to these lodgings. We were there some time before the door was open. Me, Lucy, and Armstrong, were up in the chamber, looking over a many things that were there; and I heard somebody knock at the door: I went down to see who it was; Lucy came down after me; and as soon as I opened the door, I saw Cole and the other prisoner at the door with these two bundles in their hands; Cole had this, and Happy had this. I laid hold of Cole, with the bundle; the other threw the bundle down, close to my feet. Lucy pursued him, and took him within a few yards, in my presence. I saw this bundle in Happy's hand. There were some things found in Hannaway's room belonging to the prosecutrix; Shakeshaft has them. This is the bundle that Cole had.</p>
               <p>(Opened, and shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>I know this handkerchief, by cutting it out in the neck: it was very large; and they were not worn so large then.</p>
               <p>Court. Pick out two or three of the things that you best know, and can give the best marks of; but you may speak generally, as to your belief, of the rest.</p>
               <p>This apron I know by a little darn at the bottom; I know it by that, and the binding of it is my own. This cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140086"></xptr>gown is mine. I can swear to it, by mending it and wearing it; I know the gown.</p>
               <p>Have you looked over the other things in the bundle? - Yes; and what I said was mine, is mine.</p>
               <p>What are the rest of the articles in the bundle? - These belong to my son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hilton. This is my coat; I know it by the buttons, and a kind of seam that I think is under the left-arm. They are remarkable buttons, in the shape of a heart, inlaid with white; and a piece of cloth has been cut out of the pocket, and seamed under the right-arm. This waistcoat I know is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Now remove these things, and open the bundle that Happy had.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hilton. This is my sheet; I know it by my making, by the hem: they are not marked; there is another, the fellow of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hilton. These breeches are mine; they are jean; and they have been stained by tea, just under the pocket-hole, which has made a white mark, and I know them by that; I am quite certain of them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Here are some things that were taken out of the prisoner Hannaway's room. We found this hat, and this sheet, and these handkerchiefs, before the men came there; and this other sheet, this footman, and this bolster. When Mrs. Hilton came to the office, I recollected the footman being in the room, and I took the prisoner out of Bridewell; she had the key, and took Mrs Hilton to the room, and these things were there. When we got up into the room, after she opened the door, I said to her, who lives here? says she, me; says I, nobody else? no, says she, 
nobody else. I asked her who the goods belonged to; she said, to me. I went to 
fetch a person that had broke open another house, on Saffron-hill; and, in the mean time, Harper and Lucy had taken Cole and Happy. We asked her who these things belonged to, and she said they were her's. After we had 
found them, and the things were owned, she said somebody had brought them there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That footman is mine, and this bolster is mine, and this is the fellow to the other sheet; and this I had just turned, and it is worn on one side.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the whole property that you lost? - Upon my word, I did not put down the value particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick. The value is about eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Are they of the full value you have laid them in the indictment? - They are.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Who carried on this proseution? - I cannot afford to do it.</p>
               <p>Who advised you? - My son went to the office to give information; and that was the way it was done.</p>
               <p>Why did not you indict the woman for receiving these things, knowing them to be stolen?</p>
               <p>PRISONER COLE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going along this morning that I was taken, and I met a shoemaker, a young man, that had a pair of shoes of mine to mend. Happy was with me; he gave me the two bundles to take to his room, and he said he would give me a pair of shoes he had to mend.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HAPPY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I say the same, that this young man gave me one of the bundles. Knocking at the door of the shoemaker's room, this man came and opened the door, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Happy called one witness to his character.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Jones. You swear that you never saw the coat in his possession? - I did not see him take it or drop it, but I took him on suspicion because the property was dropt at his feet; when I took up the coat, he immediately pulled at the coat again, he wanted to get away from me.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to say, that he laid hold of the coat? - No.</p>

               <p>Singleton. I was about twenty yards off, and law the man and the woman pulling against one another with the coat, she was pulling it away from him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that he ever had a hand upon the coat? - Certainly he had, I saw his hand upon it, I took charge of the prisoner, this is the same coat.</p>

            . I am a watchman. This house is on my beat. At a quarter before ten o'clock on the night of the 17th of March, I came to the back part of the building, and saw one man on the top of the house, and the prisoner on the ladder; I took him before he got out of my sight; I asked what he was doing there; he gave me no answer, but slid down the ladder which was in the garden; I was close to the garden wall; he then got over the wall into the yard of the next house; I went after him and took hold of him there; he begged of me to let him go, and he would do so no more; the other got away. I saw Mr. Edwards about half-past eleven; we found the lead at the foot of the ladder.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I took possession of the lead at a public-house adjoining; it was claimed by Mr. Edwards; I measured it with the top of the house and it exactly corresponded with it - here is about 200 lbs. I had known the prisoner some time - I questioned him how he came to do it - he said it was not him who cut it but another lad named Sanders, whom he had seen two or three times before.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

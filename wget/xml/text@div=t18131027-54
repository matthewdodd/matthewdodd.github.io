I had a pint of beer there, and when I came out the man that went in with me he was at the bar. I left him there. I went into the back room. I was told there was a man that wanted me there, the man that I wanted to see, but I did not find him. In about five minutes I left the room, and went to the front door. As I was going along the passage, about the middle of the passage I was struck by a man on my breast, that met me. He drawed my watch out immediately. I got hold of his clothes, and closed with him; in the scuffle we fell, both of us. I still kept my hold, and he was drawed to the street door; some of the people in the house came and drawed him to the street door. They opened the door, and drew him out. I laid hold of him by the legs before he was drawed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any violence offered to you while they were drawing out - A. They kept heating my hands. Several people said I should have my watch in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you hold of him by the legs before they dragged him out - A. Not above two minutes. When I had hold of his leg I perceived he had a high shoe on. I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday afterwards at Bow-street office. I described his foot on Monday, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his person in the passage - A. He took me so unawares I cannot swear to his person. The person that was down with me in the passage was the man that had my watch. His name was Brighton Cotten. I cannot swear to the person of the prisoner. I never got my watch again. I never was in this public-house before. The landlord's name is Bennett.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Wheatsheaf public-house. I have kept it near three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have seen two or three times at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night, the 9th of October, were you at home - A. I was. I saw the prisoner in my house that night, and I saw Brown also there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a bustle in the passage - A. I only saw a bustle in the passage. The passage leads from the back room to the tap. I was in the taproom; I could see the bustle, but not those that were in it. I was at that time in the act of turning a man out of the tap room that came in with Brown; he was tipsey and troublesome, and so was Brown. There were a great many people in the passage. The prosecutor went to the door; the person that was with him said that he had no watch with him when he came into the house. Brown was by; he made no reply to what the man said</p>
               <p>Brown. I am very sure I had my watch with me when I came into the house. The man that went with me he was very tipsey. The witness, Bennett, saw the seal at my watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Bennett. I cannot say that he had a watch I saw he had one seal and a key.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was before the magistrate, Brown said he would swear to me by the buckle in my shoe. I asked for time to bring people forward to prove that I had no buckle shoes on at the time; they would not.</p>

            . I am a servant, and live in Theobald's-road. On the 16th of March I was in my master's gig, in <placeName id="t18260406-169-crimeloc905">Oxford-street</placeName>

I saw the prisoner, and another female with her, pass by her, about two or three yards - they then returned, and looked at her reticule; they returned again, and looked at it again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060071"></xptr>- two ladies then came by - the prisoner pushed between them, and took something out of the reticule, but I could not see what - she crossed, and gave something to her companion. I pulled my horse from behind a carriage, went up to Miss Stringer, and asked if she had lost any thing; she said she had that moment lost her purse out of her reticule; I said I could show her the person. Clements then took the prisoner in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this in broad day-light? A. Yes - a quarter before one o'clock; there were two ladies not half a yard from Miss Stringer; they had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner; she rushed between them, and put her hand into the open reticule, but they took no notice of it; they were close by the side of the prosecutrix, and going in the same direction; I do not know whether they saw it or not; I got out of my gig in about ten minutes - the ladies had walked some distance - I did not call to them to stop, nor did not call Stop thief! The prisoner was in the crowd, and a person (who is not here) had seized her - as soon as I got out he let her go, and I took her. I do not know what became of her companion; there was nothing found on the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Marshall-street, Golden-square. I was in Oxford-street about one o'clock on the 16th of March - I had no servant with me - I had my reticule on my arm, and both my hands were in my muff - the money stated in the indictment was in a beaded purse, and 5d. in halfpence, which I had just received in change. I drew up to a window, and in a moment I felt the bag much lighter. I turned round, and found it was open; I am quite certain I had the money a few minutes before. As I turned, the witness said to me, "Have you lost any thing?" I said, "Oh, dear! I have lost my purse;" he said, "Cross over, and I will show you the girl who put her hand into your bag." I crossed the wide crossing, and stopped the prisoner; I told her I had lost my purse, and from what the young man had said, it must have been her who took it; she was much displeased at my stopping her, and in a moment I was surrounded by a great crowd, and a young man said, "Oh! here is your purse," showing me a beaded purse, which was not mine, and had only some duplicates in it. I have never seen my purse or money since; Bowler's master said he would drive the gig home, and he should go with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the purse shortly before? A. Yes - I had been in a shop in Regent-street; I think I must have left my reticule open, as the snap appears to be a very good one. I cannot say whether there were any ladies near me; I had not stopped - I merely drew up to a window; the purse was rather heavy, having the copper in it - I did not feel it taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of Nicholas Wallis. The prisoner ironed for me, and it was her duty to make out bills, to take linen home, and to receive money—on the 12th of November she went to Sarah Te, and she brought me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said the bill was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but Mrs. Ten said she had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 2nd December did you desire the prisoner to make a bill out for Mrs. Ten? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she made it, and came and brought me a sovereign—she said she had made the bill 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but Mrs. Ten discovered it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, but she had kept half-a-crown for some things that were missing.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Mrs. Ten changed her laundress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was her laundress—I believe she now employs the prisoner's mother—I was not angry about it—my husband never interferes with my business—I have heard he went to the prisoner's mother and threatened to be revenged on her for getting my washing, but I do not believe it—I know he went to speak to her about the money—I am no scholar, and he does interfere with the books—I have been married three months—I owed some money, which my husband did not know of—I owed the prisoner some money—I do not know whether my husband knew there was a reckoning between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner came from Mrs. Ten, and paid you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than you thought you ought to have received, did she not ask you to give her some money on her own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told her to come in the evening, and we would have a reckoning, and see how it stood—I have not been to her mother's—the prisoner has not borrowed money at one shop to pay what I owed at another—I had employed her three or four years.</p>

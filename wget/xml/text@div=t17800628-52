               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Charlton. On the 7th of this instant, the mob came to Mr. Charlton's; the prisoner came to me, I was at the corner of Mr. Charlton's house; he asked me if I knew what that house was, meaning Mr. Charlton's; I said no, no more than he, I was a stranger. He lifted up his hand to my head, and said if I told him a lye he would knock my brains out.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon in his hand? - I do not know that he had.</p>
               <p>Were there a great number of people rioting then? - Yes. He turned away from me, and I went to a friend's house. In about a quarter of an hour I returned into the street; I saw the prisoner ringing a bell and collecting money.</p>
               <p>What condition was Mr. Charlton's house in before the mob came? - In a very good condition.</p>
               <p>How was it when they went away? - In a very deplorable condition; the window frames were entirely destroyed, and I believe the wainscoting except one room on one side. The goods were entirely destroyed up two-pair-of-stairs; part of the garret floor was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of the prisoner? - No.</p>

I immediately sent my son to the Lord Mayor to request the favour of him to send some assistance. Alderman Bull came into the street about three o'clock; he stopped his carriage opposite Mr. Baker's the distiller's house; there was a lane made through the mob for the prisoner to go to Mr. Bull's carriage; he went up to the alderman and conversed with him some time.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoner before? - Yes. Sometime before I saw him near the house at the pile of household furniture and wainscoting. He was breaking it, and loading it into a cart, which I understood was to take it into Moorfields to be burnt. I saw it go down Coleman street.</p>
               <p>What number of persons do you suppose there were about the house and in it? - There were many hundreds there who had blue cockades.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend the prisoner to be the leader of the mob? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was this line made for him? - He went up to the carriage; he had some conversation with Mr. Bull. I was at my window and did not hear what it was; he then left the carriage and went to the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see him afterwards? - Yes, taking an active part in loading away the furniture and part of the dwelling-house; and I saw him afterwards going about the neighbourhood and demanding money.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from the prisoner what the money was collected for? - No.</p>
               <p>Or from any one in his company when he was present? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>You was looking out at your dining-room window? - I was.</p>
               <p>Where was the cart? - A little below the pile. The pile was opposite Mr. Charlton's house; their heads were turned towards Moorfields. The pile was on the side of the house towards Cheapside; not above fifteen or twenty yards from it.</p>
               <p>Are you certain to the prisoner? - I am.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280129"></xptr>He was only employed about the cart, you did not see him in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner there before the mob began to demolish the house of Mr. Charlton? - I did not; they had begun before I got there; they began the mischief, I believe, about two o'clock; I first saw the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he go to Alderman Bull's coach in a peaceable or an hostile manner? - In a peaceable manner.</p>
               <p>Was he less active after he had been to Alderman Bull? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did it take to demolish this house? - 'Till between five and six o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mr. Charlton, in Coleman-street.</p>
               <p>Were you there on the 7th of June last? - Yes. I was there, to the best of my knowledge, about two in the afternoon; the mob came about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>What numbers might they consist of? - About six or eight at first, but the number encreased to two or three hundred I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner among them? - Yes, he was the first who came up to the door about two o'clock; he asked for the books. I told him there were none in the house.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any particular books? - No; he knew what the people were by all account. I told him there were none. The prisoner with about a dozen more rushed into the house before I left the door, and I saw no more of him afterwards; I suppose they went up stairs, for the furniture of the dining room was begun to be thrown out in five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened when the mob came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other ten or a dozen men? - No; the prisoner was the tallest of them all. I was not very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Jury. You was not so much frightened but you can recollect the person of the prisoner? - I can; he came first up to the door, and was the first who came into the house.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said he spoke to you? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did any of the rest speak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you know any of the other persons if you were to see them again? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing the prisoner? - For full ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes, else I would not take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - Not till to-day in Wood-street Compter.</p>
               <p>Who took you there? - A young gentleman who will give his evidence, Mr. Jaques.</p>
               <p>Did he show you the prisoner, or did you see him with others? - I knew him as soon as I saw him among the others.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Was you taken to the prison to-day to see the prisoner in order to know him when you came here? - I was taken to see him, to know if I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you not before the magistrate? - I was not called upon to go.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner there on the 7th of June? - About three quarters of an hour after the mob came, I saw him in the house; when they first went in they broke some bottles of aqua fortis, which set fire to part of the counter. I took in some water to put it out; then I saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he was doing any thing at that time? - I cannot recollect that he was doing any thing at that instant.

               <p>What was he employed in? - I am sorry to say I saw him demolishing the furniture and wainscoting which were thrown out at Mr. Charlton's window.</p>

               <p>Was you in Coleman-street at the time the mob assembled? - I was at home from one to four o'clock; I saw the prisoner come up the street with four or five other men; he stopped opposite my door; then he, or one of his companions, said, this is a distiller's; they then turned about and went to the house of Mr. Charlton; I saw the prisoner enter the house, and with some instrument, some time after, destroy the sashes of the shop.</p>
               <p>How long was that after he went in? - I suppose not more than twenty minutes or half an hour; I saw him afterwards destroying the goods which were thrown out of the house, and assisting in loading them into the cart, and, to my great astonishment, I saw him step to the pile of goods, which were thrown out of the house at that time. Mr. Sheriff Pugh was there with the Guards, I think that was nearly the last time I saw him.</p>

               <p>Was he dressed the same as he is now? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>May not you be mistaken in the man? - I believe I am not.</p>

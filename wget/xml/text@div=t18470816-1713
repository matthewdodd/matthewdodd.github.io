                  </hi> I am a grocer and tea-dealer, in the Bethnal-green-road. The prisoner Evans was in my service as assistant for about nine months, and left six or seven months ago—in March last I was in some pecuniary difficulties, and wished to raise some money on some goods—I consulted Evans on the subject—he said he had a brother or a friend in the trade, who would take these goods of him, and I should have the money to pay a dividend to my creditors there and then—he said it was the only plan I could adopt to raise the money and to pay it down directly; and the party I employed stated it would be much easier and better for him to do it, if I could pay the money there and then, and that was the only way I could do it—in consequence of that, I entrusted the property to Evans—the arrange<lb></lb>ment between us was, that if I required the money, I should have it, and if not, I should have the property returned, but I did not want the property turned into money, as I was able to borrow 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay to my creditors—the goods were delivered about the 14th of April—the prisoner Price carried them away in his own cart—Evans took them out of my shop and delivered them into the cart—Price received them into his cart—I believe that was the</p>

               <p>same day that I had the conversation with Evans—there was half-a-chest of gunpowder tea, half-a-chest of twankay, some almond, ginger, oleander seed, rice, and sugar—there was no invoice, only a list of the goods in pencil on a piece of paper—I made part of it myself, and Evans made part—the goods were all my property, and about the value of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., indeed, I would much rather have the goods than the money, they are more valuable to me than that—Price is brother-in-law to Evans—I did not employ Price—I cannot say whether I saw Evans again the same evening that the goods were taken, but I saw him about two days after—I am not aware that there was anything particular said relating to the goods, the first time I saw him; but in the course of a week, or a fortnight, he refused to tell me where the goods were when I asked him about them—before he took the goods away, he had arranged to take them to his mother-in-law's, and before he took the second load, he said that his mother had refused to take them in, and he had placed them with a friend whom he knew, and that they were perfectly safe—I said, "Now, Evans, you will not lead me astray, you will have these goods quite right"—he said, "Quite right, let me have them all"—I asked him if they were perfectly safe, and he said they were—I afterwards borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a friend of mine, and I did not then require the goods to be sold—I have never got them back, nor received anything for them—about a fort-night after, I requested Evans to return either all or part of them, and he set me at defiance, and said I might do my best and my worst—I saw him at Knightsbridge, and asked him where the goods were—he said he had placed them with a party of the name of Ratford, a horse-dealer—he did not tell me at that time where Ratford and the goods were—he afterwards brought this Ratford before me—his name turns out to be Purdy—I had seen Evans before that, at a public-house in Fenchurch-street, and he promised to meet me at half-past eight—he then said he had seen Ratford, and Ratford required 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he would deliver up the property—he had got a letter in his hand, and he read it to me, as having been received from Ratford, but I can swear to it as having been in his own handwriting—that letter is not here—Ratford can neither read nor write—I have a letter here which I received from Evans—this is it, it is in Evans's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Peter Taylor, Canton House, Bethnal-green-road, Thursday evening. Dear Sir, I have seen that scamp to-day, and have positively done all I could to bring him to something like reason; but I am sorry to say, nothing seems to move the vagabond from what he proposed, but we will se what to-morrow may bring; perhaps both of us may do something with him. I have promised to meet him to-morrow morning, at eleven o'clock, at the Grapes public-house, three or four doors from kingsland-road, in Old-street. Yours, A. Evans. Mrs. Evans has just told me that the Revd. has called. I would come down this evening, but my brother is without a young man, and wants my services. I shall see you to-morrow, at eleven o'clock")—In consequence of that letter I went to the Grapes public-house, in Old-street-road, the next day at eleven o'clock—it was on a Friday in the early part of April, about three weeks or a month after the goods were moved—Evans met me himself first, and afterwards Ratford came in—I had never seen him before—Evans said, "Now Ratford this is my friend Taylor, I went to see if we cannot come to something like reason about these goods"—after a little while Ratford said, "It is no use stating anything but what is right, I have made away with the goods"—Evans on that rose up, called him a scamp and a vagabond, and wanted to fight him, and said he would die in a ditch—Ratford said, "If I do, you will die in the one next to me"—no blow was</p>

               <p>struck—I asked Ratford if he knew the value of the property he had had of mine—he said he did not—I said, "It is 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you have made away with it I am a ruined man for ever"—he said he did not know about that, and seemed quite struck at the value of the property—Evans still continued in the same bustle—he appeared to be quite angry with Ratford, wanted to fight him, and called him any name but a gentleman, but he did not touch him—he told me to come out—we went outside together—he directly went back into the house, continued there about a minute, and then came home with me—a man named Payne was there—I had never seen him before—Payne said in Evans's presence that it was an understanding between Evans and Rat<lb></lb>ford that the goods were to be made away with immediately, and not to remain in his house—in the middle of May I went with Purdy to Knighta<lb></lb>bridge, and saw Evans there—I had not been able to get the slightest account from Evans of the goods or the money—I am not exactly aware of what passed between Purdy and Evans—Purdy wished him to do some<lb></lb>thing in the matter of these goods—Evans said, "Purdy knows nothing of the goods, I exonerate him, I take the whole charge on myself; Taylor do your best and worst, I do not value you that" (<hi rend="italic">snapping his fingers.</hi>)—"I said, "Well, Evans, if you had told me that before, I should have known how to have acted."—Purdy said, "I have been away from my house for three or four days to vindicate your case for a paltry sovereign, and now I shall stay away no longer; I shall speak the truth, you have trod on my foot, and I shall tread on yours"—Evan's said, "Well if you have been away from home at all you are only a fool, how am I to know that?"—Purdy did not tell me in Evans' presence what had occurred between them—he had stated it to me be<lb></lb>fore—I gave Evans a sovereign towards the expenses incurred in moving the goods, and taking charge of them.</p>

               <p>employed to settle the matter for me, had said, if I could procure the money, and offer 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, he could settle it directly, but I had no money, and this was the only way in which I could procure it—Mollett lives in the Blackfriars-road—I supposed him to be a respectable man—he was not present at the time the arrangement was made, nor when the goods were taken away—he knew nothing of the goods being taken away—I did not consult Mollett about it—he understood that something was to be done with the goods, that I was to make money in some way, he did not ask me how I was going to make it—no action had been commenced against me at the time I got my goods off the premises—I had been round to my creditors—I had received no notice from any lawyer—Evans had left me about three or four months when this occurred—he had not the slightest connexion with my business at this time—I sent for him once—I did not send three or four letters to him before he came—I did not sent two—I will not swear that I did not, or that I did—I did not send to him for the very purpose of taking possession of these goods—I cannot answer what he first came to my place for—I sent for him—I believe it was to ask him how I might arrange this matter, having gone through the same thing himself, how I might dispose of the goods and get the money—I believe that was the object—I had not consulted Mollett before—I wanted to dispose of the goods, if I had not other means of getting the money—I must turn them into money, if I could not turn them into money other-wise—if I could not obtain the money otherwise, I was to have the goods sold, and I was to have the money—if I could not obtain the money to pay what I have already paid, they must be sold, but as I was able to obtain 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi> I am a horse-dealer, and live in the Whitechapel-road—I know Purdy—I went with him to the Grapes, and saw Taylor and Evans there—Taylor said he had entrusted some property into the hands of Evans—Evans asked Purdy what he had done with the property—Purdy said he had done away with it, it was so small an amount he did not think it worth while keeping it, that the value was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Evans put himself into a passion, threatening to strike Purdy for robbing his friend Mr. Taylor—Taylor went on his knees in the room, and said he was ruined, for the amount of the property was over 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Purdy felt surprised at that—Taylor and Evans left the room—Evans returned, said it was capitally done, and told Purdy to meet him at the London Apprentice—he came back again to have a small glass of brandy to refresh himself—I and Purdy went to the London Apprentice, and waited there a considerable time before Evans came—he went a little farther on with a view of pawning his watch—I cannot say whether he did pawn it or not, but he came back and gave Purdy a sove<lb></lb>reign, and me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was a job most capitally done—he gave me four half-crowns, shook hands with me, and said I was a good helpmate, and that it was capitally done.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Manning, a carpenter, in the Commercial-road—I was at Mr. Taylor's on Wednesday, the 14th of April—I saw Evans there—I saw him take something out of the shop in a small barrow—Mr. Taylor was in the shop at the time—that was all I saw him take—I was in the parlour—I did not see anybody outside with a cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 98). On Wednesday evening, 14th December, I went with another constable to 5, Wilson's-place, Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields—I saw a man in the passage, who gave a signal, by knocking on the wainscoting with his hand—I seized him by the collar and shoved him into the street—I then looked through the key-hole of the front room, ground-floor, and saw Simpkins standing by a table which had a plate on it, in which I could plainly see some half-crowns—he was turning them over, and Joyce was by his side with a ladle in his hand containing hot metal—I forced open the door, and, on Simpkins seeing me, he threw some<lb></lb>thing down which looked like plaster of Paris—it appeared to be a mould—he stamped on it—I seized him by the collar—the other policeman rushed to the plate, and got five half crowns out of it, but dropped these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the ground—I picked them up—Simpkins succeeded in struggling to the plate, and got all the half-crowns that remained in the plate, and threw them into the fire—I saw them fall through the grate, and picked up this metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the ashes—he then threw this little phial on the fire, con<lb></lb>taining liquid of some sort, which was spilt, and I picked the bottle out—we secured the prisoners, searched and found two files with metal in the teeth, two phials, some plaster of Paris, a saucer of sand, and some pieces of a mould—I picked up these two unfinished half-crowns—the landlord locked up the rooms, and we took the prisoners to the station—on the way, Simpkins said, "Jim, we are <hi rend="italic">cocked to rights</hi> this time"—nothing was found on them—I went to the room again next day—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—these five half-crowns are counterfeit, and from one mould—here are some pieces of plaster of Paris which may have formed part of a mould, but there are no marks on them by which I can say for certain—these half-crowns have been made from a mould; and, supposing the metal from which they were made to be hot, the mould must have existed two minutes before—it could not be longer—these are made of precisely the same metal as this in the ladle—it is Britannia metal, or melted pewter pots—I have sufficient experience to know from the touch that it is the same—here are two files which are used for the purpose of making the milling, and some sand which is used to clean them before they put the extra coating on to blacken or discolour them—this ladle is used for melting the metal—this piece of metal fits into the bottom of it, and must have come out of it—I have looked carefully at these coins—I have examined and found that they are all from one mould—here is one little peculiarity in the "r" of Georgius, a small mark or indentation—they all have that peculiarity—here is a little box containing two fragments of a mould for half-crowns—the larger fragment merely represents part of a letter, and the edging of the coin—the smaller piece has the letter "r" on it; and under the lower limb of the "r" is the same mark which is on all the half-crowns—that informs me that these two fragments must have been part of a mould for a half-crown—no other coin than a half-crown of George the Third has such a letter of this size.</p>

On Sunday, 2nd Dec., between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in my room, and heard a disturbance—I went to the little side window, and saw the prisoner and Mrs. Walls quarrelling, each at their own door—the prisoner said, "Why don't you go and pay your Queen's taxes, and not let your lodgers lose their things?"—Mrs. Walls said, "Go and pay your public-house score"—with that the prisoner ran into her place, and brought out a large stick and struck Mrs. Walls a violent blow deliberately on the right temple—she fell, and bled very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of Messrs. Coombe, the brewers, nine years, and am the prisoner's brother-in-law. I was in Notting<lb></lb>harm court—a great many people were there—a parcel of brickbats were being thrown against my door; two came right before me—I saw the deceased and her son quarrelling—the son was drunk; she was not much better—I saw him throw her down twice on the flag-stones when she was trying to rescue him—I saw the prisoner come to the door in her nightclothes, with a shawl on—if she had a stick in her hand I must have seen it—young Walls had something flourishing about—I think it was a stick—it was very dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At my own door; I take no part in these quarrels—I saw Walls run over to Mrs. Edwards, and strike a blow, which was meant for her head, but she put up her arm, and received it across her wrist.</p>

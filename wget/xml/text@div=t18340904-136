               <p>JACOB SCHLESINGER (through an Intrepreter.) I had a pipe for sale on the 9th of July - the prisoner came into a public-house - I asked if he would buy it - he made no reply, but took the pipe, and put it into his pocket - he did not pay for it - he went away - I went after him, and met the policeman - I told him, as well as I could, that he had got the pipe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I run away, or did you run away and leave me? A. You went out - I said as well as I could,"Will you buy one?"</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said, "Yes, and thank you too," and put it into my pocket - he then went into a passion - I said, "My good man, you should know better than to offer your pipes, so you shall stand a quartern of gin, and then you shall have your pipe." Witness. He might have said it, but I did not understand him.</p>

             (police-constable C 33). The prosecutor came to me, and made me understand that the prisoner had got the pipe - the prisoner was before the prosecutor - I was standing in the street - I told the prisoner if he had got any thing belonging to the man, he had better give it to him - he said he should not - that he had offered it to him, and he had a right to keep it - he had made the proposition that he should stand a quartern of gin, and he would give it to him - there was a Jew coming by, who understood the German language, and I got him to interpret to me, and from what he said I took the prisoner - the prisoner might have run away, as he was before the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He left me in the public-house - I went after him with the intention of giving him the pipe - as we passed the Ben Jonson, the landlord said, "There goes the fellow with the bad half-crown" - I said I would not give the pipe - I understood he had bad money about him, and a bad half-crown was found on him.</p>

On the 27th of March the prisoner came and had some beer - he left about half-past five o'clock; I was in the bar, and saw a picture under his left arm, part of it was uncovered: I knew it to be our's - it was a view of Gravesend, which had hung over the back parlour mantel-piece; I went to the door, and looked out after him, but was alarmed, and did not follow, having nobody in the house - he had left a companion, named Gardener behind, who had been in his company all the morning; I demanded of Gardener the money for a pint of beer - he said the prisoner had gone to get the money to pay for it: I said he had stolen my picture - the prisoner came back in half an hour without the picture, and was detained.</p>

            . I am blind - my hearing is very good; I am accustomed to attend to voices - I play a fiddle at public-houses, and know the prisoner by his voice. On Tuesday evening, the 7th of March, I was at the Rose and Crown - Mrs. Downes told me she had lost a picture, and about a quarter-past six o'clock, the prisoner came into the room; he spoke to me, and then Mrs. Downes followed him into the tap-room, and charged him with stealing the picture - he said he knew nothing of it, she said she should fetch a Policeman - she left, and I remained in the room; I turned my head, as if I did not notice their conversation, and heard him say to his companion, "I have stolen the picture, and me and Jem Gardener sold it;" he said to his companion, "You b-r, bolt out backwards;" I was going to tell Mrs. Downes, but the Policeman came in and took him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He said at the office that I whispered. Witness. No; I said he spoke in his ear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to this house with three young men, two strange men came in, and played at skittles - I went home to get my tea, with some bread in a handkerchief; I returned in a quarter of an hour, and Mrs. Downes charged me with this.</p>

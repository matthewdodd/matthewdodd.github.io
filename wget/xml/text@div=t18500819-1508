                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 19th July, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I met Eliza Wilson in Ratcliff-highway—she took me to a house in Whitechapel—it was then between one and two o'clock—I went to bed, and after some time Sarah Clements came in and laid on the outside of the bed—about half an hour afterwards the three male prisoners and Langley came into the room; I had never seen either of them before—it was then about three o'clock—I had no light in the room, but I could see; there was a window right over the gas—I was frightened; I got up in bed, and wanted to go away, and these <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> said, "Don't fear, we are not going to trouble you; we only came to ask you for some tobacco"—I had four sticks of tobacco, and I gave them one—they then retired from the room, leaving Clements and Wilson with me—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards the three men and Langley came back again, each of the men had a stick—I then got up to go away altogether, and the three girls put the sheet round my head, tied it round my neck, and began handling my throat, and the men got to the foot of the bed, unbuttoned my trowsers, and pulled them off—they got their hands up at the foot of the bed, and pulled off my stockings and waistcoat—my jacket was off—before I could get the sheet off my head they all went down-stairs, and I was left in the room by myself—I laid there till morning—I had had three shillings and one sixpence in my trowsers—in the morning, about eight o'clock, or between eight and nine, Walker and Elliott came to me and told me I was to leave the room and go away: I did so—I had nothing on then but my shirt and my inner trowsers—they followed me out to the public-house at the corner—I saw a policeman there, and spoke to him—Walker and Elliott escaped—Walker saw me speak to the policeman—I went back with the policeman to the house; I found Langley there and give her in charge—I have not seen any of my clothes since, only my braces—I was in the street when Walker was taken—the others were taken at dif<lb></lb>ferent times—I have no doubt that the prisoners are the persons—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Walker.</hi> When I first saw you were in the street, and told me you were too late to get in at your lodgings, and went home with a girl, and gave her your trowsers to sleep with her because you had got no money. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not—I saw you between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and again at night—I had nothing to eat or to drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 5). On 19th July, I went with the prosecutor to George-street, Whitechapel—I found Langley sitting at the door—he pointed her out as being one of the persons that had robbed him—I told</p>

               <p>her the charge—she said, "It is a hard thing that I should suffer for all; when I get before the Magistrate I shall see how I get on, and then I will tell who the others are"—in the evening I went to the house, and found these braces between the sheets, and this stick under the bed, which is the same sort as Thomas described—on the Sunday I went to 9, George-street, and took Elliott and Clements—I told them the charge—Elliott said, "I do not mind, if he speaks the truth"—Thomas had described the persons who robbed him.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on the Saturday morning I was passing near the Founder's Arms, at the corner of Wentworth-street—Wilcox walked away from the public-house side-door as I went up—at the same moment Walker and the prosecutor came out of the front-door—I heard Walker say to him, "I will see that you have all by five o'clock to-night"—Walker walked away—Thomas spoke to me, and I turned round to go after Walker; he ran down Thrall-street as hard as he could run—Wilcox was gone the other way—I heard that Langley was in custody; I went to her room, No. 5—I found Wilcox there, packing up a lot of little things in the room—I said, "I want you; you know what it is for, I suppose?"—he said, "Yes, about the sailor"—in going to the station, he spoke about Walker and the others—after coming from the police-court, I went to No. 2, and saw Walker come over the fence into the back yard—Thomas was up-stairs; I called him down—Walker saw me, and imme<lb></lb>diately made his escape over the fence—I had an officer stationed there, and Walker ran into his arms—this was between two and three in the afternoon.</p>

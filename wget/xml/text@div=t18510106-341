                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Brigg, 32, St. James'-street, Pall Mall—his shop is part of his dwelling-house—the shop is divided by a partition, and there are two doors, one to each compartment; in one he sells umbrellas, and in the other sponge—on 20th Dec. I was in the umbrella-shop about two o'clock, serving a customer.; and when I had done that, I went to the sponge-shop—there is a bell over the door of the sponge-shop, which ordinarily rings when a person enters—it had not sounded then, but I found the prisoner in that shop, at the till—he said he wished to see a sponge; I showed him some; they did not suit him, and he left—as soon as he was gone, I examined the till; I missed four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and two or three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>-pieces—I pur<lb></lb>sued the prisoner, and overtook him—he was walking about three doors off—I stopped him, and told him I suspected he had been robbing the till, and to come back, which be did—I asked him if he had taken anything out of the till; he denied it—I called the policeman; he searched him, and found three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and some silver—be was asked about this money; he said it was given him to buy a suit of clothes, by his sister, and he gave her address, 5, John-street, Piccadilly.</p>

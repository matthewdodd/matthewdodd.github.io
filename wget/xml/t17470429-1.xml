               <p>Arrowsmith. I was upon the Road. I had been at a Place called Dancer's-hill ; this Man, the Prisoner, meeting me, he asked me for the York Road; I told him he was out of the Way; then he asked me for the Road to Glasgow in Scotland; I told him he might enquire at the Alehouse at Kicksend .

             was sent in Pursuit of the Mare, and when he met me, told me of it; so we went to the Alehouse to know what Way they had directed him, and we pursued him; we took him in a by Road that comes into Hertford Road , in Mims Parish ; we took him the 27th of February, as he was travelling on the Road.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Mare?</p>
               <p>Arrowsmith. I brought him and the Mare to Barnet , and Mr. Whiston had the Mare.</p>

               <p>Arrowsmith He asked me the meaning of my seizing him; he seemed to be in Liquor, and had little to say for himself. He said a Soldier told him he might take her and proceed on his Journey, and he said, when he had rode her about eight Miles, he would give her some Oats.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Now is your Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I will tell you what Way I was ensuared into it by the English and Dutch Officers; I was taken away from my Country to Sea, and we were five Weeks upon the Sea, and by Storms we were driven into Dunbirk Roads , and then drove to Shham , and I ventured my Life out in the Night for my Wife and Children. I asked the Way for Scotland, and a Soldier , about two Miles from Highgate, he took me into a House, pretending he would go 150 Miles with me, to a Place called Durham; I said I had no Money, but what I begged; he said he had Money to carry us if I would hear him Company ; he took me into the Inn , and gave me three Quarts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290003"></xptr> of Liquor; I was not able to go with him; when I came up to him, he had this Horse on the Highway; he said it was left by a Waggoner, and he knew the Landlord, and that I might ease myself by riding of it.</p>

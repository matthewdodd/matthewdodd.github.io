            . I am an officer. On the 27th of November I was with Gleed, opposite Field-lane, Holborn, and saw the prisoner and another man come from the Thatched-house. We followed them down Fleet-market, Ludgate-hill, and up the Old Bailey, into the Star, public-house, with another man in a butcher's dress. Suspecting them, I immediately went in, took the prisoner into custody, and told him I took him on suspicion of passing forged notes. He said he knew nothing about it, nor should he know a forged note from a good one. I took him in a coach to a public-house next door to Worship-street office - We held his hands until he got into the back parlour. I told him I would search him, he said, no person should search him. I found 27s. in silver in his left-handbreeches pocket, and three 1l. bank notes in his right-handbreeches pocket. He said he should like to mark them, which I let him do, keeping hold of them while he did it-(looking at them)-these are the notes; they were quite new, not the least rumpled, and did not appear to have been in circulation. He said he had them from Blackfriars Bridge, and gave 30s. for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he not say he gave 30s. in silver, and the rest in larger coin - A. He might. I should have taken the notes myself, if I had not been told they were forged.</p>

            . I was with Armstrong, and saw the prisoner, between six and seven o'clock, with another man. I followed him, with Armstrong, up Fleet-market - He stood talking at the corner of Fleet-market for about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140028"></xptr>ten minutes. We then followed him to the Old Bailey, where he met a butcher-the other man left him - They went into the Star public-house; we followed and took him to the office. He said he would not be searched. We found 27s. in his right-hand pocket, and three 1l. notes in the left - He marked them-(looking at them) - They are the same.</p>

            . I was present at he first examination-what the prisoner said was not taken down. He said he gave 30s. for them - He immediately recollected himself, and said he gave 60s. for them to a stranger in a public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS LEES. I am an inspector of bank notes-(looking at them) - They are forged in every respect. They are all from one plate and paper, and the same hand-writing, though different names-they are the names of signing clerks (read).</p>

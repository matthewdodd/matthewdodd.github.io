               <p>Q. Who is that man, do you know him again - A The prisoner is him; he ran down Noble-street. I pursued him; I could not see him. I went home to my mother; I told my father, that a boy had ran away with the boots.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the man - A. I saw him once before; he watched me into my uncle's shop, 21, Butcher-hall-lane; and after I lost the boots, I saw him at Hatton-garden office, before the justice. I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>GOODMAN SOLOMON. I am an officer. I live in Field-lane, Holborn. I was informed that the prisoner and another were coming constantly in our neighbourhood, offering stolen goods. I saw the prisoner stand in Union-court, with this bundle under his arm. Union-court leads towards Field-lane. I went towards the prisoner, and they halloed out, run. The prisoner took to running; I followed him into Charles-street. He ran across Charles-street to the neighbourhood where his father resides, to Bull-head-court. I then lost sight of him; he chucked these boots, and upper leathers, and handkerchief, down. I knew the prisoner, and he knew me; and I know his father and mother. I picked the handkerchief up containing the boots and upper leathers. These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. The 17th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon. On the 4th of August, I went to the House of Correction, and identified the prisoner. He had leave then to go to sea. I am sure he is the man that dropped the boots. I advertised to get the owner for the boots.</p>

            . I am one of the city constable. On the 22d of August, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with another, sounding peoples pockets. I did not see him take any thing out. I took him in custody to prevent him committing any depredations that night. On the following morning, I took him to Hatton-garden office. He was sent to the House of Correction, as being a known thief, for a month. The next day, I was passing the house of the last witness; he asked me if I had not taken two boys in custody. I told him I had; we went to the House of Correction together directly. He saw this one. Goodman Solomon said, that is the boy; I know him well. We then went after the prosecutor. The child came to the office, with his father and mother. Directly he saw the prisoner, he said, he was the boy that throwed him down, and took the boots.</p>

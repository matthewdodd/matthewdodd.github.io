Between nine and ten, last Sunday night, I went to bed, having examined the state of my house. Every thing was safe and fast. I got up between five and six in the morning. I found a back-door, in a back-kitchen, which opens into a field, wide open; and found the casement in that room open, and several panes of glass broke: the shutter, and the bar which fastened the shutter over-night, were down upon the ground. It appeared to me somebody had entered that way. There was another window in the same room, which had been attempted; but that was too strong: they did not, I conceive, get in that way, but the other, and got out at the door. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): they were afterwards produced before the justice: I know they were what I lost. The prisoner Wood lived with me about five years ago.</p>
               <p>- MILWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a mason, at Homerton. That morning, about half after six o'clock, I saw the two prisoners going by, at Homerton, which is four or five miles from where Mr. Twydale lives: each had a sack. I observed one of the sacks rattled. I suspected them. I got some neighbours to assist. After following them a considerable way, they dropped their sacks, and ran away. Wood, after some time, owned that the property which was in the sacks belonged to Mr. Twydale, of Nightingale-hall. He said, there were some other things left behind; and they took us to the place where three copper saucepans were left; and they were found accordingly in a hedge, near Mr. Twydale's house.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Collins and Mr. Aikin deposed, that they saw the prisoners throw down the sacks, and run away; and that they followed them till they were taken.)</p>

               <p>The justice begged me to tell the truth: I did it absolutely. I have good friends in London, but have not applied to them. I was going down to Hertford: Wood was before me. He stooped down, and picked up this property. He said, There is something; will you help me carry them? So I did. I told him I had been a land-steward, and brought up well: but I have not sent for my friends.</p>

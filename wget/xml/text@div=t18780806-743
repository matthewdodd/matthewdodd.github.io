                  </hi>. I was servant at Mrs. Pike's, 127, Camberwell Road—on 26th June, about 2 o'clock, I was in the kitchen, heard a noise, went upstairs into the parlour, and saw my master on the floor, and the prisoner kneeling on him, holding him down, and drawing his fist back as if from a blow—my master said "What are you doing—do you know?"—Mr. Catherwood said "Yes"—I called my mistress upstairs, and when I came back my master and Catherwood were up, and my master lifted up a chair to strike him—my master's mouth was bleeding, and his face swollen—the boy had been lighting some straw in the garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. From the time I heard the noise to the time I went into the parlour two or three minutes elapsed—I ran up directly—the parlour is at the-back of the shop, which is open to the Camberwell Road; you go down a flight of stairs to the yard, and down three stairs more to the kitchen—the yard runs alongside of the yard of the prisoner's house—at the back of the prisoner's house there is an additional building which is used as a dining-room, and the smoke went in there—there was scarcely the distance from his window to the fire that there is between you and me; a paling intervened—if I said that Catherwood was kneeling over Mr. Pike I meant kneeling on him—my mistress tried to separate them—I left the room, and did not see her take her husband away—my master was in the shop on Thursday serving customers—he Was first imwell on the Friday—he went to the doctor on Sunday, and took to his bed on the following Wednesday—he was a little deaf—he used to put his head on one side when you spoke to him—the prisoner looked very excited.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">BROAD BRIDGE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). The deceased being in a very bad state the family refused on two occasions to allow me to take his statement—I went there again on 19th July, at 6.40, and he died about 10.30 the same day—between those times a Magistrate bad attended, but the doctor certified that the deceased was too ill for his statement to be taken—when I went into the room he was too ill to speak—his mother, brother, and a police sergeant were present—nobody told him in my presence that he was dying—I wrote this statement; questions were pat to him through his brother, who repeated the answers, and I have truthfully recorded them—the first part of it was not read over to him (<hi rend="italic">The formal part</hi>), but the rest was, and he made his mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the deceased's sister—I was present when this statement was taken—I had been with him during the night—he told me about 2.30 in the morning that he was dying—I asked him if he was</p>

               <p>better, and he said "No, I never shall be better, I never can be," and kissed me—about 4.30 he asked to see his brother, my mother wished to see him before his brother left; she was very anxious that he should not be disturbed by his deposition being taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was nearly always with him—the night when he said that, I did not say "Don't talk in that way," because I was impressed with the idea that he could not live—he made this statement between 6 and 7 o'clock, and fainted from the excitement—he said he hoped he had not said too much about Catherwood—the questions were put to him by my brother and my mother—my mother was very much distressed; my brother was more in possession of his intelligence, and the deceased understood his voice better—the questions the inspector took down were asked by my brother George, and the deceased replied in a whisper, but loud enough for the inspector to hear, who was leaning over the bed—my brother did not repeat the answers; my mother said "If you believe yourself dying, will you say that this is true that you have stated to this gentleman?" "and he said Yes"—I have never mentioned before to—day what my mother said to the deceased, but she did say so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. On two or three occassions the deceased said "Oh, I wish he had killed me"—that was when he was in great pain—he never expected to recover—he said that his poor brain had got a great deal to go through—he said the pain was so great that he must die, and he kissed me and said "Good—bye" about half—past four, after telling me to go to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. PIKE</hi>. The deceased was my son—I was in his room on the morning of 19th July—he was very ill indeed—he was aware for several days and at that time that he could not get over it—he said that it was a pity that Mr. Catherwood did not kill him right out instead of making him suffer as he had done—he also said that morning, "I cannot live," that was before the inspector came—he knew that the inspector was there listening to what he was saying—(<hi rend="italic">The Court considered that the declaration was admissible</hi>.) On the day of the assault, when I went into the room, I saw that my son's mouth was swelling and bleeding—the prisoner was in a state of great excitement; he kicked me violently and hurt me—I had come out of the garden, where I was putting the fire out with a stick—I think I had it in my hand when I was called; but I did not use any violence to the prisoner with it—my son was twenty—four years old—he was a little deaf with one ear; that was the ear on which he said he had a blow from the prisoner—it was the left ear, I think; on whichever side he was deaf, that was the side on which he was struck—he always enjoyed good health—Dr. Smith, of Newington Causeway, is our medical attendant; but he had not been called to attend him for eight years—the assault was on Thursday—he could hardly open his mouth the next day—he took to his bed on the Tuesday night, and never left it again—the prisoner never came to make any inquiries after the assault, nor any of the family, although they lived next door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Mrs. Catherwood was sent for once, but she did not come of her own accord.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Deceased's Statement</hi>. "I, William Pike, residing at 127, Camber<lb></lb>well Road, do make the following statement, which I believe to be my last dying testimony. At 2 p.m. on 26th inst. I was standing in my back parlour, when Mr. Catherwood from next door, 185, came through my shop into the parlour and struck me a blow under my right ear, felling me to the</p>

               <p>—— <hi rend="smallCaps">MOORMAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi>57). I took the prisoner at a few minutes past 1 on 4th July; that was a fortnight before the statement was made—I charged him with assaulting Mr. Pike, and showed the warrant to him—he said, "All right; I will go with you"—on the way to the station he asked me if it was right for a Magistrate to grant a warrant after such a lapse of time—"I said Yes, it is quite right on sworn information"—he said, "I don't deny the assault, but I think they have taken a very extreme course"—he then said that he was subject to epileptic fits, and if he should be taken ill would I send for a doctor, mentioning Dr. Carpenter and another, who, I think, was Dr. Smith—he was taken before Mr. Bush by the same afternoon, remanded for a week, and admitted to bail—he was brought up again, and it was adjourned for another week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Those two adjournments were for the prosecutor to attend, and it was adjourned a third time for the Inquest—I have seen the prisoner in a fit this morning—he looked very ill—he keeps a grocer's shop, and is postmaster.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been family doctor at Mr. Pike's seven or eight years—I knew the deceased during that period, but had not attended him—he appeared to enjoy excellent health—on 21st July I was called in to see him, and found him lying on a sofa—he got worse, and I called in Dr. Clutton—he died on 19th July—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi>—the cause of death was an abscess on the brain, which proceeded from the ear, and which was of recent formation—I saw during my attend<lb></lb>ance that the membrane of the ear was perforated—the abscess might arise from a blow under the ear—I saw nothing in the condition of the brain to account for it, independent of the perforation of the ear—a blow might perforate the membrane, which is generally followed by inflammation—there would be deafness and discharge from the ear, but he might not know that it was perforated—I assume from the perforated membrane that there was disease of the ear, and that would account for the abscess—I found the abscess which I expected. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. From the appearances which presented themselves on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination there was nothing inconsistent with the man having died from natural causes—there was nothing to lead to the conclusion that it resulted from injury inflicted—by perforation I mean the drum of the ear being broken—a person may go through life for many years with a broken drum of the ear and be none the worse, except being a little deaf—I should say there would be a discharge of blood when the perforation took place—I examined him on the Tuesday, and listened to what he said—I found no bruise behind his ear and no marks of violence on his person—I was not surprised at that—a blow behind the ear is likely to cause a fracture of the drum—I did not make a minute examination of the ear at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi>, that was entrusted to Mr. Clutton—I saw nothing of the inner ear—an abscess is an advanced stage of inflammation—the abscess was set up by disease of the ear—there was nothing inconsistent with the man dying from natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have sworn that he died from the result of an abscess—in my judgment he died from the abscess; that was consistent both with disease of the ear independent of violence, and with violence used behind</p>

               <p>the car—assuming that there was old disease of the car a blow would accelerate it—I do not think it was consistent with a simple blow behind the ear—he had a discharge indicating recent inflamation of the ear.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. I think the abscess had occurred during the last two or three weeks of life, because an old abscess is surrounded by a cyst, and this was not—I attend both the prisoner's and the prosecutor's family.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">CLUTTON</hi>. I am resident surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by the Coroner's order—I had never seen the man during life—he died from abscess of the brain, secondary to disease of the ear—it might have been forming from three weeks to two months; I cannot fix a time—you cannot have an abscess in the ear without pain—a blow would not be necessary to produce the abscess, and there was no evidence of any injury—I found a perforated membrane, but that was not caused by violence in my opinion—assuming a blow behind the ear, and finding the abscess, I should not consider the two consistent in this case, because he had disease of the ear—a blow operating on disease of the ear might cause acute inflamation, and that might cause an abscess—it did not surprise me to find the abscess and acute inflammation when I found he had been suffering from deafness, and when I heard that he had had a blow behind the ear—I should rather expect to find it because he had disease of the ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The disease of the ear was of long standing: I should think from childhood—both ears bore evidence of disease—I am aural surgeon at St. Thomas's—I found nothing in the head or ear inconsistent with his dying from natural causes—in a man with the disease of the ear which he had, all the results which I found might have arisen from an ordinary cold.</p>

I said I had no money; she then came up, pretending some fondness, and put her hand into my left hand pocket. I felt it go out, and missed my purse, which contained three shillings and two sixpences. I immediately charged her with it - she refused to give it up. I called the watchman, who took her. My money was all safe when I left the Custom-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to assist Armitage - he laid hold of her wrist - she said she had a sovereign, and would deliver it to nobody. I forced open her hand, and took out three shillings and two sixpences, but no sovereign; in about half an hour we returned to the spot, and found the purse. Stagg described<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110082"></xptr>the purse at the watch-house, as having made it himself, and being fastened with a leather button, and had a duplicate in it - it answered his description.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went into Powell's, Drury-lane, for half a pint of beer; the gentleman stood there drinking gin and water; he pulled me by the gown, to stop till he came out; when we came to Lincoln's Inn-fields, he gave me 2 s. I would not consent to his wishes; he seized me by the throat, and said if I did not give him 4 s., he would throttle me. I was the first who called</p>
               <p>"Watch!" The watchman came up, knocked me down, and took the 4 s. from me - 2 s. of it were mine. The watchman owes me a spite; he said,</p>

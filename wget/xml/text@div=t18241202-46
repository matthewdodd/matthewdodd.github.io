I had been there from five or six o'clock, in the bar, with the landlord - I had some wine with him, and drank some liquor also, and was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk. I left the house for the purpose of supping at an a-la-mode beef shop, at the end of Ship-yard: and when I got nearly to the cook shop, a man called out "Charley, give us some gin" - that was

             - two other men were with him. I knew them all three.

             and the prisoner Edmunds, were the other two. I knew the prisoner by sight, but not to know much of him. I have known Bennett some years - I knew Davis from his apprenticeship. I was not in the habit of drinking with either of them - I may have had a glass with Davis. I said "I shall not give you any." Edmunds directly said "Then d - n him, we will have what he has got;" he immediataly struck me on the head with his fist - he gave me two blows on the head - I staggered against the wall; he immediately put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out all my money, except a sovereign. I immediately called out Watch! and said to Edmunds, "I know what you are after, you intend to rob me;" he took seven sovereigns, and some silver out of my pocket; when I called Watch! part of the money fell out of his hand on the pavement - it happened close to the a-la-mode beef shop; Mrs. Marlow, the landlady, came out - his hands were then in my pocket; be put the money which did not fall, into his pocket, and was stooping to pick up the rest. Marlow said "What are you doing with that money, my man, it is not yours;" he replied with an oath "What is that to you, if you don't go in I will serve you the same;" he picked the money off the pavement, struck me another blow on the head and ran off - Jane Hoby was standing by at the time. I did not see her till he had robbed me. Davis stood close by, but did not interfere - Bennett stood close to us also, and on seeing him, I endeavoured to lay hold of him; he struck me a blow, which I returned, and knocked him down; he got up, and we had a struggle, during which time Edmunds and Davis got away - Hoby laid hold of me by the neckcloth, and said to Bennett "Now run off as fast as you can:" he immediately ran away, and as soon as I could extricate myself, I struck at her - my foot slipped, and she got off. I told Mrs. Marlow what I had lost, and shewed her the sovereign which was left in my pocket; the second blow which Edmunds gave me, knocked me down - my pockets were rifled between the two blows. I was knocked down by Bennett afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Edmunds struck you, and took your money? A. Yes; Hoby was not near me then to my knowledge. I have always given the same account of this. I told the Magistrate and Grand Jury,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020022"></xptr>that neither Bennett nor Davis did anything till afterwards. I was at the time in the employ of Messrs. 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person326">Hanson</persName>
             and 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person327">Duncan</persName>
            , of Bonverie-street, and had received the money the night before on their account. I was at the office next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not pay it over? A. It was not indispensably necessary. I had 30 s. a week. I had passed the previous evening at the Apple-Tree, in Cursitor-street, and left there perfectly sober. I might have drank three glasses of gin, and a pint of ale or more; and I had a glass of rum at another shop. I received nine sovereigns and 6 d. for my masters. Mr. Duncan was not in the way next morning; and I had to receive 12 s. from him for overwork. I always settled with him. I spent about 30 s. of the money. I dined at an a-la-mode-beef shop in Holborn, on the day of the robbery, between three and four o'clock, and did not go to the office again. I was drinking with Johnson, and a man named Friend. I might drink six glasses of gin, and two bottles of wine with them. I paid for some ale. I paid 15 s. or 16 s., including the wine. I was not drunk. I was at three or four public-houses that day - before I went to the Green Man, public-house, I went to a house to get a bed; but could not. I believe it was to a bad house - nobody was with me. I was not sober enough to go to the office. I laid my head on the table. I had a little sleep up stairs. I was not turned out because I was drunk. I have not been to the office since; but have been writing for my master at home. I saw Mr. Duncan next morning, and told him I had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Q. I think they said, that unless you convicted somebody of stealing it, they would transport you for embezzling it? A. They did not say that exactly - he said, he must know whether I had been robbed or not, or he would take me before a Justice. I complained at no office till after that; for I was not well enough. I have done business for Mr. Ford, a law-writer, several years ago - we had some misunderstanding about money, which, he said, I had not accounted for. I understood one McLain was in our company that evening; but I did not see him. I had him apprehended, as he had admitted that he stood by, and had part of the money. I went to Bow-street two days after the robbery, but Edmunds was not taken for six days. I was taken into custody about the money, while they sent to inquire of 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person328">Mrs. Marlow</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew all three of the men? A. Yes; and told Mrs. Marlow their names. I have always said, that I knew them all - my examination was taken down at Bow-street, and I signed it - it was read to me.</p>
               <p> Q. You say, in your deposition, "I got up; and the female prisoner came up and held me by the collar, till Edmunds and the three men ran away; and in the last scuffle the strange man got off. I know Edmunds and Davis; but not the third man?" No Answer.</p>

On the evening of Thursday, the 28th of January, I went to No. 120, Rosemary-lane, to the first floor back room—I found White there, sitting by the fire-side, and this child was lying on some rags, upon two choirs—I told White I had received in<lb></lb>formation that he had been ill-using the child—he said he had not used it ill—I asked him where it was—he said, "Here it is"—asked him to show it me—he took it up by one arm, and showed it me—the child screamed out, and appeared very much hurt—the officer who was with me remon<lb></lb>strated with him—the child had two black eyes, a cut across the nose, and</p>

               <p>the head appeared very much bruised—its body and chest was very much emaciated—I left him, and went off for the parish-surgeon—the prisoner said nothing about how the child got the black eyes—I asked him if he was the father—he said, "Yes" at first, and then he said he was not—he said his wife was out at work at Green-bank—I went, and found Bowden—I said I wanted her for neglecting the child, and starving it—she said she was a poor woman, and did what she could for the child—it had been ill some time—she said White was not the father of it, and it was three years old—she said she had been to the parish for relief for it, or for them to take it—I find she is a poor woman, obliged to go out to work—White took the child to the workhouse.</p>

I went to the house—my brother officer knocked at the room door, which White opened—we found the chair close to the door, where he had been sitting, in front of a small fire—I told him we came by information, in consequence of his ill<lb></lb>using a child—I asked where the child was—he took it up by one arm—it was either sitting or lying down—it was dark—I asked if he had a candle—he said, "No"—I went up stairs for a candle, and saw the child sitting down close by two chairs, on some rags—he took the child up, it had two black eyes, and seemed cut or scratched about the face—the head seemed to be in a very poor state—it had not the least appearance of swell<lb></lb>ing—I asked him what he fed it with—he said, "Gruel"—I asked what he had in the saucepan—he said gruel for his own feeding, and it was all he had—I told him to put some out, and give it to the child—the child seemed quite ravenous, and flew at the basin—I said, "Don't let it have it till it is cold"—he then said he had a tea-pot that he gave it drink from—he brought it to the table, and the child tried to seize it—I asked how the child got bruised in the face—he said it was by falls—this piece of cord was there—I asked him what he did with this—he said it was what he chastised the child with—I spoke to him about using such means to such a child—he said he could not keep it quiet, it was continually crying—I took him into custody—I asked him to take the child down to the workhouse—he said he had no objection.</p>

The prisoners lived together, as man and wife, in the back-room, first floor—I live in the front-room—the man went by the name of Mr. White, and the woman Mrs. White—they came there about four months before they were taken—they brought a child with them—I saw the child about three weeks after they came—it then had a sore on its bead—I do not think it was ill at that time—it used to want drink constantly—on the Monday before the prisoners were taken, Bowden came into my room—I heard screaming in their room before she came in, and I heard something fall—I then heard Bowden say, "Get up, <hi rend="italic">Carey</hi>, and come away from him"—a month before that, White washed the child's ears with salt and water, and there was a cut in its ear, and several lashes about the body—White was washing it at that time, and Bowden was holding the candle—I saw marks, as if it had been beaten with a cord or cane, in front of her bosom, and across her back and loins—Bowden seemed as fond of the child as I should expect—I have seen White beat the child, and knock her down with a sack—I have interfered with him, and he threatened to kick me down stairs, and called</p>

On the 31st of January I had occasion to go up to the first floor of the premises; I had left the back room door locked an hour before - I then found the door open, and the lock projected a very little; I had taken the key down with me, and put it in the bar - I went into the room, and saw the prisoner in the act of getting up from the floor: he was packing up the decanters when I entered - it was about two o'clock in the afternoon; the table-cloth was on the floor - I called Mr. Howroyd's servant; the prisoner then said he made a mistake - he came down stairs, passed us, went out of the door, and ran towards the Meat-exchange - the servant went out, and the prisoner was followed and brought back by the officer; I observed a work-box on the floor in the room - a needle-box had been taken away, and I missed a silver spoon, and a book called the "Fair Maid of Perth;" the articles produced were brought back by the officer - I saw on the table-cloth three decanters, which had been in the cupboard when I locked up the room; I am certain the key had remained in the bar till I went up stairs.</p>

            : on Friday morning, the 17th of January, the prisoner at the bar came to our warehouse, he told me that he came from the house of Taylor and Newbury, of Walworth, for some shawls for them; they are customers of ours; he said they would be much obliged if I would let them have the shawls on sale of return, meaning, that if he did not suit the customer that they were: to be shewn to, that they might be sent back; I told him we never let any shawls go out on return, that if he looked them out, I should consider them as bought, he said he hardly knew what he should do, whether to take them or not; I recommended him to go home and tell his principal what I had said, that we would not let them have them on sale of return; I told him if he would stop till the following morning, that we should have a fresh assortment in from the manufactory, and that then he might probably better please himself; he went away at that time and come again the same afternoon, he said he was come again, sent by the house, and that he must have some rich shawls; the most particular prices that I told him was shawls at four guineas and a half each, shawls at three guineas and a half each, and shawls at thirty-eight shillings each; I mentioned different prices between those, but that is not material. He said he was at a loss what to do, which price to take, whether the shawls at three guineas and a half, or the lower price which I shewed him at thirty-eight shillings, which created a suspicion in me; it appeared strange that he should not know whether he should take those at three guineas and a half, or those of thirty-eight shillings, especially as there were prices between that which he had been shewed. On the strength of that suspicion, I wrote upon a little bit of paper to my warehouseman,</p>
               <p>'John follow him to Aldgate;' he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What shawls did you give him. - A. Two shawls of three guineas and a half each; these are the shawls that he pitched upon; I am sure of his person, I had a great deal of conversation with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, my poverty renders me only able to write in my defence, and my mind being so much agitated by the situation in which I am placed, I feel myself under the necessity of craving the indulgence of the court, by submitting the following: I am charged of obtaining these shawls under false pretences, but which shawls came into my possession in the following manner: having met a young man in the street, whom I was in the habit of spending an hour or two in the evening, who informed me that he had purchased a couple of shawls in Ludgate-street; he wished to sell them again; and as I was acquainted with the business, he would be much obliged to me to dispose of them; accordingly I went to a shop in Oxford-street with them; no sooner had I got into the shop than the witness followed me into the shop; the young man that was with me saw him waiting in the shop; he went away on seeing me detained. I have conducted myself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190064"></xptr>through life in an honest upright way, never having a blemish in my character till the present time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

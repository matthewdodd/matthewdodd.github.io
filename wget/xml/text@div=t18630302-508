                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at Liverpool-street, Walworth-road, Surrey—in March last I was recommended by a clerk to put some law business into Mr. Jay's and the defendant's hands—I gave my papers to Mr. Bevan, who told me he was a clerk of Mr. Jay's, to take to Mr. Jay's office—I never saw the defendant until after the writ was issued; my man went and served it—I went to his house at Lambeth lots of times—I don't know when I went first, because I have not got the letter—he told me Mr. Jay was his partner; that was at Westminster, not at his house—he came to Westminster to take down what one of my witnesses was going to say, and then said that he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to carry on the lasubpœnaeduit—that was some time last summer—I received this letter, dated December 27th, from him—I know his handwriting—that was long after the conversation at Westminster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have chambers at 10, New Inn, into Strand—I know the defendant very well—I have known him some little time as a solicitor—he has not a certificate; I did not know that, when he came to me, only that he was very poor—in March last he spoke to me about issuing a writ against Pentecost, at the suit of Frewing; and I took out the summons in my own name, changed it to my own name, and brought the action in my own name—the date of the writ is 8th October,—I was to be the attorney to conduct the action; that was agreed upon—we were working together in that and two or three other things—I brought the action and issued the writ in my name, in the Court of Common Pleas—I gave notice of trial in Easter-term, I believe (here is the notice), and then gave a fresh notice of trial these last sittings—I had no money from the plaintiff—I wrote to Frewing, to tell him I must have money to go on with; and he came and told me he had already paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he should not give me any more—that was in January of this year—I did not receive a sixpence from Littlewood in this case—I never had a shilling of his money—I did all the business, he did nothing—Frewing was at my chambers several times—Bevan was not my clerk—I don't know whose clerk he was—I never knew of any letters being written, or any money being obtained—the prisoner's name was written up on paper against my door—I was away ill for some time, and I gave him the key; Mr. King, my clerk, was there—he has been with me thirty-five years—I tore the name down, because they will not let any two persons have chambers and put up two names—the defendant was never a partner of mine.</p>

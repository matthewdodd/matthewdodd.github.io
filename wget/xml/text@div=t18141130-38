               <p>Q. On Saturday night, the 20th of August, did you observe any persons come home - A. Yes, I did not see them; I heard the feet of two people going backward. Catherine Hall lodged in the one pair back room. I heard two people go through the house to the back part. Shortly after I saw Crawley come home; I only saw him go through the passage, and by the time that he had got up stairs, I heard a great noise; I listened at the noise, and very gently; I heard the voice of Catherine Hall cry out, pray do not; I heard her voice plainly, though I was in another room; I called my husband; I went towards the stairs, with intent to go up the stairs; I found the deceased about two or three stair up; he appeared as if he had just fell, or had been thrown down; I cannot say which; he seemed to be coming forward then; when I came to him he complained of his right arm. I saw him bleeding on the right side of his head; he got hold of my hand, and while I was attending to the deceased, the prisoner Crawley came down stairs, and seemed desirous of passing; the stairs being narrow, he could not get down without stepping over the young man; I looked up, and said it is you that has done this; he went away as quick as he could, and never offered any assistance; there is but one access to the house; he went out the way that he came in. I called to my husband to secure the door, and not to let him out. When my husband came, I said, do not let Crawley out; I believe he has killed the young man; my husband secured the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe these persons come home before Crawley come home - A. I could not. I heard the noise up stairs. I did not hear Crawley come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you heard the noise - A. In the front kitchen; the noise was at the back of the house. My wife was in the room over my head; she ran backwards and alarmed me, by saying that Crawley was doing some violence, and desired me to secure the street door; I ran to the street door with the light in my hand, and bolted it; I ran to my wife at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Crawley escaped before you had fastened the street door - A. I cannot say; we did not meet. When I got to my wife, the deceased was in the passage upon his hands and knees; he was bleeding on the left side of his head. I immediately enquired where the prisoner was, and finding he was out of the house, I ran up stairs, and saw no one in the room; Catherine Hall was not in the room. I never found her until after she was taken. By this time the street door was opened; the watchman and I took the young man to Mr. Morris, the surgeon, in Chandois-street; I never could discover how Crawley got away; I never saw him that night at all. I afterwards went into Catherine Hall's room; I found the poker on the floor; there was a quantity of blood on the floor, and among the blood was the poker broken in two pieces. This is the poker; I gave it to Clements, the constable; he now produces it; I took the poker from the blood; I did not examine it; it must have been bloody.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after your husband took the young man to the surgeon - A. I cannot say; she wanted to stop in the room; I obliged her to go away.</p>

            . On the night of the 20th of August, he was brought home to my house, he was not very sensible; he made no answers when I spoke to him; there was blood running from him at the time; he appeared to be dreadfully wounded; this was done on Saturday, and the next Friday he went to St. George's Hospital; he died at the Hospital. I live in Charles-court, about a mile and a half from Vine-street.</p>
               <p>SYDNEY CHOPPING. I am a surgeon; I attend at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought to St. George's Hospital on the 26th of August, in the afternoon, I examined his head; I found a contused wound, about three inches in length: it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument; he continued in the Hospital a month; his symtoms were at one time relieved; it returned with a considerable violence, his head was examined two or three days after he came in, an inscission was made through the wound to the bone to examine the scull; I found the scull was fractured; the bone was deprest over the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue before he died - A. In the space of a month an inflamation ensued from the violent contusion given to the scull; he died in consequence of the violent contusion which gave the fracture. I opened the head, the abscess was found in the substance of the brain; during the time he was in the Hospital I saw him every day; I did not communicate to him that he was in danger. I should suppose he was expecting his dissolution by the violence of his symtoms.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did he consider himself in danger - A. He was in great danger of losing his life when he came into the Hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. When he repeated this to you, did he consider himself a dying man - A. He did, more than once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he considered himself a dying man - A. He frequently said he knew he should never recover it; that appeared to me to be the impression of his mind from my constant attending him when he first came in the Hospital; he said, nurse, I don't think I shall trouble you long; he was in his perfect senses when he said this, and after the inscission was made in his head, he continued in saying he should never recover; in about a week he satisfied me clearly that he expected he should dye; it to be the settled conviction of his mind from the first time of his coming in to his death; he told me he was going home. He told me he met Catherine Hall as he was going home, she asked him where he was going; he told her he was going home. She said, do not go home, come with me; he said, he would rather not. She prevailed upon him, and he went; he had not been in the room but a short time when Crawley came in; Crawley as soon as he saw him, took up the poker, and struck him a blow, and the blow knocked him down; when he recovered himself, he found himself on the stairs; from that he was taken to the surgeons, and remained at home for six or seven days, then he was brought to St. George's Hospital. I asked him whether he had given Crawley any blow, or had any words with him; he told me no, he did not give him time to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did he die - A. I cannot say the day of the month; he was a month within one day at the Hospital. He told me he had not drank any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer. I and Solomon apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of November, at Perkins's Rents, Pie-street, Westminster. He was in bed with Catherine Hall, about eight o'clock in the morning. I afterwards took him in a coach to Bow-street Office. As we were going along, he said the hand-bill was a bad description of him; it was right only in the age.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

            . In August last, when this affair happened, I lived in Vine-street. I met the deceased in the Strand. The prisoner at that time entirely lived with me. The deceased knew me before Crawley knew me. When I met him, he asked me if I would go and drink; I told him yes, and thanked him. We went to Mr. Davis's in the Strand, and had a glass of rum apiece. As we came out of there, he said will you go and have any more. I said I thank you, George. He said we will not go into Davis's, we will go into Monday's, the Scotch Arms, in Round-court. We went there, and had a glass of rum again. When we came out of there, he said Kit, I shall go home with you; I told him it was a thing I was not allowed to do to go with any one that knew Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q, Did he know Crawley - A. Yes, he knew from the time that I first lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where Crawley was - A. Yes, he said he said he could go home with me, Crawley was not at home, or else I should not have been out.</p>

            How long had you been in the room before Crawley came in - A. Not a moment; Crawley came home immediately. When Crawley came in, the door was not fastened. Crawley said to Dixon, what do you here; go down stairs. Dixon said, I shall not; what for? Crawley said, I will tell you what for; Crawley struck Dixon with his fist, and knocked him towards the fire-place. Dixon, on getting up seized the poked, and immediately struck Crawley on the head, or the back part of the neck. Dixon struck at him again with the poker; Crawley avoided the blow; Dixon with force only struck the wainscot, and the poker fell out of his hand. I picked up the poker, and laid it on the table. Crawley catched hold of the poker, and struck Dixon back handed at the back part of the head as Dixon was making out of the door; I said then, pray do not, endeavouring to part them by speaking. Dixon directly went out of the room; I never saw him after. The landlord and landlady said Crawley should not stop there, and then he went away; I staid until I took out my things that I had there, and then I went out of the room. Mrs. Raine told me to go away, she said, she had no objection to me, but Crawley would come where I was, and then I went away. When Crawley was taken, he was with me in Perkin's rents, Pie-street; I went before the magistrate and was examined.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him the character of a mild disposition.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet any one - A. A Portuguese, as I supposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. Not any. I am quite certain it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the wall - A. I had; we were both going one way; he apparently was first; when I came up I went between him and the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room for you to go - A. Yes. He reeled or shoved against me sideways, and threw me against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to him - A. Not any thing When he reeled against me I said, holloa, shipmate, or messmate, I cannot say which, do not run a fellow down. I said nothing else to him. He talked something in his own language, but what I did not understand. I went from him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing further occurred at this time more than you have stated - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received this shove how far were you from your own house - A. About thirty yards when this happened. I walked up the court to my own home, and when I got to my own home I heard a footstep coming up the court very quick and very light, I did not think it was the prisoner coming after me to do any thing to me, but directly I saw his right hand draw my right shoulder of the left side of my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the blow aimed at, and where did it take place - A. On the left side of my cheek, by my chin, it cut me very deep; I could put a finger in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. He cut you on the left cheek and chin - A. Yes, then he turned upon his heel and made his escape. He ran away, and I ran after him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. Not any time. He ran into Wapping-street, and ran down into Gun-alley; he ran into the side door of the Gun public-house, I went into the house immediately after him, I called out, where is he, where is he who has cut me. I saw him in the house by the side of a little passage, just within a little kitchen, or washhouse, the passage door and kitchen joins together.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him just within the door of a little kitchen, was there any light in that room - A. Not any. There was no company where he was, he ran out again by me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw him run into the house, and you saw him within the door of the kitchen - in order to get there had he ran into the tap-room where the company was - A. He had not. I holloaed out stop him, and calling out, where is he. When I got in Mr. Watkins, a person that was in the house, he said, here he is. He ran violently out of the same door into Gun-alley again, I pursued him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him before he was taken - A. No, I did not, except in running into the door. When he ran out of the

               <p>Q. When he ran into Gun-alley again did you call stop thief - A. I did; he was taken a little way off Gun dock, in Wapping-street, I saw him stopped and detained by Wood. I was then about a dozen yards from him when Wood stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain, upon your solemn oath that no provocation took place, except what you have stated - A. None at all, at any time whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. Were there other persons passing at the time - A. I saw not any.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public place - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not jostled him in the street - A. I am certain I did not. I was coming very seriously to my own home without touching him, or even looking at him.</p>

Yes, I met him in the passage, he came in very much confused and running, he ran into the dark kitchen instead of going into the tap-room, where there was light; he turned himself against the wall in the kitchen, and got his two hands together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in his hands - A. I saw something glistening as he came in, in his right hand, he seemed to wish to conceal it, coming by me, but turning round I had a sight of it. When he was against the wall, Lawrence the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030026"></xptr>came in, he said, where is he, where is the man who has cut my face; I said, here he is; the prisoner dubbed himself down, and ran with his head down between Lawrence and me, and went out the same way.

            . I live with Mr. Peasgood, a butcher in Wapping street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Gun public-house - A. About fifty yards. On the evening of the 23d of February I was at my master's door between nine and ten o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief, I observed the prisoner running along the street, from the Gun public-house; upon that I instantly caught him by the collar and stopped him. I observed him put his right hand to his pocket to take out something, it shined, I immediately caught at it and took it out of his hand; I kept it in my possession untill I gave it in the charge of the officer the same evening, and I delivered him up to the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. M'CARTHY. I am an officer of the Thames police. The prisoner was brought to our office on the 23d, about ten o'clock. I saw Lawrence, he was terribly cut, and this was delivered to me, a brass ink-stand case, with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Look at that - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>M'Carthy. I examined the blade of the knife, it appeared bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the blade did you, it appeared bloody - A. I looked at it that night. When Wood gave it me it was bloody, I unscrewed the case and looked at the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. How was that instrument when you first took it - A. It was in the case screwed up.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long would it take to screw and unscrew that knife - A. About half a minute.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon, I believe - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of February, in the evening, did you examine the wound of the prosecutor - A. I did; the wound was about four inches in length, a deep wound, part of it on the inferior jaw, and part of it on the superior, it was in a semicircular direction; had the maxillare artery been cut there would have been a risk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it all pass over the maxillare artery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at all cut - A. No, by no means; the maxillare artery was not cut, the wound was not so deep in the situation of the artery.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have caused death in all probability if it had cut the maxillare artery - A. Yes, there would have been a serious operation of taking up the coracoid artery, which is a doubtful operation.</p>
               <p>Q. With what sort of an instrument was it done - A. I cannot say. It could not be smaller than the knife I saw. I imagine that knife would have inflicted such a wound. I have no doubt it was done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. The maxillare artery was in danger - Yes, which is a branch of the coracoid artery.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking up the coracoid artery - A. Passing a ligature of wax thread, and tying it.</p>
               <p>Q. That would stop the flow of blood - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That inkstand is not mine; I want to see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let him see it, do not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had an inkstand similar to this, the handle of the knife was on a small bit of iron. I recollect nothing of the affray, nor cutting any body with a knife. I found myself in prison all over mud, and my bones all over beat. I lodged a week at a public house, I wrote to the landlord of the public-house to come, he has not come.</p>

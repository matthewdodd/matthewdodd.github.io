            ; we are drug brokers, Queen-street, Cheapside. The prisoner was my clerk, in March last; he was entrusted to receive money on my account; he was to pay it over to us. He never accounted to either of us for the two pound ten shillings and sixpence received of Mr. Pilham. I told him I discovered on going round to several of my customers, that he had received brokerage, but to what extent, I did not know; he then told me. I neither threatened or promised him any thing whatever. He then set down on this paper, and what he could not remember he took out of the ledger; he set down this two pounds ten shillings and sixpence, as part he had received of Mr. Stewart on my account, and had never accompted for it to us. This conversation took place on the 15th of June; I had dismissed him prior to that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

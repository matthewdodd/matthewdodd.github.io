                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live at 13, King's Head Yard, High Street, Lambeth—last Saturday night I was in the Olive Branch public-house, Waterloo Road—the prisoner came in, and called me over and asked me about a row with Ainge—I said I knew nothing about it, he asked if I wanted to fight; I said "No"—he struck me, and I returned the blow—a constable came in and turned us out—when we got outside we began fighting out there, we had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> and he went away—I went after him and we had another bit of a struggle, and I chucked him on the ground; we both fell on the ground together; he pulled out a knife while he was on the ground, he had it open in his hand—I said, "Are you going to pull a knife out?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "What for?" he said, "To stab you"—I kicked him in the eye, on the fore<lb></lb>head—I tried to get up to get away from him, and as I caught hold of a lamp-post he rushed at me and stuck the knife in my arm; he then walked away—I did not know I was wounded till I saw the blood running down my arm—I went after him and chucked him on the pavement, and a constable came up and laid hold of him—I was taken to the station and a doctor came and sewed up my arm—I had not been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am surgeon to the L Division—I was called to the station and examined Purdy; he had a wound about 4 inches long on the back part of the right arm, about an inch deep—he had lost a considerable amount of blood; I had to put in four sutures—the cut went through the coat and shirt—this knife would cause such a wound; it must have been used with considerable force, as it is rather blunt—the wound was fortunately in a safe part, there is no artery of any size there—I should say he was sober.</p>

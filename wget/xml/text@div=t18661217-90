I am an inspector of police on the Great Eastern Railway—on 24th November, in consequence of information from last witness, I went to the prisoner's house, between nine and ten in the morning—he was not at home—I then went to 65, High Street, Shadwell, and there saw him—I said, "Well, Crume, you are here"—he said, "Yes"—"Yes," I said, "I want you for the pork affair this morning"—he appeared very much surprised, and said, "Whoever told you I was here?" I said, "Never mind, I am here, and you will have to go with me"—he said, "Had you been ten minutes longer I should not have been here"—he said he would not go with me, as I had no authority to take him—I told him if he did not go with me I would call in a man in uniform, and he could compel him to go—he then said, "Well, as it has come to this, I will go and see it out"—on the way to Bishopsgate he asked me where I was going to take him to—I took him to Mr. Russell's office, as I did not know what the charge would be, stealing or receiving—he said, "I did not steal it; I know who did, and I knew it was wrong when I had it; I have brought disgrace upon my wife and family, and had I known I should</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of Police on the Great Eastern Railway—in consequence of information, I went with Crawley and searched the house, 7, St. James's Place, Old Ford—in the back kitchen I found a quantity of meat wrappers, eight sacks belonging to various persons, a quantity of malt in a barrel, and in the lead lining of a tea chest in a water tank in the yard I found a stone bottle which would hold about four gallons, and two tin cans which had been recently emptied of oil—I ex<lb></lb>amined the coal cellar, and found in the far corner a large quantity of oil, I should think at least six gallons—it was such oil as is used by the com<lb></lb>pany—some dried coal-dust was thrown over it—I found two bags of plums in the back kitchen—Crawley found the things in the bedroom—the prisoner was brought to my office about four o'clock the same afternoon by Crawley—I said to him, "Crume, are you aware what you are brought here for?"—he said, "Yes, it is respecting the pork job this morning I suppose"—I said, "Yes; how do you account for the possession of it?"—he said, "I shall not say here, this is not a Magistrate's place"—I then said, "I have found a quantity of other property at your house, such as bottles of wine, rum, sacks, plums, nutmegs, cigars, and oil; how do you account for the possession of the property?"—he said, "I shall not say here, I may say somewhere else"—I said, "You must consider yourself in my custody for the present unlawful possession of the articles"—he has never to my knowledge given any account of them whatever—on the night of the 23rd he was on duty as a pointsman, in order to shunt the luggage trains—there are two men attached to that box, and each man has a locker in it, with a key of his own—I saw the locker in which some pork was found, it was the prisoner's locker—thirty-nine pounds of pork was found there, and brought to me on Monday morning by one of my sergeants—I compared all the pork, and fitted it—the piece found on the prisoner matches the pieces found in the locker, they formed a portion of the same pig; there was only one leg—I assisted in putting the animal together—what was found on the prisoner and in the locker completed the whole pig,</p>

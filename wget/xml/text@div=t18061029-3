               <p>Q. Early in the morning that has been mentioned, were you passing by Mr. Hembrow's door. - A. Yes, about two in the morning I saw the door open, I did not suspect any robbery; I supposed as butchers were early risers, they perhaps were going to market; I was going by the watchman came past, he looked in and said halloa, upon which I turned my head, I saw immediately afterwards a scuffle between the watchman and another person, they both fell on the ground, and the prisoner got up and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, whoever he was, ran away. - A. Yes; I turned back, I asked no questions of the watchman, I ran after the man and called stop thief; when he turned up Bond-street, I lost sight of him till I came to Vigo Lane, there I saw the watchman bringing him back, I said to the watchman I believed he was the man by the dirtiness of his stockings that had been down with the watchman at Mr. Hembrow's, let us take him to the house to see whether he is the man; when we came to the bottom of Bond-street, we met the watchman who had been down on the ground with him.</p>
               <p>Q. That watchman's name is Haydon. - A. Yes, He said this is the man, I have got a piece of his coat, he produced a piece of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that his coat was torn. - A. Not till the watchman mentioned it, and then I thought he was the person; the piece of coat which the watchman had, matched with his coat. We took him back to Mr. Hembrow's house; we asked him if he knew this man, he said yes, he had been his man; he took us into his accompting-house and there was a hole in the wall, it appeared as if they had been forcing the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Sparshott, and live at Hunston, in Sussex, next door to the deceased Charles Upsdell, his garden adjoining ours—it is separated by a high wall of Mr. Pearson's, and by a quick set hedge of Mr. Upsdell's, you can see through the hedge, I could not see into Pearson's garden—on Thursday afternoon, 26th October, I was in my garden and heard Pearson in Upsdell's garden—their gardens adjoined they run at right angles to mine, Upsdell's garden is on the right and Pearson's on the left—there is a high wall-between them—I heard both Pearson's and Upsdell's voices; I heard Pearson telling Mr. Upsdell "Your cows are in my garden "—Upsdell used bad language and said "I will do for you, and I will see it out Pearson "—I heard no more words, I heard blows, I could not see them, the wall separated us—the blows were in Pearson's garden—I saw them in Upsdell's garden and go towards Pearson's, and it was after that I heard the blows; I could not tell how many blows; there were more than two; they were heavy blows—I heard no voices at the time I heard the blows—I heard no more expressions after they left Upsdell's garden—the next thing I saw was Mr. Upsdell return to his own house by the hedge, the way he went; that was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after—he appeared to walk very weak, and he was covered with blood—I did not notice his head, he had no hat or cap—he was not doing anything with his hands, only walking to his own door.</p>

Upsdel—in consequence of what she said to me I went round to Upsdell gares and found him at the upper and of his own gardens towards the straw yard—he said "Help me get my cald in, see what Pearson has done for me"—he had his head tired up with a handkerechief, and he was covered with blood; blood was running from him then—I saw him walk indoors—soon after that I went for Dr. buckls—I did not see anything of person.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Draper &amp; Freeland, clerks to the County Justices at Chichester—on 27th October, I was present with the superintendent of police at Upsdell's house—the prisoner was taken there in custody; I heard the deceased in his presence make a statement which I reduced into writing—the prisoner cross-examined him—Upsdell made his mark and the Justice signed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The deposition of Charles Upsdell, taken in the presence of George Pearson. I live here, I have lived twenty years in this house; the prisoner George Pearson lives a few doors from me; I was in Pearson's garden about 4 o'clock this evening; I went after my calf which had got into Pearson's garden. He knocked me down with-a great stick about four times, he hit me. The stick was about 10 feet long, it was a clothes prop. He knocked my head all to pieces, I was 10 feet from him. He did not say a word to me, nor I to him. I fell on the ground from the first blow. He hit me three times afterwards. After the first blow was struck, while I was on the ground he said I was not a going to take the calf out of his garden. I got up again and drove the calf off the premises. Another man, my lodger, Joseph Hammond, came to my assistance, I was covered with blood—when I went into the garden, Pearson came from the granary with the pole, in about an hour or more. We had some conversation about some straw; he wanted a barrow load of my straw for his pig. He wheeled it out of the barn in my wheelbarrow. We had no words about the straw, I sold it to him for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I have never had any quarrel with him. After he had struck me he put the prop behind the granary. He did not come to my assistance, Joseph Hammond came to me. I called out for <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> to help me take the calf out of the garden. I was able to walk into the house afterwards; I sent for the doctor soon after I came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a duly qualified surgeon, practising at Chichester—I was called on to attend the deceased about 5 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, 25th October, for a wound in the head—he had lost blood—the third finger of his left hand was bruised; it appeared to be a recent bruise, such as you get in a jamb—on the left wrist there was another bruise and slight abrasions; and on the forehead and nose there were slight scratches—upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I found a clean incised wound, about 4 inches long, on the left parietal bone, going right through the scalp, both plates of the skull, into the brain itself—there were no signs of bruising about the wound—there was no other wound on the head—on throwing back the scalp so as to lay bare the skull, there was no sign of bruising—the cut in the skull was a clean cut, the edges were</p>

               <p>sharply defined, and it terminated more abruptly at the anterior part, that is towards the forehead, than the posterior; I mean that it was more perpen<lb></lb>dicular, not so sloping, as if made with an instrument thicker at the bottom than the top—there was a slight depressed fracture at the anterior part as well; that is what is called a star fracture; it was about the size of a fourpenny piece; the inner plate of the skull was driven down between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch; the greater part of 'the wound was 1/4 of an inch deep, but in the centre of the wound, in the brain, it went very nearly £ of an inch—the width of the fracture of the bone was about 1/8 of an inch—the width of the external wound on the scalp was retracted to 1/2 an inch or more—when you cut the tissues they alway come back directly from muscular contraction—there was no indication whatever of a blunt instru<lb></lb>ment on the scalp itself—it was a clean cut wound—in my opinion it was impossible that it could have been done by this pole—I compared the bill<lb></lb>hook with the wound, and in my opinion such an instrument would produce such a wound—the deceased's cap was shewn to me by Mrs. Upsdell—I find in it now a perforation corresponding with the wound on the head; there is a cut about 4 inches long on the left side of the cap, it goes through the outer part and after that also goes through a small layer of wadding and through the lining of the cap—the blow must have been a violent one, with a sharp cutting instrument, to go through the cap, the lining, and down to the substance of the brain—you often get the star fracture by the actual violence without anything actually touching it—it is a kind of a spreading out of the force—the primary cause of death was inflammation, produced by the wound; he died from the effects of the violence to which he had been subjected—from the character of the wound I should think he must have been stooping at the time the blow was struck, or he might possibly have been on the ground; I can't say—he was a taller man than the pri<lb></lb>soner—I should say the person who struck the blow was in front of him—the bruises I have spoken of might have been caused at the same time, by the back of the same weapon, I mean the graze on the wrist and the jamb on the finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a microscopic examination of what was on the bill-hook, not of the bill-hook itself—I could find no recent marks of its having been knocked about—it is very blunt—I examined it on the Satur<lb></lb>day, the 28th, following the Thursday—I stated before the Magistrate "There were two hairs adhering to it which were human hairs, but they had evidently been there some time "—that had reference to the pole—there were either rabbit or hare hairs, on the bill-hook, they corresponded with either—I was before the Magistrate and also before the coroner—the deceased never complained of being struck with a sharp instrument—I have been qualified as a medical man two years—there was a scalp wound.</p>

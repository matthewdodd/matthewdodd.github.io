               <p>Q. Is he a house-keeper. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time the prisoner at the bar coming to your house to take lodgings - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 28th of July. - A. It was either the 28th or 27th of last July; it was about twelve o'clock in the day; he asked me it I had got any apartment to let, I told him I had the first floor; he went up and looked at it, he asked me if I could let him have the use of the parlour, I told him I would; the prisoner looked round the parlour, and said he wanted a book-case, I told him I would get him a book-case; at last as he was going out into the passage, he looked very poorly, he asked for a glass of spring water.</p>
               <p>Q. How hid he appear to be poorly. - A. He pretended to be faint; I ran down stairs to get the water, when I came up, the prisoner was gone. I missed the watch from the mantle piece before I put the water out of my hand; it hung in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in that room. - A. Yes, that was the room in which he wanted the book case.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the watch in the back parlour while he was there. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your apartments. - A. He was in the house about a quarter of an hour; he went up stairs, in the second floor, I did not want him to go up; he did go up, he said he wanted a room for two servants; and he found his own plate, and linen, and he wanted the use of the kitchen; he went down to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before had you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was this. - A. A metal watch capped and jewelled.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the maker. - A. Tuck, No. 10766.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since. - A. No. It was a gilt case, just coming home from being gilt, with gold hands; it opened at the back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your loss did you see the prisoner. - A. About three weeks after. I saw him in Clerkenwell prison.</p>

            . Q. What is you business. - A. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Chandos-street. On Tuesday the 28th of July, about half after one, to the best of my recollection, the prisoner brought a metal watch to pledge made by

             of Cockspur-street; it is a remarkable watch dome, capped by a spring; you open the back and by another spring you open the cap; it does not open by the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the number. - A. I did not; they were plain gold hands. To the best of my recollection it was a gilt case; he wanted seven pound upon it; I asked him how it was possible he could ask seven pound for a watch like this; which had it been made by a watchmaker he would not charge more than that, much more when it was made by a silversmith; I asked him what he gave for it, he said fifteen pound; I no ways credited the story; still the genteel appearance of the prisoner made at that time, I thought though he told that plain story it might be that he thought my judgment might be such that I might go by what he said, rather than my own judgment. I offered him three guineas and a half; with which he was not satisfied; he took it away and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the person. - A. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered him three guineas and a half for it, of course you thought it was worth that. - A. The value of it according to my judgement was about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, supported with confidence that the serious charge that is alledged against me will meet with a just discrimination of mercy and justice, that is always exemplary distributed to every unhappy prisoner, and I trust that my case will be considered with humanity and attention from the honourable jury; I having served his Majesty's army most of my life. By a succession of distress I have been obliged to sell my commission to support my wife and family; the difficulty of procuring for them lodgings, I was under the necessity of looking at a great many; for while I was continuing in London I was under some considerable expectation. My lord, many cases collected together to implicate a criminal must without any other effect reduce his character to a great question of integrity, and is a great state of disparagement to him. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, in such case I stand before you. I happened to be apprehended in one case under suspicion of stealing a watch; a vast number of people that kept lodging houses appeared at my examination, in order to see if they might identify my person to lay their charge against me; the present prosecutrix appeared; she deposed that she missed her watch about ten minutes after I left her house, that her husband was making enquiries after the watch at the pawnbrokers, get no watch has ever been produced.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor). While the prisoner was in your house and you saw your watch to the time you missed it, had there ever been any other person there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(to pawnbroker). Did the watch appear to be lately gilt. - A. It had not the appearance of being lately gilt; it had the appearance of a new watch; it wound up in the back. I am sure it was on a Tuesday he came to me; my young man was out on the Monday.</p>

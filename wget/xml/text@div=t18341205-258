                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Robert Gadbury, who lives at Bethnal-green. I have known Whitton three or four months—on the morning of the 28th of November, I saw her in Brick-lane—she asked me where I was going—I told her no where particularly—she asked if I would come to her sister's—I said I did not mind—I went there, and saw Woodi<lb></lb>son and Huckley—Woodison asked me if I would take my boots to pawn—I said, "No, I could not do that, I should catch it"—I sat down some time—Woodison and Nuckley went and brought in a pigeon—they ripped the belly open, took the heart out, stuck it full of pins, and roasted it, and said some words, but I do not know what it was—I sat down—Woodison and Whitton came up to me—Whitton put her hand upon my mouth—Nuckley stood by—she did not do any thing—before they took their hands away from my mouth—they said would I agree to let my boots go till night, and they would get them out for me—I was frightened, and said, "Yes," because they should take the hand from my mouth—they then took off my boots, and gave me two old ones to put on—I went to the pawnbroker's with them—they all three made me go—I pawned the boots for half-a-crown, but they were with me—I did not say any thing to the pawnbroker, because they promised they would get them out at night—I took the money and the duplicate from the counter—Woodison said, "You young heifer, give me the money"—I gave her the money and the dupli<lb></lb>cate—they then went and bought four pennyworth of sprats, and a pint of beer—this was on Friday—I stopped with them till Sunday, but there was no opportunity of getting away till then—Woodison brought a man home, and they locked me in a room with him—the man wanted me to come on his knee—I would not, and I screamed out—he then sent for some gin, and the door was opened—I ran out—I went past my mother's door, but would not go in as it was so late—I then met Whitton in the street, and</p>

               <p>went home with her, and sat in a chair all night—Woodison had asked me to go and take a pig, or if I could not get a pig to take a fowl for her—my mother came and fetched me on Sunday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Whitton.</hi> I was not there. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, she took me to Woodison, and she held my mouth when the shoes were taken off, between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke's Head, Mint-street, Borough. The prisoner came there on 24th Aug., a little before twelve o'clock at night, and asked fora bottle of stout, which was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the bottle until returned—he laid on the counter half a sovereign in payment—I laid down the change, then took up the half sovereign, rang it on my finger in the usual form, and also looked at it, and found it to be a good one—the prisoner said the stout was not for himself, and the parties were not in the habit of paying more than 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I could not take 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and therefore I must take it back again—I laid down the half-sovereign again, and he returned the change; and then be said, supposing the parties objected to pay the price, would I return the money again?—I said, "Yes; certainly"—I did not see what he did with the half-sovereign when he took it up—I gave him the change back, and he laid a half-sovereign on the counter again—I took it up, examined it, and found it was bad—he was then going out—I called after him before I left the bar—I then ran after him, with the half-sovereign in my hand—I lost sight of him—I returned in two or three minutes, and found him at the counter—I said, "Give me the half-sovereign you gave me first; I do not want this," showing him the money I had in my hand—he said, "What half-sovereign?"—I said, "You know very well what half-sovereign"—I told him it was a bad one—he did not say anything to that, but said he did not know what I meant, or words to that effect—two policemen came in, and I gave him in charge, and gave the half-sovereign to Delany.</p>

I went into the prosecntor's house with Fielding—the prisoner was there—I heard South say, "This is not the half-sovereign you gave me first; it was a good one, and this is a bad one"—the prisoner said, "If it is bad, I know nothing about it; I got it from my brother to come for a bottle of stout"—I asked if he had got any more money?—he said, "No"—South gave me the half-sovereign produced—I and Fielding took the prisoner into custody—he had his back to the counter, facing me, and I observed him move his mouth, as if attempting to swallow something—I immediately took hold of him by the throat, to cause him to throw up what-ever he had in his mouth—I then put my finger into his mouth—he bit me, and caused the blood to flow—he succeeded in swallowing whatever he had in his mouth, and fell on the ground and rolled about as if he was in pain—</p>

                  </hi> (78 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On 22nd March, at a little before six p.m., I was on duty in Upper Street, Islington, and saw the prisoner and a woman walking together—they looked in at Mr. Ashford's window a few minutes, and the woman left the prisoner and went into the shop—the prisoner walked on a door or two, and then stopped—the woman came out and joined him, and passed something to him, which he put in his pocket—they walked on together to Mr. Harding's, a hairdresser's, looked in at the window, and she left him and went inside—the prisoner walked on and waited for her, and while he was waiting he put on this pair of kid gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she then joined him and passed something else to him, which he put in his pocket, and they walked to Odell's button shop; they stood look<lb></lb>ing in at the window, and I passed them and crossed the road—they then turned back, crossed the road, and went through the churchyard—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them—the prisoner saw me, and pulled out this paper, a piece of one of Mr. Harding's handbills, which he threw inside the church railings—he ran through the churchyard, and I ran after him—as he passed 3, Church Passage, I saw him throw something down the area, which jinked like money—I followed him into Cross Street, where he threw away a cake of soap on to the pavement—I picked it up, caught him, and took</p>

               <p>him to tbo station—I asked him going along what he threw the soap out of his pocket for—he said, "It is mine, I must have dropped it"—I took the gloves off his hands—I found in his pocket this other part of Harding's handbill, these two small images, this skein of Berlin wool, and this lady's collar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); also five good five-pound notes, two half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, five florins, four shillings, seven sixpences, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all good, and a watch and chain—I went back to 3, Church Passage; 47 <hi rend="italic">N</hi> got over into the area and picked up six bad half-crowns, which he handed to me, three wrapped in one paper, one in another, and two loose—I produce a bad half-crown which I received from Davies, another from Thaine, and another from Ryan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Church Passage a public thoroughfare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was not raining, but it had been—I said nothing about the handbill the first time I was before the Magistrate, but I did the second time—I told the inspector I had heard something fall from the prisoner, and the prisoner heard me—I also said so on the first examination before the Magistrate—the inspector and a constable were present when I took the handbill out of the prisoner's pocket, I was in uniform—the address the prisoner gave was quite correct.</p>

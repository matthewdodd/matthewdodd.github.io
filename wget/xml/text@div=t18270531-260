In consequence of information I went to Mrs. Wood, in an alley, in Bunhill-row, with Plaistow, early in March - I there found six muskets with our mark on them, a quantity of ramrods, a Dutch barrel, and a barrel guage. Morecock had given me information that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know the muskets? A. They have the mark L. and W., which we always put - we never sold them, for they are not quite finished; they are guns, but not finished - they have no triggers, but they are guns - we had no other outdoor workman - we had six or seven workmen who had goods of this description - there is no mark on the stock, but on the barrel - we never sell them in that state - guns of manufacturers are sometimes mixed, but no man takes in any but his own - this stock has had a mark on it, but it has been sawed off.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. It was my duty to give out stock-guns. I delivered the prisoner out some goods the latter end of the year - we had great confidence in him - we allow those men, whom we have confidence in, to come into the warehouse, but no others - we gave guns out in twenty-five or fifty in a lot, and very seldom give out thirty; such a thing might happen - I bring out five at a time from the warehouse - the prisoner has, perhaps, taken them from my arms, or I might put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310102"></xptr>them just at the door, or he might come into the warehouse - he would take the furniture with them, according to what number he had; the small work is kept up-stairs - he used to take the work away in a truck, which he and a boy brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You deliver them to a boy? A. He sometimes brought a boy with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever send a boy alone? A. He has I believe sent a boy when he has been busy - there was one other man whom we placed confidence in - he would have them delivered out in the same way; the prisoner could not get into the stock-room when I was not there - I kept the key, but I might be at another part of the premises - I do not think he could take twenty-five guns, and the materials without my knowledge - I delivered him the last lot about November - I enter them on a slate, and a clerk enter them in a book - he is not here, but the books are - I know he had some work home in February - all the work, which goes out and comes in, are entered; and these entries have always tallied - I cannot say how long I have left him in the warehouse; he might have taken guns without my knowing it - nobody else is in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he employed by your master the end of last year? A. Yes; I cannot tell how many indoor workmen we had, but we had no out-door workman then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He could not take thirty guns without your knowing it? A. No - he sometimes took his own work himself.</p>

            . I was a gun-screwer in the prosecutors' employ, and left him on the 4th of November. I remember seeing a Dutch gun on his premises. I have since that seen the barrel at Plaistow's. There was a guage there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it? A. The breech nail-hole is not exactly in the middle - that might happen to others.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you seen it in his premises? A. Ever since I have been there, which is about twelve months, and I left it there - the prosecutors' servants used to come there at times. I do not know whether they could see it - it might be behind other guns.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutors' employ, from October last, till May. I was a screwer - the prisoner gave me one hundred and twenty-one rods, and one black Dutch barrel, and a guage in April - he told me to take them to my own house; I did so, and returned them to him by his order - he came in just as I was going away, and asked if I had any friend, who I could leave them with for a week - I said in two or three minutes that I thought I did know a person; Mrs. Ann Wood, of No. 42, Banks'-court; Blue Anchor-alley, Bunhill-row; he told me to leave them for a week. I took them there; he said he could go for them, and if he said his name was Chambers, she was to let him have them. I told Wood so - I continued to work for him until the 5th of May, I told him what I had done - after this I heard of the prosecutors' being robbed, and gave them information. Mr. Lacy went with me, Ward and the officer, to Wood's. I found the goods in the same state as I left them; we took them out of the cellar there and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known these goods at the prisoners? A. From November - they were not there before; not on the part of the premises where I was. Lacy's servants called occasionally about work - the Dutch barrel was in the cupboard, which was not locked - there were six English guns and one India gun, in the same closet, the room was locked when we were absent. Only two lads worked there besides me - I heard of the robbery about the 2d of May, from a stranger whom I met in Lambeth-street. I did not see the prisoner after that - I worked for him that evening. I thought he had a reason for sending them away - I have been at Birmingham to work since; I gave the prisoner no notice of going - I lived there from June to August last year - I took nothing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now; how much did you pay him when you returned? A. Twelve shillings for the rent of my room - he did not charge me with any offence. I went to work with him immediately - I had some unfinished work of his before I went.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You worked at piece-work and thought proper to go to Birmingham? A. Yes; I left the prisoners working in town - I took my wife with me, being ill. When I was at the prisoners we worked in the second floor back room, the cupboard was in that room. I returned to work with the prisoner as soon as he had work: which was in October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the prisoner you had left the work unfinished? A. No; he employed me again - the work was always in the open shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Chapel Court, St. Clement's Lane, Strand—the prisoner married my sister, they live at 7, Wilson Street, Drury Lane—on 23rd May, between 5 and 6 o'clock the prisoner came and asked me if I had seen his wife, I said no, I had only just come in from work—he asked me where my mother was, I said that I had not seen her, and then he asked me to go to his lodging—I went there, but found nobody there, and the chairs and tables were broken up and the place was in great con<lb></lb>fusion—I said to the prisoner that he was very foolish to break up the home I would have settled the matter differently to that—he offered me his mar<lb></lb>riage certificate and said' "Here take this"—I then went home and found my sister in my bed with my mother, it was then past 6 o'clock—I sat up and it was past 11 o'clock when the prisoner came up stairs, he said to his wife "Oh you are here are you," he then asked her to get up and go home but she did not answer—a few words then arose between them, and my mother told her to get up and dress herself and go home—the prisoner then asked her again if she would go home—she said that she had no place to go to—the prisoner said that if she remained there for a month he would remain with her; my mother said that he was as welcome there as she was—he then went to lie down alongside of her on the bed, he kneeled on the bed and my sister cried out "Oh Alice, I am stabbed"—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand strike her because <hi rend="italic">my back</hi> was turned, but I turned round and saw his hand raised and then he struck several times, but did not say anything—I clung to his hand and saw something in it—I at last succeeded in getting him away from my sister—he dropped his cap in the room and while he was looking for it my sister succeeded in escaping from the room—I went to him and begged him to listen to reason, and he said no, he would have her out of the house—they had been married a fortnight or three weeks but I heard him say that had he had her twelve years and he would not have her another twelve: I believe he had been living with her before—I found her down stairs in one of the front rooms, she was undressed and she was saturated with blood and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much excited, I went with her part of the way to the hospital and some friends took her the rest of the way—I got a policeman and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

               <p>prisoner coming in, but I saw him in the room—he asked her to get up and go home—I told her to arise and dress herself and go home—he said that if she stopped for a month he would stop too, and I said ho was as welcome there as she was—he laid down beside her, and I believe he knelt down and then he stabbed her—I saw him lift his hand and strike her on the breast, but whether he had anything in his hand I do not know—he did that more than once, and my daughter got her out of the room, leaving the prisoner with me, and I said to him that if I had such a life as that I would sell boxes of matches.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 131). I received information, went up stairs to to the room, and saw Catherine O'Donnell standing in front of the prisoner—she said "He has stabbed me"—I said "What did you do it with?"—he pulled a knife out of his pocket and said "This is what I did it with"—I said "What made you do it?"—he said "I came here after my wife and she picked up the poker to me," meaning that the mother did; "and I did it"—he said that he was quite prepared to be hung for the b----y old bitch, they had been living in misery for the last twelve years, he might as well be in hell as living with her"—he meant his wife then, I suppose—he was very excited, and I told him to be quiet—I took him to the station, the charge was read over to him, and he said nothing—he seemed very calm there and perfectly sober.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—on the night in question I went to my mother's house, and went to bed with her—I consider it was all my own fault, because the prisoner came and asked me to go home—I remember his coming into the room while I was in bed—he asked me to go home with him, and I refused to do so—I don't know whether he said any<lb></lb>thing when I refused—I don't remember how it was done at all, because I had been drinking—nothing was the matter with my chest or body when I went to bed—I did not notice whether my husband was beside me when I was in bed—I was too tipsy to know what was done—my sister did not take me out of the room—I went out of the room because my husband was in a great passion—I do not know whether anything was the matter with my chest then—I remember being in the hospital; I was there because I had some very slight cuts on me, a few on my arms and on my breast—I do not know how those cuts came—I remember nothing about it—I did not remember anything about it when I was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at King's College Hospital—on 23rd May, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, the last witness was brought there, and I found thirteen stabs on different parts of body body and arms—there were five small punctured wounds by her left breast and below it over the region of the heart, three in her left arm pit, two on her left shoulder, two on her left fore arm, and one on her left elbow—they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080060"></xptr>
               <p>all precisely the same size and shape, about one-third of an inch each, the depth was very superficial, but it was impossible to tell at the time whether they penetrated or not because of their small size—this chisel might have inflicted the wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say that they were superficial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were one-third of an inch deep, those in the soft tissues, but those in the chest I did not examine; my opinion is that they did not penetrate the chest; they were more on the ribs and the hard parts, and were not deeper than the others—she lost a great deal of blood, from which she was in danger—the wounds were in dangerous localities—she was in the hospital seven days, but has not been near me since she left, though she was discharged as an out-patient—if this was the instrument which infilcted the wounds, only the point went in—it was not stopped by the bones, but the blows had not force enough to wound deeper.</p>

I do not know whether her mother thought I was going to stab her, but she seized the chisel. I don't know whether she was going to stab me, but she stabbed Mary Ann, and Mary Ann wrenched the chisel out of her mother's hand and stabbed her. I took the chisel and put it in my pocket, and when the officer came I gave it to him.</p>

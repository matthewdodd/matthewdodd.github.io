            . I am thirteen years of age. I was walking down Long-acre, and saw the prisoner and another boy walking behind a gentleman in a brown coat; the prisoner said to me, "Why don't you go on, you young monkey." I then saw him put his hand into Mr. Burke's pocket, and take the handkerchief out. - Mr. Burke's turned round and said, "Now I am done." The prisoner gave the handkerchief to the other boy, who ran up Long-acre. I was in the road at the time.</p>

On the 21st of April I had a coat lying on a chest in the middle of my shop; and it was missing between one and two o'clock in the day. I did not see it taken; but the prisoner and that were brought into my shop. I took her before an alderman at Guildhall, and there swore to my coat. She said she took it in order to go and tell it for my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant ?</p>
               <p>Maddin. No, there was not. I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>

            . I was in my yard, but on turning my head about, I saw the prisoner going out of my shop. I ran after her, and said, mistress what have you been doing in my shop? She said she was going to sell the coat for me to a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her come into the shop ?</p>
               <p>D. Maddin. No, I did not; I never saw her before to my knowledge. I brought her back. She had got another coat with her, but it was not mine. I stop'd her till my husband came home, and he got an officer, and secured her.</p>

            . I live opposite to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner come out at his door with a coat, but did not see her take it. Mrs. Maddin came out and ask'd her what she had been doing. She said she was going to sell the coat for her; and I heard her say before the alderman she did not intend to steal the coat, but was going to sell into a man that was gone down the lane; at another time she said some body in the shop had told her the price of the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came to buy that coat for my husband, with some stockings and shirts, for he is going to Gibrakar; I had bought one before of a Jew; and I went to the door to call a friend to look at this in the light because the shop was dark.</p>

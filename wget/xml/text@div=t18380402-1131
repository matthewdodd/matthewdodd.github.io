                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, and live at Upper Edmonton. On the night of the 13th of February, my house was safely locked up—I was the last person up—in the morning I discovered that it had been broken and entered, and all the property that was within reach was taken—there were between seventy and eighty pairs of ear-rings, seventy brooches, a musical box, a time-piece, and other things—for some time I heard no trace of the robbery—after the 20th of February I received some information, and some things were produced to me—I can swear to them as mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I was staying at No. 6, Belmont-hill, Lea, at the time of the robbery. On the 13th March I was at Greenwich Fair, at 2 o'clock in the day—I had a blue silk purse, and a shilling and sixpence in it—a police constable came up to me—I looked to the place where my money was—I found no money or purse—I next saw the purse when the policeman showed it me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

On Wednesday, 80th March, I went to Greenwich Fair, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners there—my attention was called to them between half-past 2 and 3 o'clock—I was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour watching them—they were all three together; they were talking and walking together—at the expiration of that time I saw them go to the side of the prosecutrix—the female prisoner was on the right hand side, the prisoner Barton in front, and Smith behind, what they term covering the female—I saw the female leave the prosecutrix—upon that I went up to her—the three prisoners shifted from the prosecutrix, and went to the back of the booth—I followed them 30 or 40 yards, and from what the prosecutrix stated to me 1 caught hold of the female prisoner, and in catching hold of her she threw the purse out of her right band</p>

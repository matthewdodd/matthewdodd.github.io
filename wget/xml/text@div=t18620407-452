                  </hi>. I am a lithographer and printer, of 24, Derby-street, Birmingham—I carried on business in Howard-street at this time—at the latter end of February or the beginning of March last year, Rosenberg called upon me and asked me if I would do some indecent prints'which be produced, and which I refused—on another occasion he asked me if I would make my fortune: if I would do something—he produced a Russian rouble note, and asked me if I would engrave it; what we call get it up—I said that I would rather not, and after a few minutes he went away—he called again next day, I believe, and asked me if I would carry out the execution of that note—he produced it again, and I asked him why he did not get it done in his own country—be said that the risk was very great there, and the punish<lb></lb>ment was great; in England they were not so severe, but in Russia they would send their wives and families to Siberia—be said that I should have 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for executing it—I was to engrave the whole of the plates necessary for producing fac similes of the rouble note, and I was to print a quantity—I agreed to engrave it, and be said that he would send me a genuine not to work from, by post—I received this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) next morning; it was not in this state; I made it so by means of varnish, and out off the corners for the purpose of executing it—I saw Rosenberg again on, I think, the after<lb></lb>noon of the same day—be asked me if 1 had received the note all right—I produced it, and he asked me if I had done any portion—he wished me to do a portion of the red, the chocolate part, the ornamental border, and when I had done it to send it directed to K. Weber, 4, Nelson-street South, Birmingham, to show my ability—he gave me a printed card of the name of the street—I have not got it; Mrs. Corder burnt it—I proceeded to execute on stone the border which he required; I think I did it the same day—I struck off three or four proofs, and sent two to the address given—I had made a communication to Mr. Glossop, the chief superintendent of police at Birmingham, and to Mr. Collis—I think I traced the note before I spoke to the police, but am not sure; that was the commencement of the process.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you got any further than the tracing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, but am not certain—I believe I had not spoken to the police before I sent</p>

               <p>that proof, but I called on Mr. Collis, the Vice-Consul for Russia, before—that was my first step—I saw him and told him—that was on the same day that I traced out the border, but whether I traced it after I went or before I do not know—I communicated with the police that same day—I went down with Mr. Collis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On executing that proof, did you send a duplicate proof to Mr. Tandy, the inspector of police at Birmingham? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—this proof (<hi rend="italic">produced by Inspector Tandy</hi>) is of the same stone—I sent one like this to that direction by post, and on the next day, I think, Rosenberg came and grumbled that I had written anything inside the envelope—I had asked him in the letter if it was sufficiently good—he said that I should not have put any writing—he said that it would do very nicely, and I was to go on; he was very well satisfied—he came again in a day or two with Tobias, who is not in custody—he said before he brought them that he must show these portions to them—Reichberg also came on another occasion; they were con<lb></lb>tinually calling—Rosenberg came again with Tobias only, and again, I think, the same day with Tobias and Reichberg—Rosenberg produced the proof which I had sent to Weber—he kept that one himself; be always carried it in his pocket—he produced it and described the different technicalities of the note, and the different ways that the border ran, which was a thing I should not have noticed if it had not been pointed out—the ornaments at the top run to the left and to the right, but at the bottom they both run towards the centre; it is a thing which no casual observer would notice—a conversa<lb></lb>tion took place about the progress of the work, and I was ordered to go on with it—Rosenberg said that if I got on I should have some money on ac<lb></lb>count—from that time, and for weeks afterwards, I received continual visits from them, but not so much from Reichberg as from Rosenberg—I saw Weber about three weeks after the first interview; he came alone, and said that he was a gentleman from London, and then he introduced himself as Mr. Weber, and said he would bring up two gentlemen "On that business; you know"—I then mentioned the names, Reichberg and Tobias—he said, "Yes"—he then went away and called with them the same afternoon; the proofs of the note were then produced, and we talked about them—I cannot tell exactly the words, but it was in reference to the proofs, and to several minute details in reference to the shape of the Russian letters—they did not stop long then, but they came again in the evening and brought some sardines and biscuits with them—they stayed till half-past 12 at night—they sent out for some ale, and then the notes were produced—they sent the nurse for some water, into which they dipped the note and held it up to the gas to show me the water-mark, which then became very distinct—they showed me several other things connected with the note, especially the shape of the Russian characters—I had at that time an impression in full, of the face of the note ready for them, which had been struck off from the stone; that is the promissory part, "I promise to pay"—that is one of the stones which Mr. Tandy has—the engine turned work was then done—these two stones (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are for the face; they are quite similar to each other; they are both so exactly alike that I can hardly tell which one I used—this is the first I made, the smaller one; it was produced and shown to them—I think the plate was engraved subsequently—two or three hours were occupied in examining the proofs and the water-mark—one evening Weber and Tobias called—they came up in the office and sketched me conjointly the pattern of the water-mark on a piece of card-board; at least, I sketched it under their direction—I gave it to the police—</p>

               <p>this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—they sketched it on another piece of paper, and I believe they tore it up—all these matters were handed by me into the cus<lb></lb>tody of the police—I got the groundwork of the water-mark engraved sub<lb></lb>sequently in London, on copper, by McCullmn, of Lincoln's Inn-field—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I can tell it by one or two imperfections—it was executed in London according to my order, and I showed it to all of the prisoners—they expressed themselves very much pleased with it, and offered to buy me a machine to do the work myself instead of sending it to London to be done—they then wanted to see the beck border and some of the small writ<lb></lb>ing on the back, which was very particular—I omitted to say that I had two more one rouble Russian notes, one from Weber and the other from Tobias or Rosenberg, I will not be sure which, for the purpose of working from—this note was not very distinct after it was varnished, and I wanted a clean one—the letters at the back are very minute; you have to use a glass to see them—they promised to buy me a magnifying-glass, and when I got home I found an eye-glass had been left which I and they used at times in examin<lb></lb>ing the work—I struck off impressions from the copper-plate, and one came from London with it—I struck off impressions for them on very thin paper, and gave them to them—I subsequently procured them two daguerreotype plates on copper, silvered (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), of the back of the note—I had two, because this one was not sufficiently distinct to cut—the object of that was to work from it more easily than from the back of the note—it only required cutting out the work that was daguerreotyped upon it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the two notes I received from Weber—I wanted a very nice, clean one, because the work on the back was so minute; and he said he would go to London and get me one—he brought this excursion bill to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), or a similar one, prior to going, and asked me to write down the date on a piece of paper, the times he could go and come back by, and the fare—this is my writing on it—Weber speaks English very well—I do not know why he could not see for himself—this other note was given me by Rosenberg Weber, or Tobias—a few days after I made out that paper with the times on it, Weber came from London—he was away a few days—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether it is Weber's writing—I filed it on my receipt file, and after he came back to Birmingham from London be asked me if I received his letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on with different portions of it, and they called at different times—Reichberg and Tobias were sometimes in London and sometimes in Paris—I was told when they did not call that they were in Paris—I subsquently took impressions as the work went on, and sent some of them to London, to Rosenberg—he gave two addresses: No. 4, Little Prescott-street, Goodman's-fields, London, and 19, Little Alie-street, Whitechapel—I sent him proofs to both places—he gave me the address for that purpose—one was addressed to Reichberg at one of those addresses, and when Rosenberg came back to Lon<lb></lb>don, on a subsequent occasion, he told me that the proofs had been received all right, that he met Reichberg at a Jew's eating-house or dining-rooms, who told him that he had received them—these two stones are identical as regards the impressions—the first one was not sufficiently correct—they were so very minute in examining with the eye-glass that they discovered one or two places in some of the letters—they also said that the paper which I found was not sufficiently good, and they would find other paper—Rosenberg had an im<lb></lb>pression pulled on some paper which he brought—he said that the paper ought to be very tough, so that it would bear water without tearing; and they all explained pretty nearly the same thing to me—the toughness of the paper was a very important point—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two impressions which I pulled from the first stone—Rosenberg explained to me that the notes would be many yean before they reached the bank, as it was such a vast country; and that the people were very uneducated, and could scarcely read their own notes—Reichberg cannot speak many words of English—they ceased to call upon me about November—they wanted to take away the stones and other materials, but I would not let them have them—I had not produced a perfect note; there are six printings to produce a perfect im<lb></lb>pression—this is the groundwork for the colour, the yellow, a stone which is destroyed, was for the chocolate—these are for the promissory parts, "I pro<lb></lb>mise to pay;" and these plates are of the back, with the small writing and the border—the eagle was never done at all; but it is upon these plates—I never engraved a plate like this—this plate was never finished; I litho-graphed the border of it—about a month or two after the commencement of the matter, Rosenberg proposed that he and I should jointly turn round upon the others, inform the Government, and obtain a reward—he said that he could obtain 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him how I could have any confidence in him if he could tell of his own persuasion, and he said that he only did it to try me—about a week afterwards, Weber proposed the same thing to me, in almost the same words; but he did not say how much money there was—I told him that Rosenberg had proposed the same thing—he said that he was a bad man; and I said that he said he only did it to try me; and Weber said that he had only done it to try me—Ann Parsons is the person who was at my house—she was the nurse to my wife who was ill; and was there when the beer and biscuits were got.</p>

I am inspector of the detective police at Birmingham—in March, 1861, Mr. Corder made a communication to me of a certain application made to him, and, with my concurrence, he went on receiving the prisoners—in January, 1862, Brett came down from London, and, on 18th January, I went to Rosenberg's house, 54, Gooch-street, Birmingham—Brett told him that we were police-officers, and that he would be charged with forging Russian rouble notes—we said that we should search his house, and he said that we could do so—Brett asked him if he had any rouble notes in the house, genuine or forged; or any copies or specimens of notes—he said that he had not—we searched and found a small box on the mantel-piece, and among some letters and papers we found this. (<hi rend="italic">The varnished note</hi>)—I handed it to Brett, who said, "Where did you get this from?"—he said, "About twelve months ago an old man came to my house begging, a foreigner; he asked me to buy this, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Brett asked him if it was in the same state now as when he bought it—he said, "Yes"—he asked him if he knew him—he said, "I did not; he was a stranger"—nothing further was found in the house—we went to Weber's house on</p>

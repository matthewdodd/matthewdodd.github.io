                  </hi>. I am a woollen merchant, of 18, Basinghall-street.

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Young, a pawnbroker of Princes-street, Leicester-square. This duplicate (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is the writing of a young man who has left our employ—I know this is one of our duplicates—this is the shawl that was pledged.</p>

               <p>any promise held out to you—nothing was said at the time you gave up the pawn tickets about a general statement—I gave you a sovereign to leave London—I did not say if you would make a fair statement, I would give you a chance—I did not take you into custody at the time you gave me the tickets, because of Mr. Brown's promise—you left my employ the beginning of Jan.—I did not advise you to enlist, and go to the Cape of Good Hope—on my oath, I did not—I declined to give you any advice—you gave me these tickets up in presence of Mr. Brown—I had no particular reason for desiring you to leave London, but for your own sake—I never knew your address after you left the Minories—I do not know your address now—I have taken you now to satisfy the ends of justice—I was not aware that you called on one of my best customers, and solicited an order from him, until the day I gave instruct<lb></lb>tions for your apprehension.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The present proceeding is entirely a piece of malice towards me; he directed Mr. Brown to come to me, and said if I would make a fair statement he would give me a fair chance to begin the world again; I was told it on Saturday night, and I attended on the Monday morning; Mr. Brown told me to tell Mr. Wilson everything, and my best way was to leave London; he owed me a considerable amount for salary; after giving him the tickets, he said he would make inquiries the following day, and see what money he could get for me; I called on the Tuesday night, and he said he was very sorry he was not able to give me more than 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had therefore nothing to depend on but to look after some employ; I obtained employment, where I have been employed ever since; I called on two of his customers, and one gave me an order, and this coming to his ears is the cause of the present proceeding.</p>

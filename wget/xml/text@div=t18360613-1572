                  </hi>. I am a packer, in the employ of Mrs. Carden. On the 6th of June, I went to the house where the prisoner lives—I gave her the message that Mrs. Carden gave me, which was, that she had seen a shift in her box the preceding night, that she thought belonged to Mrs. Church, and wished me to take it to her—the prisoner went to her box, took out this shift, and gave it to me—she said "You may take it to Mrs. Carden, but it is my own—you are quire welcome to take it"—I saw that the mark had been picked out—there had been a little "C" which had been picked out—the mark of the red cotton was still there—there was enough left to show that a "C" had been there—it is a stout linen shift—she did not tell me where she got it from, nor say that Mrs. Donog<lb></lb>hue had given it her.</p>

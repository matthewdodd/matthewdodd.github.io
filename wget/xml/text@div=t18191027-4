               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, my Lord, we had four pots of porter among five of us. I went to Drury-lane, and there asked a woman the nearest way to Charing-cross. I was alone. The prisoner and another man came up, and said to the woman, What does he want? I said I wanted to be directed the nearest way to Charing-cross. They said they were going that way themselves, and should be there in a few minutes. One caught hold of each arm. I walked a very few paces with them before I told them I required no leading, but if they would direct me I would treat them with a pot of porter for their trouble. They wanted the porter, I saw a public-house door open, stepped in, and called for a pot; the landlord said it was too late, and he would not draw it. They both requested some gin, I would not give them any, and immediately stepped out of the door - they followed - the prisoner took my right arm and the other my left; we proceeded a little way down the street, and came to <placeName id="t18191027-4-crimeloc23">Brydges-street</placeName>

I said, No; he swore, and immediately the prisoner gave me a violent push on my shoulder, which forced me on the ground; the moment I was down the prisoner took a black leather pocket-book from my pocket - they cut it out, for the pocket was sound before, and I found it cut, and the pocket still buttoned. The other man put his hand into my other pocket, but it had nothing in it. I pursued the prisoner down Brydges-street, my foot slipped, and I fell again. I called out Stop thief! I was not more than forty yards behind the prisoner, and saw Smithers take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. No, the street was very light - it was a moonlight night; I never saw him before - I had walked thirty or forty yards with him. The public-house was below Long-acre - he was not running when Smithers took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know the way to Charing-cross - A. If it had been daylight I should have known it; I think the other man ran a different way. I am certain the prisoner is the man - he was never out of my sight - he did not run above a hundred yards.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. On the 11th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going down Brydges-street, when I came to Exeter-street I heard somebody fall, and saw the prisoner running from the prosecutor, who called out Stop thief! - it was very light; I was not ten yards from him - he was running, but when he saw me he stopped and walked. When I came within a few yards of him, he himself called out Stop thief! I said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man." He said No, he was gone up the street. I told him that I could see nobody else in the street - there was nobody else in the street. The prosecutor came up, and said he was the man - I found only 6 d. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night of the robbery I was returning from the Coburg Theatre, and heard the cry of Stop thief! A man ran out of a court on the right-hand side, I followed him, and Smithers collared me.</p>

             re-examined. There was nobody else in the street, except two or three girls - the prisoner came right across the street from where the prosecutor fell, at the corner of White Hart-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. I thought him rather fresh, but it might have been his agitation. He knew what he was about, and could run very well.</p>

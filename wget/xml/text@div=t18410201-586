                  </hi>. I lodge in Knight's-court, Green-bank, Wapping. On the evening of the 7th of January I met the prisoner, and began some conversation with him—I asked him what ship he belonged to—he told me, and said he wanted a lodging till the ship was paid, which would be on Friday—I took him to my place, out of charity, and he was there three days—on the 7th of January I went to cut some wood—I had two sove<lb></lb>reigns and one half-crown, which I had seen safe an hour before I went</p>

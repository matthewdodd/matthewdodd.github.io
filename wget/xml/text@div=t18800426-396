                  </hi>. I am lieutenant Colonel 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards—on the 12th March I was in command of the Queen's guard, St. James's—about 7.45 that night the prisoner came, and said he was a servant of Captain Hitchcock, Brigade Major, Chatham, that he had lost his great coat and money in it and a soldier's pass, and did not know what to do; that he had asked a policeman, and he had recommended him to come to the office of the guard—I sent him to the guard-room to write a statement, which the sergeant of the guard brought up to me, and I sent him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay his fare in consequence of his statement.</p>

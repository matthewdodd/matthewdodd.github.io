On the 17th of January, I sent her on an errand; she stopped longer than I thought proper; I told her of it - she was saucy, and said I might turn her out. I suspected her, went up stairs, looked in her box, and found my petticoat. I laid it down again, and sent for Atkinson, the officer, who came and took her up stairs to her box, in which were found a miniature, and a variety of articles of mine. She said she hoped I would forgive her. The officer produced a key to me, which opens my sideboard and drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOKE. Q. Do you let lodgings - A. No; sailor boys sleep there sometimes. The prisoner slept in a front attic, and a little girl with her, who I took as a servant - her box was not locked.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was fetched, and found the prisoner in the kitchen, and told her I wanted to go up to search her box. She wanted to go up stairs behind me, but I made her go before. I examined and found the property stated in the indictment. When the miniature painting was found, she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, pardon me, mistress, pardon me!" She wished to put her hands into her pocket, which I would not allow. I found a key there, which Mrs. Smith said had been taken off her bunch of keys; she said at the watch-house, that she had put some of the things into her box, but not all; that she found the key the day before, and forgot to give it to her mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour were you called in - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I live two or three hundred yards off. Mrs. Smith was agitated when the miniature was found. The box was open, and one or two things seemed to have been lifted up at the top, every thing else was laid with exactness. As soon as I went up, she said some person had been to her box, and had put the petticoat in, but said nothing about the other things being put there. She said the sash was her father's. The epaulet was pinned up in an old stocking, nearly at the bottom of the box. No conversation passed in the room - what she said at the watch-house was voluntary.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser; I had been with Worral. Three men rushed against him, I was rather behind them; they then came and rushed against me, and one of them struck me on my eye; we had not got far before the prisoner rushed out from a scaffolding, and took my cousin's pocket-book out of his pocket. I secured him, and saw it in his right hand - He threw it away. I gave him in charge. I was not drunk.</p>

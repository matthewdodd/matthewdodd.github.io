                  </hi> I am single. On the 18th of June I was walking in the Wandsworth-road—I had in my pocket a half-crown, a shilling, four six<lb></lb>pences, and a fourpenny-piece—I heard some one on my right side—I looked, and saw some money fall, and saw Bishop picking up some—the prisoner was at my side—he was nearest to me—Bishop asked me if I knew that I had had my pocket picked—I said, "No"—she said the prisoner had picked my pocket—I searched, and found that a shilling, four sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece were gone—the prisoner ran away—we ran after him—he was stopped by a policeman.</p>

My clothes were in a trunk in the club-room. I had some of these clothes on on the Sunday, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening - I had one of the gowns on that day. On the Monday the prisoner was there, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and staid till a quarter past ten, with a party of about thirty persons - I missed them while the company were there, having received information from a little girl, who saw the prisoner and another come down the stairs, very bulky. I went, and found the lock taken off my box - the prisoner was then gone. She was taken up in a few days. I am certain she was there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I took the prisoner on the Friday after the robbery, at the Royalty Theatre - I told her the charge: she denied having pawned the shawl, but she afterwards acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I attended a raffle at this house, and after most of the company had left I went out with the remainder, and about two yards from the door my foot touched something, which on my picking up proved to be a shawl - I enquired whether it belonged to any of the parties present - they did not claim it, but advised me to keep it. I am aware I was reprehensible in so doing.</p>

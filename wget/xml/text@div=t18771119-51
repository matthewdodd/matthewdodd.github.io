                  </hi>. I reside at Meopham, Kent—on the night of 23rd October I went round my house before going to bed, about 10.15—I particularly noticed the back kitchen window, it was fastened by a common spring catch—I awoke between 5 and 6 next morning—I got up about 7.15—when I got down stairs I found the kitchen window open sufficiently wide to admit a man—it must have been opened with a chisel or some-thing of that kind—there were marks of some instrument—the spring fastening was broken off and thrown under the kitchen-table—I missed two pair of boots, a coat, and a waterproof from the kitchen, and on going into the other rooms I missed two coats from a door, a greatcoat that hung across a chair in the back parlour, and several little work-boxes and writing-desks from the shelves, which I afterwards found in the garden—in another room I found that two or three boxes had been broken open and the contents strewed about the room, and some carried away—amongst other things I missed a Paisley shawl, and a clothes brush—I immediately went for the police, and in consequence of</p>

               <p>information I went from the station at Meopham to Fawcombe by the 10.30 train—I saw the prisoner get into a third-class carriage at Faw<lb></lb>combe—we went on in the train as far as Swanleigh, and there we tele<lb></lb>graphed on to Bickley—at Bickley we saw a fly, and we all got into the same carriage with the prisoner, and went on together to Bromley, where the prisoner was taken into custody—he was taken to the station there—I saw him searched, and the first thing he pulled out from his pocket was a very old-fashioned clothes brush—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I identify it as mine—it has been in our possession a number of years, ever since I can remember, and I had a new back put to it—this Paisley shawl was found wrapped round the prisoner's body, between his trousers and waistcoat—it is my wife's—she has had it fifteen or sixteen years—I can swear to it; it is constantly about with her wherever she goes, all day long—it always lies over the head of a couch when she is not well—I see it every day—there was nothing else found on him that I could identify.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—I was on duty at the Meopham railway station on the night of 23rd October, when the last down train arrived, at 10.45—the prisoner, in company with another man, arrived by that train—they gave up tickets from the Elephant and Castle and passed out of the station—Mr. Light's house is about 100 yards from the station—I saw the prisoner again just before 12, just opposite Mr. Light's house, as I was closing the station gates—the other man was with him—they were coming from the direction of Nurstead—I asked them if they had mistaken their way—they made no reply—I asked them a second time, and the man not custody said Yes, they had been about three-quarters of a mile—I then asked them where they were bound for—they made no reply, but walked on, apparently half intoxicated, in the direction of Meopham Green—I watched hem up the road about a quarter of a mile, by the Fox and Hounds—next morning, in consequence of what I heard, I communicated. with the prosecutor—I first telegraphed to Fawcombe station, and then rent there with the prosecutor—it is about three miles from Meopham—saw the prisoner on the platform at the Fawcombe station—he entered he back part of the train—I went on in the train as far as Swanleigh and telegraphed from there to Bickley for the assistance of a police-constable, knowing there was one on the bridge there—at Bickley we all got into the same compartment with the prisoner, and at Bromley he was given</p>

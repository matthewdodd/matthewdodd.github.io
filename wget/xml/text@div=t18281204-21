            . I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner; when I came up the people said, "That is the man;" the copper was standing by him - this was in Penton-place, about one o'clock in the day, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; I have tried the copper, and it fitted exactly - the prisoner said a man gave it him to carry, but he did not say who, nor where he was to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had to take some things to Pentonville, and on returning I met a man, looking like a bricklayer, and a sailor; they asked me to carry this copper - I took it up, and the sailor walked before; some person came and asked how I came by it - I said, "That man gave it me to carry;" they saw him, but did not take him - he went away. <rs id="t18281204-21-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

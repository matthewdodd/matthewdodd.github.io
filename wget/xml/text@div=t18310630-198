            . I lodge in High Holborn. I have a sister, named Charlotte, residing there - I saw the prisoner there, and he received 4l. 3s. 6d. for goods; this is the bill of them - he gave it at the time; it is his writing, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Where did you get the bill? A.From my sister - she is not here; she bought these goods - the goods were delivered at twice; I was present on the Wednesday, which was the last delivery, and then this bill was brought - it was made out in my presence, but I cannot say that I was looking at it; part of the goods were delivered then, and part on the Tuesday - the bill is in pencil.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 15th of June the prisoner brought this bill to me - here are my initials on it; it is written in pencil, and is 3l. 4s. 6d. - he paid me that on account of my father; this other bill of 4l. 3s. 6d. is his hand-writing - he never at any time paid me the difference.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say, that on the day he paid you 3l. 4s. 6d. he had attended Miss Doyle? A. Yes, he had; he had on the same day taken some goods to Mr. Maitland, in Bryanstone-square, about two or three o'clock - he rendered this account to me about seven or eight in the evening; the persons in the shop give in what they receive as soon as the customer is gone - but they give an account in the evening of what they have received in the course of the day - I saw the prisoner write this account in pencil;

             is a cousin of mine- here are five items on one of these bills, and only three on the other.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HAINES. Q. I believe you took the prisoner from the Emporium, in Greek-street, Soho? A. Yes - I had a character with him; I know that he did wait on Miss Doyle - I do not know that the sales were made on three different days; some bands and some stockings were sold at the counter, and they are not accounted for in the bill delivered to my daughter - they were taken home on the second day; I understand from the prisoner that part of the palmyrene was sold on the first day, which was the 14th of June, and part on the next day - my nephew,

            , did not tell me that the prisoner had sold the hose and bands to Miss Doyle; I did not know she had purchased them till I examined the bill at her house - we have the prisoner's check for the money he paid in, as every shopman does; it is not likely he should make a mistake in making out the check, though the goods were sold at different times; I do not recollect any mistakes being made after a bill has gone to the desk- but there may at the counter; we impose a fine on any one who made a mistake in their accounts, and they have been inflicted - we have also premiums.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the stockings were delivered at the counter was any bill made? A. Miss Doyle looked at some there - she selected some, and some we had to procure for her, which were sent to her; what she selected at the shop she would not have a bill of parcels made for, till she had the other articles, and would have to pay for them altogether - he would not account for them on the 14th; the check he gives to the cashier, with the money he pays in.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 15th of June - I found 1l. 9s. 7d. on him, and this bill of 4l. 3s. 7d; he gave it me out of his pocket - his master said that was what he wanted him for.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address, stated that his paving less than he received was quite a mistake, occasioned by the lady having made purchases at different times, which he should have discovered in correcting the books, and would have paid; and that there were constant mistakes made by other shopmen.</p>
               <p>MR. HAINES re-examined. Q.Is it the habit of your house to account at night? A. Yes, to see whether the shopmen's books agree with the cashier's, and with the checks they have given - if there were any errors there they would be rectified, but that would only refer to having a check too much or too little; I did not call on the prisoner to give any explanation of this - I told him what he was taken for, and he said I should find myself mistaken.</p>

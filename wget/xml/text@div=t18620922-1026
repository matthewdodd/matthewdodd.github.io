I live at-9, Holland Cottages, Milbrook-road, Brixton—on the morning of 19th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock, just after midnight, I was walking along the Walworth-road—the two prisoners, accosted me, and requested me to treat them—I said I would not, and they followed me, and intercepted me on the pathway; I still refused and then the elder prisoner said, "You b—, take that," knocking me off the path-way into the road, which is considerably lower—I fell; they both fell on me, and seized me by the throat—I endeavoured to call for the police, but it was</p>

I live at 20, Charles-street, New Kent-road, and am a pistol-maker in the employ of the London Armoury Company—a the morning of 19th September, I was near the end of the Walworth road, returning home, at about twenty minutes or a quarter to 1 o'clock—just as I turned by the Rockingham Arms, I saw a disturbance, and went to see what it was—I heard that a gentleman had been robbed—I lighted the constable's lantern for him, and when the light was turned on, I saw the watch lying in the gutter—he had Reynolds in custody at the time.</p>

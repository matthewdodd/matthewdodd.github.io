               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever before sent any things to Ware? A. No - Ware was not up when it was left.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live next door to Allen. I recollect the prisoner coming to my house with some duplicates - it is about nine weeks ago that he first came, on a Saturday evening, I think - he brought the ticket of a bed first, and wanted to sell it - I asked him to leave the ticket, and I would look at the bed at the pawnbroker's, which he did - I went on the Monday morning, but the pawnbroker refused to show it unless I paid the money - next day I went with two police-officers, paid the money it was pawned for, and then took it home - there were three other duplicates left with me at the same time - they related to other pawnbrokers - I saw these articles, and purchased the tickets of the prisoner, I got the articles out, and placed them outside my door, and sold them- I gave him 5s. for the ticket of the bed - I cannot say whether I gave him 2s. or 3s. for the others - I think it was a sheet, bolster, and blanket, but cannot swear - on Thursday morning, the 22nd of May, Allen's son came and told me a young man had left a table there for me; and two or three days previous to that the prisoner had told me he should bring one - the table is here - the blankets I sold after I had bought them - he asked me 5s. for the table and blanket together, which I gave him - I saw the prisoner about nine or ten o'clock on the morning the table came - he asked me if I had seen it - he turned round and saw it standing there - he said, "Oh, that is it" - I asked what he wanted for it - he said I should have them for 6s. as they were - he wanted the money - I did not wish to pay him till next morning, and I gave him 3s. or 3s. 6d. in part payment - I had seen him before I bought the table, when an offer was made of the duplicates of other things - I cannot say how long it was back - he used to come two or three times a week sometimes, and sometimes brought one ticket and sometimes two of various articles, which he wished to dispose of - some I bought, and some I did not, as they were out of my line - one ticket was for two miniature pictures pawned for 6d. - one for six neck handkerchiefs - one for window curtains - I redeemed those articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after you got the table from Allen, was it claimed? A. Not till the next morning - I had planed it over then, and rounded the corners, which were square, but not to change the colour and shape - I usually do so if it is in a bad condition - I have always told the same story about this - one of the pawnbrokers was Whiskard, of Bishopsgate-street, and the other one opposite Church-street - I went to a pawnbroker's in Shoreditch - I think his name is Sadler or Smith - I never took particular notice - I saw the shopman at the pawnbroker's in Shoreditch - I do not know his name - I did not tell him I bought them of Mrs. Kew, and gave 1l. for them, nor any thing like it, in any respect whatever - I bought the things of the prisoner, because having known him for two years I had a good opinion of him - I do not know whether he was a housekeeper - I know he was on the point of marriage - I do not know what has become of the tickets, except two the policeman took - I redeemed what I bought, and the pawnbrokers had the tickets - I thought all these tickets (looking at them) were his property - this is for a table-cover and bed gown in the name of Keen, I should call it - he told me the person who pawned the things for him had put the name on the duplicates - she told me the name of Kew, for several of the duplicates were written plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mention the name of Kew to Adnum, Smith's shopman, and say you bought them of Mrs. Kew, and gave 1l. for them? A. I did not - he did not ask me- I will not swear this name on the duplicate was meant for Kew - the prisoner told me they were pawned by Kew - I am not positive that the name on this ticket is Kew - I was three or four times in the shop in Shoreditch - I fetched a bed out of pawn, for which I got 28s. - I paid 5s. for the ticket, and, I think, 15s. 10½d. principal and interest.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEW re-examined. Q. Before you returned to your apartments and missed the things, had you at any time gone to your apartments to look at them? A. Only once, that must have been about the beginning of May, I then looked about, but did not miss any thing - I had a tea-caddy on the mantel-piece containing the duplicates - it was locked - I did not examined it - when I missed all my property the caddy was still on the shelf, but it was broken open and all the tickets were gone.</p>

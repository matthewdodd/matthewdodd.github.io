                  </hi>. I live at Clapham, and am in the habit of fetching my newspapers from town in a cart. About five o'clock in the morning of the 12th of December, I put 153 <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi> newspapers into my cart—about six I went to my cart, which I had left opposite the gateway in Shoe-lane, at the house where I fold and sort my papers—all my papers were then gone—I went to the Dispatch office to buy an equal number—I then came down Shoe-lane, and went up the Strand to Catherine-street, to announce to the trade that I had lost a number of <hi rend="italic">Dispatches</hi>—I saw Dunny, and told him—the prisoner passed me about half-past six, and I heard him call out "Here is the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi>"—I turned back, and asked how he came by them—he said he bought them of some man in the street, he did not know who—I called a policeman to take him, but he refused to do so—I then went with the prisoner to some persons whom he said knew him, but I did not find any person who would say any thing about him—he had fifty-five of these papers—it is the prac<lb></lb>tice of the trade to get them between five and half-past six o'clock—a per<lb></lb>son cannot get them without his name is down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time did you get them from the Dispatch office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At half-past four o'clock—immediately on the discovery of my loss I went to Mr. Whitty, and stated that I had lost these papers, and Prothero, his lad, directly said he saw three persons at the tail of my cart, with the tail-board down; two of them were short, and one was taller than the rest—his employer asked him whether he should know them again if he saw them—he said "Yes"—I had not spoken to the boy previous—I might have seen him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What did you do when you saw me at the tail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to my master—I did not say any thing—it was about twenty-five minutes past five o'clock—I told my master when the gentleman came in and complained about losing his papers out of the cart—there was another man besides you standing at the cart, which I thought was Mr. Edmonds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am in the news trade; I bought some papers at the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch office</hi>; we cannot get papers early enough ourselves; we get them from such persons as Mr. Edmonds; I bought two quires; and it is common in the paper business to change one for another; I said, "Here is the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch for the Sunday Times</hi>;"—he came to me, and said, "How many can you do?" I said, "Eighteen for sorts;" that is, for different sorts. I said I bought them in Shoe-lane; he said, "What did you give?" I said, "What do you give for yours?" He said he would call a policeman, and the policeman would not take me into the City. I took him to Shoe-lane, and Mr. Dyson said he knew me as being in the trade; he went to Mr. Taylor's, and there this boy said I was the man that took the papers out. I took the prosecutor to Fleet-street, and saw a man named Powell, who knew me. I bought two quires, and he lost five quires.</p>

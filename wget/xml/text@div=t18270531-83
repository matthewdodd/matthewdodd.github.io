On the 21st of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving my wife and daughter at home. I returned a little before eight - it was not then quite dark; I knocked at the door and nobody answered. Cole, the next door neighbour, came out, and gave me my key - I unlocked the door and went in, without shutting it after me; my son-in-law came in, in two or three minutes - and while talking to him I heard a noise at the up-stairs window; I immediately ran out, and saw a person struggling with Mr. Carter, he got from him - Carter immediately called Stop thief! and my son stopped the man, who was the prisoner, - I never lost sight of him; we secured him. I immediately said "I will go up stairs to see if any body else is there," and at that instant a person rushed down-stairs, ran out and got away; my wife went up-stairs. I followed her, and we missed some property.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went up-stairs to the first floor, after the men had escaped, and found my clothes taken out of the box - I found them down-stairs, tied up in a bundle, ready to be taken away, the box was not locked - I had seen all the things safe that day - the bundle was brought down to the ground floor, and put on the ironing-board; they are worth much more than 40s. at a moderate estimate; my husband had left me and my daughter at home - we both went out at half-past seven o'clock, locked the door, and left the key with Mr. Cole.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of April, between a quarter and ten minutes to eight o'clock, I went to the prosecutor's house - he is my father-in-law; in a very short time he said something - I ran to the door directly, and saw the prisoner scuffling with Carter; he got away, - Carter cried Stop thief! and I caught him in my arms, - a scuffle ensued; he hit me, but I detained him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the morning of 26th August I went with Inspector Craig and Detective Brown to 23, Little Clarendon Street, Somerstown—it is a brothel kept by the prisoner Thomas—Gray resides there—we asked if Mrs. Thomas resided there; they said yes—I asked for her; we saw her, and asked her what she did with the portmanteau and other things removed from Museum Street in company with a midshipman—Foster was dressed as a midshipman—Mrs. Thomas said she knew nothing about the portmanteau and other things and that Foster was not in, after a minute or two the woman Gray ran downstairs and said, "Tell, Mrs. Thomas, what you know about it"—we asked for the portmanteau and she said that Foster was upstairs—we went up and saw the prisoner Foster sitting in the room—it is a four-roomed house, the front parlour is occupied by Mrs. Thomas and her brother; the parlour is occupied by another girl that walks the streets, and on the first floor front room Foster and the girl lived, and at the back somebody else—we told Foster we were constables and asked him what he had done with the two portmanteaus he had removed from Museum Street-on the morning of 27th August—he said "Do you want me or the goods"—he then said "Come with me and I will show you where they are"—he took us to No. 13, <hi rend="italic">Little</hi> Drummond Street—the door was open and we went in—in the back parlour we saw a portmanteau with the letters A.G.L. upon it, and other things—we then told him he would be taken into custody for the unlawful possession of the goods—we took him to the. station leaving a constable in charge of the house—we immediately came back and I took Mrs. Thomas into custody, telling her that she would be charged with being concerned with Foster—she said "I don't know anything about it"—I took Gray next morning, and told her she would be charged with being con<lb></lb>cerned as well—on the 26th we inspected the premises and found a geat deal of property, the portmanteau, basket, and fittings, coat and pair of candle<lb></lb>sticks produced—we did not find any of those articles in Thomas' room at 13, Little Drummond Street—I found under the bed where Mrs. Thomas slept the pillowcase and napkin produced—we did not find the basket and portmanteau at Clarendon Street, they were found at Little Drummond Street, but we found a quantity of other things—I found a pair of candle<lb></lb>sticks in a carpet bag in the back floor of Mrs. Thomas' house, and a pawn-ticket of an Ulster coat on the chimneypiece underneath a glass—when 1 was taking Mrs. Thomas into custody she attempted to pass to her daughter some Bank of England notes and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold.</p>

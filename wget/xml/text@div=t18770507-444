                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, of 146, Kingsland Road—on 23rd April, 1877, I saw the prisoner Francis Charles Golding, who was a boot and shoe maker, at 5, 6, and 7, Bethnal Green Road—I had been acquainted with him a short time previously—he asked me to lend him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this lease from father to son, and I did so under the belief that it was a good lease—I received as security this indenture of 15th February, 1873—I saw him again in July, 1874, when he asked for a further advance of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this original lease. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated </hi>31<hi rend="italic">st May,</hi> 1831,<hi rend="italic"> from, the freeholder, Thomas Yarrow, and purporting to be for ninety years.</hi>) He said that it was for 90 years, that it was the original leane which his father received, and that it had 45 years to run—I believed that and advanced the money in consequence—I wrote out this document for the" prisoners, and the prisoners both signed it. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that in consideration of the sum</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">they deposited the lease of the premises as collateral security until the re<lb></lb>payment of the amount, and</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per cent, per annum interest.

I am the early part of 1876, Francis Charles Golding filed a partition for liquidation, and I attended a meeting of his creditors and gave value of my claim—I subsequently saw this other lease. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated August</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1858,<hi rend="italic"> from Yarrow to Jeremiah Golding, and was a fresh lease of the premises for</hi> 35 <hi rend="italic">years to be compiled from Lady Day</hi>, 1857). That relates to the same property—that was the first time I knew that a new lease had been granted—I believed that I was holding the genuine lease—I took it to a solicitor and then saw that "nineteen years" had been altered to ninety.</p>

I signed it because my son represented that he was going to deposit it with Mr. Briggs as security for what he owed him. When my wife died it shook my nerves very much and I lost the use of my hand and could not carry on my business, and my son took this cottage for me, and bought an annuity on my life, and I had nothing to do with the business for years, and what he borrowed or what he did I know nothing about; but unfortunately I did not separate my name from his, it was still Golding and Son, and therefore his creditors made me liable and sold my bed from under me.

               <p>been many years. Seeing its date I believed it was of no value, yet knowing that another lease was mortgaged to a building society, I took no notice of it to my father, thinking that as he was ill if anything happened to him I should be in the right if it proved an original, and being pressed by Mr. Briggs for money, I did hand him the lease. I was not acquainted with its worthlessness, until this charge, when it appeared that it ought to have been for nineteen rears, instead of ninety.</p>

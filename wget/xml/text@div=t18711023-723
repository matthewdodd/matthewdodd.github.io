                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, in Stonecutter Street—in June last a gas company had the pavement there open for repairs—on the 18th June, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take up two stones from opposite the front of my door: they were ordinary paving stones, such as pathways are paved with, only small—I asked him what he was going to do with them—he said he was going to repair the bottoms of the dust-holes because the wood-work rotted away so quickly—he took them away in the direction of the Savings' Bank in Farringdon Street, where he lived—ho is the beadle of the parish—I took no further notice of the matter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230019"></xptr>
               <p>—I had previously seen him take small pieces of stone occasionally, that I did not think of any value, all of the same description, small square pieces—I have seen the property that has been found, and it corresponds as nearly as possible with the things I hare seen him take; but there were none that I considered of any value—I can't say how often I have seen him do this—some little difference arose in the ensuing week; I don't know whether it was in consequence of my speaking to him about the stones, but I had placed some timbers in the church-yard temporarily, and he threw them over the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he said he was taking the stones for the dust hole I did not say "All right, I am sure they are no use"—I said "If you want a lot of stones like that, I will give you as many as you want"—I did not think they were of much value—the only difference we have had is what I have mentioned—(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner:</hi> "How about the wall you built? how about the burial ground? how about the window you lowered?")—I can hardly tell what he refers to—I made some alterations at the back of my premises—he had no power to object to that—he informed the parish of it—I did not build any wall; I altered a window, under my landlord's instructions, by lowering it 2ft.—the prisoner had no right to object to that; he did not object to it to me—I altered it voluntarily—I did not enclose a piece of ground which I had no right to enclose—the prisoner did not say so—I have known the prisoner nine or ten years—I don't know that he was allowed to take pieces of stone to put round the mounds in the burial-ground, to keep it in order.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I am a watchman, in the employ of Hill &amp; Co., contractors for the new street leading from Shoe Lane to Farringdon Street—about 9 o'clock on the night of 18th September, I was at the top of Stonecutter Street, and saw the prisoner going away with a stone, from Stonecutter Street into Farringdon Street—my attention was called by the market beadle—he had a piece of cloth round the stone—he took it to the West London Savings' Bank, in Farringdon Street—he went to the back part of the house—I stood at the door while he was gone with it—I did not speak to him about it—I went to the policeman, and gave him in charge at the time—I afterwards went with the policeman to the Savings' Bank, and saw the stone found in the cellar—the prisoner at first said it was not him that took it, and then he said he had only borrowed one—our firm has been using bricks in the construction of the street.</p>

I am one of the night constables of Farringdon Market—on the night of 18th September I saw the prisoner walk up Stonecutter Street, go back again, and take a stone up, on the footpath—he picked it up, like, to feel the weight of it, put it down again, looked up Stonecutter Street, took an apron, or piece of cloth, from under his arm, placed it round the stone, picked it up, and walked away—having seen him do it previously I called Weston's attention to it—I had seen him do it on the Wednesday and Thursday previous, the 13th and 14th—he took a stone on each occasion, and took it in the direction of the Savings' Bank—they were paving stones.</p>

On the night of 18th Septem<lb></lb>ber I went to the Savings' Bank in Farringdon Street, and the prisoner was given into my custody by Weston, for stealing this paving stone—I asked him if he had taken the stone from Stonecutter Street—he said no, he had not—I said "This man (<hi rend="italic">referring to Weston</hi>) says you have, and that he followed you here"—he said "He is mistaken"—Weston said he was positive, and the prisoner afterwards said "Well, I did borrow one"—he said that he had been making some rhubarb wine, and he borrowed it to place on the top, to press the wine—I asked him where the stone was, and he took me to the back of the premises, and produced it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said "You need not make any bother about it; I will take it back again"—I asked if he had got any other stones—he said "No"—on looking into a store-room, at the end of the passage, I saw this other stone; and I said to the prisoner, "Here is another stone; how do you account for that?"—he replied that he knew nothing about it; it had been there some time—I then said "It is a pity, Mr. Rose, that you should criminate yourself for the sake of a stone; for had you gone to the foreman of the works, and said you wanted a stone for the purpose, no doubt you would have been allowed to take one or two"—he said that he did not wish to be under any obligation to anyone—I then said "You had better go with me to Fleet Street, and there you will be better able to explain the cir<lb></lb>cumstance"—I afterwards searched the cellar at the Savings' Bank, in company with another officer, and there found a quantity of bricks—I dare-say there might have been a cart-load altogether—about thirty odd—they are a particular sort of brick—some are stamped—they are new—we also found about nine paving stones in the cellar, of the same description as these two—I afterwards went to 13, Whitefriars Street, and in the cellar there, found ten or eleven pitchers, or pitching stones, called granite tube; and in the cellar at 15, Whitefriars Street, I found a quantity of paving stones, bricks, and granite pitchers—the paving stones were similar to these—some of the bricks were stamped, and there was about two or three dozen pitchers—I heard the prisoner say at the Police Court that he had occasionally picked up bricks, as they fell from the carts going along the street, and that he never left a brick unturned if be saw one fall from a cart <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">The alleged libels were</hi>:—"Jules Riviere condemned between the years 55 and 57 to 10 years <hi rend="italic">travaux forces</hi> for either forgery or fraudulent bank<lb></lb>ruptcy; he was a fumiste, 18, Place de la Roquette, and cheated his partner. His first wife, a Frenchwoman, they say is still alive; was in England three years ago (his English wife does not know this); he gave 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go away quietly. Is that woman alive now?"—" I forgot to tell you I am off to Brighton to-day. R. knew it, so did (as he hoped) a cunning and underhand trick in giving out circulars last night, which he thought I could know nothing about till Monday. He tells the most unscrupulous lies on the subject. I hope you have arranged for Tuesday at Store Street I am so afraid he dare not face me.—G. W." "What a scoundrel that Riviere is, but I have got all the proofs against him. He will never stay in England afterwards. He has committed bigamy, married this one as a bachelor. All of you must help me with the enemy. I know you will, and am very truly yours, Georgina Weldon."—" Riviere must be done for in time, but it will take heaps of money. Riviere has been con<lb></lb>demned to 10 years' hard labour, has falsified his marriage certificate, and has committed bigamy."—" I am very hard up now owing to Riviere's swindling, and though I expect, if he does not run away, to get a good sum out of him, besides heavy damages, I have to wait for it."—" I am sorry for Riviere if you are going to testify to your esteem for him. I fear it can be proved not worth much. He has held out bribes to others, perhaps he has done the same to you; but whatever any one may say for him, or whatever esteem his boon companions may hold him in, nothing can take away the fact that he is an escaped felon condemned to 10 years' hard labour; that he has passed himself off as a bachelor in his second marriage certificate, and done other pretty little things which will all come out in time. Here is another letter written by me which you can show to him."</p>

I am a professor of music, of 12, St. John's Villas, Romanny Road, Lower Norwood—I am a friend of Mr. Riviere, and know the defendant—about 11 November I received these two letters by post—they are in Mrs. Weldon's writing—I know her writing—the prosecutor received information, and came and claimed the letters, and I showed him the one of the 11th.</p>

I had the letters a fortnight before Mr. Riviere came—I met Mrs. Riviere, who told me Mrs. Weldon was saying nasty things about her husband—I do not know whether I said that I had received letters, but I did not mention the contents of them—there is a little plan at the top of them, and it points to Tavistock House, where she lives and conducts an orphanage—I have known her eight or nine years, not only as an individual, but as an accomplished musician—I was in the Crystal Palace band conducted by Mr. Riviere—I remember Mr. Riviere making a regula<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>that there should be no encores—Mrs. Weldon sung the solo parts in selections from "Nourmahal"—I am not aware that she was encored, or that Mr. Riviere was very angry—one movement got wrong in "Nourma<lb></lb>hal," and Mrs. Weldon came forward and took her seat at the piano and marked the movement—that was at the public rehearsal—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber whether she did the same at another performance—I do not remember asking her why she did not sing a solo at the second concert, or her saying that she was cut out of her solo, and that she believed it was because Riviere was angry at the applause she got at the first—I cannot recollect whether she sang a solo at the second performance—I am a German—I never heard a rumour of Mr. Riviere being an absconding bankrupt, but he told me that he had made a failure in France—that was at the beginning of the proceedings, after the letter—I knew that an action was pending between her and Mr. Riviere with regard to an alleged breach of contract at Covent Garden—he conducted "Nourmahal" at the Aquarium, where she has been since singing—I do not know Busby personally—he may be one of the members, his name was mentioned the first time in one of the letters—the correspondence was about the Aquarium, but it was at St. James's Hall that she wanted the band—I have been to Tavistock House—I think a conversation happened to the effect that she did not want money herself, but that she wanted to get money enough to keep 50 children instead of 11—I do not remember her saying that in consequence of Riviere not keeping his contract, she did not know how to find money enough to keep her orphans.</p>

P. R. was, in 1857, while a bankrupt trader, guilty of embezzling part of his assets;" that is correct—I am aware that I was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy, and the sentence was for that offence, and I made no appeal—I told Mrs. Weldon that I had been a bankrupt, but I do not think I said a fraudulent bankrupt—I was <hi rend="italic">greffier de Justice de Paix</hi> before I married Marie Caroline Zinck—that is clerk—I was born on 6th November, 1819, at Aix, and I was first married I believe on 9th March, 1847—my father's name was Prudence Henrie Sulpice Riviere—two years after I was married I pur<lb></lb>chased the business of my father-in-law, 26, Rue de la Roquette, for 52,000 francs; but before that, he, being very illiterate, sent for me to be his book<lb></lb>keeper—I was only to pay him an annuity—I never paid him any cash, but I paid him 3,000 francs a year regularly till I left Paris in 1857—I may have been in arrear—I paid him as regularly as I could, but sometimes I was late—I do not remember whether I called my creditors together two years before I was declared bankrupt, but I may have done so, and may have asked for a delay of four years to enable me to pay them—my partner, M. Brocard, and I have had a long lawsuit together, but I cannot say whether I brought an action against him or he against me—he did not charge me with having embezzled partnership goods—he wanted a dissolution of partnership, and for a year we were before arbitrators—I do not remember that I had to make important restitutions to him—I had left Paris before the award—I did not wait for the result—I was the head of the firm, and I collected the money due to me—I don't think it was 12,000 francs—I <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> to Brussels, and never went back to Paris—the money was mine—Brocard is not one of my creditors—I do not owe him anything—he brought all the money in, but I brought the firm, which was worth twice the amount of his money—when I got him to bring in 50,000 francs I was in great difficulties—I had not received a penny from the firm—I went away a year after Brocard</p>

Dellart and began to make inquiries after my daughter; I sent for her—it must now be 21 years since I heard of her—she was not living with her mother then; she was about 10 years old at that time and was in a first-class school in Paris—I was paying for her, but her mother took her out of the school and gave her in charge of a Russian family, who adopted her without my consent—she wrote to me from Russia 21 years ago and told me so—I have inquired for the last 22 years for a certificate of my wife's death—I did not see Roget in 1878; I do not know whether I wrote to him—I did not write to him and say that a question had turned up about my wife, and that I wished to know whether he could ascertain whether she was living or not; I have all his letters here—I did write to him in 1878 to obtain the date of her death and the certificate—I have not heard where she was supposed to have died—I should be very much surprised if she were to walk into Court—I believe she died in 1662, and I have been told at Lyons—I have caused a search to be made there, but could not find that she died there—I have been inquiring for 20 years—I have a letter from her here in which she says "I am going to Lyons; this afternoon I start"—I have not made inquiries myself at Lyons, I have only commissioned people to do it; I was in England—I have been always inquiring from people who were intimately acquainted with her—I never went to France to make inquiries about her—Roget sent every one of my letters back to me; I told him to do so simply because they are the story of my life—I knew the story, but I wanted them for evidence if necessary—I owe Roget some money, and I mean to pay him, but I cannot pay all at once—I did not make inquiries of my father-in-law, M.

I live with my father at 22, Gordon Square—I am secretary to Mrs. Weldon—I have had several conversations with Mr. Riviere—I received a telegram from him on 30th September requesting me to meet him at Covent Garden—I met him at the stage door, and he took me into his private room, and told me in the presence of Mr. Hawes and Mr. Murray that he had been a bankrupt, and that fee had lived with a woman named Delbart, who had passed as his wife—I remember his distributing a circular in September at the gate of Mrs. Welelon's house after one of the rehearsals—Mrs. Weldon made no apology at Store Street; she said at her own house that she bore Mr. Riviere no ill<lb></lb>feeling, and she hoped matters would be settled amicably, and that the choir would sing at Covent Garden—that was not in the presence of the choir—that is the only apology I know of—an agreement was entered into between Mrs. Weldon and Mr. Riviere on 3rd October—I know that Mrs. Weldon paid several bills—I have examined this book—there are receipts in it for salaries—I should say that Mrs. Weldon spent fully 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before any agree<lb></lb>ment was signed, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since—I remember her reading a circular to the choir at Store Street Hall, and when she got less than half way through, Mr. Riviere said that he had not come there to be cross-examined, and put on his hat and ran away—she had put no question to him, she merely looked at him when she had read the first paragraph, waiting for a reply, and then went on to read the next—he did not reply at all—there were no other matters of complaint to my knowledge.</p>

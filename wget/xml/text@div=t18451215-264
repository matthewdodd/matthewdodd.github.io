I live in Queen's-buildings, Knightsbridge, and am a grocer; both the prisoners were in my service, the woman as domestic ser<lb></lb>vant, and the boy to attend the horse and the shop. About two o'clock on Sunday morning, the 7th of Dec, after all were gone to bed, I put some marked money into my till, and some 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces that were not marked—I left Maloy alone in my house when I went to chapel on Sunday—I suppose Knight was in my stable—I was called out of chapel by the policeman—I had in my pocket the key of a door in a partition—on my return I missed some silver and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I spoke to Maloy—I said I was very glad I had found her at last, I had missed property several Sundays—she said, "What?"—I said, "Money"—she said, "I have no money;" and by the manner in which she said it, it gave me the impression that Knight had it—I bad not suspected him till that moment—I told the constable to go after Knight, and then Maloy told me she would show me where Knight made an entrance—there was a board which takes down, which forms part of the shutter—some money was found on Knight, but not on Maloy—she said she had some tea and sugar, and she would show us where it was—she went down into the kitchen, opened a drawer, and took out some tea and sugar, and some isinglass, which she threw into the fire—there were some books in her box, "Pope's Odes," an Annual, and "Chambers's Journal"—they are not in thii indictment—she said she took them to read, and to return—with the exception of the small quantity of tea, sugar, and isinglass, there was nothing found in</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Saturday, the 27th of December, in consequence of information, I went to No. 10, <placeName id="t18290115-154-crimeloc815">Little Earl-street, Seven-dials</placeName>

(or words to that effect) I am trepanned:" Reynolds picked up what he dropped - it was a half-crown, and he had in his other hand a bit of rag stained with some kind of colouring; I secured him, and examined his hands and fingers - his left-hand thumb and fingers in particular had a kind of yellow cast on: I asked him how old he was - he said fifty-one or fifty-two- I said "I think you are old enough to know you are doing wrong;" I turned and said, "What are you doing here," (pointing to the table) - he said it was poverty that brought him to it; I took him to the Police-office - I searched his other pocket at the office before I left him, and found a bad shilling in his coat-pocket, and a farthing to which some colour had been applied: I have them both here; I left Reynolds in possession of the room, and on my returning there, I found this pipkin and some sand paper - there was some colouring in the pipkin; I also found a file, and two cups with some wash in them, (which I have since emptied into bottles,) and a paper of cream of tarter - the paper was open on the table; the colouring in the pipkin was in a dry powdered state - some of the sand-paper was quite clean, and some rubbed, with a brassy appearance on it; I took a piece of old iron hoop from the fire-place, and one end of it was red hot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He said he had been trepanned - did he give you the name of the person? A. He did not, certainly - I know to whom he referred; I never knew any harm of that man: he is not in the service of the Mint; he is in the coach way: he was employed by Mr. Powell on this occasion; I had seen him three or four days before, and saw him that day before we went to the prisoner's room: I do not know that he had the key of the prisoner's room in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual, to your knowledge, for some persons connected with the Mint to keep men in their pay to make inquiries, and give information on these subjects? A. No, I do not; I never participated in any thing of the kind: I gave the man 1s.; the prisoner was asked by whom he was trepanned, and said he did not know where the man lived, or his name: I knew his name; I am principally employed in prosecuting persons of this description; I knew the prisoner lived there before - for what I know, this may be the first occurrence of the sort that ever happened to him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You gave the man 1s.? A. Yes, to get a drop of beer; he came down to give this information, on which I acted, and which information I found correct.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Limbrick to this honse, and found the room door fastened; Limbrick told me to break it open: I did so, and directly observed the prisoner sitting by the side of the fire - he dropped the half-crown From his hand into the fire-place, and had a rag in his other hand:. I picked the half-crown up, and have it here - these other things laid on the table; I produce all the money: I found four half-crowns and five shillings on the table, all bad - some of them are finished, and some not.</p>

            . I am a bedstead-maker, and live in Little Earl-street. My father is landlord of this house: the prisoner lodged in the top back room; he occupied it alone - he came there about the latter end of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know any thing of him? A. Not till he came there; he behaved well, and is a bellhanger: he went out regularly to work, and paid his rent regularly till five or six weeks before this happened - he then stated he had not finished his work, and could not pay us.</p>

            . I am an inspector of base coin. This half-crown appears to be in a state of process for re-colouring; I have looked at the different materials produced; the pipkin contains some part of nitrate of silver, which I have tried, and it colours copper money: all these things are such as are generally used for this process; two or three of the shillings are cast, and do not require it; the others are copper and brass.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am assistant-solicitor to the Mint. The person who gave this information, came to me; all informations are given to me in the office, and, when necessary, the officers are employed - we do not suffer officers to receive informations, or to act without our first making inquiry; the man came to me of his own accord - we do not employ them to go about inquiring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You, of course, are fully aware of the person to whom the officer alludes? A. Yes - I never saw him before he gave me information of this particular man; he first came to me, as far back as the beginning of November - I saw him, perhaps, half a dozen times before the prisoner was apprehended; he did not give me information about the prisoner at each of those times; I believe his name was introduced every time, though other subjects might be introduced - his first information did not refer to the prisoner alone; the prisoner was apprehended in consequence of what passed between this man and the officer at that particular time; I was not on the spot at the time of the apprehension, but was there immediately after - we are generally near the spot, in order to go and see what is found; I had seen the informant that morning, about two hours before- he received nothing from me before the apprehension; I have since given him 5l.; and, in explanation, I must say that he had never applied to me for a single sixpence, and had been losing a great deal of time for upwards of a month; he was out of work, and I thought it not too much, he having lost upwards of five weeks - I shall charge the 5l. in my account; I have general authority to pay monies.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you general authority to employ persons giving informations respecting base coin? A. Yes - we take every means in our power to ascertain whether the reports are true, and from the general knowledge we have, we can almost always tell whether the person is deceiving us or not; we do not rely on the single person giving information.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any thing in the information of that individual which would lead you to know or believe whether the prisoner might or not be entrapped? A. There certainly was - I knew his comnexions; we take all the means we conceive legitimate, to inquire into the truth of the information, and in this case I took all the pains I could to satisfy myself that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150067"></xptr>was directing his information correctly; I had other information.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has Mr. Powell any apprehension that the 5l. will be disallowed in his account? A.None whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I will state the truth, as far as I can. On the day before Christmas, this individual called me out of the shop where I have worked six or seven years, to go and drink with him, saying it was Christmas time; I went with him to several places, and drank both liquor and porter, till I got intoxicated, and towards evening we parted; in the morning he came to my lodgings, before breakfast, and brought these very identical things- I had not even a bad shilling, sixpence, half-crown, or anything; I had not 1d. - even the halfpence the officer took from my pocket belonged to him; he brought in these things, and put down 9d., saying it would purchase some stuff, and wanted me to go out for it - he went out, after preparing these things himself, for colouring - he scowered them, and then said he was going to meet a person to get some money; he went out and returned in about twenty minutes, with some money, then tried the stuff, and said it was not sufficiently strong, it required cream of tartar, which he went and bought himself, went through the process with it, and asked me to assist him; in about twenty minutes more, he said the stuff was not good enough, he would go and get some more silver - he took the latch-key of my door, saying he would get it, and return in about ten minutes, in the course of which time the officers came - when he brought in the cream of tartar, he wanted to take the key from outside the door and put it inside, which I never did, for I always kept it outside, and I made him return it to the outside. As I now stand here, I plead your clemency before God; I am fifty-six years of age, and from my childhood have obtained an honest livelihood by hard work, and my character was never impeached - I hope you will take all this into your serious consideration, and spare my life.</p>

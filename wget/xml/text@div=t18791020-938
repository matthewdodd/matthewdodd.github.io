                  </hi>. I live at 23, Drummond Street, Euston Square—on Tuesday, 23rd September, I was in the Skinners' Arms, Judd Street, with Jane Carter between 9 and 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoners there—I knew them by sight—Harvey walked over and deliberately struck Carter on her nose, making it bleed—the barman came over the bar and turned the prisoners out—I followed, and in the street the prisoners assaulted me and knocked me down, and Underwood put her hand in my right-hand pocket—I got hold of her hand—I had two florins and a sixpence there—I had pulled my money out in the public-house to pay for drink, and the prisoners had an opportunity of seeing it—her hand was closed when I seized it, as it was being withdrawn from my pocket—I then missed my money and they ran away—about 11.15 p.m. on 28th September, while passing St. Pancras Church, Euston Road, the prisoners came behind me and struck me on the back of my head and said "I'll allow you to put detectives on me," and they took off my bonnet and carried it away—on the next Monday they came dancing before me and I went over to a policeman and gave them in custody—they ran away, but the detective secured them—I was injured on the back of my head on the 23rd, and had it bandaged up at the hospital, and I had two black eyes—I was perfectly sober.</p>

I am barman at the Skinners' Arms, Judd Street—on Tuesday, 23rd September, between 9 and 10 p.m., Davis was standing at the bar drinking with another female, when the prisoners walked into the house and Harvey walked deliberately up to her and struck her friend with her fist—I jumped over the bar and turned the prisoners out—Harvey tried to force her way in afterwards, using disgusting language—I got her away and Davis and her friend walked out.</p>

                  </hi>. The commencement of the row was about a young man. Louisa Birdges—she is not named Davis—was drinking with him, and I went in and asked her what she meant, and she used bad language and I struck her. We had another fight in the Euston Road. I know nothing of the robbery. Every time she sees me go away with a man she comes and asks me for 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for rum. The girls are all frightened at her. She has had nine months, and is living with a returned convict.</p>

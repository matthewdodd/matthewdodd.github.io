I walked about six yards, and felt a pull at my pocket; my handkerchief was gone. I turned round, seized the prisoner, and charged him with stealing it - I moved him a little way, and presently saw it laying close at his side; I let go of him to pick it up, and he ran off - I called watch, and at the corner of Field-lane he was secured, and said he would never do so again if I would let him go. I am certain of him.</p>

I had just left my mother, and was going home - the gentlemen turned round, laid hold of me, and gave me a shove, and I ran away - he picked up something, and called Stop thief! I immediately stopped, and he accused me of taking the handkerchief. I said I had not.</p>

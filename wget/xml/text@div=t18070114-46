            . I am an officer. On the 19th of December this woman called upon me and said that she had been robbed, and that she had found the property at the pawnbrokers. I went with her to the pawnbroker's and desired him to shew us the property, which he did; I desired that if any person came for the property to stop them and send for us, and the next morning as I was going down the street I met Mr. Garrard and an officer with the prisoner. I desired them to bring her back to me to go and search the girl's lodgings, I went and searched them, she was a long while before she would shew me where she lived. In her lodging I found this handkerchief and shift, which the prosecutor swore to be her property. I asked her how she came by them, she said they were her own. When I brought her to the office I asked her how she got in this place where that property was; she said that she broke the door with a chisel, near upon three o'clock, and went immediately to the pawnbroker's. I searched her; in her pockets there were one half guinea, two seven shilling pieces, and a five shilling piece, which she said was her money she pledged the things for, and a great number of duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shifts are mine; one is a calico one, and it is torn, and the other is joined across the loins; that is my sheet, it is a calico sheet; the petticoats are mine, and the spoons are mine, five of them are brighter than the other, and one is bent by wearing of it more than the others; the gown, handkerchief, and the shawl are mine; they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to this woman's house, I took a chisel and opened the door, I went and took these things out of the drawer.</p>

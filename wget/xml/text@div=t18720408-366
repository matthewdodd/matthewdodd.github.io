                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live at Thorpe Villa, Cobham Road, Stratford—I work in the locomotive shop of the Great Eastern Railway there, by the side of the prisoner, who is also a turner—it is a large covered shop—on 21st March, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Martin and Hollingshead were playing at snowballs—they both threw at the prisoner while he was working in the shop, and he was struck by the snowballs—he was using a chisel, chipping numbers off a brass piston—he told the lads if they did not leave off he would tell the foreman, but they did not leave off—Martin threw the last snowball, and it hit him—they were nine or ten feet from him, throwing the snowballs—after throwing the last snowball, Martin ran along the shop, and Goose threw the chisel in the direction in which Martin ran, but down towards the ground; Martin was then nine or ten feet from Goose, and he bobbed his head while he ran, and the chisel struck him behind the ear, and remained sticking in his head—John Simpson took it out—there was a great deal of blood when it was pulled out—Martin said that he was stunned, and said "Take me home"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the chisel—Goose seemed angry at the time he threw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> We are both apprentices at the Great Eastern Railway, at Stratford—the prisoner has been in that employment a year and a half or two years—his father was there before him, and was killed last year—the prisoner has borne an excellent character as a peaceable, quiet person—during the whole of this day he was being constantly pelted with snow<lb></lb>balls, and made no resistance whatever—the snowballs were brought into the shed by two other persons—during that time the prisoner was con<lb></lb>stantly at his work—two snowballs were thrown at him at once, and one hit him on the face an the other on the neck—the chisel was at that time in his right hand—he raised it with his right hand in this way; back<lb></lb>handed—I am prepared to say that the chisel did not hit the ground before it struck the deceased—if he had not stooped down, it would not have hit</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> The deceased and the prisoner were perfectly good friends—I never knew them quarrel before—the prisoner came over to the deceased, but he could not speak for a moment; he was overcome—he then assisted to pick Martin up—I did not hear the deceased say that it was done by an accident—the prisoner has borne a character for quietness in the shop—he is a mild inoffensive boy—he was using the chisel all the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—John Martin was admitted on 21st March, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon—I examined him, and found a patch on his skull somewhat behind and above the left ear, and the brain oozing through—he died about 7 o'clock on Saturday morning the 23rd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> It was a depressed fracture, done with a sharp Instru<lb></lb>ment—there was not much splintering of the skull, as would have been the case if it had been done with a large surface—this chisel is heavy enough to fracture the skull if thrown with sufficient force—it might have been done with either end—the deceased made no Statement to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If it had been done with the blunt end, it would not have been found sticking in his head—the person who withdraw it would know best.</p>

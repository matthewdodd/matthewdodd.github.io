                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, and lodge at No. 3, King-street, Brick-lane. On the 23rd of December, I asked the prisoner to help me to carry some soot—I received a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and two shil<lb></lb>lings for it, and gave him one shilling—I went and drank a little beer with him, and asked him home to tea—we had three pints of beer there—I left the sovereign in my wife's care—about seven o'clock I was going to fetch some errands in with the half-sovereign—I saw her tie the sovereign up in the corner of a handkerchief which was round her neck—we had a quartern of gin—the prisoner left about a quarter before eight o'clock—he said he was coming back in about an hour and a half, and said, "You have got your money safe in the corner of your handkerchief?"—he did not return—I asked my wife where the money was afterwards—I untied her handkerchief, because she could not, and then there was a sixpence, instead of a sovereign—she had had no silver at all—I went to look for him for about three hours that night, and then went to bed—I got an officer next morning, and found him—I have not found the sovereign.</p>

Was any body else in the house besides me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at the time I missed the sovereign, nor that afternoon—he was the only person in the place—my next door neighbour came in while I was at tea—she sat behind me, not by my wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with the prosecutor, but we are not married. I tied the sovereign up in the corner of the handkerchief I had on my neck—the prisoner said, "Let me tie it up, I can do it better than you"—my husband was not present then—he tied it up—I am quite sure I put a so<lb></lb>vereign into the handkerchief—I had no sixpence whatever—he never touched my handkerchief afterwards—he went away about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards, and after he was gone I found only a sixpence there—as the prisoner went away, he said, "The money is all safe in your handkerchief," and said he should return in about an hour and a half—my next door neighbour was there that evening—she never touched me—she could not have untied my handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor told me he had been robbed of a sovereign the night before—I apprehended the prisoner, and told him Legg charged him with stealing a sovereign in his absence—he said he did not care, for they could not prove it against him—I am sure those were his words.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was perfectly in<lb></lb>nocent of the offence; and produced a written acknowledgment, signed by the prosecutrix, of having received 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and agreeing to take the remaining sum at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, of the prisoner's father.)</p>

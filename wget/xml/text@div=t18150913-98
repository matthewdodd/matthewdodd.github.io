He was at the corn bin, and his not coming from the bin when I called him it caused a suspicion, I told him to go and sweep the kennel; I observed him first hang up his nose bags. When he was gone, I put my hand into one which appeared the most heavy, and drew out some coffee; on further examination, I found there were seven pounds six ounces; it was tied up in a handkerchief, and in the nose bag. I took it up into my own room, and then went to enquire if he had delivered the coffee safe. We weighed the coffee he had delivered at the coffee establishment, and found one cask deficient eight pounds nearly. He had lived with me three weeks.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Colonial establishment. I assisted M.. Scudder, in weighing five casks of coffee, delivered at our house, by one of his carman; and in one, there were eight pounds deficient. Mr. Scudder afterwards brought me a sample of what I understood he had found in a nose bag, and it was the same coffee that was contained in the casks.</p>

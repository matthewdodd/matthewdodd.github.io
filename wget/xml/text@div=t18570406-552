On 23rd Dec, I was on duty with Philip Brown, in Gravel Lane, Southwark—I saw the prisoner about half past 5 o'clock in the morning, and again about 6, and again at a quarter before 7, when he made his escape from us—he was in company with Hoskins, twelve or fourteen yards from No. 21, Gravel Lane—we followed them to No. 3, Dyer's Buildings—Hoskins was carrying some lead under his arm—they ran into No. 3, Dyer's Buildings—Hoskins dropped the lead outside the house—we went to the house, and the door was fastened; we forced it open, and the prisoner and Hoskins ran up stairs—I ran and caught hold of both of them by the legs—I let go the prisoner, and he ran up stairs—I held Hoskins, and he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, jump the window, "</p>

               <p>and the prisoner jumped out of the window directly—he got away, and I never saw him till he was at Guildhall—Hoskins pleaded guilty at the Southwark police court—I took the lead which was dropped outside to Mr. Lawrence—I saw it fitted to the place it had been cut off from at No. 21, Gravel Lane—it fitted the place exactly—the lead it corresponded with was on the roof of No. 21—the piece we compared fills up the space exactly.</p>

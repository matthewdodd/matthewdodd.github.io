            . I am in the coal trade. My sister lived in Rose-court, I believe, but I did not go to see her till she was in the hospital; I visited her four days there, and saw her the day she died - she was perfectly insensible - the last time I saw her when sensible was on Sunday, the 23d; she had been there about a week; I know she expected she should die - she said so, and begged of me to come and see her, as she was sure she should never come out alive; I asked how it had happened - she said she had lost her shawl, and she was going after it - that a woman named Seddon had got it, and the woman struck her - that she went up the ladder after the woman, and the woman struck her when she was on the ladder, she then fell, and could say nothing more; I asked her if she was drunk before - her answer was, "No, I was perfectly sober."</p>

The deceased was brought there insensible, and had received a hurt - she had some blows on her head; I could not tell whether she was in liquor - she was insensible: she died in about eight days - I opened her head; her skull was fractured, which most likely happened from a fall.</p>

On the 15th of January in the evening, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) At a quarter before six o'clock my wife and I were at tea in a parlour behind the shop. I looked towards the shop-door, and saw the prisoner. There is a passage all round the shop, I catched hold of him. He had some handkerchiefs in his arms. When I took hold of him; he let them drop at his feet; they were in fifteen different parcels. I asked him what he was going to do with them? He made no answer. I called my wife and we secured him, and got a constable and gave charge of him.</p>

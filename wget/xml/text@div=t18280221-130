On the 26th of January, about a quarter before eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop to buy some leather, as he was accustomed to do; when he had been in the shop a few minutes, I saw him adjusting his waistcoat, which gave me some suspicion - he then looked out some pieces of leather, and took them to the scale - as he moved I saw that my suspicions were right, and accused him of it - he took out these pieces of leather, and said he intended to pay for them - my master came down and he was taken into custody - he then said he did it through distress.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at our house at the latter end of July, as near as I can say—she said she was the wife of Hodges, a policeman, who came to live there with her—I thought they were man and wife—mj husband is a ship-keeper, and in the habit of going from home—I used to go to him on Sunday to spend the day, and the prisoner and Hodges were left in the house—I had noticed the prisoner many times leave the house with a basket and bundle when Hodges was at home—I have asked her at different times what she was taking away—she said she was going to the tailor's to get the police clothes altered—I asked her if she was going again—she said, "Yes," for they were very uncomfortable—the last time she left the house she borrowed a basket of me, and said she should be back on Tuesday to tea, but she did not return—I did not see her</p>

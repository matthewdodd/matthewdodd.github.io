               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not do my duty that night correctly? A. You were very correct in your calls, and I always found you on the alert in your rounds; a little before four o'clock that morning he reported that he had found a cask turned on one side, and on turning it up he found it had been broached - he appeared then intoxicated; I looked at the spot, and found two other casks turned - he said he knew nothing about them; I saw him again about five o'clock - he was then more intoxicated; I saw him again at a quarter before six, and told him to be particular to give the cask which had been broached up to the watchman who would relieve him - I then saw him and Porter doing something with the great coat, as if they were buttoning it up.</p>

On the 2nd of July I was standing at my shop-window in Allen-street, in the afternoon—the prisoner, who keeps the Rose and Crown public-house in Allen-street, was talking with the deceased—the deceased pointed to me and said, "This is the man for <hi rend="italic">cheek,</hi>" meaning impudence—after that Jones and one Roberts were standing at the door of the Rose and Crown for a long while—Roberts did not appear to be sober—Roberts came to my shop-door and attempted to pull it open to pull me out—Caulfield was not there then, but hearing the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> he came back—the prisoner was there, and had a little discourse with him—the first I saw was the prisoner, <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> Caulfield twice—then there was a sort of scuffle or fight—I do not know what to term it—I then went into my shop to work—I came out again after hearing Caulfield's leg was broken, and found him lying down on the curb-stone by my shop-door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Green-street, Globe-road, Mile-end, and am a smith. On the 2nd of July I was in James Winslow's shop—I saw caulfield in the road, and my uncle Jones at his door—words arose be<lb></lb>tween Jones and Caulfield—I could not distinctly understand what about—they appeared to be angry words—Jones pushed him several times—then blows arose—Jones struck Caulfield first with his fist, then pushed</p>

               <p>him, and Caulfield pushed him, and when he hit him, a scuffle ensued—both fell, Jones undermost—they got up again, a scuffle took place, and blows again—both fell, Jones uppermost, Caulfield falling across the gutter, and Jones falling on him, broke his leg—Jones said, "I will give it you again to-morrow"—I do not think he then knew the leg was broken—about half an hour after Caulfield was taken to the hospital, I heard Jones say he wished he had broken his neck—I cannot say whether he then knew his leg was broken—the deceased was sober—before the scuffle, Caulfield said, Jones sold bad beer—they had hold of each other when the second fall took place, and had entangled their legs round each other just before the second fall.</p>

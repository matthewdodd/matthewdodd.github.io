                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer seller, and have a stall in Barbican—I know Messrs. Smith's premises in Beech-street—there is an empty house at the corner of Red Cross-street—part of it is in Beech-street—on the morning of 4th September, between 4 and 5, I was at my stall, which is at the corner of Golden-lane, in Beech-street, about fourteen or fifteen yards from the door where he came out—I remember the police relief passing me that morning—that was about a quarter past 6—after they had passed, a pony and cart drove up to the empty houses—there was a man driving—when he had driven up to the door, the door opened, and the prisoner brought a bundle out, and put it in the cart—he is the person—he gave it a shove with his right hand, which made it go to the bottom of the cart—it appeared to be wrapped up in a white cloth—it was a longish parcel, about a yard and a half long, of pretty good bulk—the prisoner stared me in the face, and I him—directly the parcel was put in the cart the prisoner shut the door, got up in the cart, and off the cart drove—I believe it was on the 6th that I next saw the prisoner—I was called out of bed at 2 o'clock</p>

               <p>in the morning—I think it was the next morning, or the morning after I had seen the man come out of the house; I won't swear—three or four policeman came for me—I went with them to Bethnal Green-road, to see if I could identify the man—I waited some time in the outer room, and then went in—they said, "Is he there?"—there were three men there, and he was the middle one—I said, "That is the man"—I believe that was on the 6th; I won't say for certain—I was sent for to Moor-lane before that, but I did not know anybody there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City of London—on the morning of 26th September I went to the Bethnal-green police-station, and there found the prisoner—I took Rayner with me—after waiting some time the acting-inspector fetched two other men—Rayner and I stepped into the charge-room with the sergeant—the two men were brought and placed in an ante-room—Rayner went into that room, I remained behind—after a few minutes he came and said, "It is the middle man;" there were two more besides the prisoner; the prisoner was the middle one—I then went to him, and said, "This man has just identified you; I shall consider it my duty to take you to the City, and charge you on suspicion of being concerned in a large robbery of whips"—he made no reply—I had a cab, and brought him to the City—Elias Kaufman was in the cab with me—on the road to the City, in the cab, the prisoner said, "This is through keeping bad com<lb></lb>pany; through drinking with that fellow's brother," pointing to the witness Kaufman, "and using the same concert-room with him, which has brought me to this"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a sample of the whips that were produced here last session—they were all identified by Mr. Smith—I examined Mr. Smith's premises and the empty house—the supposition is that the thieves were concealed on Mr. Smith's premises in the evening—the gate of Mr. Smith's is fastened with a padlock, but at the interior of the premises there are some tiles which lead from that gate over on to the water-closet, and they could have made their way into the house that way—there is but one door to the house, and that is the door that Rayner pointed out as the one the man came out of, which leads into a large shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you took Rayner to the police-station it was 2 o'clock in the morning, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about 2 o'clock when I was called up by the officer Collins, and it was about half-past 2 when we went to Rayner's—Rayner was taken in by the inspector to look at the man; I was in the adjoining room, and then he came out to me—he did not say, "I believe the middle man is the man;" he said, "The middle one is the man;" I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason Rayner was called up in the middle of the night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—the inspector ought to have sent the man to the City—I think the object was that the man should not be locked up all night unless he was identified.</p>

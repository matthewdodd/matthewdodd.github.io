                  </hi>. I have two brothers in partnership with me—we are pawnbrokers and salesmen—one of our establishments is in Drury-lane—the prisoner was foreman and salesman in our employ. On the 22nd of January I went with an officer to the prisoner's house in Green-place—I found him there and these spoons, they are mine—there is my mark on them—I had three pairs, and missed one pair—I am sure they were not sold, as they would have been entered in the sale-book—he had no authority to take them to his lodgings.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner about half-past eleven o'clock at night on the 28th of November, at the corner of Wilderness-row, with two parcels; I asked what this large one contained - he said two skins, which he was going to send to his brother, in Norfolk; I asked if he had any letter to shew where he got them - he said he received them from Mr. Barnes, a tailor, in Heath-street, Stepney. We then took him to a public-house in Goswell-road, and asked if he had a letter from his brother - he said he had one, but destroyed it - that he lived at Mr. Astow's, a wine-merchant, opposite - my brother officer went over there, and that gentleman pledged himself to be answerable for his appearance next morning; I went there the next day, and saw the prisoner again - he said, "I told you an untruth last night - I found it at the back of my master's house last night" - this is the paper, in which there was but one skin; the paper was quite clean, though the night had been very wet and muddy. I afterwards showed this skin to Mr. Waite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He told you where he lived, and you found him there the next morning? A. Yes. The place where he said he found the skin is a very dirty place at all times.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WAITE. I have no doubt at all of this skin being mine - I have made no mark upon it, but there is a particular chalk mark upon it; I bought it of Mr. Wyard, in Coleman-street - I had not missed it. The prisoner's brother was my porter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many such skins have you bought? A. Some hundreds, and other people have had the same. I do not know that I had noticed the chalk mark on it before. I had sold part of them, and cannot swear I had not sold this.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Brown - I took one parcel, and Brown the other. The prisoner said, positively, before I opened the parcel, that it contained two skins, which he had got from a tailor, in Heath-street, Commercial-road - I opened the parcel, and found but one.</p>

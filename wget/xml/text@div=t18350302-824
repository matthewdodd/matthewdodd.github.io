                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Shadwell-fields. Last Tuesday week I was at the Swan at Shadwell, and got tipsy. I had a sil<lb></lb>ver watch, and a guard round my neck—I had it safe when I left the Swan—I found myself at home the next morning, in my mother's house—my watch was then gone, and the key and guard, and two handkerchiefs, one off my neck and one out of my pocket—I know the prisoner by sight, but I do not recollect seeing him that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in London-street, Ratcliffe. I saw the prosecutor quite drunk, lying across our kitchen area—I saw the prisoner and another boy there—I thought the prosecutor was dying, and I told the prisoner to loosen his handkerchief off his neck—he said they would not leave him, they knew him—I went in, and when I went out again, the boys were gone, and the handkerchief also—I did not see the watch.</p>

About eight o'clock at night, on the 24th of September, I was at home. I went up stairs; I think it was rather past eight o'clock. There was a light in the shop; I had lit a large lamp for about three hours at that time, and I lighted it as soon as it was dark. It was quite dark at the time I am speaking of. Before I went up stairs, I had shut the shop door myself; I had shut it upon the latch; it leads into the street. Before I went up stairs, I left my watch in the little parlour; it had a gold chain; it was hanging on one side of the waistcoat. It hung in a corner where any one who came into the shop could see it. When I came down stairs, I wanted to look what it was o'clock, and I missed my watch; I am quite sure it had been hanging in the place where it had usually hung, when I went up stairs. I let nobody in the shop. There was nobody in the parlour but myself. I pereceived that my watch was gone. I looked at the door, but could see nobody. I found it standing half open. I was quite sure it was on the latch before I went up stairs. I thought the least of its being open. I remember perfectly well it was so. I did not miss my watch until after I had perceived the door was open. I am quite clear I had shut it myself. I sent to one of the Hatton Garden officers that evening. I did not see my watch until the morning following; I then saw the watch, chain, and seal, all together.</p>

            . Between three and four o'clock, on the morning of the 25th, before day-break, I went into a house in Newgate Market. I found the prisoner at the bar, and two others, in that house. They had been drinking, but were not drinking then. I knew them all three to be suspicious characters. I knew them all. I took hold of the prisoner, and asked him if he had any thing about him; he said, "no, he had nothing." I had not heard at that time of Mrs. Black having been robbed. Upon his saying he had nothing, I began to search him. I found nothing, either in his hat or pockets; but when I came to search him rather close, I found the watch, chain, and seal on him, in his breeches, close to his knee, in his pantaloons. He would neither give an account of it, nor the maker's name, nor the number of it. I asked him where he got it; he said, "he met a strange man in Long-lane, who gave it him, and he did not know the man, and should not know him again. I took him into custody, and the others also. They were discharged. I have had the watch ever since. I am perfectly clear that is the watch which was taken from the prisoner at the bar.</p>

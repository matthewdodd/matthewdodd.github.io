               <p>What was there in the room particular? - Some lace and ribbons.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed? - There was a dispute about the lace and the ribbons, between Waters, Summers, Lucas, and this gentleman.</p>
               <p>What gentleman? - The prisoner, this gentleman had very little to do with it, he said, it was agreeable to let them go at two shillings and three pence a dozen, that was about the ribbon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290034"></xptr>Were the ribbons disposed of there? - Yes, at Mr. Levy's.</p>
               <p>Who was in company? - Lucas, Waters, and Summers, and these men were in the room; they were convicted a sessions or two ago.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation where it came from or anything of the prisoner? - Yes, Waters said, it came from Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner contradict that? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did they sell Levy in the whole? - The ribbons came to six pounds nineteen shillings, and the lace to forty guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much of this bargain had you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>I believe you was to have half? - No, I had no half.</p>
               <p>You was to have had? - You are welcome to say what you please, you are welcome to scold.</p>
               <p>Was not the original bargain that you was to have half of these? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So Lewis bilked you? - I do not understand that word.</p>
               <p>They cheated you of your bargain? - I did not know any of their bargain, when I knew how they were got, I did not want half.</p>
               <p>So Waters told this young man, that the things came from Covent Garden? - They said that the business should be done quick, on account of it's being so near Bow-street.</p>

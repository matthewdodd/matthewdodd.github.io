                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Marlborough-street police-court—on 9th September, William Price James, and Alexander Davidson were brought before the Magistrate there, and charged with attempting to pick pockets—the prisoner was the sole witness against them—I took his evidence (<hi rend="italic">Read;.</hi>"Monday, 9th September, 1861, before William Frederick Beadon, Esq. William Price James, and Alexander Davidson, charged with attempting to pick pockets." William Gordon sworn, said, "On Saturday night last, about a quarter to 8 o'clock, I followed the two prisoners, in company with a thief named Ricketts, from the Hay market to Piccadilly—I saw William Price James make a snatch at a gentleman's watch—they then went to St James's church, and I saw Davidson put his hand into a gentleman's coat pocket—he turned round and felt him, and hit him with his stick, and I went and took the prisoners into custody." On cross-exami<lb></lb>nation he said, "They were going westward; James got in among the crowd—I find they are respectable persons' sons"—discharged. I think I took the evidence as nearly as possible verbatim. I don't know whether the place was named where the two boys and Ricketts went behind a gentleman; it</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Castle-street, Long-acre, and am an apprentice to Messrs. Mc'Glashen of the Coal-yard, Drury-lane, engines and copper-smiths—I have been there about four years—I have a younger brother named John, and a fellow apprentice named Alexander Davidson—on Saturday night, 7th September, somewhere about half-past 6, after we returned from work, we all three went for a walk—we went to Hyde-park, down St Martin's-lane, through the Horse Guards, through St. James's-park and into Hyde-park—we remained there a quarter of an hour or twenty minute and came back along Piccadily—when we came opposite St James's chorea, we saw the rifle volunteers—we were then on the side opposite St. James's church, the left-hand side of the street—there was no other person in my company except Davidson and John James—I saw the prisoner Gordon when he came and threw my brother down—that was the first I saw of him—he was dressed in private clothes and had a walking-stick in his hand—when my brother fell down, Gordon hit Davidson across the back with a stick—I thought he was mad or intoxicated, and I ran some yards off, and my brother ran across the road; I stopped on the side of the kerb and saw him thrash my brother, and then let him go—he then came behind me and caught hold of me by the collar, and halloed out to another policeman, 59 C, to take Alexander Davidson, and he did so—when the prisoner took me by the collar, I asked him what was the matter, and he said, "You know as well as I do," and took us off to Vine-street—I did not say anything more to him till we got there—I said there that we thought he was mad, and run away—before that I did not make a snatch at any gentleman's guard or chain, or endeavour to steal it—Davidson did not attempt to put his hand into any gentleman's pocket—I was so close to him as to be sure of that—there was no person named Rickets, or any person at all, in our company—we did not come from the Haymarket, we came the other way—Gordon did not, about three weeks before this, caution me for being in the company of a thief—I do not know such a person as Ricketts—the prisoner charged us at the station with attempting to pick pockets—I said it was false, and he said he had followed us from Leicester-square, following the rifles, and seen us make several attempts—I gave my address, and I was bailed out late at</p>

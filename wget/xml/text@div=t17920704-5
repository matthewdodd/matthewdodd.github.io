               <p>Upon that day did the prisoner at the bar come to their banking house? - On that day, as I believe, between three and four, somewhere near four, the prisoner came into the banking shop and presented the draft I have now in my hand as the draft of

             for payment; on my receiving the draft, I asked him in what manner he chose to receive it, and he answered four 20 l. notes, and the remainder in cash; the draft is for 96 l. upon his answering me, I looked again at the draft, and was persuaded in my own mind it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Hardinge; I again repeated the same question, and received the same answer; I then referred to Mr. Morgan, who concurred in my opinion; I heard the questions which Mr. Morgan put; he can better tell you; the draft has been in my possession ever since; the prisoner was secured and taken to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Hardinge's hand-writing? - I should suppose six or seven years.</p>
               <p>He has, during that time, drawn on your house? - He has very frequently.</p>
               <p>Did he keep cash at your house? - He did (looking at the draft over and over again); I firmly believe, to the best of my judgment, that it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I have great doubt that he wrote it.</p>
               <p>(The draft produced and read.)</p>
               <p>Court. As far as a man can swear to the hand-writing of another, do you believe it is not his hand-writing? - I believe it is not the hand-writing of Mr. Hardinge, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If you had conceived it to be his hand-writing should you have paid on his draft? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, prisoner's counsel. The mode of your judgment, whether Mr. Hardinge's, or not Mr. Hardinge's, is derived from the drafts that you have seen presented at your house? - Not in that situation.</p>
               <p>Your judgment at present is made in this way, that this writing is not like other writing of drafts that you have paid? - Just so.</p>
               <p>And the only way in which you make up your mind is, because you have seen drafts of Mr. Hardinge's presented for payment, and which had not been honoured, and this hand writing is not like that; read,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, pay the bearer 96 l. yours G.</p>
               <p>"Hardinge."</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Besides this being very dissimilar to the character of Mr. Hardinge's hand-writing, was it in the mode of his drawing? - No, he at present draws, and did at that time, on a check, and signs his name different to that.</p>
               <p>Had that taken place in consequence of some peculiar circumstance; I do not ask what? - It had.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mr. Hardinge's handwriting? - Yes, sir, but not very particularly, though I am in the habit of knowing his hand-writing; not in the same degree as Mr. Willoughby.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge you have of his hand-writing, do you believe that is it? - I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040009"></xptr>at the bar, or was there any between Mr. Willoughby and the prisoner in your hearing at that time? - Yes there was.</p>
               <p>State to the Court what passed. - I was accidentally sitting near Mr. Willoughby, and I do not immediately recollect seeing the prisoner come into the shop. Upon my seeing the draft, I had little or no doubt of it; therefore, I walked round the prisoner, and posted myself between him and the door. I then interrogated him where he got it. He told me he had received it from Mr. Hardinge. I do not recollect whether he said that morning or the preceding evening, but I told him he could not have received it that morning, because I was persuaded Mr. Hardinge was on the circuit to Wales. I am not sure, but I think he said he returned to town the preceding evening. I think I asked him for what purpose he might have the bill of Mr. Hardinge, and he told me that it was for some horses that Mr. Hardinge had purchased of a friend of his at Llandovery in Wales. I immediately left him in custody, and he went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Had you no other conversation with him but what you have related? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>You did not persuade him at all to tell you any thing that passed with respect to the draft? - No.</p>

             at the bottom of the draft; - I will not swear that it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Which do you believe? - I think it is not, and I will give you my reason why, because he does not always write one hand, nor confine himself to one hand-writing; but the reason I think it is not his writing is, because he was in South Wales at the time, and not only that, but because it was not on a check upon which he at that time drew.</p>
               <p>I cannot take upon myself to say it is his writing he writes so different in drawing his drafts, and in letters which I have frequently seen, in short every day and every hour; for that reason, I could not say; we were in South Wales till Saturday: I cannot tell the day of the month, but I think it was the 14th. This was upon the day of the week Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The only reason then for your thinking that this is not Mr. Hardinge's writing is, because he was in Wales at the time the note was presented? - One reason, Sir.</p>
               <p>That note you know may have been written a long time before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other reason is, because this note does not appear to be on a check? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Otherwise you say Mr. Hardinge writes so many hands that it is difficult to say which is which? - It is. I cannot say that he writes in so different a hand, that I do not know that I can take upon myself to say that is not his hand.</p>
               <p>He writes as different hands as there are letters in the alphabet almost? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did you see this confession signed by him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Permit me to ask who was in company with him at that time; were any of the gentlemen from Mr. Hoare's shop there? - No.</p>
               <p>I should think not. Had you yourself had any conversation with him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a good deal of conversation before he went in to the Justice? - No, not before he went in to the Justice, but when he had been in to the Justice, not before he went in: for this was drawn up before I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040010"></xptr>saw him at all, and before Mr. Kitchener, and a young man of the name of Rant that is under-clerk in the office. Lightowler was taken over the way to the Green Man; then I talked a deal to him. Some time after he was sent back to the office, and it turned out that he had signed this confession then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The only question that is fit to be asked you before this is read, is this, had you, or any body else to your knowledge, made him any promise, or used any threats? - I cannot know what passed at the first; I do not know of any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did you see that signed by the prisoner? - Yes, I saw it signed by the prisoner at the magistrate's. It was read over by Mr. Lavender, one of the clerks, to the prisoner. Read.</p>

               <p>I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. You know your counsel has not an opportunity of saying any thing for you? - Clearly, my Lord. I wish to suggest there is a grand mistake in Mr. Macmanus's evidence: I do not know that the confession was ever read over to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Macmanus. You hear what Mr. Lightowler says.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. Yes, Sir, and I am very sorry to hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lavender was the most likely person to know whether it was or was not. I have very little thoughts of its doing me a service: this I will tell you very candidly, that I read it over myself, but it never was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I am sure Mr. Lavender read it and gave it into his hand afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he read it to him in an open way, so that he heard the whole of what passed? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How came Lavender not to be here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Are you prepared then to say upon your oath, that it was read over? - I have no doubt about it, not the least; I wish Lavender was sent for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no desire of the kind, I do not think it would serve me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. There is no harm in your suggestion of the question at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. If you mean to say any thing to the Court or Jury, you must do it yourself. - I have nobody here. Apprehending from the message I received from the worthy solicitor against me, that my trial would not come on, I did not prepare myself with any witnesses at all.</p>

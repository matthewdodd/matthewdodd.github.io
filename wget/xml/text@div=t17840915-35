               <p>Have you come to see her since she was in prison? - I have been to carry her a bit of victuals, and a few apples now and then.</p>
               <p>Court. Take her home, and take care of her, and remember you must answer to God and the public, for the care you take of your children; if you do not take care of them, you are more criminal than they a great deal.</p>

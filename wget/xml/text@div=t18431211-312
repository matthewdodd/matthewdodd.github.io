                  </hi>. I live in Edward-square, Kensington. On the 2nd of Dec. I was in an omnibus—when I got in I had a purse containing three foreign Danish gold coins, which I have had forty years, and six shillings—I received information from Clark—I found my purse, silver, and gold coins gone, my right pocket cut in two places, and part of my dress—this is my purse, and these are my coins.</p>

               <p>the Black wall Railway. I was acting as conductor to an omnibus on the 2nd of Dec.—the prosecutrix sat on the off side, next the door—the prisoner clare and a lady were opposite—Clare was nearest the door—Moore was next to the prosecutrix—as Moore had got in at Regent-circus he walked up the side of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to see who was in it—he got in—we proceeded a little further, and Clare hailed me, and he said I did not look out—I put him in, and made a remark that I thought they were bad characters, as I had had a lady robbed in my <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> a fortnight before—another lady got in, who got out again at Wind<lb></lb>mill-street, and I observed her dress was disordered—she had sat near Moore—the prosecutrix then got in, and during that time Moore shifted up to the end of the omnibus, but afterwards found his way down to her—we proceeded along—I picked up one or two more persons—we went to Temple-bar, and the prosecutrix desired me to put her down in Fleet-street—before we got to Chancery-lane Clare said he would alight—I said, "Very well"—Moore said he would get out, he had but little further to go, and would not trouble me to stop again—the prisoners did not appear to know each other—directly they got out I collared one with my right hand, and the other with my left, and Moore said to Clare, "Take it, take it, you d—d fool"—I asked the prosecutrix if she had been robbed—she at first said no—I said, "Be particular; if you are not robbed I am doing very wrong"—she felt in her pocket and said her purse was gone—I saw Moore's hand pass towards Clare's—I was obliged to release Moore then, because they both struggled very much, and Moore got away; Clare I held very tight—he kicked, and jumped, and did all he could to get away—I held him, hallooed, "Stop thief," and Moore was caught—Moore dropped the purse when he was taken, on the other side of Fleet-street—I took Clare to the station, and saw the purse brought in afterwards—the prosecutrix was sent for, and identified it—the scuffle took place between Temple-bar and the Temple-archway.</p>

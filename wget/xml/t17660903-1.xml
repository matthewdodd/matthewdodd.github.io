               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you lost your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Bond. It was about one or two in the day.</p>
               <p>Devereux Wall. I saw Mr. Bond going along with his handkerchief hanging out of his pocket; the boy at the bar ran after him and took it out, and gave it to a man behind him; the man seeing I observed them, gave it the boy again; I stopt the boy, and ran after Mr. Bond, and asked him if he had lost his handkerchief; he felt, and said he had; when the boy was committed, I saw the handkerchief taken out of the lining of his coat when in the Compter.</p>

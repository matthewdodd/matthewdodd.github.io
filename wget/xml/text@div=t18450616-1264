               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160031"></xptr>
               <p>correct plan, merely a rough sketch of my own—the river Gallinaa is not navigable for large vessels, nor for such vessels as the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>—there was no trade carried on at the Gallinas, that I could ever discover, or that I ever heard of, but the slave-trade, slave-trade alone—I have landed there frequently—there were six or seven slave establishments there previous to our destroying them—at the latter end of the year 1840 we destroyed six or seven slave establishments, by convention with the natives—I cannot say how many there were during the whole period, from 1837 to 1841, but in 1840 the naval squadron on the station destroyed six or seven—when we landed to destroy them, the Spaniards, or foreigners in possession of them, fled—I can only mention who were the reputed slave factors—I was not present, and never saw any of them purchase or sell slaves, but we found slave barracoons and several slaves—there were from 800 to 1000 given up to us—they left the slave establishments as we advanced upon them, but we caught several before they were out of the slave esta<lb></lb>blishments, and they were afterwards acknowledged by the natives to have been taken out of the slave establishments—I knew a person named Rolo, connected with the Gallinas—I have seen him at the Gallinas—I never saw him as a slave-dealer, but he is a reputed one—I have had conversa<lb></lb>tion with him at the Gallinas—I saw him at a place called Dorabocoro—there is one very large barracoon there, and several houses belonging to it—I did not see Rolo in the barracoon, or in either of the houses—he landed from a vessel that had been seized by Captain Denman—the vessel was not seized in my presence, but I saw him land—I do not recollect the name of the vessel he landed from—I know the name of Angel Ximenes—I have not seen him at either of the stations on the Gallinas—I have seen him at Sierra Leone—I know a person of the name of Alvarez by repute, I do not know him personally—I have seen a person who has been pointed out to me as Alvarez, at a small town close to the Gallinas—I saw no barracoons at that town—barracoons are large buildings used for keeping slaves—the number they will contain depends upon the size—they are sometimes very small, and sometimes large—I have never been far in the country myself—I have only seen barracoons near the coast—they are places where slaves are kept, until an opportunity is had for conveying them away—in March, April, or May, 1839, I captured a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, sailing under the Russian flag—when I absolutely seized her she might have been eight or nine miles from the Gallinas, but she had been previously much closer—when I first gave chase to her she was about two miles from the Gallinas, on the day I captured her—I had chased her before—a person named Bernardos was in command of her—after capturing her, I sent her to Sierra Leone, for the purpose of prose<lb></lb>cuting her in the Spanish and British Mixed Commission Court—she was not prosecuted there, on account of her being under the Russian flag, the Court refused to receive her into Court—I then sent her to England, to place her in the hands of the Lords of the Admiralty—I accompanied her to Sierra Leone—Bernardos was on board, and went to Sierra Leone with her, and from there to England—in Feb., 1841, I again captured that same vessel, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, and sailing under the British flag—she was then at anchor in the roads at Gallinas—the prisoner was then in command of her—I knew her to be the same vessel instantly, on going alongside—when I captured her as the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi> she had slave equip<lb></lb>ments on board—I cannot at this time state correctly what she had—she</p>

               <p>was equipped for the slave-trade—she had water-casks and coppers—I cannot exactly state the amount of her slave equipments, but she was equipped for the slave-trade, which justified me in seizing her—I did not accompany her to England, I sent an officer with her—when I boarded the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi> I saw the prisoner on board—I recognized the vessel, and talked to him about the vessel—I asked him for the vessel's papers, and he gave them to me—before that, I told him I recognised the vessel as being a vessel that I had before seized—I think he said he did not know, that he was ignorant of my having captured her before—I cannot now recollect whether I mentioned to him the name she bore before—it is so long ago I cannot recollect what my conversation with him might have been with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in her Majesty's Navy—I commanded a district on the African coast during the years 1840 and 1841—the river Gallinas was in my district—I was within sight of that river about eight months, scarcely ever out of sight, watching it closely—there is no trade whatever carried on there but in slaves, and the goods im<lb></lb>ported for the purpose of buying them—there were six large factories for slaves there, and two small ones—barracoons are one part of a factory destined to receive the slaves—a large barracoon will hold 1000 slaves or more—I knew Ignatius Rolo—he is now dead—I saw him at Gallinas, and also, I think, on board the <hi rend="italic">Wanderer</hi>—I am not certain whether it was on board our ship or another—I know he was the factor of a slave-factory called Jekree—he and his brother were the agents—I never saw Don Thomas Buron—I have captured slave ships—there are parts of Africa where nothing but lawful trade is carried on, and many parts lawful and unlaw<lb></lb>ful, but at Gallinas there is no lawful export trade—there is no export, except of slaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you take the log, on Tuesday 17th Nov., what would be the position of the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a little to the westward of the Scilly Islands—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a chart</hi>)—this is sufficiently accurate for me to answer the question by—I should say, on the 18th she would be about 120 miles from Cork—the wind is stated to be SSE in the forenoon, and varia<lb></lb>ble in the afternoon—she would be 800 or 900 miles from Cadis on the 18th—he would have to pass the coast of Portugal to make round across the Bay of Biscay, and he would round Cape St. Vincent—the wind was fair for Cork on the 18th, as direct as it could blow in the morning, but foul for Cadiz; but in the evening it was fair in either direction which she wished to go—it says variable here—I cannot precisely say how the wind might have been, but by the courses it does not appear there was any sud<lb></lb>den change—the wind shifted to the NE during the night of the 18th, and continued so on the 19th, and during that time it was blowing a heavy gale, and the ship's head SW, and it makes her go three knots and three and a half—it is perfectly impossible, in ships going before a heavy gale of wind, to be going three and a half, especially the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, which was a very fast sailing vessel indeed—the wind was fair for Cadiz, and she was steering a proper course—on the night of the 19th the wind seems to have shifted SE—it was foul wind for Cadiz, but she might have taken advan<lb></lb>tage of it where she was—on the 21st it was fair for Cadiz—the fact is, the log is so incorrectly kept, it is impossible to judge anything about distance—the latitude and longitude puts it in one place, and the distance from cer<lb></lb>tain places puts it in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, it appears they arrived at Cadiz on the 6th of Dec, having been 120 miles from Cork on the 18th of Nov.; now, considering what the wind was, and the speed of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, how long would it take her to get to Cork? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might have got in next day easily, I should say, if she wanted repairs on the 18th, and the wind was foul for Cork, she should have looked out for another port, which would have been Lisbon—there is no question if she wanted repairs she should have gone back to Cork.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—after being committed to Newgate by Alderman Johnson, he said, "Well, I suppose I am to be the sufferer; I could say a good deal if I liked, but I won't"—I said, "Why not?"—he said, "Because I should get other people into trouble"—I said, "I don't want to hear anything you have got to say"—he said, "I don't care who knows it."</p>

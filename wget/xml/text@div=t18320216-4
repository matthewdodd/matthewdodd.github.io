               <p>JOSEPH BRAMLEY. I live at Sandy-acre, Derbyshire, and have the <rs id="t18320216-4-viclabel19" type="occupation">care of a boat</rs>

I came there last Thursday week, and afterwards went to an hotel in Covent-garden to see a gentleman who I had bought the coals for; I was to see the gentleman at ten o'clock at night, but it was eleven before I saw him - I then had to go to Paddington again, and lost my way; I enquired the way; I saw the prisoner shortly after I left Covent-garden, and asked him to direct me - he said he knew Paddington very well, he was going that way, and would show me; we had not gone far before he said,"We must have something to drink," and called in at a gin-shop - we went into five or six gin-shops in all; I took a little gin at the two first shops, but not at the others - he drank at all the shops, and I paid for it; he wished me to drink more, very much, but I declined: it was half-past five o'clock in the morning when I got to <placeName id="t18320216-4-crimeloc20">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was you doing all the time? A. He kept calling at different gin-shops; I kept saying I wished I was there - he said, "Well, we shall soon he there now;" I got him out of the gin-shops as soon as I could, and when I got to the Paddington canal I knew where I was - I was quite sober; I had just taken two small glasses, and eat nothing; when I got to the canal I said, "I know where I am now;" he said, "Well, before you leave, look if your money be right;" I felt rather fearful, and would not look - he asked me several times to take out my money, but I would not; he said, "I should wish you to look at your money, and see if it is right, for if I leave you, and your money should not be right I should feel uneasy;" he said,"Well, what o'clock is it?" I looked at my watch, which was a silver one - I took it out, and it was half-past five o'clock; I told him so - he said he thought I had made a mistake; he wished to look himself - he asked me several times to let him look, and at last I let him lay hold of the watch, and I held fast by the ribbon; he held it up, and said, "I thought you had made a mistake, it is two minutes more;" as soon as he had said those words he gave a snatch with one hand, and hit me over the breast with the other - I stood with my back against the canal, and thought his intention was to knock me into the water; I recovered myself - I did not fall, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blow stagger you at all? A. Yes - he hit me as hard as he could, but I did not fall; I should think I might be nearly a yard from the canal - I did not step back when he struck me; the blow, as I felt it, was with his first - it hurt me; he tore the ribbon of my watch - the swivel or ring broke by his pulling; I held the ribbon still in my hand, and he took the watch - he ran up the street; I ran after him, and caught him thirty or forty yards off; I cried Murder! as loud as I could, and then he cried Police! I held him but a very short time before the Policeman came up, and took him in charge; when the Policeman came up, he said, "I have not got his watch - you may search me;" the Policeman searched him, but did not find it on him - he found it on the ground, four or five yards from him; I saw it on the ground myself - the Policeman had a light; the watch flew out of the case with the fall - I picked the watch up, and the Policeman the case; I gave the watch to the Policeman, and he kept it -I have kept the ribbon ever since; the ring remains on the ribbon now.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was near the canal in Praed-street - coming along I heard the cry of Murder! two or three times, and immediately began to run; I heard a cry of Police! I ran down the street towards the wharf road, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner about forty yards from the cut; as soon as I came up, he said, "This man has taken my watch;" the prisoner said I might search him, which I did but found nothing - I turned my light on; it was a very had light - two boatmen came up with a lantern, and I picked up the watch-case, and saw the watch laying about six feet from it; the prosecutor took it up, and gave it to me - I have had it ever since; I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH BRAMLEY. This is my watch, which was taken from me that night.</p>

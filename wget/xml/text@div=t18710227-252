                  </hi>. I live at 16, Isabella Street, Broadwall, and am a carman—the prisoner and her husband rented a room of me—on 6th February, my wife was out rather late—she came in about 8 o'clock, or 8.30, and I began to blow her up—the prisoner and her mother, of course, took it up—I begged the mother to hold her noise, because she did not hold any occupation in my place—then the prisoner came and struck me with her fist, when I was in my chair—I took her and got her into her own room, and shut the door, and went back to my own kitchen—the prisoner came after me again, I believe with a knife, and cut my lip—I got her into her own room again, and shut the door again, and then I rushed out into the street to get help—my lip has been sewn up—the prisoner's mother hit me with a poker—a hammer was used, but I did not get struck with that—I had not had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron-moulder, and lodge in this house—on the night of 6th February, about 8.30, I was with Durling in his room—Mrs. Durling came in, and he began wrangling with her because she had not got his tea ready—I came out, and stood against the door—the prisoner's mother came up, and said if it was her husband she would pull his nose as long as her arm—Durling came out, and said it was nothing to do with her; she did not rent any part of the house, and he wished her not to interfere with him and his wife, and he would turn her out if she was not quiet—the prisoner came out of her room, and let him know that it washer mother that he was going to put out, and with that, she met him, and struck him several times—he pushed her into her own room—he then came to speak to me at the foot of the stairs, and before he could say very many words she came out with something in her hand—I don't know what it was—I saw something shine in her hand, and she made a strike at him as he was going to put the door to—he was coming out again, to go for a constable, and she met him again with a hammer, and struck at him, but I don't think she hit him; it hit the wood—I heard him say "Oh!" when he shut the door—they had a scuffle in the passage—as soon as he came out of his room I saw him saturated with blood—they fell twice—I saw the prisoner's sister pulling Durling's hair, and very fortunately she did, for I think that was the <hi rend="italic">instigation</hi> of the hammer hitting the wall in place of his head—I went up to my own room—I came down again, hearing a knock at the door, and the prisoner said the first b——that came and opened the door she would settle him.</p>

I am a surgeon—about 10 o'clock on the night of 6th February, I saw the prosecutor—he had an incised wound in the upper lip, about an inch long, and deep into the teeth—it was done with some cutting instrument—he had also a contusion on the thigh, and a severe contusion of the right arm—the skin of the forehead was broken, and he was bleeding from the lip—he lost a large quantity of blood—I had to sew the lip up—there is always danger of erysipelas in these cases, but it did not supervene here.</p>

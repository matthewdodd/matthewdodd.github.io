                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in the parish of All<lb></lb>hallows, Lombard-street. I have known the prisoner for some time—he is a butcher, and used to call upon me at the shop—he came on the 14th of November—I asked him to take care of my shop while I went out—on the 17th I missed my watch (I had not seen it after the 14th)—I suspected the prisoner, and on Monday-week he came to my lodging, and said he heard that I suspected him of taking my watch—he said I might hear of it, or of the duplicate, in the course of a week—I gave information to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I received information about the 19th or 20th of November, and saw the prisoner on the 7th of December, in Gracechurch-street—I told him he must go with me to the hair-dresser's—he said, "I have made that all right"—I said, "You must go and let me see"—I went with him, and he had not been there—I took him to the watch-house, and in going along he said he was <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>—that he had taken the watch, and I might find the duplicate al his place of business in Leadenhall market—I went and found it there.</p>

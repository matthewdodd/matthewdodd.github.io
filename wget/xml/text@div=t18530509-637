               <p>ford. I lived with the prisoner as his wife for four years, up to a fortnight before 28th March, and was then living with another man—on the morning of 28th March I went into Mr. Barker's house for a ribbon to trim some caps; it is a private house—the prisoner was there before me; and when I went in, he got up, and asked me to go into the kitchen, and read a letter from my uncle, which he gave into my hand—there was no one in the kichen when I got there; while I was there, the prisoner came in, put his left arm round my neck, and asked me whether I was unhappy—I said, "No"—he said, "I am," and put a razor to my throat with his right hand, and cut a deep wound on the left side of my throat—I struggled with him, and called out, "Murder!"—my hands were cut in the struggle, and also my cheek and my chin—Mr. Barker came in, and released me from the prisoner—I bled a great quantity, and was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday night, 27th March, the prisoner lodged at my house—on the morning of the 28th Charlotte Carter came for some ribbon—the prisoner asked her to go and read a letter, and they went into the back kitchen together—(I had known them before that living together)—I heard a scream, rushed into the back kitchen, and found the prisoner with his left arm round her neck, and his right arm somewhere in front of her—I did not see anything in his hand—I liberated her, and saw that she was bleeding from the neck—I went out, and called, "Murder!" returned to the back kitchen, and found the prisoner there, with this old chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—he said, "Hold your noise; don't say anything; it is all right"—I sent for a policeman, and the prisoner went into the back yard—I went after him there, and found him lying, with his throat cut, and the blade of a razor in his hand, the handle of which I afterwards found in the back kitchen—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 28th March, Charlotte Carter was brought to the London Hospital, in a very weak and exhausted condition from loss of blood—she had a large wound on the left side of her neck, three quarters of an inch long, and nearly an inch deep; it had not divided the carotid artery—if it had it would most probably have killed her—it was about half an inch from it—two small vessels were divided—I had to tie them—she was considered to be in danger for about a fortnight—the prisoner was also dangerously wounded—he had really cut his throat—this razor would have inflicted both those wounds.</p>

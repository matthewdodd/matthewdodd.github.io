I went to the Justice; the Justice and my master must come himself, he went, and came with a warrant; I went with my master to search, but we could not find the callimanco; after that Mr. Bell came, and informed us of the piece; when the prisoner and piece was before the Justice, I heard him own he took it, and hoped he should receive mercy; (piece produced.)</p>

On the 31st of January I was in the garret at work; about nine o'clock I heard a rustling; I said to my wife, give a step down, there is somebody in the entry; she said, there is nothing at all; I said, yes, go and see; she went to the head of the stairs, and then, as she told me, she saw Mrs. Graham; I did not see her. About half an hour after, Mr. Brett, a journeyman, and the constable came to search: I never moved out of the garret: my wife desired them to come and search the garret; they came and searched, and were very well contented; then they went down to our other room, but found nothing. About one o'clock I had done dinner, and went to my labour again; my wife went down to make use of the pot, and she called me down, and said, here is something hangs black out of the bed; then I ran down; I laid hold of it, and drawed out a whole piece of black stuff. I went and said to Mrs. Graham, come and fetch that out of my room which you put in, for no body could put it in but you or Webber; she did not come up then: my wife went down and called her up a second time, then she came up; I said, you naughty woman, how could you put that piece into my room, take it out again; she made a great many vows, and said she did not put it there; I said, I'll go and tell the owner of it; she laid hold of my sleeve with one hand and my shirt with the other, and said, if you do go, Webber will be hanged; I went immediately to Mr. Brett, and told him of it; he and his foreman and the officer, came and took Mrs Graham and the piece away together.</p>

               <p>I am a partner with Mr. Davis. The prisoner was working in the warehouse; and he went into the next warehouse, without any orders; and I heard a noise, by his breaking open a chest; I immediately call out, what are you about there? Jacques was there; and said, he was very ill, and desired to go to a publick-house, as he was very ill; I immediately followed him, having found the chest broke open, and that he had got some opium; I followed him out of the house, and found the opium in the gateway; and he said, he had never robbed us in his life: I did not find any thing upon the prisoner: I had the chest of opium weighed, and found the exact quantity deficient, as was found in the gateway.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutors: they sent me to the next gateway, to see if the prisoner had left any thing there; I went and found the opium behind the gate, in the gateway.</p>

               <p>(The opium produced, and handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was you at the weighing of the chest? - I was. There was some chaff about the opium; and the Lord Mayor ordered the prisoner to be searched; and he was; and some of the chaff was found in the prisoner's breeches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon losing some opium before, I marked some pieces; but I do not see any of the marks upon this.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner had not been at work upon opium for some time before, not a twelvemonth.</p>

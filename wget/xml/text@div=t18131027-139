On the 10th of last November, the prisoner came to my shop in a sailor's dress, with large whiskers. When I saw him at Union-hall he had them shaved off; now they are grown again. When he called upon me he affected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270071"></xptr>to be intoxicated. I judged so. He said he wanted to look at some linen for shirts. I shewed him a small quantity, and he scarcely looking at the cloth, pulled out of his jacket pocket two gold pugado's and a Spanish dollar, saying, do you take such money as that. I said, yes, when we know the value of it we take it. I called

             to go and know the value of it. The boy went, and returned in a quarter of an hour. During that time he affected intoxication, reeling about as if he was tipsey. Phillips returned, and said the value of the pugados were six shillings and ten pence or seven shillings, and five shillings and sixpence the Spanish dollar. I said, reach me down a piece of cloth, and while I was looking at the cloth, one of the pugados was gone; he produced these forty-three pugados in paper, wrapped up, and while I was counting them he said, come let us go into the cabin, seeing the accompting-house. I supposed they being precious metal took them with me; he said he must have the brass, meaning the change. In the accompting-house I endeavoured to ascertain the value of them, supposing them to be good, and after calculating them I found they would come to fourteen or fifteen pounds. I had nine pounds laying on the desk; I offered him that until they were sold. He wanted the cloth or the other change to make it up. I told him I would give him no more at present, nor should he have the cloth. I moved the cloth out of his reach, as he seemed to want to take it. I gave him no more. I told him in an hour he should have the whole of the change. I then put the forty-three pugados towards him, and told him he should have no more. He would not give me the nine pounds back again, but seemed to wish to get off. I gave him a card of our shop, and told him to call in an hour; he promised me he would. As soon as he was gone I sent Nicholson to ascertain their value, and sent Phillips with him to ascertain their value, and to bring me the produce back. Phillips came back; I then found they were good for nothing. I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Mackglew's shop. Mr. Mackglew delivered to me forty-three pugados. I took them to a friend of mine in Red-lion-court, Watling-street. I intended to dispose of them; the person would have nothing to do with them. I returned them to Phillips. They were the same pugados that I received of Mr. Mackglew, the same I returned to Phillips.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Mackglew. I received the two first pugados; I took them to Mr. Smith to ascertain their value. I took them back again to my master. I am not sure whether I delivered them back to the prisoner or my master. I afterwards went with Nicholson to Watling-street, and I went with him to Bow-lane. He returned me the forty-three same pugados that he had received of my master. I made enquiry about them in Leadenhall-street, they were brass.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these forty-three - A. They are all of them false metal, gilt, merely copper washed over. They are of no value whatever. The two first produced by the boy were good; they are worth six shillings and eight pence or seven shillings. They are the coin of Bombay.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Mackglew. Did he ever return for the cloth - A. No. The cloth came to three pounds odd; I gave him nine pounds, keeping a balance in my hand for the difference of the value of the coin.</p>

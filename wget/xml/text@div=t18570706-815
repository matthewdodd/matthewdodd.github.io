                  </hi>. I live in Adam's Place, and am a seaman. I recently came from Melbourne—on Thursday, 4th June, I was in Mint Street, Borough, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I was taking a few oysters at a barrow; I paid for them, and I put my money into my right hand pocket—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there, and I had in another pocket 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I had not left the barrow three yards before the prisoner and another came up to me—they made bad oaths at me, telling me to go home—I took no notice, but walked on—they came up again, stopped me, and they made me in that way that I threw off my coat to stand in my own defence—I saw they were determined to ill use me in some way—the prisoner then took me round the waist, and threw me down, and when I was down I was stunned by the fall—he fell on me with all his weight, and I did not recover myself for five minutes, and then I missed the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket, and my trowsers were torn down—I was not quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mint Street with my brother when he got these oysters—I saw the prisoner and another person come up after he left the barrow; they took hold of him, and asked him for refreshment, and the prisoner swore a great deal—I went on with my brother, and he took off his coat, and gave it to me—the prisoner took my brother round the waist, and threw him on the pavement, and cut his head, and I saw him put his hand into my brother's pocket, and take his hand out shut with some money—when my brother came to himself he said that he had lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner then saw my other brother coming, and he went away.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was our servant; and was discharged the evening of the 18th of March, between seven and eight; and we paid her her wages.

               <p>Court. What is the value of these clothes? - About thirty-seven shillings. The prisoner said at the office, that she took the street-door key along with her, and let herself in; and opened the back door at the same time, and took the things; and went out at the street-door.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of April, I took the prisoner into custody in the Park; coming along I asked her where her mistress's property was, that she had robbed her of? she would not tell me then, till I had got a little farther.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make her any promise? - Not in the least. I took her to a public-house in Litchfield-street, and took her into a room, and was beginning to search<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260009"></xptr>her; she immediately put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out four or five duplicates, and gave them to me; I asked her then, how she got the things out, after she was discharged from her mistress? she then told me, she took the key of the street-door with her when she was discharge, and took her box away, and went and left her box at a friend's house; and some time after, went back to her master's the same night, and let herself in, and went up stairs, and took her mistres's clothes; and opened the back door, and carried them out on the leads. I asked her, if there was any one concerned with her? she said, she threw them down into a back private yard that led into another street, left the back door open, and came out the same way she went in; and went then and took the clothes from the place where she threw them over, and carried them, and put them into her box, which he had left at her friend's.</p>

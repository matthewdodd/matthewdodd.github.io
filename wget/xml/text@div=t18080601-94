            . On the 25th of April I was looking out of my one pair of stairs window; I saw the prisoner unpinning the two shirts, folding them up, and putting them into her pocket; I called out to her that the property did not belong to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when she was unpinning these shirts - A. In an open yard that goes down an alley far from the street; I told her again that the property did not belong to her; she still kept on. I ran down stairs as fast as I could and went to the causeway where she was; she was running up Stepney causeway; I called out stop thief; she was taken from behind some buildings; she was brought back to where she stole the shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you suspect her - A. Because she pulled up her petticoats, and put them into her pocket. I was confident that she was not the person that belonged to them.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the things in my hand, no more than I have this instant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the 10th Hussars—on 31st March I was at the races of the 10th Hussars, at Down Barnes, inside the enclosure—the prisoner passed in front of me, and I felt a tug at my watch-chain—he moved away—I went and put my hand on his shoulder and said "My watch"—he threw it on the ground, and started out of the enclosure—I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he was captured—my watch was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was at these races, and at 5 o'clock saw the prisoner running from the enclosure, towards Harrow—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw him followed by the prosecutor—I took the prisoner, and found a pack of cards on him—I told him the charge—he made no reply.</p>

            . I keep the Hare and Hounds stables, Islington, and have known the prisoner for years. I received this mare from him on the 15th of March, I think - he was in the habit of coming to my house; he brought her first to my house, but I did not like her. On the 15th of March I saw him with her in Bruton-street, Regent-street; he said she would do in harness: I put her into harness as he recommended her strongly. I tried her, and bought her of him for 30 l., and a black mare; he told me he had her of a pig-jobber, at Smithfield, named Baker, who lived at Hackney, and had had her a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he or you to pay 30 l.? A. He was to pay me 30 l.; mine was the best horse. I know he buys and sells horses in Smithfield. I would not have given him credit if I had not known him; he was very lame with an abscess on his thigh, and I should think could not ride sixty miles; he was driving it in a gig - he could not ride my black horse back; he made no concealment about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The first time you saw it, was at your stables? A. Yes - he drove it there in a pony chaise. I should think it would take sixteen hours to drive it sixty miles.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 27th of March I was at the Hare and Hounds, with a gentleman, and saw the mare. I had received information, and wrote to Mr. Hills, who came up, and claimed it. I saw the prisoner at our office on the 24th of May, and detained him - I told him it was for a mare in foal which he swapped with Easton; he said,</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Devonshire-street, Elephant and Castle. I know the prisoner and Baker - I bid Baker money for this mare in March last, at Smithfield; it was in foal, or I should have bought her - I bid 16 l. I saw the prisoner afterwards come into the King's Head, public-house, and pay Baker two notes and some silver for it - it was a brown bay mare, with black legs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Baker before? A. Yes, for twelve months, but never dealt with him; he lives at Smithfield: I have tried to find him out, but cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you witness the receipt which passed? A. I saw a receipt pass, but was not asked to witness it. I saw the stamp sent out for, but who by I cannot say - I think some gold passed; I heard 18 l. mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Baker lived in Smithfield? A. No, in Hackney-road.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You do not know of your own knowledge that he lived at Hackney? A. Only I heard him say so, at the time the mare was paid for.</p>

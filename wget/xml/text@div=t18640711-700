I have only been five years in London come December next. was never in a position to see Mr. Farrar, until I had been a year in London; for one year after I made his acquaintance, I sold him several parcels; and since then, I have had no goods suitable for him to purchase. I have been four times in Mr. Hellaby's warehouse within the last four years, and on each occasion have seen Mr. Farrar the last time but one: I don't mean Thursday. I told him particularly I required work for my wife to make shirts, as I was doing nothing, but out of employ.' (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, repeated this statement.</hi>)</p>

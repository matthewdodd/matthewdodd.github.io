               <p>RICHARD STIFF sworn. - I am the collector appointed by the society, to receive subscriptions for the education of the children of insolvent debtors under confinement; I have been collector above twelve months; there is one school at the Stones End, and I do not recollect that there is any number to it; and another in Dorset-street, Salisbury-court, Fleet-street; the committee meet every second Tuesday in the month; I have no knowledge of the prisoner; there are no collectors besides myself, I have my appointment in my pocket, signed by the gentlemen of the committee; Mr. Wood is one of our subscribers, I received Mr. Wood's subscription on the 25th of January last.</p>

               <p>Q. What book have you got there? - A. A book containing the resolutions of the committee at the time I was appointed, which was in March 1799; Mr. Grassfer was collector before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers? (Shewing him the letter, and the receipt.) - A. I know nothing of them in the least.</p>
               <p>Rev. ROWLAND HILL sworn. - I am one of the committee: I come only to assert, that Mr. Stiff is the only person appointed by us to receive any subscriptions whatever; a vast number of these kind of collectors have done us prodigious injury; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the house of another person. On the 12th of August, between five and six in the morning, my wife and I heard a noise; and, getting up in bed, saw a man in the room: he had gathered the things mentioned in the indictment together, and put them on a chair close by the window: when he heard me stir, he looked round, and catched up the things in his arms, and jumped out of the window, which is thirteen feet from the ground. I got up, and looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner drop the things in the court, and take up some of them again, and run away; he knocked off his hat, and left it behind him in the court. I called out, Stop thief! and a Jew going past pursued him, and in about seven minutes brought him back, and some of the things with him; I am sure the man brought back is the same person that jumped out of the window: he had a brown coat and a blue apron: when he jumped out of the window, he looked up, and I saw his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Jeweller, and live in Smithfield-bass, in the parish of St. Sepulchre's. I did not miss this property till a police man came last Saturday morning, the 9th of December, and made inquiry—I then examined my stock which was near a hole cut in the window, end missed a scent box—I did not miss the pin till it was shown to me—the hole must have been made in the glass on the Friday night—it was whole in the afternoon—I cannot say positively that I had seen the prisoner in my shop that day—I had seen a boy like him about eight o'clock on Friday evening—he came and inquired if I sold steel pens—he did not buy any—I did not discover the hole till I took the shutters down next morning—it is a hole out of the corner, rather more than an inch, quite large enough to take a scent-box out—I had several breast-pins of the same description as these near the hole, and could not positively miss them.</p>

               <p>last I went to a beer-shop in Turnmill-street, Cow-cross, about half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner in a back room, the door of which was open—I went into the room—before I entered the room the prisoner saw me, and went from the middle of the room towards the side—I went into the room and asked him if he had not slept at a house in Field-lane—he said he had not—I said a robbery had been committed—he said he knew nothing of any robbery—I searched him, but found nothing on him but an old leather pouch—on hearing something from the landlord we searched the room and another room—I did not find the property myself, but my brother constable found it in the room the prisoner was in—I saw him find a parcel tied up in a piece of old handkerchief in the corner of the room, between the seat and the wall, at the back of the seat—it contained a scent-box and a breast-pin, with another small pin attached to it by a chain.</p>

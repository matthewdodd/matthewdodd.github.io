                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Evans, of Eaton-place, Edmonton. I resided in the same house with the deceased, John Bowler—his wife was then living—the prisoner is the step daughter of Bowler—her mother died two days after the deceased—he was seventy-eight years, of age—he was a pensioner, and had been in the army—the prisoner did not live with her parents—she is an unfortunate female—on 2nd Nov., between a quarter to 3 and a quarter past 3 o'clock, she came to the house—I was in the room, with old Bowler and his wife—he was lighting a fire, after coming from London—he was sober, to my knowledge—the prisoner was about half tipsy—she had a child in her arms, about a year and a half, old—it was not her own child—she sat down in a chair—Bowler asked her to go out; he did not wish her to be there—she said she would not go out for him, and he laid hold of her to push her out—she kept him away from her as well as she could, and they struggled together—I said to her, "Let me have the child"—Mrs. Bowler then interfered—the prisoner said to Bowler, "Mind you, I will mark you before the night is over for this"—Mrs. Bowler said to him, "Let her be for a few minutes, and she shall go out"—he did not leave her alone—he wanted her to go out all the time, but she would not; and when he saw that he could not put her out, he went to look for a policeman—while he was gone, the prisoner asked her mother for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, where did she think she should find a sixpence—she did not give it her—I cannot say exactly what time Bowler returned, but it was moon-light—the prisoner then took up two chairs, one after the other, and broke them in the middle of the floor—she was in a passion—she then took a kettle of boiling water from the stove, and broke it on the floor, and kicked it right out into the yard—the boiling water came on the floor—she then went away—she came back in a minute or two, without her bonnet, and her sleeves tucked up, and struck Bowler with a stone—he was then at the threshold of the door—she had got the stone from the yard—I saw her stoop and pick up something, but I could not say whether it was a stone or a brick—it was bigger than my fist, but not so big as my two fists—she struck him with it on the top of the head—he hallooed "Murder!" several times—he bled most awfully—he said, "Is there no neighbour that will assist me, or I am a dead man?"—a man named <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi> O'Neil came, and took him to the chemist's—before the prisoner struck Bowler on the head, I saw her drag him down, and kick him most awfully when he was down; and when he got up, he said that he had lost the use of his hand—he did not complain of his head then.</p>

M'INTYRE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him fall before she struck him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she dragged him down, and kicked him in the side and shoulder—he remained at home three days after this, and then was taken to the Union—he was ill all the time he was at home—I saw him every day—I was lodging in the house—he was perfectly well before this—</p>

               <p>I cannot say whether <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> were pretty frequent there—I was not lodging there more than three months—to my knowledge, the deceased was a sober man—I never saw him drunk, but once; that was when he drew his money—he had drawn his money on the Wednesday, as this happened on the Thursday—he was not drunk on that day—he and his wife had been into London, to lay out his pension money—he had no signs of drink when he came home—I should be sure to know, if he had—I am a good judge—people were not giving him advice as to what to do with his wound—the prisoner was about <hi rend="italic">half and half</hi>—she was not a good deal excited, or she could not have carried a child a year and a half old, in her arms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Edmonton, I first saw the deceased on Wednesday, 8th Nov., at his own house; and he was removed, on Thursday, to the Infirmary—he was in a most dangerous state, from erysipelas on the head and face, extending over the whole head—a blow on the head with a brick would produce erysipelas—a fall might equally produce it—I did not see a wound on the head—the head and face were excessively swollen, and covered with vesications—I saw no appearance on the head to account for that—there was a wound on the head, but the swollen state of the scalp prevented it from being much seen—it was on the right side of the head, on the parietal bone—I could not say of what standing it was; some few days, I presume—it might have been inflicted on the second or third day before—if a person had been perfectly well before, and had received a blow on the head with a brick or stone, it would account for all that I saw—I saw him again on Friday; he died that night of the erysipelas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You could not speak positively to the time at which the injury might have occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not decidedly—the swollen state of the head was the consequence-of the erysipelas—it is generally fatal under such circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bird, of Eaton-place, Edmonton. I saw the commencement of the disturbance between the deceased and the prisoner—I saw her in the yard, and saw her take up a piece of flag stone—I put my foot upon her fingers, and wanted her to do no damage—she threatened to knock me down, and she pulled the stone from under my feet—it was a three-cornered stone, and weighed about a pound and a quarter, I should say—she tucked up her sleeves and her gown, and ran down the path, with the stone, saying, "Take that, you old English old soldier; and if that don't do, I will give you some more"—she ran right against the door, and hit the deceased on the right side of the head—he hallooed out, "Murder!" three or four times—he appeared very well before this—he went down to Ponder's-end the day before for his pension—I did not see any more of him after this, only the first thing in the morning, when he went for a little water, and a pint of beer for the old lady—he was down stairs, in the bottom room, but I did not go in; none of the neighbours were called in—I did not see him come in the day before—there always was a piece of work at pension time.</p>

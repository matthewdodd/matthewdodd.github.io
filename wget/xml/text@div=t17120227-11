             as Accessary to the same before the Fact. It appear'd by the Evidence, that Mr. Denton being at Islington for his Health, his Wife went to him on the 19th at Night, and returning in the Morning, found the Street-Door shut as she had left it, but the inner Doors, with Chests of Drawers, Trunks, &amp;c. broke open, and the Goods gone; and having afterwards, a Suspicion of the Prisoner, with some Difficulty found out his Lodging in Fetter-Lane, where he had like to have been taken, but made his Escape; and his Lodging being search'd, a Purse was found, which Mrs. Denton knew to be hers. After which, he remov'd to Fulham, where it was prov'd he melted some of the Plate, and where a Trunk with several of the Goods in it was found, in which was also some Cloaths belonging to the Prisoner. It was also prov'd, that he sold a Gold Watch-Case and Chain, part of the Goods, to a Goldsmith, to whom afterwards coming to sell some melted Silver, he stop'd him, and carry'd him to the Compter, together with the Man where he lodg'd at Fulham, and by the way he dropt a Bag with a Quantity of melted Silver, to the Value of about 50 l. The Evidence was exceeding full and clear against him, and he having nothing material to offer in his Defence, nor any one to appear to his Reputation, the Jury found him <rs id="t17120227-11-verdict53" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lucas, and live at 4, Hoy-street, Plaistow—I know the prisoner by sight; she came to our house on the 23d of November, about a lodging, with a woman of the name of Parker—she went into the back room—I did not see her go into any other room—she was in the house about ten minutes—she came into the room where I was, and then went down stairs again—next day I missed some things—they must have been taken between 10 and 3 o'clock—they were quite safe at 10, and were gone at 3—I missed a coloured dress, two coats, a pair of trousers, and a silk handkerchief—this dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the things I missed.</p>

I received information of this robbery on the 25th, and went to Mr. Darlow's, the pawnbroker, and gave information there to the witness Hall—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody, on the 17th January—I found on her sixty pawn-tickets, among others one relating to a dress—I asked her how she accounted for that gown that was pledged at Mr. Darlow's, for 4 shillings, on the 14th November—she said she had bought the ticket nine months previously, and that she went and pledged the dress that night—about half an hour afterwards, at the station, she said she had bought the ticket, with another, that morning.</p>

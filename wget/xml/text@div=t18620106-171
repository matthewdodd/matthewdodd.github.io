                  </hi>. I live at 94, Broad-street, Ratcliffe, and am an iron<lb></lb>monger—the prisoner is my apprentice, and has been so about four years—he sometimes slept on the premises—on the evening of 24th December, I locked up the premises myself—I left nobody in charge—I gave the keys to the prisoner—he was outside the premises, going to leave, going home—on the morning of 26th, in consequence of some information, I went to the premises, and discovered there had been a fire—I observed that a great number of paintings had been stolen from the place, and the place had been set fire to in two places—a basket of straw bad been brought up from the cellar, and placed behind the counter in the shop—I am quite sure the basket of straw was not there when I left on the night of 24th—another basket of straw bad been placed under the table of the room above, and set fire to, that had burnt through the flooring—it was placed under the gas<lb></lb>pipe—about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stock was injured altogether—there was a barometer also missed—I next saw the prisoner on Friday morning, the 27th—he did not appear on the 26th at all—on the 27th he came to his work as usual—I asked him if he knew anything about the fire and robbery, and he affected astonishment, and said he knew nothing about it—I told him to open the shop and get on with his work as usual—in the afternoon I went to his lodging with Serjeant Stimpaon, 2, Snow-hill—I went on the following day again, and I saw some paintings found there in the cellar; two of them I had missed—they were safe at my place on the 24th—they were wrapped up in a sheet—I then came back to my place where the prisoner was—I asked him what sheet that was—he said it was off his bed—I know this key (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is the key of the outer gate—I lost it about a month or three weeks before the fire, and had spoken to the prisoner about it, I dare say twenty times, but he denied all knowledge of it—when the gate is shut, the street-door might be left open—a person could not get in with that key alone; the street-door must be unlocked first, then they could get in with this key at any time.</p>

On Friday, 27th December, I went to Mr. Davis' shop—I saw the prisoner there in company with Mr. Davis, and heard him say that a man had been dodging him about for five weeks, and he had seen him about nine times during that time; and last week he said he saw the man about five times, pretty well every night during the week; that he came on Tuesday evening, and tapped at the window, and he went out to him, and had some conversation with him; and then he waited about there till he shut the shop up, and after that he took him to a public-house, the Ship and Star, in High-street, Shad well, and there they had a pint of ale, each had a glass; that he gave the man the keys, and the man gave him a half-sovereign—he said the man and his master were formerly friends, and he wanted the keys to look over his goods—the man unlocked the door, went inside, shut the door again, and gave him the keys, which he took to where he had to leave them, two doors off, and that was all he knew about it—he described the man; he said, he was about my own height, or not quite so tall or stout as myself, black whiskers, and had a tooth out in front; but whether the upper or lower jaw he could not say—he said he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10 1/2, Richmond-street, Old-street, and am the wife of John Favell Betts. He is a clerk in an insurance office—Thomas East came on Saturday morning to ask for a room for himself and son, a little boy—I said he could not well have it that day—he said he must if he could, as he had just come from the country, and was at a public house, which was expensive—he said he was a cabinet-maker, but was not in employ at present—I said if he was sober, and a good work<lb></lb>man, I thought I could get him work—I said, "I suppose you can give me some reference"—he looked at the room, and asked if there were good sheets—I said they were good common sheets—good enough for my chil<lb></lb>dren, and good enough for me, when I had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said he could give me a reference to a person in Henry-street—he staid in the room I should think five or six weeks—he did not pay one farthing, and I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was a pensioner—he asked me to let my servant make a fire that night, and she did, and then he went up into the room, and after a while, he said, could I lend him a mug to get some porter in—while he was gone I went up-stairs, but the door was locked—I have since found that that night a blanket of mine was pawned—I did not see the woman, but I understood she had been harboured there all along—one day my servant asked if she should clean the room out, and he said, no, his sister was out of place, he had got her there, and she should do it—I lent him a pail and brush, and he came down with his sleeves tucked up, and said he had given it a good cleaning—he said he had been a sailor and could do it.</p>

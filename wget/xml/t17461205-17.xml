Mr Levy, upon enquiring who was aiding and assisting, with respect to the Cloaths, had some Suspicion of Figueiro, as they had some Intimacy. I heard him say that he painted some small Part of his Face, his Eye-brows, and some small Part under the Eye; then Mr Levy asked if he knew any thing of the Cloaths, he said he did, but he did not understand by the Laws of England, that he had committed an Offence, that was what he said in my Room.</p>

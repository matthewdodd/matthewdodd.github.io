               <p>COURT. Q.What age were you when you married? A.About twenty; I should think she was thirty, or more - I heard about twelve months after that she had a husband living; she then told me he was alive - she had before said he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you lived with her thirteen years after that, and now prosecute her? A. She troubles me for a maintenance; I do not want another wife - I have a sister lives with me; I did not know where her husband lived, nor any of his friends; I at last found out he had been a furrier - I went to a furrier, and asked if he knew where he lived; he said he was dead, but he could tell me of a person who was present at the marriage - she told me he was alive about twelve months after our marriage, but she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300093"></xptr>said after he was dead; I asked what trade he was, but she never would tell me - she did not tell me that she had consulted a solicitor to know if she could not legally marry; she knew where to go any day to find her husband, for he lived where he did when they were married.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in consequence of my appearing against his sister that he has brought this prosecution. Witness. Yes. she appeared for an assault, but I never found out before where her friends lived.</p>

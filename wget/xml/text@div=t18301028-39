The prisoner was in my employ, and was in the habit of taking 15s. in silver, and 5s. in copper, every day, to a person named Young, to pay the work-women; on the 28th of August, he took it between ten and eleven o'clock, and I saw him no more till he was taken up on the 9th of October; he said he had nothing to say - he lived five years with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have told my Lord that he went with a pound the 28th of August - were you at home? A. Yes, and I saw it given him - it was for Mrs. Young; they used to send once a week down to me as many sovereigns as I had sent pounds - I believe I had received a payment on the Saturday evening before the 28th of August - that was on a Saturday; I had received it on the Saturday night or the Sunday morning; Mr. Young used to bring it down - I never suspected the prisoner before, though I knew he was a little addicted to drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 301). On Saturday morning, 8th April, I was on duty at Leytonstone, and about 3 o'clock saw the prisoner in the Leytonstone-road coming towards me from the direction of Mr. Symons' house—shortly afterwards, on going round my beat, I found a coat, a hat, and a pair of boots in a dust hole by the side of Messrs. Protheroe and Morriss's fowl house—in the coat pocket I found this brass tap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>),</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070090"></xptr>
               <p>Sergeant Hennessy came up and we found the prisoner in the hen home, without coat, hat, or boots—he said that he did not know how he came there, and asked for his coat and his boots—he said that they were his; he claimed the coat in which the tap was—I took him before a Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, K</hi> 35). On 5th April, about half-past 3 o'clock, I went to Messrs. Protheroe's, and saw a coat and a pair of shoes—this tap was in the pocket of the coat, and part of a loaf also—I got a ladder, went up into the loft over the fowl house, where forty or fifty fowls are kept, and found the prisoner without coat, hat, or shoes—he struggled, got away, jumped into the yard, and was knocked down by the constable—I heard him ask for his coat—I asked Mr. Protheroe in the prisoner's presence if the tap belonged to him, he said, "No," and the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately replied, "I do not know how I became possessed of the tap as I was drunk, and did not know what I was doing"—he was taken before a Magistrate, and had three months for being found in the fowl house; no charge was made against him at that time of stealing the tap—on Thursday, 10th April, I went to Mr. Symons's, and fitted the tap to the water butt—it exactly fitted—it went in as far as this black mark—the female servant was there, and recognised it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the tap shown to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I and all the evidence was gone through except the identification of the tap—the prisoner did not appear to have been drinking, but he might love been, the fore part of the night—he has the coat on now; he claimed it before I found the tap in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Richard Symons, of West Ham. On Friday night, 4th April, the tap was safe in the water butt at half past 8 o'clock; I missed it at 7 o'clock next morning—I have used it for three years—the handle is a little bent—it is Mr. Symons's property—the water butt is in the yard—a person must have got over the railings in front of the house—he would then go round to the back.</p>

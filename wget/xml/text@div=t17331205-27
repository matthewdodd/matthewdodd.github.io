She had run away from me several times, and therefore, as I was to go over the Water, I set her to work in the Kitchen, lock'd the Door, and went out. I return'd about 6 at Night, and the Prisoner was not to be found, my Drawers were broke open, and my Money and Goods gone. On the Friday following, a Neighbour met her in Cannon-Street, and brought her home to me. I ask'd her, what it was she broke open the Drawers with ? Why, what should I open them with, says she, but with a Chissel ? I ask'd her, what she had done with the Money and Goods? She own'd she had taken three Guineas; but said, she had been to the Prisoners in Newgate, and they had got them from her.</p>

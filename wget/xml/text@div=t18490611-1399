                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Webb-street, Southwark. On 17th May, about five o'clock, I was returning from a vestry-meeting, and met Bridge and Webber in Bermondsey-street—they said, "Mr. Shaw, won't you treat us to-day?"—I went to the Adam and Eve—the publican is a customer of mine, and Hill has had dinners frequently baked at my house—I gave Bridge and Webber some gin or rum at the Adam and Eve—I had not taken much before that—I went with them to Hill's house, which was in my way home—it is in what is called a court, but it is a public thoroughfare, where I have been hundreds of times—Hill was in the house, and 1 think Daley, but I am not certain—after I had treated them to some more spirits, I was going towards the door—they shut it, and Hill swore I should not get out—Bridge then pulled at my watch-chain; it broke, and she got the two seals and a ring—I laid hold of the handle of the door to open it, but could not—Webber punctured the baek of my hand with a pin, and Hill took off my hat and threw it behind her to the other end of the house, and struck me in my face—my nose bled profusely—she tore my shirt out of my trowsers and tore it in half, and my eye was blacked—I had not done anything except calling the neighbours—I at last succeeding in getting out—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I have not got my property since—I am not sure that Daley was amongst them—they were anxious to detain me, but I said, "No," and they shut the door—they ill-used me, and I called "Murder!"—there were, I dare say, a hundred persons in the court—it was at five in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>the court before I got out of the house—we had not dined at the veatry—I had had two or three glasses, may be—they only took Bridge at first—she said she took the seals—I did not have-the house searched, as my seals were gone by Hill's husband, who lives on prostitution and robbery—it was merely kindness on my part to go there—the whole court deals with me for bakings and other things—I did not go up to the bed-room with one of the women I did not think that Hill bore the character she does—I have never heard anything against her particularly—I never was in the house before—when I went in, I saw Hill in the room below-stairs—I swear I did not go up-stairs with either of the prisoners—we all four remained in the room down-stairs—Mrs. Hill swore I should not go—she did not ask me for any money—she said I should not go home because she wanted robbery—she was not the first person that had hold of me; it was Bridge, I think—Hill took off my hat and gave me such a blow that I thought my nose was broken—she did not ask me to pay for the room I had hired up-stairs—I did not hire the room—I hold the situation of overseer, and have gone to the vestry to relieve the pensioners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Shaw. I knew he had been attending a vestry-meeting, and I heard he was being murdered—I came out about five in the afternoon—I met him coming home—he had no hat, his face was covered with blood, and his shirt was torn and covered with blood—I took him home—the constable came—my master and the constable and I went to Hill's home—we found Hill and Bridge there—my master said be should like to have Hill taken, but he did not positively say—Bridge said, "Don't have the landlady taken, take me; I took the seals"—I asked her to give them back—she said, "I have not got them."</p>

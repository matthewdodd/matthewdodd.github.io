                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith; my father, Samuel Whale, has a workshop, it is in the parish of Woolwich, and is a detached building—on Saturday night, 20th Fe b., I left the shop quite safe. On Sunday morning, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner get over some new building near the shop—I gave information to the police, and about half-past ten, I came back again and heard noise unlocked the shop and found the prisoner inside—the policeman was there—I let the prisoner and policeman out, and found the place all in confusion—the drawer were all opened—I missed several brass knobs, several pieces of brass, and other things—these things produced are my father's property, and were safe in the shop on Saturday evening—they are worth about ten shillings—a window or glazed door had been broken, and by that means the door was opened, and a person could go in and out—the bolt was broken off—I informed my father on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon.</p>

On Sunday morning, 21st Feb., about ten o'clock, I passed Mr. Whale's shop, it then appeared quite safe—at twenty minutes past ten I returned, and saw the window at the rear of the premises open—I got over the new buildings, went into Mr. Ruffey's yard, and saw the prisoner getting our through the shop door or window—he saw me and went back into the shop—I got on to pig-sty, and then on to a shed, looked in and saw him in a corner—I said, "What are you doing near?"—he said, "Oh do let me go, I am not going to take anything"—I found in a towel fourteen brass knobs, several pieced of brass, a small box, and several pieces of solder—Whale came and opened the shop—he had given me information before.</p>

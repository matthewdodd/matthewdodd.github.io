                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Dock Company's Police—on 28th September I received information and sent for Sinclair and Bird, and saw them separately—I said to-Sinclair "I learn you were at our warehouse last night," and told him it was a serious matter, and cautioned him—he said "It was arranged with foreman Ryan about a month ago that I, Bird, and another man by the name of Carr should be in the warehouse and make up some bales of wool; I and Carr remained in one night, about the 13th, and made up two bales: on the following night we stopped in again and made up two more, making in all four bales, which on the following day were put into the scale; Ryan told us to mark them A. M. and a diamond No. I to 4, which was done"—Sinclair then said he had received about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that transaction, and afterwards received a few shillings at the time, about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—he said "Nothing more transpired until the previous day, when Ryan came to Sinclair and said 'You had better stop in again to-night with Bird and Carr and make up four bales more, get them marked A. M. diamond No. 5 to 8,' which we did; the bags were brought to the scale and there they remain ready to be—weighed"—I asked Bird what he had to say, and he said he knew nothing about the wool whatever; that he was working in the wool warehouse on the previous day, and that having left his jacket in the foreman's box he went there to get it, and on his return he found the door locked, and rather than make any bother in reference to his being locked in, he remained there all night; but he admitted having seen Sinclair there about five o'clock in the morning—I afterwards brought them to<lb></lb>gether, and read each other's statements so that they knew what each had said—I then sent for Ryan, and told him what Sinclair had said—Ryan said "It is no good denying facts, it is true; I have done it to make too ends meet"—I said "It is a very serious matter, and whatever you</p>

               <p>have to say may be made use of as evidence"—he said "I cannot help it; I may as well say it, and make a clean breast of it"—he said a person of the name of Hammond, about two months ago, asked him to get some bales of wool, and about the 13th September he prepared four bales, got them to the sale, passed them through the sale, and received 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the produce, which he divided between himself, Sinclair, Bird, and Carr—I showed Evan the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) A. M. I to 4, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he said "Yes, I received it from Mr. Hammond and have acted upon it"—he then said he saw Mr. Hammond on the 27th, and arranged to get four bales more—the four bales were marked "A. M. diamond 5 to 8," and they were placed ready for the scale, where I afterwards found them—I then called Bird in the presence of Ryan, and told him that Ryan had said it was arranged for him to re<lb></lb>main in with other men, and Ryan said "No good to be downhearted; tell the truth"—Bird said "Well, it is no good to deny it; I did remain in for one night, about the 13th, and we made up two or three bales then: I remained in last night and we made up four bales more, and we marked them A. M. and a diamond; I do not know whether they went to the scales"—the prisoners had no right to make up those bales, and no right to be in the warehouse at all.</p>

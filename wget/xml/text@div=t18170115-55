I was met by the two prisoners, they pressed me against the wall, they could pass me very well without touching me; it was evidently done on purpose. I said, there is plenty of room, why stop me; they still pressed me against the wall. I saw them turn into Long-alley. I felt, and found my watch gone. I followed them, and gave the alarm; neither of them appeared to be lame. When I came to Crown-street, I saw the prisoner, Hughes, in custody; there was a seal and key on my watch, it was worth 30s. I am sure the prisoners are the men who stopped me. When they had pressed against me, they turned back.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I was in Crown-street about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 28th of December, I was just by Long-alley; Hughes run furiously by me, up to Crown-street, and turned up Clifton-street; he was stopped near a low piece of ground dug for the foundation of a house. I saw him throw something white behind him into the low ground. I went there and found the watch, and seals, and key.</p>

               <p>John Dickson. I went to an Ale-house in Drury Lane, where I met the Prisoner. We drank together, and went to another Ale house in Long Acre, where we staid till past twelve at Night. She said then it was so late, that she should be locked out of her Lodging. I told her she should be welcome to lie in my Maid's Bed. So we went home together. I took her to the Maid's Bed. She asked me where I lay, and I shewed her; she said she liked that better, and so without any more to do, she undrest and went into it. I told her I would not lie out of my own Bed; she answered, I might do as I would, but for her part she would stay where she was. I found there was no remedy, and so I went to bed to her. When I awaked in the Morning, my Lady was gone, and had taken my Breeches with her, and all that was in them: she could not get out at the Yard Door, but by the help of a Ladder, she found the way over the Wall. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100014"></xptr> six Months before I could find her again; and then she confest where she had sold my Watch, and to whom she had given my Breeches. <rs id="t17351210-39-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

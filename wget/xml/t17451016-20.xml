I have got the mark on my nose now, and then they robbed me of a tobacco box and six shillings; after that they stopped my mouth, and dragged me into a house in Moses and Aaron Alley into a room up one pair of stairs, and robbed me of some jewelling work, which was in my pocket, to the value of between nine and ten pounds.</p>

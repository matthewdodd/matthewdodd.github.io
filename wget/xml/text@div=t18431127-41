                  </hi>. I am the wife of Wiilliam Lewis, of Denton-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner lived next door. On the 21st of Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock, I put a sovereign and a half-sovereign in a bill off the front parlour mantel-piece—I missed it about a quarter past four—the prisoner had been in my house, and in the room where the money was—she left about four—I was looking over the banisters, and saw her go out at the door—on missing it I sent for her, and told her I had lost the money—she said it was all nonsense, I should find it, and if I did not she would lend me the money—she then went home again—about six o'clock there was a great noise in her houw—I went in and found her lying on the floor, quite tipsy—I asked her if she had got the money—she said, no, she had got no money.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing this day with Mr. Lewis—I taw her put the money on the mantel-piece in a piece of paper, near eleven o'clock—about half-past three in the afternoon, Mr. Lewis was up stairs—I went of to her, and as I was going out of the parlour-door, the prisoner met me, and asked if I would lend her my cloak, as she was going out of an errand for Mr. Lewis—I said, "Yes," and she went into the front parlour—as I was going up stairs, Mr. Lewis leant over the banisters, and asked me to give directions to the servant—I went into the kitchen to do so, and on coming up, I saw the prisoner coming out of the parlour with my cloak on, and go out of the street door—there was no one in the parlour at that time—it was about half past three or a quarter to four—when I left, the paper was still on the mantel-piece—I cannot say whether the money was in it—about a quarter past four I went with Mr. Lewis into the parlour, and missed the money—the prisoner was then sent for—she said it was all nonsense, she was sure Mr. Lewis would soon find the money, and if she did not, she would lend her</p>

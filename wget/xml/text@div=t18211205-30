            . I live at Red-hill, Reigate, Surry. I work for my father, who is a butcher, I had a mare which I used to turn out on <placeName id="t18211205-30-crimeloc178">Red Hill-common</placeName>

I am sure it was mine - I took her home. I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Worship-street; he lived in the parish of Challard, about six miles from Reigate.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any thing done to disfigure her - A. No. I found the clog on Haleswood-common, adjoining Brickhill - I knew it by the chain and strap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there any thing particular in the strap - A. No. The mare was my own, I kept her from fold, I work her occasionally - I bought her of my uncle. The common is not enclosed, the clog was old, they sometimes come off - I thought she might have strayed after her colt, which I had sold about a fortnight before, it was at Reigate - I had had the mare four months, and knew her well, she was marked white down her face, and had two white fetlocks, and a large udder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she got home did she appear to know the place - A. Yes. I put her on the common next morning. Redhill is twenty miles from town.</p>

            . I am the patrol of Bethnall-green. On the 31st of October, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner near Cambridge-heath turnpike, near Hackney - he had a mare with this cord on her head, leading her; I went up and asked him what he had got, he said a horse, I said "Is it your own," he said Yes, and that he bought it of the jockeys six months ago - I said "You have a fancy bridle on," he said, Yes; I said "Where did you come from;" he said from Horsham, and that he was going into Hampshire to buy nuts and almonds, that a man told him he could buy them very cheap there; he said he did not know what town or village he was going to - I said he had nothing to bring them home in, he said he should buy a sack there; I detained and searched him, and found 20 s. about him. I put the mare in the Green-yard, and on the 7th Hewett, saw it, and claimed it, and took her away, it appeared quite tired, and was all over clay, as if it had come from the country a considerable distance.</p>

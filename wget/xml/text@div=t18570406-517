               <p>chips were inside the drawer, not on the floor; they were merely a few chips broken off the edges, as if some instrument had been put into the drawer—I told the father on one day that Brown, the officer, had told me that he had seen the prisoner in Newgate, and that he had admitted that he had destroyed the cheque or cheques; the father came to me two or three times—he brought the boy to me, I cannot recollect the day, and I asked him about the cheques, and I said to the father, "You had better take the boy, and take care of him; he is much better under your custody than being given in charge to the police"—I generally found the boy there when I got to the office in the morning, but I suppose the office was opened for the purpose of being cleaned before he got there—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque was in the pass book when it was brought home—the other cheques I have never seen, except the one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never sent any present to the boy's mother; I never sent a tortoise made of sealing wax as a relish for her tea—I swear most distinctly I never sent messages to his mother—I never sent her any coals with a letter telling her how to light her fire, nor did I afterwards, when I came to my senses, send an apology saying I was sorry for what I had done—this is the first time I have heard that I was in the habit of drinking and doing such silly things—I am not aware that I ever got into a state of intoxication; I cannot say I never did, but I swear positively I never sent any such messages, in fact I do not think I even knew that the boy had a mother.</p>

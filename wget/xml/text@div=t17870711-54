I was not frightened at all; yes, says he, your money in a moment, and he held up the pistol; I told him I had very little money, I had been seeing a friend in the country, and did not carry much money, but if he must have it, I would give it him; I had two guineas, and two half guineas in my pocket; I thought I would divide the spoil with him, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110087"></xptr>gave him one guinea and one half guinea; he said you have more money than this, and I said I had not; he said you are a liar, for I heard it chink in your pocket; that he might to be sure, because I heard it chink myself; he said, give me all you have; then I gave him the other guinea and a half, and as soon as he received the other guinea and a half, he turned his horse, and went to the common again; the horse was a small horse, about fourteen hands high, very remarkable, white face, two white feet behind, and lame; I then had some little hesitation in my mind what to do; I was better mounted than him a good deal; I thought I would pursue him; I stood consulting about three or four minutes, and I pursued him, and when I got off the heath, there were four or five roads; I pursued him in the wrong road, I almost killed my horse; the prisoner went to the further part of the heath, where there are roads to Drayton, and one to the Bath road; I left particular information of him, I said I should know him again among a thousand men; I then pursued him till about five; I found I had totally lost him; I got into the Bath road, there I was informed by the stage he was gone to Bath; I went to town, and laid an information before Sir Sampson, and that night he was taken; I saw him at Sir Sampson Wright's the next day.</p>
               <p>When you saw him at Sir Sampson's, did you see him in company with other people? - There were five and himself brought in a coach to the door, and the moment I went to the door and saw him, I knew him, and said he was the man; he was dressed as he is now; I believe he had the same coat on when he robbed me, but his hair was not tied.</p>
               <p>How long might the time be that you saw him on the heath? - The moment I came on the heath I saw this man among some sheep; I suppose he was twenty minutes in my sight; the heath is a mile long, and he did not rob me till he got almost to the end of it; he had a round hat on; I saw two guineas, and two half guineas at the office, but I could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. The time the prisoner was doing this fact, could not be more than three or four minutes? - I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>As to the other time, it was when you saw him at a great distance? - I suppose when I saw him first he was a quarter of a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Now I take it for granted, that when you was at Sir Sampson Wright's, they told you they believed your man was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore you expected to see some man that might be like your man? - Yes, if I were put in a room with a thousand men I could find him out.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of his dress? - Not much, I know he had nankeen breeches on, and white stockings.</p>

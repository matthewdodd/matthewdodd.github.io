I live at 33, King Street, Long Acre, and am a shoemaker—I have seen the prisoner on two or three occasions—I am married and live with my wife—on the night of 13th October, about 7 o'clock, I was in Great Earl Street, Long Acre—I met the prisoner and she followed me—I received a blow at the back of my head before I saw her—I felt blood run from my head—I asked her why she done it, and she said "I want 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from you," and I told her I did not know what she meant—I went on the Dials for a constable, and when I got to the corner of the street she took some coppers out of my pocket—I went about 20 yards and she followed me again</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 3, Southampton Street, Strand, and am divisional surgeon at Bow Street—I examined the prosecutor—he had a punctured wound in the upper lid of the left eye, which penetrated the eyeball and destroyed the sight; the eye was full of blood—he also had two small punctured wounds, one on the left side of his jaw, and one on the back of the head—they were such wounds as would be inflicted with a sharp instrument—in my opinion a pair of scissors would have done it—it will not be necessary to remove the left eye in order that the inflammation of the right shall cease—he has lost the Bight of the left; the other wounds were trivial.</p>

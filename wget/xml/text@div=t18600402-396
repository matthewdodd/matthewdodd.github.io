I am in the employ of Enthoven and Sons, lead-smelters of Rotherhithe—on 6th February, about 20 minutes to 9 in the evening I was on their wharf, and saw Holmes and Turnbull go to the pothouse: they could get on to the wharf that way—I went out a short time after, stood on the crane, and saw Holmes standing on a barge with two or three pigs of lead beside him—it was a fine moonlight night—it was short lead, what we call silver lead—there were four or five piles of silver lead on the wharf, close to the crane, one of which was broken down—I saw Vincent on the barge with the pig of silver lead in his hand, going towards Holmes, who stood next the water—Vincent walked from the edge of the barge</p>

               <p>nearest the wharf—I stooped down, went into the works, and spoke to John Herbert—I went out with him on the wharf, and saw Holmes standing alongside the water-closet on the wharf; he made a bit of a cough, we stepped up towards him, and he came and asked us where we were going to—we said, "To see the ships going out"—he said, "There are none to-night"—I stepped on the crane again, and Holmes got hold of me to pull me off; I still got up, looked over, and saw Vincent going down into the cabin of the barge, and Turnbull standing on the deck—I said, "It is too cold to stop here, I will go inside"—Holmes said, "Was that you that was out a little while ago?" I said, "No; it was my mate, I think"—he said, "That is all right then," and I went inside—I had seen a mail passenger boat six or eight yards oflf smaller than this boat that goes over the water—I went inside and spoke to the watchman—I had not seen the barge after it was loaded that afternoon—she had her hatches on, covered up with tarpaulin, and was loaded with market lead, something like this—the pigs of silver lead on the wharf were five or six yards from the barge—the place they work in is the pot-house—that is where the lead is melted.</p>

I live at 153, Rotherhithe-street, Rotherhithe, and am in the prosecutor's service—on the evening of 6th February, I was at work in the pot-house where the lead is crystallized—I went in about 8 o'clock—Sargeson was at work there too—I saw Holmes and Turnbull about half-past 8 o'clock—they were walking through in a hurry—I said, "What's here?"—Holland said they were going to take a barge away—shortly after that, Sargeson came and spoke to me, and we went out on the wharf and got on to the crane, and there I saw Turnbull on the barge that was laying there, and another man going down into the cabin—I could not swear who he was—Holmes was on the wharf then, he said to Sargeson, "What are you doing here?"—Sargeson said, "We have come out to look at the ships"—he said, "There are no ships there"—Holmes said, "Who was that that was out here just now?"—Sargeson said, "It was my mate"—we then got off the crane, and went into the pot-house again—Holmes, when he spoke to Sargeson, just</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Enthoven and Sons—I live on the premises—on 6th February they had a quantity of silver lying on the wharf in piles—I do not know the number of piles—there were from 80 to 100 in a pile—this is the sort of silver-lead that was there—these pigs are worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the silver they contain—I was on the wharf that night between 8 and 9 o'clock—the watchman spoke to me at the gate, and then I pursued my way into the lead works—Sargeson there spoke to me, and I sent for a constable—in consequence of something I had heard, I gave Vincent in custody—he was in the barge at that time—I went on board with the constable—I said to Vincent that I should be under the necessity of giving him in charge in consequence of his having been guilty of stealing lead from the wharf, in connexion with Holmes and Turnbull—he said, "You are doing wrong, Mr. Sparks"—I said, "I am very sorry for it, but from the evidence I have received I feel it my duty to do so; if I did not I should not be doing my duty to my employers"—he said, u I havi not seen these parties to-night"—I noticed the piles of silver lead that night—I did not observe them when I left, but I did when I came into the house—I found them in a very disorganised state; one of the piles, bearing</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Enthoven and Sons—on 6th February we were taking a pile of lead down, and five pigs fell off on each side—it was silver lead, similar to this—when I came the next morning I saw that on the side next the furnace there were only 2 left where there were 5 before—it was a very nice moonlight night—the 5 that I found next morning would be in the shade of the moon, those that were missing would have been in the bright light.</p>

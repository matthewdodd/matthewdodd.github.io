Liptraps, and might have gone that way to Houndsditch; they went on a few yards, and were knocking at a little brazier's shop, kept by one Newberry I think the name is; I observed each of them had something heavy wrapped up under their arms; I asked them what they had got there; they said, what was that to me; I told them I was an officer, and insisted upon seeing what they had; I immediately laid hold of them both; there is a public-house next door, I endeavoured to get them to the public-house, when the tall one, Davis, rescued himself from me, and got away, throwing down this solder, which weighs 26 lb. (produces it); I called out, stop thief! and he was brought back in a minute or two; I kept the other in custody in the public-house; he had this piece of solder wrapped up in his working jacket; this weighs 25 lb. (produces it); the largest piece, when I picked it up, was warm; they said they had been at work for Mr. Liptrap; Norman was very much frightened; I went the next day to Mr. Liptrap's, and found two ladles that correspond with the solder. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. They both told you where they had been at work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And told you who their masters were? - A. Yes, at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Oakes.) If these men had brought home the solder to your house, you would have weighed it, and accounted for it to Mess. Liptrap's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. I had not worked at Mr. Liptrap's for six years before, and I did not know the custom; I have taken it home to my master from other places.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Norman called four, and Davis five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>RICHARD COCKELL. I live at Enfield-highway. On Saturday the 27th of May, I was at the Rose and Crown public-house, Cambridge-heath; the prisoner was there. I went from there to the Black Boy public-house, and had some bread and cheese with a friend; he came in there, saying he had had no work for seven or eight weeks, and I treated him with some bread and cheese; at last he asked which way I was going home; I said Stamford-hill road; he said he would drive me; I said "If you drive me don't pick my pocket;" he said, "No, I should be sorry to rob you, when you have filled my belly" - he got into my cart and drove; I fell asleep, and he awoke me, saying, "There, you are at <placeName id="t18260622-32-crimeloc151">Stamford-hill</placeName>

In a very few minutes, before I got out of the cart, I found my pocket turned inside out, and my purse gone, with three half-sovereigns and six shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came into the Crown, and had part of two pots of beer; he asked me to drink; the publican refused him more beer, and said if he did not go he would fetch an officer, and asked me to try to get him away; I got him into the cart, took him to the Black Boy; we drank there; he asked me to drive him to Stamford-hill, which I did. I picked the purse up outside the public-house door.</p>

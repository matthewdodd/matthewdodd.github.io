I live in Houndsditch, and am in partnership with my brother Alfred—I have employed Manly Abrahams as errand boy for two or three years—while he was in our service we missed a variety of articles of various sorts of jewellery—more particularly one parcel which was completely stolen—I have an invoice of it in my pocket—they we coral and jet ear-rings and pins—I missed this on the 29th of August Abrahams being still in my service—in consequence of something I heard, I went to the premises of the prisoner Silkman with my brother, two policemen, and the boy—the parties who gave us information told</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City police-constable. I assisted in searching the prisoner's premises, at 18, Duke-street, Aldgate, and found all these things in the second floor front room—they were in the drawers, except those in the box—the others were scattered about the chest of drawers—Abrahams was with me—he did not point out the things—he pointed out the prisoner.</p>

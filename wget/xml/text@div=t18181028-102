I went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and found the articles stated in the indictment there-the prisoner was not at home. He was afterwards taken, and said he knew Travers, but never received the property of him. I told him he must have known that the property was mine-the prisoner was formerly a journeyman of mine, and knew Travers was my servant. I have seen the prisoner about my door several times, at one o'clock, when my men go to dinner.</p>

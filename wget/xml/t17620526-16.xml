On Monday last, in the afternoon about four or five o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, and ask'd to see some minionet lace. I gave her a piece into her hand of six yards seven eights. There were two ladies stood close by her, to whom I gave two pieces. I saw the prisoner roll the piece I gave her up in her hand, and put it under her cloak on the right hand side. After some little time, she desired me to shew her the piece I had shewed her before, which I had told her was 3 s. 6 d. per yard. I looked into the box again, tho' I at that time knew she had got it. I shewed her a piece that was coarser, and said it was the same I shewed her before. She desired I would cut her off half a quarter. I measured it, and was going to cut it off. She said, it did not signify, it was a pity to waste it, and desired me to weigh her two drachms of 12 d. thread. Then she asked me, if I sold pins. I said I did. She desired I would weigh her an ounce. She paid me three pence halfpeny for the thread and pins, made me a courtesy, and went out of the shop. When she was out of the shop I called her back again. She readily came back. I told her she had got a piece of lace which she had not paid for, and desired her to walk into the back shop. My uncle followed her as I went before her. He pick'd up the piece of lace from off the floor. I left her and my uncle together, and went forward and got a constable; who took the woman and lace into his custody, and she was carried to Wood street Counter. She had not been a yard from the place where she stood to cheapen the lace; that was very near the door, about four yards from the place where my uncle said he pick'd up the lace. [The lace produced, and deposed to by a mark that was upon it.]</p>

            . The prisoner was turned about a yard and a half out of the door when the prosecutor said, you have got some lace of mine. He brought her into the shop, and going cross the shop, to go into the back room, she dropped the lace, and I pick'd it up. Her gown drew over it: I am certain it did not lie there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>
               <p>H. Fabian. No, I did not; but, upon my oath, I believe it came from her. She was in a great tremble; a constable was sent for; she begg'd for mercy, and to be released, and said she had very great friends, and if we knew who she was we would not detain her. She owned she had taken the lace, and that there was a fate in it.</p>

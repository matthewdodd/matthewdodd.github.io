                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Clare, of No. 49, Commercial-road, Lambeth. On the morning of 27th April, about a quarter past 3 o'clock, I was awoke by a person named Jenkinson—I ran down stairs and found my parlour window open—I found that two dresses and a coat had been removed from behind the door to the centre table, and the tea-caddy and tea-pot from the sideboard, where they had been when I went to bed about a quarter past 10 o'clock the night before—I had fastened the window the night before, but had not put the shutters up—my husband and I occupy the back and front parlours—we were the last up in those room—we had lodgers in the house—we looked up the parlours, and took the keys with us stairs—when I came down in the morning I found the doors still locked as I had left them—the parlour doors open into the pas<lb></lb>sage—nobody else in the house has a key of those doors.</p>

On the morning of 27th April, about half past 3 o'clock, I got out of bed and looked out of window, and saw a man and woman at the corner of Cottage-place—I saw the man open Mr. Clare's window, and get into the room—we live opposite them—I do not know what became of the woman, she did not go in—I went down stairs, and made an alarm to my husband, who is watchman in Mr. Lett's timber yard, and then went with him over to Mr. Clare's—I threw up the window, which the man had closed again after getting in, and he jumped out of the window, and knocked me down backwards—the prisoner is the man, I am certain of him—he did not strike me, he knocked me down by jumping out to make his escape—my husband ran after him, calling "Stop thief!" but he could not catch him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left my lodging on the Thursday night previous to the robbery; I had no shoes, having sold them on the Wednesday; I was walking the streets all night, on account of a few words I had with my sister on the Thursday night; going along Stamford-street a nightman came up to me, took hold of me, and began to use me roughly, and when he let go of me, I went in one direction, and he in another;. as I stood at the corner of the street, the policeman came running along; he stood in the road for about three minutes, looking up the road, hearing the cry of "Step thief!"when he saw me, and said I must go with him; he took me back, and when about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's house, they cried out, "Bring him along, that is the man,"and they would have said the same of any person.</p>

I put the key in my pocket. It was quite dark when I went away; I had not the stable door in my view all the time; I had not seen it between eight and half past eight; if any one had entered the stable door between eight and half past eight o'clock, I was not in such a situation as I must have seen them. I returned to the stables at about a quarter after nine o'clock; I saw a light in the room up over the stables; my father was with me. We found the door open. My father went in, and stood at the door; I heard my father call out Bob, two or three times; he meant the postillion; I heard an answer made in a strange voice. My father then came out, and locked the door; we have two keys to the stable door; I had one, and my father the other. My father told me to go for assistance; I went to the ale-house, and brought assistance; Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie came with me. When I got back to the stable, my father told Wright to take care of the stable, and he would go for more persons; he did so. On his return, they opened the door, and went in; he went up stairs, Mr. Wright, Mr. Mackenzie, and my father went up. Two or three days afterwards, I found a crow and two skeleton-keys in the litter of the horses in one of the stals; we clean out the litter once a week; we put fresh straw over the old, and so go on for about a week. It was light when I locked the door.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Palmer, 199, Oxford-street, he is a coach-harness plater. I remember the evening of the 17th of May; I was sent by my master to Lord Darlington's stables, to take two territs; it was about nine o'clock when I got there, it was pitch dark; not knowing the stable, I hallooed out at the end of the mews, and was answered by a woman; I asked which was Lord Darlington's stables, and she told me they were the last on the left hand. In consequence of her information, I found out the stable; I tried the stable door to go up stairs, and found it fastened; I stopped there about four or five minutes; at last I could not make any one hear, and I hallooed out very loud boy, and a postillion answered me from the window, and I perceived by the light of a lamp opposite, that he was in his shirt sleeves, and he said, he was getting into bed, and could not come down, but told me where the coachman was. He sent me to the coachman at the public-house; instead of going to the Golden Lion, I went to the Red Lion, and left the territs there for the coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was quite pitch dark. I never returned to the stable after having gone to the public-house; all was quiet when I was at the stable; it had gone nine I rather think when I got there; it was four or five minutes after, and I returned straight home from the public-house, it was not a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after nine. Who had been at the stable between seven and eight o'clock, I don't know. All I know is that the door was locked at the time I was there; there was no lock outside; I know that, because I felt; I could not see. I felt the door, and felt a little staple, and put my finger through it, and shook the door, and found it was locked inside. The postillion was on the inside of the room.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. I found this staple by feeling; for I could not see. I left the two territs for the coachman at the public house; there was two coachmen, only I took the territs to the wrong public-house.</p>

               <p>Re-cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Can a person now, or could he at the time of this burglary, have gone by any internal communication, from the place where the prisoners are supposed to have been found, into the house - A. The communication which originally existed, was walled up then, and is now. A person could not have entered the room over the stables where we found the prisoners, from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoners have gone from the place where they are supposed to have been found, to where your people slept over the coach-house - A. No. The reason the communication was nailed up, was because his Lordship let part of the stables.</p>
               <p>COURT. Although there is no internal communication, yet the place where the prisoners were found, is under one roof with the place where you and some other of your master's servants sleep - A. Yes; it is all the same building.</p>

               <p>Examined by the COURT. When I went up the ladder, the lesser man, Gow, said, coachman, you have got us; we will give ourselves up to you; I am in distress.

               <p>MR. REYNOLDS, for the prisoners, objected, that the part into which the prisoners had broken, was not part of the dwelling-house, because whatever communication there might have been originally, it was clear that there was none now, either with the place where the servants slept, or with the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSHAM, contra contended, that it was under the protection of the dwelling-house, and in support of his argument, cited the case of the "King against Brown, in the 1st East. p. 493; in that case the premises of the prosecution consisted of a stable, cow-house, cottage, and barn, which were not enclosed, nor had any internal communication with each other; the barn was the part broken and entered, in the night time, and the prisoner was found guilty, subject to the opinion of the Twelve Judges, who after a consideration of the case, declared the conviction to be right.</p>

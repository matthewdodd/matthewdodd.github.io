               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before you lost your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she? - She did flop work when she pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she work with you? - Sometimes she did and sometimes she did not, she goes from one mistress to another when she pleases.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the cloth cloak? - This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in your house or in your employment at the time you lost it? - She came into the house and asked me for a little work, the 2d of January, which was last Friday was a week, and she took my cloak away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cloak? - It was on a table just by the door. I happened to want to go to the warehouse and looked for the cloak, and instantly missed it. I was going to the warehouse that minute, to Mr. Darby's, in Gracechurch-street; I missed the cloak as soon as she was gone out of the room. I went after her instantly and catched her with it in her apron; I pulled her apron on one side and see my cloak, and I said, what a wicked hussey you are to take my cloak when you know how hard I work for my living, and she said it was none of my cloak, she had borrowed it. She knows it is my cloak very well, and I know it very well; the lining is tore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She agreed to make it up with the officer for two shillings.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I told her I would not hurt her if I could any way help it; if I could any way get her off when I went before the justice, I would; and when I went before the justice I said, as long as I have got my cloak again, if you think proper, she may go about her business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I borrowed the cloak of Mrs. Nash.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is not true, indeed it is not.</p>

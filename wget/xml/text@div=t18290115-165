            ; the prisoner never was in my service - she came to see my servant on Sunday, the 30th of November; I had been writing in the kitchen, and had changed a sovereign - I had put 16s. into my purse, and left it on the books in which I had been writing; I saw the prisoner come in, and go down into the kitchen; I afterwards rang for my servant, to put coals on the fire, which she did, and soon after the prisoner and she went out to church; about seven o'clock, I then recollected my purse had been left in the kitchen; I went down, and it was gone; when my servant came home, I spoke to her, and got the prisoner taken up, on the 8th of December - the purse was found in her possession; I know it because it came from Paris a short time ago.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD. I took the prisoner on the 8th of December, and found this purse in a pocket, in a bundle, under the bed, which the prisoner owned; she denied it at first, but afterwards said she took it, with 16s. in it, through great distress, that she had lived upon the money, and the servant had nothing to do with it.</p>

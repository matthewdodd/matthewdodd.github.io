               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Does your master usually fell fowls that die a natural death, to be eaten? - A. Yes; whatever comes to market, we always fell it at some price or other, be what it will.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on Saturday, they were in a basket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on Monday, they were in a bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this sowl with the spur off, would not any other fowl that had the spur taken out, look just the same? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it is a common thing, in order to make a hard, tough old cock, look like a fine young fowl? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And because this spur was bloody, you will swear to it? - A. I swear to all the fifteen, that was the quantity that was lost, and the quantity that was found.</p>
               <p>Q. But, suppose other fifteen fowls had been found, would you have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think no other man smothers fowls besides your master? - A. He does not smother them, it is the country people that smother them, and send them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it that there are two Counts in the indictment, one laying them to be the property of Mr. and the other of Mrs. Strickland? - A. They are separate traders, he is a salesman in butter, with a partner, and she carries on the sole trade of the poultry for herself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William John Cormack, a sales<lb></lb>man, in Covent-garden. On the 6th of June I saw the prisoner carrying away four pots of plants in his arms from the side of my master's conserva<lb></lb>tory—I followed him as soon as I could, but he was gone out of sight—I returned, stopped about a quarter of an hour, and was called by Terry, and saw the prisoner with five other plants in his arms—he asked the price of them—I charged him with stealing them and the others—he said if I would go to the market below I should see his friend, who would convince me he had not stolen them—the first that I saw him take have not been found, but I know he did not put them down again, for I saw him take them below—I did not stop him the first time, as I thought he was a person who had a shop below, but I went down, and saw he was not the person—he had got the second pots under his arm, but Terry saw him before I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Cormack. I was in the shop on the 6th of June, and heard a noise in the conservatory—I went in, and saw the prisoner with five plants in his arms—he had taken them off the stage, and was going towards the door—he was about two steps from the stage—I called to him, and asked what he was going to do with them—he turned round, and asked me how much they were a pot.</p>

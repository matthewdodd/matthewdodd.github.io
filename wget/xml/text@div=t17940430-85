               <p>Q. Did you know the deaf and dumb man before? - I never saw him before, I cannot find out where he came from, nor what his name is; he told me that the man had been robbed by some women in <placeName id="t17940430-85-crimeloc456">New Gravel-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q.Who pointed out the house? - The deaf and dumb man, and the lad. Then the lad he described one of the prisoners particularly; I then desired him to go with the old man again up into the same house we had come from and I would enquire into the business; in about two minutes afterwards the two prisoners; Burn and Kent, and another that was discharged before the magistrate, all came up to the house, and I then took them into custody; the man, as soon as I took them to the Virginia Planter, he began to rave and point at them; and the lad likewise pointed to the prisoner Kent, that she was the person that hauled the bag off the man's shoulder; in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner Mead, came to see them, I asked her what she did there? and the deaf and dumb man immediately ran to her, she said to me immediately, I did not rob him, it was Burn and Kent that robbed him, I will shew you where the bag was. Burn and Kent were there at the time secure. I went down and found the bag on the landing place of the one pair of stairs in the same house where he pointed out, not in any room; as soon as he saw the bag, he ran to it directly, and there was a particular coat that he held up, and he made signs that it was his own. I searched all the prisoners and found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he express himself? - He pointed to Kent that she took something off his back, and he made motion that he lost money; we shewed him a shilling, and he marked 33, and pointed to a yellow button. We shewed him half a guinea, and he put his finger on it, and held up one; and he made motion that he lost a quantity of halfpence; he cannot read nor write.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Mead. I was looking out of my own window, Good Friday, between seven and eight, and I heard the cry of murder, and I went up to see what was the matter, and after that I went up to these women to know if they wanted any thing, and Mr. Cooke took me into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burn. This man met this woman and me, and we went up together, and I went out for a pot of beer, and before I could come back again they were crying out murder! and there was a great concourse of people.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 34). On 31st Jan., I was employed to watch the premises of Mr. Waring, a tanner, of Spa Road, Bermondsey, part of which are in the occupation of Mr. Barrow—I placed myself in Mr. Barrow's house, and could see any persons who entered Mr. Waring's pre<lb></lb>mises—about 10 o'clock I saw Tobin and Vernon go to Mr. Waring's pre<lb></lb>mises—they took the direction of a shed which is there, and in a few minutes I lost sight of them; I saw Tobin alone, about twenty minutes afterwards, going out of the yard into Spa Road—I saw nothing more of him—between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon a man, named Butler, brought a truck there; it was drawn through the gateway, into Mr. Barrow's yard—he was followed by Vernon and Tobin, who shortly afterwards came out of the yard and separated—I proceeded to the end of the yard, and saw the truck, which had been taken in empty by Butler, loaded with hide pieces—I saw no more till about 6 o'clock, when I saw Tobin, Davis, and Broderick stan<lb></lb>ding at the corner of Mr. Barrow's gateway; they remained there a few minutes, and all three went up the yard—in two or three minutes Brode<lb></lb>rick and Davis brought the truck out and went up Spa Road, towards Grange Road—I lost sight of Tobin, but I believe he was in the yard—when they got into Grange Road, I took hold of Broderick, and said, "Where have you brought these things from that you have got in the truck"—he said, "We have nothing to do with it, we have been employed by a tall man"—I took him into custody, and placed him, for security, in a butcher's shop; and Smith, who was with me, took Davis—I then went into Spa Road, and met Tobin close by Mr. Barrow's premises—I said, "I want you to go with me on a charge of stealing some hide pieces belonging to Mr. Waring"—he said, "Do not talk to me about hide pieces, I know nothing about them; speak to my foreman, Mr. M'Laughlin"—I then took him into custody, and took him to where the other prisoners were—they were then all taken to the station, and Butler also—when the charge was stated against Butler at the station, he said, "I will tell the truth, all I know about it; Tobin gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take the cart into the yard, and after it was loaded he wanted me to draw it out; but being told that something was wrong, I would not have anything to do with it;" the others said nothing in reply to that—I weighed the pieces I found in the truck; they weighed 2cwt. 2qrs. 18 lbs.—there was one bundle tied up, and the rest were loose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner, and occupy premises adjoining Mr. Wa<lb></lb>ring's tanyard, where there are pits for soaking hides and a shed. His pre<lb></lb>mises are divided from mine by a fence, and there is a gate from his pre<lb></lb>mises into the main road, which was fastened; there was no work going on, the frost had stopped it—I was on the premises on the Saturday and saw Tobin there, who I knew to be for some time in Mr. Waring's employ, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I had seen him there frequently, and had often gone through the yard—he came in through my premises, in consequence of the gate being fastened, and got over into Mr. Waring's premises, by jumping over the fence; there is tan on one side and some hides on the other, so that it was easy to get over—I saw him and another man who I had never seen before, get over in the morning; I went into the yard and heard the rattling of <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi> in the shed, but could not see anything—Tobin came and spoke to me when I was about the centre of the yard—he said that he had the key—I said that I had a great deal of property in the place, and I did not think anybody ought to go in who thought proper—he said that he came for 3 or 4 cwt of hide pieces, for samples, which were to be taken as soon as the cart came, and asked me if I had any objection to their bringing them by that road—I said, "No," and he went to the shed again—the other man must have been in the shed at that time, be<lb></lb>cause I heard him rattling the <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi> while Tobin was talking to me—Tobin returned to the shed and remained about twenty minutes; he then passed through my premises again and went out—when he had gone I still heard the noise of a man working in the shed for nearly an hour—I left the yard and returned between 2 and 3 o'clock—I then went to Mr. Waring's shed, and found two bundles of hide pieces tied up on the floor, but did not in<lb></lb>terfere with them—between 3 and 4 o'clock Tobin and another man came</p>

               <p>through the yard; I thought it was Butler, I am sure it was not the man who came with him first—they both went to the shed, and I observed them bringing a bale of pieces towards the top of the ladder on the upper floor—Tobin came down to the foot of the ladder and the other pushed the pieces after him—the other man attempted to lift it on his back, but it was too heavy, I suppose, and he dropped it—I afterwards saw the two bales brought over the fence; two of Mr. Acker's men, who has a, lease of the premises adjoining, assisted them and lifted the bales over—I did not see the other man at that time, I was in the adjoining premises and could not have seen if I had been there—they were loaded into a truck that was standing in my yard near the fence, by Acker's men—I was engaged on my own business at the other part of the yard and did not see who was assist<lb></lb>ing them—I did not see the truck moved away, as I left the yard, but I saw it at nearly 6 o'clock—there were three men standing outside the gate, but I cannot swear to them, it was nearly dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Waring. Tobin was in my employ, but I discharged him a fortnight before this, when the frost set in—I gave him no authority to take these skins; he had no right to be on the premises—I was out of town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's Defence.</hi> I was employed by Tobin to drive the cart to the top of the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Vernon's Defence.</hi> I was not on the premises; I went to Spa Road between 3 and 4 o'clock, but was not there five minutes; I am very often up and down the road, but was never on the premises that day at all.</p>

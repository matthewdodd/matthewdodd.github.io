I am a bricklayer, of 20, Brook Street, Hammersmith—on 17th May, about 11.10, I was in the Great Western Boad, going home—I received a blow which knocked me down, and as I got up I sat the prisoner, but did not see his face—I received another blow, and my watch was snatched, but I saved a portion of my guard—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, and I believe I lost sight of him because it was dark—I saw him in custody two or three minutes afterwards—this is my watch—I gave 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

I am a labourer, of 38, Great Si Andrew's Street, Bloomsbury—on 17th May I saw two men larking in the street, and after I had passed, one of them said, "He has got my watch," and out of them ran away—I chased him, caught him without losing sight of him, and threw him on the ground—it was the prisoner—something went away from his hand, and a constable came up and took him, and found this watch and chain a yard or two from him.</p>

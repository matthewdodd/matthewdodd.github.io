                  </hi>. I live in Granville Grove, Deptford—the prisoner was staying in the house; he did not lodge there—he came there with the intention of being married—he caused a great deal of dis<lb></lb>turbance between himself and the person he was living with—my wife took her in as a friend, as I believe she was in trouble—on 1st December the prisoner promised to leave at 12.45, before I came home from work, and said he would not let the woman cause any disturbance—when I came home I found him sitting on a chair before the fire—I said "You have not done as you promised; you have not left"—he said "No; and I don't intend '—there were two bundles by the side of him, and I took one in each hand to remove out of the room—I got to the door with them, and he rushed at me—I put him back with my right hand, setting a bundle down to push him back, and before I could get the bundle again I felt a terrific blow on the side of my head as I was stooping to pick the bundle up again—it was rather dark (near 5 o'clock), and I could not see how it was done—we closed; I thought I had him by the throat, but instead of that I pinned his right arm against his side, and I felt several small blows strike me five or six times on the back of my head—he got away from me; my rightarm was disabled, and he slipped from my grasp and got to the staircase—I went after him and caught him on the stairs; he was trying to get down, and I was trying to hold him—we got to the front door; he had a large hammer in his hand; he slung it over his head, and said "Now come on, I will settle you"—the constable came at that exact moment, and received on his right hand the blow that would have fallen on my head or arm—I</p>

               <p>then took the hammer from his hand and charged him, and I went to a doctor and had my head and arm examined—the hammer was mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 343). On 1st December I was called to Granville Grove, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner rushed ont of the door first, and the prosecutor came afterwards, bleeding—the prisoner had a hammer in his hand, and was swinging it about, saying "Come on"—I took it from him—he said, "I gave him a slight tap"—I examined the hammer—there was a hole in the hat which the prosecutor was wearing—this is the hammer and the hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a dent in the hat now—the prosecutor was covered with blood—he had his coat off—they were both sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 120, High Street, Deptford—on 1st September about 7 p.m. I was called to examine the prosecutor—I found a wound on the left side of his head and two bruises, both contused and incised—they might have been caused by a blow from a hammer like this—it is always uncertain how these wounds will turn out—I saw him the following morning, and I then thought the wound would be serious—his circulation was excited, bis pulse rapid, and he had a certain amount of giddiness—the symptoms passed over, and he went on very well—he had a bruise on the right arm—it must have been a heavy blow—it might have been caused by a weapon of this kind, but I should think through the coat or shirt-sleeves, not directly on the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He said he would turn me out. I said "You have no cause to do that; I will go quietly if you will wait." He said he would not wait, he would fetch the police. He caught up the bundle, and I caught hold of the hammer. I did not know what it was at the time. I gave him a tap on the arm, and that was all I did.</p>

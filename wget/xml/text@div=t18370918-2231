On the 29th of August about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the Lewisham road with this bag—he passed me, I followed him, and asked what he had in the bag—he said, "A few turnips and some apples"—I asked where be got them—he said from Waltonby (this was twenty miles from Waltonby)—I put my hand into the bag and felt the ducks—I asked where he got them—he said his father-in-law gave them to him—they were warm and said he left Waltonby the day before.</p>

I am bailiff to Mr. John Green of Eltham, I have examined these ducks, and know them by marks on the feathers they are both exactly alike—my master had ducks about two years old and we missed them the day the man came to tell us he had found some—these are just like Mr. Green's ducks—I can swear to them to the best of my knowledge—I have no doubt they are the same.</p>

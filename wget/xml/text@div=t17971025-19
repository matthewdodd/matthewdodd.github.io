               <p>ISABELLA GALLOWAY sworn. - I am the wife of James Galloway: On the 28th of September, the prisoner came to our house, and pretended that he was an uncle of Mr. Galloway's; he said, he had made a very handsome fortune abroad, he had got a ship loaded with bale goods, and he wanted to do something very handsome for his friends; he said, Mr. Galloway was his nephew, and had a right to a share of it; he drank his tea, and part of three bottles of wine; I lit him up to bed, and locked him in, and put the key in my pocket; he wanted to see what fort of a bed I had got to lie on, for he was sure it was very mean; in the morning he wanted to borrow a guinea of me, I would not lend him a guinea; some time after, somebody wanted change for two dollars, he snatched the two dollars out of my hand, and refused to give them me again; he went into the bar and took a bottle of brandy; I sent to Bow-street for a constable, the constable took him into the parlour, and searched him, and found the dollars on him.</p>

             sworn. - I searched him, and found two dollars in his right-hand pocket. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Galloway. I cannot swear to the dollars; I did not mark them, but he was not out of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say, when you charged him with having taken them? - A. He said, he would not give them me, when he did, he would give them me with a very handsome present; the next time I asked him, he said, he would see me d-d first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe at that time, that he would make you a present? - A. No; I told him, I was sure he was an impostor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very-much in liquor; I don't know any thing of it, my brother was just come home from the West-Indies, and I was so overjoyed at seeing him again, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He was a little in liquor, but not insensible of what was passing.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was you at this time?</p>
               <p>Pearce. At my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear any thing about the candlesticks till that night?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I doubt you have not told us all the truth yet?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I have told you all that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not desire to entrap you, but tell the whole truth; you have not yet told the same story you told before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Pearce. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you watched at one door and they at another, at Mr. Coxe's door?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Girdler that you watched at the ale-house door?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you describe them, whether tall or short?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them whether short ones or tall ones?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So then I am to understand now, Mrs. Pearce, that before the Justice you did not own being concerned in the robbery yourself?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No; no farther than having the cloth up in my room on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear Masey say that

               <p>Pearce. On Saturday in the court he was coming up to my room to breakfast, he said she was going to Lyons.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you?</p>
               <p>Pearce. Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had your mother for selling the linen?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I believe nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you cut of the candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Pearce. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand from you, that you was not in the street upon the watch at the time they went up into this house to take these candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No; I was not up in the room all day long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Masey say any thing about the linen or candlesticks upon Saturday night?</p>

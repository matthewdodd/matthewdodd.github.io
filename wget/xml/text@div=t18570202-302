                  </hi>. I am single, and am a dressmaker, of No. 8, Frederick-street, Regent's-park. About 30 minutes past 7 o'clock on the evening of 29th Dec. a friend called on me, and I went with her down into the back kitchen, and about five minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the back parlour, and then we all of us heard a drawer drawn out very heavily—my friend's sister and a young man, a lodger, were also there—the young man went up stairs first, and we followed—we had got nearly to the top of the kitchen stairs with a light, and quite in sight of the parlour door, when the prisoner rushed out of the back parlour, and turned round upon us—he looked very violent, but the young man called out, "What do you want here?"—he said, "It is all right," sprang to the street door, went out, and slammed it after him, but he had secured it from shutting by the bolt—my lodger Robinson ran out, and called, "Police! stop thief!" and in a few minutes a policeman brought the prisoner back, and I recognized him immediately—I swear he is the man—he must have entered with a skeleton key, for I had closed the door five minutes before—the front parlour, which the prisoner entered, was left wide open—it had not been locked—it was the back parlour he sprung from—two drawers in the back parlour were open—nothing was taken out of the place, but the things were got ready to be taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the house of the last witness. I was in the back kitchen—I got up the stairs first with a light, and saw the prisoner—he ran out, but was brought back in two minutes, and I knew him—I lost sight of him scarcely a second, while he turned a corner.</p>

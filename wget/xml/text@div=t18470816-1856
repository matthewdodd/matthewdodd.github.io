                  </hi> I am seventeen years old. In July last I lived at the prisoner's house in Keate-street, Spitalfields, and had been living there about four months. I know the prisoner, and also Mary Ann Sullivan, whom he was living with—on Sunday night, the 25th of July, I came back to the house in Keate-street—there was nobody at home—I waited at the door till the prisoner came up—he and Mary Ann Sullivan came up together—Sullivan had been drinking, but not so much as the prisoner—when the door was opened, I went in first, and the prisoner and Sullivan went into the parlour on the ground-floor—I heard the prisoner say something to Sullivan—I could not understand the words—Sullivan said, with an oath, that she would not live with the prisoner any longer—he did not say anything to that, but took up a white-handled knife off the table, and attempted to stab her—he said nothing when he took up the knife—he did not say anything till he had said it down again—he took it up in a passion with the intention of stabbing her—he cut her hand—he was going to put it somewhere about her neck, she put her hand up to save herself, and the knife went across her hand—they were close together—the point of the knife was nearest her throat—he had the handle in his hand—if she had not raised her hand the knife must either have gone to the front or side of her neck—her hand bled very much—the prisoner threw the knife on the table, and said he would do for her—at that time she was stand<lb></lb>ing in the passage at the door of the room—she did not fall down—she cried out, "Help" and "Murder," and told the prisoner that he had cut her hand—he then struck her, and knocked her down in the passage—I called the po<lb></lb>liceman. White.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman H</hi> 210.) I heard cries of "Murder" as I went round my beat on the night in question—I went round a portion of my beat, and met Jackson half-way—she took me to the house—I found Mary Ann Sullivan lying down on her back, or more properly speaking on her side, with her hand up, bleeding profusely—her clothes were saturated with blood, and the floor as well, literally covered—the prisoner was about three feet from her—I asked her in his hearing what was the matter—she said that he had done it, that he had stabbed her—the prisoner said he might have kicked her, or he might have struck her, but he had not stabbed her—he said he did not use a knife—I got some assistance, and gave him into the custody of another officer, got a <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>, bound up the wound, and took the woman to the hospital—I took the prisoner next day to Worship-street—as we were going along, he said, well, perhaps it was a good job, for he had no doubt if they were together, that he should be hung for her.</p>

                  </hi> I was acting as house-surgeon at the London Hospital when Sullivan was brought there—I found an incised wound on the little finger of the left hand—it began on the inside of the finger and went round—it went to the bone—it was a wound that must have been inflicted by some sharp instrument; a small sized knife would have done it—supposing a thrust was made at a person with a weapon of that sort, and the hand was suddenly raised, the injury I have described might have been inflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean a thrust, as if by the point of a sword, that the injury would be inflicted in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the hand were placed in that position to prevent a sword or knife coming—the would appeared as if made by the edge of the blade, not by the point—it was on the inside of the little finger of the left hand, at the bottom of the finger, close to the hand—it is just likely that such an injury might have been inflicted by the party seizing the knife and making a grasp at it—I do not think it could be caused by grasping the knife, because the would extended farther round—it is just possible it might—if the knife was grasped, and then it was drawn from the hand, it might be drawn round—the wound went from the inside to the out<lb></lb>side of the little finger.</p>

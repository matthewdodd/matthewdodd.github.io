I am the wife of Thomas Elwood—we keep the Foun<lb></lb>tain, in the Broadway, Deptford—the prisoner lived in my service—she came to me in Feb. and left on the 18th of April—while she was with me I missed a pepper-box, a handkerchief, and four glasses—I discharged the pri<lb></lb>soner in consequence—this is the pepper-box and the glasses—they are my husband's—this handkerchief is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, of High-street, Deptford. On 23rd Feb., about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked my apprentice to show her some satin ribbon—the box was put before her to select the colour and width—she purchased one yard, at three farthings a yard—the apprentice cut the ribbon, and was in the act of putting the box back, when the prisoner said, "Stay a minute, my little dear; I will take one more yard," and while he was reaching for the yard-stick I saw her take one piece of ribbon out—she laid it on the counter for five minutes, covered with her hand, till she got an opportunity of putting it under her cuff—I saw her draw the cuff down, and take it up—I told her to step to the other end of the shop—I said I was very sorry, but I saw her take and conceal a piece of ribbon—she said I was a good-for-nothing fellow to accuse a lady—I told her to draw off her right-hand cuff, and the ribbon dropped out.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 23rd Feb., the prisoner came into my master's shop, and asked me to show her some satin ribbons—I did, and she said she would take one yard at three farthings—I cut that off, and she said, "Stop a minute, I will have another yard"—I turned round to get the stick, and then it is supposed she took the ribbon—I saw my master look sharp at me, and after I put the box away he asked her to step up to the top of the shop—he said he was very sorry, but he saw her take a piece of satin ribbon—she denied it—he told her if she looked up her right-hand cuff she would find the ribbon—she took the cuff off, and found the ribbon.</p>

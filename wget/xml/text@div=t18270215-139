The prisoner occasionally worked for us; as he was going out I suspected him, as his hat hung over his head - I followed him, took it off, and three skins were in it; I gave him in charge - he got away, but was secured, and two more were found in his trousers; he said, at the watch-house, that we had not paid him, and he was determined to pay himself; we had lent him 2l. to go into business, and he was to work it out.</p>

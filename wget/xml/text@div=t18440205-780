                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 196.) On Monday morning the 8th Jan., about half-past two o'clock, I was on duty in Church-street, Deptford, and saw the prisoner crossing Church-street, on the footpath of the railway, towards town, with a large bundle at hit back—being an unseasonable hour I went after him and asked what he had in the bundle—he said that he was a servant, that he had just left his situation, and had got his dirty clothes; that he had met with a friend and had taken a glass—I asked if they were his own—he said, "Yes"—I took him to the station, and found the bundle contained two live pheasants, four live pigeons, two dead ones, seven dead fowls, and two dead ducks, and no dirty clothes—I showed the things to Waterhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Col. Thomas Perronet Thompson—he had some pheasants, pigeons, fowls, and ducks, safe on the evening of the 7th Jan.—I missed them between eight and nine o'clock on the 9th—I have since seen them in Vincent's hands, and know them to be the same—they were kept in the stable and loft—the stable was not locked.</p>

Thompson had pheasants while you were in his ser<lb></lb>vice—the fowls used to be locked in the hen-house, and the key taken to a drawer kept by young Mr. Thompson—I can identify all the poultry as my master's—I know the pheasants by a ring round their necks, and the cock pheasant had lost its tail—they are English ring pheasants—I am quite sure of the fowls and ducks—the yard-gate was open till ten o'clock—I do not know whether it was locked after that.</p>

               <p>heath I saw a person drop something from his shoulder and walk away towards Greenwich; I went up, and it was the bag produced, containing the pheasants and poultry; I brought it on through Greenwich, intending to give it to a policeman, and when I got near Deptford station the policeman called to me, and thinking he might suppose I had stolen the things I told a falsehood, not knowing what to do. If I had intended to escape I could easily have done so, as I was thirty yards from him.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you call the watch? - I did; I followed up the alley a little way: I found him on the Tuesday night in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your things again? - Yes, I got my handkerchief, he had pawned it; he said if I would not hurt him, he would send for his mother and get it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Did you promise not to prosecute him if he would give it you? - I never mentioned no such a word.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he throw you down? - He took and threw me down on my back upon the kirb stone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the woman nor the handkerchief neither.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - It was darkish, it was underneath a lamp: I will swear he took it.</p>

               <p>Can you be sure to his person in seeing him so short a time on a dark night? - It was underneath a lamp, I am positive it was him.</p>

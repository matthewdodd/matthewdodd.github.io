            . Q. You live with Mr. Cook. - A. Yes, as servant; I have lived with him fifteen years. His house is the corner of <placeName id="t18080217-28-crimeloc157">North row, Park lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Cook's christian name. - A. Edward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 30th of January any thing happening. - A. Yes, on the 30th of January I was sitting in the kitchen, I heard some noise on the leads.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that lead over the kitchen. - A. Yes, it was ten minutes before twelve; I heard the noise over my head; I did not get up directly; the noise was as if a person was cutting; I sat about two seconds; then I heard the noise repeated again, as if a person was ripping.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the kitchen did the noise seem to come from. - A. The first time I heard it, it came from the first window to the right; when I heard it the second time, the noise appeared more closer to me in the centre. I waited till my fellow servant came down stairs; I spoke to him; I went out of our hall door into North row; that is the side of the house. I went round the corner facing of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the iron rails are. - A. Yes, it is facing of the kitchen windows. When I came there, my fellow servant lifted me up on the railing; it was so dark I could not see; at first I thought I saw something, but it was so dark and rainy I could not; I stopped where I was; my fellow servant turned the corner, he saw a watchman coming across the road, he had a light with him; he stopped the watchman. In consequence of what he said I went to him, and we took the light from him; I helped my fellow servant up, and the light was held up; directly he saw the prisoner; I saw the prisoner come over the wall; he come down on the ground, he had a very great fall.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a person fall. - A. I did not see him; directly he fell he got up again, he turned round and ran away; I pursued him; he never was out of my sight, we stepped step for step; I struck him three or four times, I knocked him down and then took him; I brought him back to my master before I took him to the watchhouse. After I went to the watchhouse with the prisoner I went upon the leads; there was four feet and a half of lead gone from the first window on the right.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the window where you described that you heard the noise first. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the lead lay. - A. It lay by the sky light, it was fixed over the window, and that lead was gone, and the lead of the second window ripped ready to carry away; there are three windows; the whole of the area is covered with lead.</p>
               <p>Court There is no mention made in the indictment of ripping, only of stealing; confine yourself to stealing of lead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. How much lead was gone entirely. - A. About four feet and a half in length and two feet in width; the other laid at the other window; it was loose, it was not rolled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the other lead. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the lead in the course of the day. - A. Yes, they were perfect in the course of the day; it was perfect when I saw it; I was on the leads, and the other servants were out upon it in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. As the prisoner was running away did you hear any thing fall. - A. Just as I seized the prisoner I perceived him searching his pocket, I thought he was going to use some violence to me; directly afterwards I saw him throw something away; I marked the spot where I took the prisoner; I searched the place in about half an hour afterwards; I found a knife, this is the knife (producing it). I found it just at the place where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you observe whether the lead was cut or torn. - A. It was cut, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of some other lead, was that cut. - A. The nails were picked out, it was not cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At Marlborough street, he said that he had not, nor any of the servants, been on the leads that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect on the 30th of January, whether you had been on the leads or not - A. I had business to do there; the door opens level with the parlour to go out upon the leads.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out upon the leads that morning. A. Yes, I was there seeing the soldiers go by; if there had been any lead taken away I must have seen it. I never said any such thing at Marlborough street.</p>

            , and going out of doors. - A. Yes, I lifted him up on the rails, I called the watchman and had his light; I saw the prisoner go up over Mr. Cook's water closet; I did not see his face, but I saw the size of the man; he got from thence to the wall into North row.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Davis overtook him. - A. Davis and I were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person whom Davis had taken brought to your master's house. - A. He was brought to the door, there was a light in the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner that person. - A. Yes. I took hold of him, and never let him go till he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day had you been on the leads. - A. I cannot say that I had; I had been in the parlour, but I cannot be positive that I had looked at the windows; as soon as we had been to the watch-house I went out upon the leads to examine it; I found the lead from one frame gone, that looks in North row. It was about four feet in length.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the other window. - A. The lead was loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any one person there. - A. We met a person at the corner; as we went round he went towards Oxford road.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that when you got up on the rails you saw the prisoner; do you mean to say you saw a man like the prisoner - should you have known him again if he had not been taken. - A. Yes, I should; I took particular notice of his hat and size; I should have known him again.</p>

At last one of them catched hold of me, and said I was one of the lads; they were before me first, and running; I got before them.</p>

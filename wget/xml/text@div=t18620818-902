                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, residing at the Metropolitan Chambers, Albert-street, Mile-end—on the night of 12th August, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was in the Whitechapel-road, when I received a blow on my left jaw which knocked me down—I received another on the left shoulder when I was down, immediately after—I have been deprived of the use of my arm ever since—I turned round at the time the second blow struck me, and saw a piece of a crutch fall off my shoulder—I saw the prisoner about to his me again, and I caught it on my right arm, and it broke on my arm; it broke in three pieces—I followed the prisoner up—at this time the crowd was collecting pretty fast—I found I could not handle him myself, and I sung out for the police, and he was taken into custody—the glands of my neck are affected, and all the teeth in my left jaw loosened—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—I knew nothing about him till the blows descended on me—I cannot tell whether he had mis<lb></lb>taken me for any other man—I heard him say, going to the station-house, "You did not think a cripple could fetch you down as easy"—when the policeman had him in charge I asked him what was the reason he had used the violence, and he made no reply—I went to the police-court, and the doctor attended me there—I have been under surgical care.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on the 12th, charged with violently assaulting this man with his crutch—this is the crutch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up at the prisoner's feet—the prosecutor was bleeding very much indeed; he seemed as if he had been seriously injured—the prisoner said to him, "I suppose you thought a cripple could not fetch you down, but I will let you know all about it when we get to the station"—he did not explain anything at the station, not the least.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at 7, Spital-square—I went down to Leman-street station to see the prosecutor on the 12th—I found a severe lacerated wound on the left side of the lower lip, completely dividing it; also a contused wound on the left shoulder, another on the lower end of the right forearm, and another on the back of the hand—he had been severely wounded, and had lost a considerable quanity of blood—the jaw was not injured, although it quite divided it—this crutch would produce such wounds—I have seen the prosecutor occasionally since—he is still without the use of his left arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> As I was proceeding down Whitechapel, a man came and took my crutch from me, and delivered the blow to the prosecutor. He called on the crowd to surround him, and give him in charge. He then ran away, and laid the crutch down at my feet. The next morning at the police-court a man swore he saw me do it; and the second day that woman made her appearance, and swore that I was the man who did it. I have lost the greater part of my foot, and am a cripple.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Thames Police Court—on the 28th May a woman named Sarah Legust was brought up in custody on a charge of assaulting Sarah Cronin—there was a remand until the 4th June and on that day Browning was called for the defence—he tendered himself and was accepted, and he gave evidence—I took down his evidence—he was sworn—I produce my notes of his evidence, and they are correct (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I live at 43, Martha Street—I am a shoemaker—I recollect Monday, the 25th May—I saw her (Cronin) at 11.30 at night—I heard cries of police and murder from her—I heard her say 'Will no one go for a con<lb></lb>stable, I am bleeding to death'—I looked out of window—I saw the complainant streaming with blood from a cut of the eye—she vowed vengeance against her husband for doing it—she then turned on the land-lord saying 'he has only got one lung, and I will tear that out of him'—I did not send for a constable, I went to bed,"The case was remanded until the next day, and on that day Browning was recalled, and he said in reply to questions by the magistrate "It was on the Monday night I saw this,</p>

I am the wife of Henry Cronin, and live in Cable Street—on Wednesday evening, 27th May, a person named Legust assaulted me, about 9.15, at the bottom of Dean Street—she ran behind me and struck me with a street door key on the eyebrow, and called me a b----sow—it cut my forehead, and I bled very much—I was taken to the station house after I gave her into custody—I made a charge against her—a surgeon was sent for, and my wound was attended to at the station—I had no wound or mark over my eye at all before that night when the wound was inflicted—that was the Wednesday after Whit Monday—on the Whit Monday I had some disturbance with my husband about 11.30 or 11.45—he turned me out of the room on to the landing—I went down the stairs and I asked for the baby when I got to the bottom—he gave me the baby at the street door and I went straight to the station house to make complaints of him to see what I could do with him—a constable told me I had no marks of violence, and they could not do anything for me—I after<lb></lb>wards went to my sister's, Catherine Keefe—she lives about five minutes' walk off—I stayed there that night, and I did not return to my husband till the Thursday—on the Friday morning I went and gave evidence before the magistrate and described the assault by Sarah Legust—the prisoner was called as one of the witnesses for the defence—it is not true that on Whit Monday night I said I was bleeding to death—I was not bleeding, and I did not say so—I did not vow vengeance against my husband for having wounded me, and I did not make any complaint against him for having wounded me—I did not call out in the street that night after I had got the baby "Police!" and "Murder!"—I went straight to the station house from the street door—Mr. and Mrs. Nodding, who are here, are friends of mine, and saw me on the Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

I did not get out of bed then, but when she said "Is there no kind neighbour will get up and fetch a policeman," I got out of bed and lifted the window up and saw the woman in a stooping position, but I did not see her bleeding. As I opened the window she said, "I am streaming with blood"—after people began to run in all directions I slid down the window, and with that I heard her call out most fearfully against her husband for ill-using her and injuring her, and after that she turned on to the landlord, and she said "He has only got one lung, and I will tear that out of him," and after that I sat in my room till past 1 o'clock and she went on most dreadfully, which my witnesses will prove. Mr. Paget gave me in charge and this woman, for stating what we did, and I have got five witnesses to come to-day, and they will confirm everything we said, and the woman she was with after 12 o'clock got a tremendous black eye that ever you saw in your life; and as for Nodding he was not there at all, he went into work.

                  </hi>. I lodge with Mrs. Watts at 44, Martha Street—on Whit Monday night I was awoke by hearing a noise—I came out of the back room into the front room and opened the window, and I heard Sarah Cronin screaming,"Murder!" and "Police!" and she said, "Is there no kind Christian that will come and help a poor sinner?"—she said her husband was beating her—I saw a crowd round the door—I did not come down stairs—I did not see whether she had any blood, on her face—her hair was hanging down.</p>

                  </hi>. I did live at 42, Martha Street, next door to Mrs. Watts—I was there on Whit Monday night—I and my husband were in bed, and about 11.45 we were woke up with the cries of police and murder—we got up and dressed ourselves and went down to the door, and saw Mrs. Cronin outside with her hair hanging down her back, and she said "Will no kind Christian help a poor sinner?" and she put her hands to her face and said "Look at me, look at me; no one would help me while my husband was beating me with my baby in my arms"—she sat down on the stones for a few moments, and then she got up and came across to me and asked for a glass of water—I went up stairs and got a glass and gave it to her—she drank some and rinsed her mouth out, and gave it back to me—she con<lb></lb>tinued her abuse till about 1.45—a few minutes before she left off I went up stairs, but I came down again; I could not sleep.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had been in bed a few minutes, and we got up, dressed, and came down stairs—we looked out of window first, but we could not sleep and came down—I did not see anything the matter with Sarah Cronin that night only the bruise—I did not see anything of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Martha Street—Mrs. Cronin was in my house some time in the evening on Whit Monday—I saw her again after her husband had beat her, and she came out in the street—she made a noise in the street, and then she came to my door and wanted to come in, and my husband said "No, where you made your row you must go and finish it," and she went back to her own door—it was about 12 o'clock as near as may be—her face was all swollen and bruised on the right side—I did not see any blood—I stayed till her sister came and took her home, and then her sister came back and got the gown from her husband from the place where she lived—it was her sister, Catherine Keefe, that took her home, and it was Catherine Keefe came back for her gown, and there was no more noise afterwards—it was about 12.45 she came back—she had taken her home and came back for the gown—Sarah Cronin gave a woman a black eye before that, before her sister Catherine came up—the woman came and persuaded her to go in and she would not go, and she turned round and gave the woman a black eye right at my shoulder—I saw no marks of blood about her.</p>

On 1st October, about half-past 2 in the morning, I heard screams of "Murder" in Jenning's-buildings, Kensington—I went there, and saw the prisoner's wife lying on her back, and the prisoner leaning over her, striking her—when he saw me he ran away—I stooped down, lifted his wife up, and rested her on my knee—I found the blood streaming down her face—she was covered with blood—I led her to</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 25). About half-past 2 o'clock on the morning of 1st October, I heard a cry of "Police!" in Jenning's buildings, and saw the last witness with the prisoner's wife—she was stream<lb></lb>ing down with blood—I went in search of the prisoner—I went to his room and found the door looked—I got it open, and found the room covered with blood, and the doors and staircase—I then went into the next house, where I found the prisoner in the passage—I told him I wanted to take him in custody for assaulting his wife—he said, "All right; she assaulted me first, and then fell downstairs"—at the station I asked him if he had got any knife, and gave me up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was covered with blood and some hair was on it—he afterwards asked me if he might look at the knife—I did not allow him to do so—he asked me if there was any blood upon it—I said, "Yes"—he asked his wife, at the time he was charged, not to go hard with him, and she refused to sign the charge-sheet—her head was cut in several places, and her and was very severely cut—the prisoner's hands were wet with blood, and the sleeve of his coat had got wet blood on it—there was a slight scratch on his cheek, which I had seen previous to this occurrence—I was in his company about twenty minutes before this occurred; up in his room with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and medical officer of the parish of Kensington—on 1st October I was sent for to the police-station—I found the prisoner's wife there, bleeding very profusely from several wounds in the head—she had evidently been drinking—she was suffering from loss of blood—some of the wounds were punctured and others incised in the scalp—there was also a severe wound between the right forefinger and thumb of the right hand—some of them were severe wounds, about an inch and a half in length—some of them were of a serious character—erysipelas might have followed—I sent her to the workhouse—I was afterwards sent for to attend her again there, in consequence of her bleeding from the hand—she remained under my charge for about a fortnight—the wounds could certainly not have been inflicted by a fall—they could be inflicted by such an instrument as this knife.</p>

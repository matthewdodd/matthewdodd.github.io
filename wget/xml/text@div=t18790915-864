I am head nurse at the infirmary at Kingston Union—I know the prisoner by the name of Alice Ward; she was admitted into the infirmary by that name on 3rd June—she was in labour when she came and on the 4th I delivered her of a male child; it was born with a double caul over its face—on 2nd July she was discharged with her baby—during the time she was in the workhouse she treated the baby kindly; it was a very nice child—she nursed and suckled it and dressed it after the fortnight, and behaved to it as a good mother—when she left with it on 2nd July it was to all appearance in a healthy state—she told me she was going to Weybridge to her mother's—the child was vaccinated before it left the Union; it was done twice; the first time the arm did not take, and she had to stay another week on account of the baby's arm—when it left it had on a little nightgown, a petticoat, a flannel belly-band, and a diaper—the band was hemmed instead of herring-boned; I called her attention to that—I have since seen a belly-band and diaper produced by the police; they were the same that the child had on when it left the workhouse—I have not seen the nightgown or petticoat; there was what is called a back flannel all to pieces, I could not identify that—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the diaper; it is an old calico one with a hole in the corner—I identify that and this belly-band by being hemmed instead of herring-boned; I never saw one hemmed before.</p>

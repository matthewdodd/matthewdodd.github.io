            . I am a labourer to the East India Company. On the first of January, about ten o'clock, I heard a noise in the adjoining room, went in, and saw the prisoner on a pile of wood, drawing tea out of a chest - he had no business in that room; I said nothing to him. He asked me if I had found an old pair of shoes, which he had put there? I said No. He went into the passage with me and then returned; I followed gently, and heard him rattling the tea in the store-room; I returned to the passage, and pretended not to notice him, He came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have been endeavouring to get some rest, but cannot, I am so full of pain, I will go and get half a pint of beer." I told Mr. Lines, who was coming up at the time - the prisoner then passed us, and Mr. Lines charged him with it. He denied it, and offered to be searched. I went away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HINDS. I am an assistant elder to the East India Company; Irons gave me information. I stopped the prisoner, and, told him I understood he had tea about him, he said he had none, and was willing to be searched; Lines came up, pulled off his hat, and found 1 lb. 20 z. of tea concealed in a dirty bag, like the lining of his hat; the chest contained the same sort of tea - about that quantity was missing. He said he was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>JOHN LINES. I searched the prisoner's hat, and found the tea there.</p>

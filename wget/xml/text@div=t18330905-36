No; he had left three months before these things were found on his premises - he had all that time to have made away with them - there were a number of workmen on the premises where these goods were.</p>

I put the articles in the loft - there was a carpet like this; I cannot say that this is it; it was of this kind and near to this pattern; I have not been there myself, but I have heard some has been lost; I recollect the pattern of these glasses, and there was a cruet-stand with a silver top, something of this kind, but there were stands round it for the cruets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your expression was, "something of this kind," are there not many other stands and glasses similar to these? A. No doubt there are, but I never noticed any of them; when I put them away there were fifteen small glasses, and some large ones, these are the same pattern.</p>

I searched for her, but could hear nothing of her till last Tuesday night: she was apprehended in Covent-Garden. On being examined she at first denied it, but at last she owned she did the fact: I asked her whether she did it with a chissel or a hammer; she said, neither, it was with a gimblet: I had not mentioned my having found the gimblet, at that time; she said she bored round the lock, and after that separated the wood from the lock, and opened the chest; and that she was advised to this by a young man named

I took her before Justice Kynaston; there she confessed she broke the chest, but would not own what she had done with the things, but that she said she had left them all at Canterbury: I have not found any of them again: she begged to go in at the Blakeney's-Head; there she confessed she let in that young man, at three in the m orning; that she lighted up a rush-light; that she took the bed-quilt from the bed, and shaded the window; that he persuaded her to break the chest with the gimblet, and she trembled and said she could not; but he bid her not be afraid, for nobody should hurt her: then he came and took the cloaths, and she never touched them:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220037"></xptr> he bid her go down with one bundle, and convey them into the Bagnio-yard, and after that he would meet her at the upper end of St. Martin's-street; but when she came to the yard he was gone, with the money and things, and she never saw him since: we took her back to the justice; she confessed the same there: she said

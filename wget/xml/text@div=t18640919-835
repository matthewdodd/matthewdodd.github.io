                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Nealan, a labouring man—on 30th August, about 6 in the evening, I was walking along Swan-place, Mile-end, with my baby; I was speaking to a neighbour of mine, a Mrs. Tap<lb></lb>pendon, who made some remark about my little boy's boots, and the prisoner came up and said if I was talking to her instead of Mrs. Tappendon, she would job a knife in my eye—she then struck me twice with something—I did not know it was a knife till I had the second blow—she struck me twice over the eye—when I received the second blow I put my baby down, and said, "It is a knife"—I did not see anything in her hand at the time; the blood came into my eyes, and mouth, and nose—I saw no one at that time—I do not remember any more after that—I became insensible—I forgive her for what she has done—I have got well—I have never been in prison, and I don't want any one to be in prison through me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a flannel and blanket merchant, of No. 72, Aldermanbury. The prisoner was introduced to me by a person named Knight, whom I knew something of—I asked him for a reference, and sold him a parcel of goods on credit, amounting to 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called on me on the 20th of the same month, May, and told me that he expected to haves contract with the French Government for blankets—he had given his name as Fould and Co., No. 3, Cannon Street, and told me that he was related to Monsieur Fould, the Prime Minister of France—he said on the second occasion that he expected to have an order from the French Govern<lb></lb>ment for blankets for the camp at Chalons, and he should have an order for me—I sold him a parcel of goods amounting to 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called on me again about the first week in June, and said, "I want you to get me some samples of blankets, to see if I can obtain that contract; they are going to be put before the French Government, and I want samples from you as well as from other houses"—I asked him what quantity he should want, and he wrote it on a paper, and gave it to me—I have looked for it, and cannot find it; I believe it has been torn up—I left my books and papers at the office of Mr. Child, the inquiry agent—it was an order for 200 or 300 blankets; fifty pairs of nine-quarters, fifty pairs of ten-quarters mediums, fifty pairs of nine-quarters supers, and fifty pairs of ten-quarters supers—a few days afterwards he called again, and told me that the goods had been placed before the Government, and said, "I have got the contract, and it is for you; you must supply the goods"—I said, "Very well"—the paper was in French, and I did not understand it—it was headed, "<hi rend="italic">Gouvernement de Francais</hi>"—he said, "Here is the contract for the French Government"—it was partly printed, and partly written—there was a printed form on one side, and when you turned over the leaf there was the order on the other—it looked like a very large order—I could understand the numbers, but not the writing—there was a column of figures—he said that he wanted 5, 000 pairs a month, or upwards, and a fortnight after every delivery I should receive the money for them—I procured the goods, and then went over and saw him at 3, Cannon Street—it is two or three offices, up three flights of stairs—I told him that a portion of the goods had come up, and said, "Where are they to be sent to"—he said, "Send them into Arnold's, the packers, in Barge Yard: shall I send a cart over, or will you send them?"—I said, "Just as you like"—he said, "Very well, let them lie at your place until I send a cart for them"—a cart arrived, and they were given into the charge of the carman in my presence—that order was not entirely completed—there were 200 pairs in the first lot—I delivered 200 pairs more on 18th June, and on 23rd June 100 pairs large size—he had told me on the 18th or the 23rd that he wanted larger sizes of the same qualities as I had sent in, and gave me an order for 100 pairs, which I got for him—he said something about a better class for the officers—I should not have parted with those goods if I had not believed his statement, that he had an order from the French Government—I last saw him between the 6th and 24th of Aug.—I found him there two or three</p>

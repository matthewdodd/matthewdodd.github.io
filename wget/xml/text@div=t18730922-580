                  </hi>. I am a porter, of 2, Old Church Road, Stepney—on 15th August, about 9 p. m., I was at the corner of Sidney Street and Oxford Street, Mile End, and I saw a long <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> crossing from the north side to the south side—the prisoner was with it—I heard somebody call out "You are on your wrong side"—he was in Oxford Street and crossed from his right to his wrong side—there was a cart on the near side with Foster and Murphy in it, they were on their right side and Foster was driving, going towards London at a pace of about five miles an hour—four roads meet at that place—the <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> appeared to come out at a gateway and to cross the road, it was going between four and five miles an hour—it being on its wrong side and the cart on its right side, there was not sufficient space to get through, and that caused the collision—Mr. Murphy held up his hand—the <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> struck the cart, the two wheels were locked together, the pony shot away, and the two men were thrown out—I fetched a cab and helped to put the injured man into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> is a long thing with two wheels to carry tubs—in coming out of a gateway it would reach a considerable way across the road—the gateway is about forty yards from the four crossroads—it was getting dark—the defendant was driving slowly, four or five miles an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Burton Street, Mile End—on the night of August 15th I was in a cart with Mr. Foster, the deceased, in Oxford Street, Mile End—we were going towards London from Stepney, and as we crossed Sidney Street, on the near side, I caught sight of the prisoner driving a <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi>—I held up my hand, and called out to him "Where are you coming to? why don't you pull into your near side?"—he seemed to mimic me by saying "Har, har!"—he took no further notice, but seemed to be intent on filling or lighting his pipe—I cannot say whether he had the reins in his hand; I almost fancy he had them over his left arm—in a second or two the two tires of the wheels caught flush, and Foster and I were both thrown out by the shock, one on the off side and one on the near side—I was bruised, but I accompanied Foster in a cab to the hospital—I saw him dead next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was more than eight yards from the <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> when first saw it—I said at the Inquest "Rather more than four yards"—I may have said "Four or more"—he was then in the middle of the street—I swear I never said he was only four yards off.</p>

On 15th August, about 9 o'clock p. m., I was called to Oxford Street, Mile End, and saw the prisoner with a <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> standing behind his horses' head, smoking a short pipe—I took his name and address on the van—he appeared very slightly under the influ<lb></lb>ence of drink.</p>

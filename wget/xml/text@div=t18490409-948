                  </hi>. I am a constable, in the employ of the London Dock Com<lb></lb>pany. In consequence of information, I went on 27th March to the West Quay, and examined a room where the men often leave their clothes—I saw a small box secreted, containing two or three ounces of green tea—I searched further, and found a handkerchief containing a similar quantity, at the back of the warehouse—there is a warehouse which had been lately under repair, and the doors of which are not yet put up; it was full of bales of cotton—I went into a corner, and there saw a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of writing-paper—I did not remove it, but searched among the bales, and saw two pieces of rag stuck in—I ex<lb></lb>amined further, and found this handkerchief containing 11b. 15 ozs. of tea—I put the rags back as I found them, returned to the warehouse, and hid myself where I could command a view of the bales—at about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came, rushed into the place past me, went direct to where the tea was, looked right and left, pulled out the pieces of rag, put his hand in, pulled out the bag with the tea, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out past me so quickly that I could not catch him—I caught him about ten yards off, asked what business he had there, and what he had about him—he said he had got his lunch—I then caught hold of his hat, and said, "What is this.?"—he appeared <hi rend="italic">stagnated</hi>—found 11b. 15 ozs. of gunpowder tea in his hat, and his luncheon in his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You swear you saw the tea between the bales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe you had your lunch in your right-hand—it was not in your hand when you put it into the hole; I called, <hi rend="italic">"Hoy!"</hi> to you, and you turned round; I was six feet from you; I paralyzed you as if I had dropped from the clouds; after I pulled your hat off you said you had got tea, which you had found, and which you were going to take to the warehouse-keeper.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He bad no business there at that time.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is cus<lb></lb>tomary for all extra-labourers to be called by the foreman, and they receive a tin ticket; they then come to me and deliver the ticket, and are then admit<lb></lb>ted into the Dock to do their work; he could not come without one; he had brought me no pass as an extra-labourer; there were none that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you not aware that all labourers have access to any building for the purpose of placing their clothes and lunch in.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one is allowed to go to the tea-warehouse; I never heard of you and others find<lb></lb>ing tea there and taking it to the warehouse-keeper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had lost my lunch on the Monday, and found this place to secrete it; I went for it, and found something soft; I was going to work in about two minutes, and should have taken it direct to the warehouse-keeper or foreman, whoever I saw first.</p>

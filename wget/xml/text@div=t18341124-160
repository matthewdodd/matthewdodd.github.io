                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Walter Cropley, a hay salesman at Smithfield. On the 21st of October the prisoner came and examined several loads of hay—he selected one belonging to Richard Palmer of Enfield—I told him it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted it for his master, Mr. Bignall, black coach proprietor, of Tothill-street, Westminster—I knew there was such a person, and he represented himself as his servant—he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. taken off, but I said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the lowest price—he then said Mr. Bignall would send the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the load by the carman, and I de<lb></lb>livered him the load on the faith of that—I should not have delivered it to him if he had not made the statement he did.</p>

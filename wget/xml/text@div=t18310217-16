On Tuesday morning, the 15th of February, between two and three o'clock, I was disturbed by an unusual noise; I got out of bed, opened my bed-room door, and heard that which convinced me all was not right at the top of the house - I went down two pairs of stains, and called the assistance of my young men; I have four - I awoke them all, and armed myself with a sabre; I went up to my ware-rooms, which are the attics - there is a trap-door in the ceiling; I observed the inner trap-door was removed, and a quantity of mortar on the floor - I observed that the ceiling was broken through a little beyond the trap-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent the person who had forced the trap-door from getting into the house? A. Yes, some iron bars which I had placed there myself - the aperture in the ceiling was about the size of a man's head; the two bolts of the trap-door had been forced, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170027"></xptr>outer trap-door had been forced open by breaking the wood - I put the sabre up through the bars at the inner trap-door, and made a noise with it against the bars; I then heard a trampling over the roof of the house - I heard footsteps on the roof; I put up the windows, and gave an alarm - the Police came to my assistance, sprang a rattle, and in about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, I saw all the prisoners, except Allen, in custody; I saw Allen in custody at the station, about half an hour after the other prisoners were taken - the house, No. 51, North-place, was empty; it is four doors from mine - I directed the Police to watch that house; No. 16, Wilson-street was also empty - that is five doors from me; there is access along the roof of my house to those of No. 51, North-place, and No. 16, Wilson-street; a man might meet with some difficulty in climbing up the houses in Wilson-street - there is access from both houses, but it is more difficult from the house in Wilson-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This was at two o'clock in the morning - you had gone to bed on Monday, the 14th? A. Yes - the inner trap-door was opened, and the outer trap-door thrown down on the roof; the inner trap-door is about a foot from the bottom of the outer one, which lays flat on the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. When you open the outer trap-door, are you out of the house or in it? A. In the house, below the roof - the inner trap-door is over the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any opening made in the roof or trap-door by which a person could get into the ware-room? A. They had broken the ceiling, but the hole was not large enough for them to get into the ware-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you taken the trouble to pass from the roof of your house to No. 16, Wilson-street? A. I have not, but I was with those who did - it was a bricklayer, and one of the inspectors; they went down with a ladder, which they brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Except from the assistance of the ladder would it not, from what you saw, be not only extremely difficult but extremely dangerous? A. Not at all, I could do it myself with ease - in raising from the top of the houses in Wilson-street to the roof of mine there would be a difficulty to a person not accustomed to it, but there was no difficulty in going from my house to Wilson-street, because I could drop from my roof to it; the height is about seven feet six inches - I have measured it; a person would only have to drop once - my house is the fifth from No. 16, Wilson-street; the four first houses are two stories high, and mine is three - he would not have to drop the height of a whole story, because the roof in Wilson-street comes above the story; it rises up - the gutter runs in the middle of my house, and reduces the depth very cousiderably - the four first houses are all one height, but No. 16 is a story higher - he would not have to ascend that story, as the back parapet is the same height.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he have to run along a parapet without any guard from the street? A. He could go across the top of the houses without being near the parapet; it would not be at all difficult or dangerous.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose there is nothing particular in the size of his feet? A. Not that I am aware of - he did not own them in my presence; he had a pair of list slippers on.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live opposite Mr. Brown - I have the care of No. 16, Wilson-street, and had so at the time; it was empty. On the 15th of February, on hearing an alarm, I went towards that house; when I got to the door, somebody opened it by drawing the lock inside; I instantly drew back, beckoned, and a Policeman came to me - I observed then that the door was about an inch and a half open; I saw it gradually drawn open about an inch and a half; it was instantly drawn open quite, and a person presented himself at the threshold of the door; I instantly sprang forward, and the door was slapped in my face by the person inside (there was no inmate to that house); there was a gas-light opposite the door of No. 17; that light enabled me to see the person - the prisoner Allen is that person; the gas-light is about seven yards from the door, on the same side of the way - Gough-street runs at the bottom of Wilson-street, and is from twenty-five to thirty yards from No. 16, Wilson-street - after he had shut the door in my face, I heard a cry of "There he goes, Stop thief!" and saw a man run past the bottom of Wilson-street, and a Policeman in pursuit of him; I joined in the pursuit, and had a view of his person, and kept him in sight - I got before the Policeman about three parts of the way down Gough-street, and passed Burge's yard to Mount-pleasant, turned the corner of Warner-street, and into Red Lion-yard - I did not lose sight of him as he turned the corner of Warner-street, but as he turned into Red Lion-yard I lost sight of him for a moment - he turned to the left-hand side of the yard at the bottom, and ran through a horse-pond; I followed him on the other side - he ran up three or four steps, and over a brick wall, which separated a private yard from the street; I was then seven or eight yards behind him - I made a catch at his foot as he get over; the gates of the yard were then broken; I entered the yard - one Policeman entered before me; we were together, and he (the prisoner Allen) was from eight to ten yards up the yard, laying on the ground, quite exhausted - we took him into custody - we found nobody else in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was all the opportunity you had of seeing the man in the house No. 16, the door being open about an inch and a half? A. I did not see him till the door was quite opened - a person could not look out when it was open an inch and a half; it was when he threw the door open, and presented himself at the thershold; I had never seen Allen before to my knowledge - I swear positively that he is the man I saw at the door, and that I saw the same man afterwards in the yard - I did not observe whether his clothes were wet; mine were - it was only a small pond, nearly half leg up - he ran through as I did; the whole of my stockings were wet, because they were down over my shoes -I had not tied them up; nothing else was wet except my skin - I was not wet up to my breeches; I never lost sight of the prisoner except for a moment, at the corner of Red Lion-yard.</p>

I was alarmed by the cry of thieves - I can see from my back window into some of the yards of the houses in Wilson-street, and of No. 16; after the alarm I saw a young man jump over two walls, in a direction of the walls of Nos. 16, 15 and 14. Wilson-street -I then went to the front of my house in Gough-street, and saw a man drop from the wall of the corner house in Wilson-street, into Gough-street - it was a young man in a fustain jacket; I gave an alarm, and cried out, "There he goes;" that was in the hearing of a Policeman, and I saw the Policeman pursue the man down Gough-street, towards Burge's yard, Mount-pleasant.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Brown. -On the night of the robbery I accompanied him up to the warehouse; I afterwards looked through the roof of the house, and saw the property there, in parcels, which the Policemen afterwards took possession of - I have since seen them; they had been placed on the top of the stairs, just under the grating where the trap-door was, on the day before the robbery; I know the articles by the duplicates being on them - I wrote some of the duplicates myself; I should think the articles worth from 15l. to 20l. - 13l. had been lent on them.</p>

               <p>Allen's Defence. I am innocent. I know nothing whatever of these three men - I never saw them in my life till I saw them at the station. I was returning from Camden-town between one and two o'clock; I turned round the first or second turning on the left-hand side of the way from Mr. Cubitt's. to come towards Mutton-hill, on my way home to Finsbury, and as I came under a wall a Policeman sprang out on me, and said, "Here is one of them;" I turned round, and said, "One, what?" he said,"One of the thieves;" I then knocked him down - he sprang his rattle, and three or four more came up towards where I was; I then ran away, with ever so many Policemen after me, first up one street and another; I ran across a sort of mews - I did not know whether there was a turning, and when I got to the bottom there was none; I had no place to get away, and jumped over a gate - I never ran through any horse-pond; I hurt myself in falling off the gate - I found I could not get up, and there I laid; I cannot say how long, for I was stunned with the blow - some Policemen knocked the gates open, and laid hold of me; I said, "Where is the man I have struck?" they said, "Oh, come along," and took me to the station; two of them lent me their shoulders to lean on very kindly, or I could not have walked - they sat me in a chair; I had been there a quarter of an hour, when these three men were brought in - the serjeant or inspector, I did not notice which, said, "So we have got four of you;" one of them, I believe it was Mallett, said, "Which of us is it you reckon as two then, as there are but three of us;" the Policeman stood in a file before me - they moved back, and said, "Why, here is the other sitting in a chair;" the man said, "That man has not been with us - we know nothing of him; it was us three by ourselves;" I told the inspector I knew nothing of the three men, but, without any ceremony, he put as all into the black-hole together; he brought me out first in the morning, and told me I was charged with burglary, with those three men; I told him I was a housekeeper in Shoreditch, and a respectable man, and they might send for my friends; they said Oh, no, I was along with these three men, and laughed at me - they put me into the hole, and I was taken to Hatton-garden; I told the Magistrate I knew nothing of the three men, and they declared they knew nothing of me; the Magistrate sent me back till Thursday, when I was committed - I have plenty of friends; it has been so sudden, but I have no doubt some of them are here - they have heard of it by means of the press; I am a painter, and live at No. 60, Leonard-street, Shoreditch, and keep a shop, which my wife looks after; I have no incumbrance whatever, only one child, and leave the Jury to say whether I should be guilty of such a thing - my reason for running away was because I had struck the Policeman; I do not know the men - they were all strangers to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What King-street? A. You go up Princes-street, Gray's Inn-lane to it - I do not know the number; the gentleman's name is Banbury - I left there twelve months ago last Christmas; I was there for a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the neighbourhood of Mr. Brown's house, is not it? A.

            . I am a painter, and live in Hackney-road. I have known Allen about five years, I think; he lives in Leonard-street, Shoreditch, and is a painter - I never knew any dishonesty imputed to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know him pretty intimately? A. The first two years we worked together, with Mr. Bright, of No. 109, Minories, who is still living; I continued to know him occasionally up to the present time - I never heard of his going by any other name but Allen; I have read of his going by the name of Jack, the Painter, but never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you tell it was the person you knew, who you were reading of? A. By its being William Allen, alias Jack, the Painter - it was as a prize-fighter I read of him; I never asked how he came to be called by that name - I work for Mr. Bright now; I never heard of the prisoner being in custody.</p>

            . Q. Do you recollect in what dress Allen was when taken into custody? A. He had a fustian frock-coat, with pockets on the side, and I believe, fustian trousers - it was a sort of shooting-jacket, such as plumber's wear; a kind of frock coat, nearly down to the knees, I think, but not quite - I am positive he is the person I saw in the house when the door opened.</p>
               <p>JANE WOOD. When I saw the young man getting over the wall, he wore a light fustian coat, with pockets at the side - I cannot say it was Allen.</p>

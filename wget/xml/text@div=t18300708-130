               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.When did you see them again? A. On the Friday morning -I had not seen Trant till Thursday afternoon, about five or six o'clock; there was another person with him - there was nothing to prevent their straying from where I kept them - Steers told me that Trant was the owner of the herbage in the parks; he did not say he was forbidden to have more than three hundred sheep at a time, nor that he never let stray sheep go, till they paid for the herbage - the fold is in the hollow near Kensington-gardens; Waugh told me to look over the fold, and I did, but my sheep were not there, either on Wednesday or Thursday, when I went.</p>

            . I am a drover. On Wednesday, the 9th of June, about four o'clock, or a little after, I saw Trant at his fold in Hyde-park - he drove some sheep and lambs up towards the fold, and called Waugh, his shepherd (who was not with him then), and asked if he knew the marks of those sheep and lambs - he said No; he also asked me if I knew the marks; I told him No, I did not - Trant said, "There are eighteen of them, there will be 18d. to pay for them;" I did not notice the marks - he pulled his watch out, and said, "It is a quarter-past four o'clock, William; some of the sheep have broken over, and by the time you bring the others up it will be nearly five, to fold them;" none of the eighteen had broken into his fold - Waugh fetched the sheep up, and they were put into the fold with these eighteen sheep and lambs; this was at the fold in Hyde-park - I had to take four lambs of a master butcher's, which had been there to grass, and Waugh had to take ten home - we went home with them together; Trant takes in sheep to graze for butchers - I saw Hempson at Smithfield on Thursday morning; I went with him to Waugh's house that night, and reminded him of what occurred in the park - he said it had quite slipped his memory, but he would show Mr. Hempson where Trant lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You were attending sheep in the park? A. Yes; it was about folding time - I cannot say whether Waugh heard Trant say there would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080069"></xptr>18d. to pay; I believe the number of sheep in the park is limited, and if there are above that number they are taken to another place - Trant rented the herbage of Hyde-park and Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. We admit he was not allowed to keep more than three hundred and fifty sheep in Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>JOHN STEERS. There might be two hundred sheep in the fold or more; I cannot swear there was not two hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were all the sheep in the park in the fold? A.There were a few store things out in the park - I could see all that were there; I should judge there were not above two hundred and thirty or two hundred and eighty - I did not go all over the park, because the sheep are kept together; I was not there on Thursday, and cannot say how many more might come in then - they come in and out almost every day; it might be five o'clock when I went away.</p>
               <p>MR. HEMPSON. I first saw the fold on Wednesday evening between six and seven o'clock, my sheep could not be there then, for I looked the fold over well; I could not have overlooked them - I will venture to swear there were not two hundred there; the G. on my sheep was so visible it must be seen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOX. I am in Trant's service. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of June, I had the keys of the fold at Regent's park - I left at six o'clock; these sheep and lambs were not there then, I am sure; I went at six in the morning to attend the flock, and these sheep were there then -Trant was not there; he sent his nephew to me, and I saw him about nine o'clock that morning; he said, "Here are eighteen sheep and lambs which I found going to be taken to the green-yard, if any person should come for them you are not to let them go out without my leave;" I saw one marked S. on the hip - I did not notice what was on the back of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Waugh is the shepherd at Regent's-park? A. Yes, I am under him; I had not let some stray sheep go once before - I had only been there a month; he did not say any body was welcome to look at them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where are the sheep kept in Regent's-park? A.Between Clarence and Hanover gates, close to the road; people going along can see them.</p>

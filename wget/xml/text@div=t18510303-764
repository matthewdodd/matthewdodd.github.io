                  </hi>. I keep tot Crown and Sceptre, Woolmore-street, Poplar—the prisoner was my housemaid thirteen days. On 19th Feb. I heard a conversation between my wife and the prisoner—I heard Mrs. Roundtree ask her what she was doing at the brandy—she said, "I thought I was drawing rum"—Mrs. Roundtree said, "Whatever it is, you save no business to be in the bar drawing anything"—I came down and took this bottle from her—she said, "I thought the servants in public-houses had a right to have what they liked to drink"—this bottle of brandy is mine.</p>

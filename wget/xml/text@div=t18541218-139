The superintendence of the busi<lb></lb>ness devolved on me—it was my business to open letters addressed to my employers—the prisoner was their traveller—it was his duty to report to us by letter all moneys he received, once a week; but for the convenience of the house he was in the habit of doing so every day, and the accounts ran on till the end of his journey—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is dated 21st Aug.—it contains an account of moneys received by the prisoner—he accounts here for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received of Messrs. Burgess and Sons, of Reading, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. allowance—this other letter is dated 31st Aug.—I find in it, in the prisoner's writing, an account of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received of Benjamin Antill, allow<lb></lb>ing a discount of 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this other letter, of 4th Sept., is in the prisoner's writing, and contains an account of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received of William Higginton—the prisoner received a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and was allowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for expenses—he never accounted to me for the difference between what he had in fact received and what he reported.</p>

Moore when it was paid—I only know by hearsay of an arrangement being made—I know that he was in communication with Messrs. Moore at the time—he has been in their employment four and a half or five years—his salary when he entered their employment was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, not 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say that it has been increased to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from twelve to eighteen months—he has frequently complained that the allowance for his expenses on the road was not sufficient, in consequence of his travelling very quickly—about the first, second, and third journey he claimed for losses upon his expenses; I think it was about 1849 or 1850—he complained frequently, till it was agreed that 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to be the maximum—he has frequently said that 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not enough.</p>

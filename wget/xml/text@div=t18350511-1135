                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and carry on business in Trinity-lane. I have one partner—the prisoner was our clerk for eight or nine months—he was town traveller—I paid him a salary—his duty was to take orders and collect the accounts—he used to return at five o'clock in the afternoon and enter in a memorandum-book what he had collected, and band the money over to me—he should enter the names and amount of the persons he received money from—he was not allowed to retain any balance—in March we had a customer named Pratt, who lived at Greenwich; he has never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from him—the memorandum-book containing the items has been abstracted from the counting-house, and I have not got it—I have a book containing a copy of it, and by that I can say he did not pay over any money on the 19th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, nor on the following day—he did not account for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Henry Parks, of Woolwich, on the 9th of March—he accounted for some sums received that day, Bitches; "18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "is entered as received that day, but nothing from anybody else—we had a customer of that name, who owed 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day—he has not accounted for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Miller on the 16th of March, nor for any money received that day, nor on the 17th—he accounted for money on the 18th, but none from Miller—in April last I had received information, and on the 23rd of April I said to him, "Mr. Martin, you have received money which you have not accounted for, "he said, "Oh, I have some money in my pocket," I said, "Pnt down on a piece of paper what you have received, and hand it over to me"—he did so; I have that memorandum, with a variety of sums, amounting alto<lb></lb>gether to 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he has written at the bottom, "Received by me, only 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "and that sum he handed over to me—it does not include any one of the sums in question—I said, "This is not the whole you have receiv<lb></lb>ed," be said, it was the whole he had received—but be said, "If there are any others, you had better name them to me"—I then named to him "Pa<lb></lb>ternoster, Kent-road, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; "he turned to his book, and said, "I see it is not marked off in my book I have not given it to you;"—before that I had allowed him to go to his lodging for his book—I sent a person with him—it was when he returned with his book, that I mentioned Paternoster's case to him—he said, "It is not marked off, I have not paid it to him"—I said to, him, "There are others besides Mr. Paternoster, which I am aware of"—he desired me to mention another—I mentioned "Pratt, of Greenwich, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he turned to his book again and said, "Well I have not given it to you, it is not marked off in my book"—this was his own private book,</p>

               <p>not one belonging to me—I said, I had reason to suspect they were numerous—he begged me to give him time to make up his accounts—he said it was not like my usual plan to be so hard upon him, and would I give him time to make up his accounts—I said I would give him time—nothing else pas<lb></lb>sed—I pursued my inquiries and made a great many fresh discoveries—I discoverd Park's and Miller's amounts afterwards, which I was not aware of at the time of the conversation—in consequence of that, I had him taken into custody on the Saturday, and he delivered me an account that day—this is it—he debits himself with these amounts in that account.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you undertake to swear you did not before Saturday decline to go into an account which he produced, and wished to go into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will under<lb></lb>take to swear that no account was rendered to me; but as to the other cir<lb></lb>cumstance I will not be certain—I did not decline to go into any account with him, not on any occasion—I never said I was not at liberty and should be engaged all day—there was no paper tendered to me before the Saturday—when this paper was produced I was angry with him, and said he was no better than a thief—I did not ascertain that he had not the means of paying me; on the contrary, he represented himself to me as a man of property—when he gave me this account he said he had never received the money—I had required from him an account of what he had received—he gave me this as an account of money he had received, and then he stated that he had not received the money, although it was there in his own handwriting, and it was that made me angry—he first said he had received them; afterwards retracted it, and said he had not; that was to<lb></lb>wards the latter part of our conversation, during the time I was speaking to him about it—I said, "Why there it is in your own hand writing"—I could not make him understand, or he wilfully misunderstood it—I had no quarrel with him, further than I told him if he did not account to me I must give him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had made you the payment of the money in the account, you did not intend to give him into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at that period, certainly;</p>

               <p>my object was to know what he had received, and to get the money from him—I asked him for the money, and he said he had given me all he had received—that was after I had given him in charge—there was no payment made on the 9th of February—on the 9th of March, there is 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. re<lb></lb>ceived, that corresponds with the entry in the small book—on the 16th of March there is no entry in either book—on the 19th there is one amount entered, but none on the 18th—the only amount on the 19th, is in the name of Cleeve—that is entered in the prisoner's book on the 14th—I attended every day to receive money—I do not mean to say I have not been absent—nobody accounted with him on my behalf—I have compared the entries in the cash-book with the prisoner's book—I have not found the gross amount of money in my cash-book, more than he has entered in his book as received.</p>

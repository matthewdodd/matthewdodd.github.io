               <p>The Prosecutor deposed, that on the 13th of April, about half an hour after nightfall, he was walking along Shire-lane, and was called to by the prisoner Jones, to come in and drink a glass of wine, she having something to say to him of particular consequence; that he went in first inside the door of his own accord, peaceable and quiet, and then recollecting he had this money about him, in his right-hand coat pocket, he went out again, and said he would not stay; she desired him to go up stairs, and said he should be safe, for it was as honest a house as any in the world; then when he got a little the outside of the door, she took him by the breast, and pulled him in again, and the door was shut. The prosecutor then went up stairs, and sat down, and in two minutes six or seven women and one man seized his person, some of them took him by the legs, some by the hands, and took the money out of his pocket; they held him fast, and he saw the money go; he had received it at the Bank that day or the day before; it was in four different papers, twenty guineas in each paper, and tied up in a handkerchief; the prosecutor was quite positive the prisoners were four of the people, he knew them before: when he saw his money taking out of the room, he called out, stop thief! and the man came up to him, and said we shall have it amongst us, but if you do not prosecute us, you shall have it in the morning; they put out the candle as soon as he saw the money go, and the man threatened to kill him, and these two circumstances he forgot before the magistrate. The prosecutor run down stairs directly after, and went out of the house and went in again; two of the women stood outside the door, and pushed him in again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260145"></xptr> and he went into the parlour where the prisoner Wilson was, and she advised him to go with her that night to the Talbot-inn, and sleep there, and she would put him in a method to get his money again; he went with her, and staid all night, but did not sleep much, and in the morning she told him he might go and hang himself, he would never get a penny of the money; he gave information before a magistrate in a day or two after; he did not give information before, because he thought to get his money in another way; he saw the prisoners again the next day at the same house, to try to get his money again; he waited there till night, and there were three women there that told him they would bring him the money, one of them was the prisoner Wilson, and the prosecutor gave these three women half a guinea a piece; he waited there all day, and then they told him there was no such thing; every one was drunk, and then he swore he would give information against them directly, which he did as soon as he could, but did not know how to go about it; the next day he went to the mansion-house, and was directed to Bow-street: he said he was as sober as he was at this time of examination.</p>
               <p>The Court desired to see the information, which was handed up, and upon asking the prosecutor when he gave that information, he repeatedly said it was two or three days after, whereas it was not till the 20th; and he believed he did not then say a word of the door being shut, but said they picked his pocket. The prosecutor deposed on his cross-examination, that he pawned his watch the morning after he slept with

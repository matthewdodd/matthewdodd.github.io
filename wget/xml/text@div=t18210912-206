            . The prosecutrix is a neighbour of mine, she sent to me on missing the property; I met the prisoner by my door, she said, Mrs. Dowling had lost three napkins, that they were taken out of the yard, and asked me to go to Nicholls's with her, to ask if they had been pledged, I went, she said to Nicholls "Has any linen been pawned her belonging to St. Andrew's", he said, No. I went with her to Crees, another pawnbroker, and enquired there, and she went back to Dowling. I then went alone to Nicholls's; he said if any were pawned there, the prisoner was the woman who pawned them. I went to Armstrong's, and found some things pawned in the name of Glass, which I redeemed - they were wrapped in one of my aprons. A little girl fetched me into Leather-lane, where I saw the prisoner with her child, and asked why she took the things, she said she would make them good. I said "Why did you take them, you knew she was distressed, and has six children; give me the tickets and I will take them out." She said she would see her d - d first.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of you proposed going there - A. We proposed between us of going there.</p>
               <p>Q. She or you must have known the house before - A. She knew the house before; we agreed to go to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it - A. Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed had you any money about you - A. Yes, two guineas in my breeches pocket; I put my breeches under the bolster, we had not been in bed above five minutes before I missed my money; the candle was put out; I heard the two guineas rattle in the purse that I had; I directly got up and accused the prisoner with taking the two guineas; I missed my money, I could not find it in my pocket; it was in a purse; she said she had not done any such thing; there was no other person in the room; I got up and made a noise, the woman of the house came up, I do not know her name; I asked her for the purse; she said here is the purse if that is what you want; she said she had no money at all; I said I was sure she had, and if she did not give it me I would charge the watch with her; when we got out I charged the watchman with her; he took her to the watchhouse. I saw the money while I was in the room with the prisoner, before we went to bed together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you drinking with two more, a young man and a young woman that was in company with me - A. There was a young woman in company with the prisoner, I was not in company with her; one of the young chaps that was with me went with this young woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. One of the young men had another girl - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The purse that the prisoner gave you was your purse - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The young woman came and knocked at the door and borrowed four shillings and sixpence of him, we had nine or ten glasses of rum and gin; we went into five or six different houses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not drink in any of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you been drinking at these houses with the prisoner - A. I drank part of a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And some gin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lent a young man that was with me four shillings and sixpence, and this young woman I gave six shillings to; I had nothing left but two guineas and a few halfpence.</p>

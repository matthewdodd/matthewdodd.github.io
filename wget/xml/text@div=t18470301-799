                  </hi>. I keep the Castle tavern, in the Holloway-road. I have known the prisoner Edward Burke twelve months—he used to work in the neighbourhood—on Saturday night, the 13th of Feb., about half-past ten o'clock, he came to my house—he had come on three previous Saturday nights, kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—his brother William followed him, and another man whose face I did not see—they had not been in two minutes before a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> com<lb></lb>menced—I went into the tap-room and said, "Now, Burke, you are come to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> to disturb me and my customers"—he was standing up to fight some man—I immediately put out the gas light—he ran out of the bar, looked at the clock, and said, "Now, you b—old b—, it is half-past ten, you have put out your gas, that is done because I am here"—I said, "Yes, you have come the last four or five Saturday nights to kick up a dis<lb></lb>turbance, and made me shut up my house"—he turned round and came into the tap-room—I had kept the tap-room door open, and stood with my hand to prevent his going in, and said, "You shall not go into my house to-night, I will lose my life first"—he immediately took off his cap, put it n my face, knocked one of my teeth out, and loosened some others—I did not know what to do—two persons came behind me, and thrust me away—one said, "Get out of the way, landlord, he will hurt you; I will take my brother out" I got out of the way—William pretended to put him out, but he kept him in instead—he kept saying to his brother, "Give me room"—he <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> me and <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> my son—with the assistance of my son we got them all out, locked the door, and bolted it—he turned round—I ran to the door—they broke the lock off the side door—some people outside said, "What are you breaking the man's door open for?"—he said, "I will murder every b—b—in the house"—they got partly into the house—we pushed them out—they got in at the door again, and Edward struck right and left at everybody—the others were aiding him—he struck my son and me—I said, "Good God, cannot you find a policeman?"—my man said, "There are two outside"—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184703010138"></xptr>
               <p>came in—Burke said, "You be—, call in two policemen, why I will murder three"—as soon as I called for the police he said to his brother, "Take your neckcloth off," which he did, I suppose, to prevent anybody catching hold of him—the policemen came in—it took ten or twelve people to put them out—they all tumbled out together—we shut the doors, and got rid of them—one of my sons was hurt, and was confined to his bed next day—the prisoner Edward dislocated my finger—I saw William the second time when they came to the door, but did not see Kelly to identify him, but have no doubt it was him, because his dress is the same—William took hold of me, and prevented my using my arms—he prevented my pushing Edward out.</p>

What was the size of the tap-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It will hold, I suppose, thirty people—I suppose there were thirty people there when I put the light out—my man held the door open—the light from the bar then shines into the tap-room—it is exactly opposite—it is a large door—William and Edward have both frequented my house this twelvemonth—I have heard that there are several of them in family, but I only know these two, and a very bad family they are—I did not see William at the Police-office when the charge was first made against Edward—he was not there on the second occasion—he was there afterwards—I went to identify him—they had got his brother—I said, "Yes, this is the man who was there," that was William—they did not bring any more of the family—he was kept in custody—I believe he was taken up because Edward said at the first exa<lb></lb>mination it was his brother Michael and him went into the tap-room—I did not know Michael; I only knew these two—if there is another I have scarcely seen him—I thought William was trying to get his brother away, and that he was doing it to do me service, as his brother had threatened my life several times, but I soon found that he was not—I made way for him to get hold of him—my tooth was dropping out, and I was out of breath—he did not protect my son.</p>

On Saturday night, the 13th Feb., Elson was brought there—I found he had considerable tenderness on the lower part of the belly, on the right side, with a swelling of the intestines and considerable pain, and also a pain in his back—he was much injured—he is now an out-patient of the hospital, in order to come down here—he is not under treatment now, because it is impossible to treat him while he is here—he is going back to be treaded—I think he will be in a fortnight—the injuries may have arisen from kicks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Strank, a greengrocer, of Moor Lane—we had apartments in the same house where the prisoner lodged—about twelve months ago I lent her some things to pledge to raise some money upon—I had applied to her for the money or the things back—on the night of the 17th July I was sitting in my parlour reading the newspaper, with the door open—the prisoner came in, and hauled me down off my chair by the hair of my head—she then took me up and smashed me down again, and also kicked me—I have the wound, but it has been sewn up—she went upstairs, came back, and did it again—she went upstairs a second time, and came back and wounded me again—what she did it with I do not know—no one came to my rescue—she cursed and swore all the time she was doing this—she was quite sober—I had not spoken to her at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When she gave me the things to pawn I gave her the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I got for them, and she told me to put away the ticket, that her husband should not see it.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 149).

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on the 17th July, about eight or half-past in the evening, Mrs. Strank was brought to my surgery—her face was covered with blood, and the whole of the front of her dress—she was bleeding freely from a cut wound on the forehead, just at the junction of the hair—I had to cut the artery through to stop the bleeding—there was a wound on the outer side of the month, another wound that I could place my two fingers in at the base of the jaw, and there was a fifth wound at the back of the head—that was a punctured wound—there were also several scratches and bruises about the face—the wound on the forehead must have been inflicted by some cutting instrument—it was a small wound about half an inch in length—it wounded a branch of a small artery—if the punctured wound was done by the same instrument it must have been pointed or sharp—the wound on the upper lip was given downwards—that must have been done by some cutting instrument, but it was jagged—the wound on the jaw may have been caused either by a blunt instrument or by a very sharp kick—the wound at the back of the head must have been from some pointed instrument—I was afterwards at the station, when the prisoner was being removed from the cell, and heard her say, "If I come out I will give it her again"—she was in a very excited state—I could not say she was drunk, but she was under the influence of liquor.</p>

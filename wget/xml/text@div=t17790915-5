The prisoner passed me. I was in a whiskey. He headed my horse, and rode up before me. They had each a pistol. Then the other stopped me, and the prisoner demanded my money. I delivered my watch, which was a gold one in a single case, to the prisoner, and half a guinea and an half crown in money.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - It wanted about a quarter of eight I believe: he had a white handkerchief tied under his chin, with an intention to disguise himself.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed as he is now? - He appeared to be dressed in dark clothes; his face looked remarkably pale and white. He was close to me during the time. He had white nankeen breeches on.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body upon the road at that time? - I saw carriages behind me; the next carriage behind me, I imagine, saw me stopped, for they attempted to stop the carriage, but it drove on. The prisoner's hat appeared to be slapped over his face.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - They appeared to be in a great hurry; they begged I would make no delay, but deliver my money immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake positively to swear that the prisoner was the person? - I do swear positively to his person.</p>
               <p>Was the watch found afterwards? - Yes; I believe it will be produced in court.</p>

               <p>On the second of September, a little after eight in the evening, the prisoner was brought into a publick-house, close to Battersea-bridge, on the Surry side, by five or six people. He had had a violent fall from his horse, and was then insensible. When he was brought in, after setting him in a chair, and examining to see if he had any bone broke, he came to himself. One Dover said to him, I have got your watch, Sir. He made for answer, I had no watch. Do you wear a watch in general? Yes. What kind of watch is your's when you wear a watch? A silver one. He was then asked where he lived. He said his name was Lake, that he was a taylor, No. 23, Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road. Nothing further passed then. Another person came in, and said Jem how do you do? Mr. Lake made no reply to him, but the person that accosted him said we have had a damned sober ride to Kew to day I think. The person who then came in went to the door to go about his business; he said; you had better stay here all night Jem, you will be taken proper care of, and I will be with you in the morning. As<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150009"></xptr> Mr. Lake appeared to me to be much in liquor, and stunned with the blow he got by the fall; he went out of the yard, and sell as he went to the gate, where they take the toll. He staid there some time. I believe he did not know which way he was going. He asked if somebody would go home with him; he had before said where he lived, and offered any body two shillings to go home with him.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About a quarter after eight. He went away, and I went about my business.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt that this is the person? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am the person that gave him the horse, and that direction.</p>
               <p>Did he go away on horseback? - No; on foot. I sent the horse to the Black Raven inn at Battersea, in order to be taken proper care of.</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to send it there? - No; a Mr. Ivey, who is clerk of the bridge, desired me to have the horse taken care of, and I sent my servant with it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he so much in liquor that he could not go home on horseback, or was it from his hurt? - He appeared much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long after he came to himself did he deny the watch? - Almost immediately; for the man told him that he had found his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is this from Nine Elms turnpike? - Better than two miles.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>He immediately denied the watch, and then told you his name was Lake? - Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Is that his name? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>And did he live in Goodge-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he said that without any kind of hesitation at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He does live in Goodge-street? - I know no more than what I heard at Sir

In a few minutes after this happened, by what light there was, I could see some people collected together upon the bridge. I went up; there was a person thrown from his horse, who was very much hurt; he was by several people carried off the bridge to Mr. Munday's.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner that person? - Yes; in about an hour afterwards another person came to demand the horse that was secured. I refused him the horse, not being certain it was his. I made some doubt of it. He told me I might be satisfied that the horse came from Westminster-bridge. I asked him what company he was in? He said none at all, he was by himself. I asked him how his horse came without him? He said his horse threw him at the foot of the bridge. I remarked the oddness of two people being thrown so near together, one at the foot of the bridge, the other on the Battersea side, about the middle.</p>
               <p>This horse that you secured was the horse that afterwards was sent home to the last witness? - Yes; when I told him the other person was thrown, and appeared to be very much hurt, and that he was at Mr. Munday's, he said, I will go and see him. He went in. I went in presently afterwards. He made some jocular speech to the prisoner. He said, Jemmy, we have had a sober ride, or something to that purpose. Presently afterwards he advised him to stay there all night to be taken care of. Soon afterwards he disappeared, and I saw no more of him. The prisoner, when he came out from Mr. Munday's, stopped some time at the gate. Some questions were asked him concerning the watch. He said he had no watch about him; the watch that was produced and shown him he said was not his. He offered any person two shillings to go home with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150011"></xptr> and mentioned his name and the place where he lived. He said his name was Lake; that he was a taylor, and lived in Goodge-street.</p>
               <p>Court. You said the other horse ran through the gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it ever stopped? - I never heard any thing of that horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The fact is two people were thrown off upon the bridge that evening; - Yes; the horses came within two minutes of each other without their ri ders.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the apprehending of the prisoner. I went to search his lodging, in Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road; I believe it is No. 23. I brought these nankeen breeches and waistcoat, and a pair of boots, up to the office.</p>
               <p>When did you search his lodging? - The robbery was committed on the Thursday, this was on the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took a white cambrick handkerchief out of my pocket which I wrapped my hand up with.</p>
               <p>Jealous. That was taken out of his pocket by my partner; he is not here; I expect him every minute.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Was it a white handkerchief that was tied under his chin? - It was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination of Jealous.</p>
               <p>You found him at his lodgings on the Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had not left his lodgings then? - No; I found him in bed.</p>
               <p>What business is he? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman said I could not be contented, after I had robbed the gentleman, but I must leave my boots, spurs, and pistol upon the bridge; my wife said no, I had not done that, for they were in my lodging.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Was you long enough with these people, when they robbed you, to observe whether they were drunk or sober? - I think they were much in liquor.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- SPAUGHTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a painter. I have known Lake four years; he is a taylor. I never heard any thing dishonest of him in my life. He was four years with a father-in-law of mine before I was acquainted with him. I never heard the least stain on his character in my life.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher in Goodge-street. He lodged with me near six years. He lodged two months next door, before he came to me. I always looked upon him as an honest young fellow; he seemed willing to get any work, and always did it out of hand.</p>
               <p>Has he any family? - A wife and child.</p>
               <p>What hours did he keep? - Very good hours, and generally came in sober.</p>

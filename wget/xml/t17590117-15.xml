               <p>Q. Was you sober when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Gaston. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Gaston. When I went to bed, I had three guineas and a half in my purse, and a watch with a black shagreen case; these were all in my breeches, which I laid under my head, and in the morning, breeches and all were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for charging the prisoner with taking them?</p>
               <p>Gaston. There was nobody in the room but she; I took her before a Justice of the peace, and she denied having taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Gaston. I was awake at twelve o'clock in the night, and heard the watch going under my head; she call'd to me at four o'clock, and said the soldier and his wife were not come to bed; then I fell asleep, and slept 'till near seven o'clock, then I miss'd the things, and she was gone.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170011"></xptr>Q. Have you ever met with any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Gaston. I had the watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is it?</p>
               <p>Gaston. I was obliged to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Gaston. Her husband, as she calls him, is in the Marshalsea-prison, and a person that lives near More-fields, delivered it to me; he said, he had it not from the prisoner, but he had it from her husband, or another man from the Marshalsea-prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that man that delivered it to you?</p>
               <p>Gaston. He is not here: I had also my breeches return'd me by a prisoner in the Marshalsea-prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The room had never a lock to it, it was a common lodging-house, and several people lay in the next room. I am falsely accused.</p>

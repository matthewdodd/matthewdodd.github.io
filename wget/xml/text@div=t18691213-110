                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of 19, Stewart Street, Old Artillery Ground—on the night of 24th February, I shut up my house safe a little after 11, when I retired to rest—I rang the bell at 6 o'clock in the morning, for the servant, and she went down stairs first—I went down afterwards and found that the house had been broken into, and missed two coats, five table cloths and other things—the kitchen window was open—it was shut down the night before, and to the best of my belief, latched, but the shutters were not shut—I afterwards saw my things at the station-house, they were given up to me.</p>

About 5.45 on the morning of 25th February, I went to 32, Flower and Dean Street, and there saw the prisoner with two men and a female, the prisoner had a bundle in his hand—when they saw me they made their escape out of the back way of the lodging-house—the prisoner dropped the bundle, I have known him a long time and am sure he is the man, I was close to him—I picked up the bundle, it con<lb></lb>tained coats, table cloths, an umbrella and other things—I searched the lodging-house, and found the clock up stairs on a bed in one of the rooms—I afterwards examined the prosecutor's house, and found it had been broken into—I apprehended the prisoner on 25th November, in a lodging-house, in Flower and Dean Street—I had not seen him since—I told him the charge—he said I was mistaken.</p>

On 26th November, I had been bad for some time, and not having means to procure proper lodgings, I went to lodge in one of these streets in Spitalfields. I had not been there above an hour, when this policeman walks in and takes me for this burglary; I know nothing at all about it. He swean he saw me run away, and saw nothing remarkable about me; I am lame with my left foot, which he would have noticed, if it had been me.</p>

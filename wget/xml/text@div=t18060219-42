On the 27th of January, about a quarter before five o'clock in the evening, I received information from a woman; in consequence of which I pursued the woman prisoner, and stopped her in Camomile-street, and took a piece of print from her, which she had under her cloak; there was a a man with her, who appeared to be assisting her. I brought them both back to my shop, and gave charge of them; she was dragging the print on the ground, he picked up the print and gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the print in your shop. - A. It was fixed on an iron just withinside of the door.</p>

             sworn. I am a warper; I was coming down Bishopsgate-street, I see the woman come round from Mr. Moore's shop, I did not see her come out, I saw something dragging on the ground, I thought it was her gown at first, till I saw about four yards of it, I then saw the man run after her, and put it under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them in company before. - A. No, I told the gentleman I thought they had stole it; Mr. Moore ran after her, and took them.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence. Me and my husband went out to buy two pair of shoes and some meat; we bought them and was coming home; my husband met a man, and stopped behind to speak to him, I walked on slowly, I knew he would soon come up, as I went on I saw this piece of cotton on the ground, I picked it up, this woman says half of that is mine, I says you have no right to that, you did not pick it up; she says if you do not let me have half, I will make you sorry for it; I said you may make me sorry for it if you like, if I knew the owner of it he should have it; when my husband came up I had it in my hands, I told him I had picked the cotton up off the curb stones, and that woman wanted half, he said if you picked it up off the curb stones it is your own, he said he wished he knew who it belonged to; I staid on the curb stone about a quarter of an hour; the gentleman came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said you must come back, you have got something belonging to me; I went back with him into the shop, and laid my shoes, meat, and the print on the counter; he says have you been stealing these shoes and the meat too; I said neither, I was taken into the kitchen, the constable stripped me naked to my shift, he found nothing on me but the key of my door, and the ticket of my own counterpane. When the gentleman brought me into the shop he seemed confused, he asked whether it was sold, and if I did not pay for it, he said I should suffer.</p>
               <p>Gardner's Defence. I had been out along with my wife, I met an acquaintance of mine, I stood talking to him at the corner of Camomile-street a quarter of an hour or better, I overtook my wife in Camomile-street, she shewed me that piece of print, she said she had picked it up, I told her it was then certainly her own, and she had no right to give half of it away; when Mr. Moore overtook us, we returned back with him, I told him if it was his piece of print there it was for him; Mr. Moore told me that I had nothing to do with it, I might go about my business; I stopped a little time in the shop, and when the officer came he took me in custody.</p>
               <p>Gardner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

             was left in care of my house while I went into the country; I put her in to take care of my house; I first missed the things on Tuesday the 23d of July, the day I was going to return again, as I came to Town on the Monday, but it being a wet day I went to look for a great coat, and when I went to the spot where they were, there was never a one to be found; I naturally asked where my great coat was? she said she knew nothing at all about it; I said she must find them, or must have had improper people in the house, or must have made away with them; at ten o'clock at night she gave me an account it was pawned, and gave me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the duplicates of the other articles? - None but two great coats. I thought it was not a proper time of night to let her go out. When she got up in the morning I desired her to empty her pocket, for I was doubtful that she had got other duplicates; she pulled out her things, and in a pocket book, which she pulled out of her pocket, I found near twenty-five or thirty duplicates, five of which referred to my own property, and according to these duplicates I went to examine at three different pawnbrokers, and found the things.</p>

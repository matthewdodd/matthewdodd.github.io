                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, X 172). On 2nd June I was on duty in the Uxbridge Road, Ealing—I was riding a young horse coming from Shepherd's Bush, and noticed a cart coming along at a sharpish pace—the prisoner and two more men were in it—I knew them by sight—I had heard something of a robbery at Ealing at that time from a constable—I had not heard of the plate—I allowed the men to pass me, and then turned my horse's head again—I saw a basket in the cart, which I produce, with straw in it—I followed them toward East Acton Lane, and asked the prisoner to stop—he was driving—he put his horse into a walk—I asked him again to stop—he would not—I asked him a third time, and caught hold of the horse's head near the bit, and said, "I shall stop him"—he then struck his horse, and my horse reared, and the tire of their wheel caught my horse's hind quarters—they got away then—I came up with them again, and said I should follow them twenty miles till I stopped them—they went on, and I still followed them at a very sharp pace—I passed them then at a gallop—I got about fifty yards in front, turned my head, and saw the prisoner and the other two men jump out of the cart—I turned round and followed them across a wheat field—I went into a grass field, lost sight of the other two, and saw the prisoner—he got over a water ditch, and hid under a fence—I gave my horse into a gentleman's hand, and got over the ditch and caught him—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a watch—he said I had got him wrong for the watch—I took him to the station—I gave the cart in charge to a farmer—I found this plate basket and the other basket inside the cart, with the straw over it—I heard about the plate robbery about six or seven the same evening.</p>

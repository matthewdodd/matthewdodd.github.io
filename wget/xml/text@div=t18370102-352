                  </hi>. I live at Waltham-abbey. On Friday, the 23rd of December, I called at the White Hart, Stones-end, at half-past ten o'clock—I left my cart at the door, and came out, and the tilt of the cart was gone—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 67) On the 23rd of December I was in the Kingsland-road, and saw the prisoner loitering about—he went to the cart, at the White Hart, Kingsland-road, took something bulky, and went into Caroline-place—he came out, saw me, and ran round an errand cart and escaped—I watched, and spoke to the prosecutor—we stood there, and I saw the prisoner coming back to Caroline-place—we went to a dark place, and the prisoner went to the place and took this tilt up, and was making off—I rushed out, and took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was returning from Enfield—I stooped down—I thought it was a man rolled up, and before I got it up, they took me—I had no intention of stealing it—I never was near the cart. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I am quite sure he is the man who took it from the cart at first, and he was pointed out by a shopkeeper—no person could have seen it unless they turned into the place where it was—I saw him distinctly by the glare of the gas—I did not take him at first, because I could not get near enough to him—as soon as he saw me, he ran off—I had seen him previous to that, and had been close to him.</p>

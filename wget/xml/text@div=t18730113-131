I am a labourer, and live at 13, Granby Place, Drury Lane—the deceased and his wife, the prisoner, lived in the same house—and I occupied the second floor—on this Saturday I came home about 3 o'clock, and saw them going up stairs to their own room—I had to help Mr. Moriarty up stairs to his room because he was so drunk—I took him into his own room and put him into a chair—his wife followed me up, she was very drunk, too—I shut the door, left them there, and went up stairs to my own place, and about 7 o'clook I heard the prisoner's three children run down stairs hallooing—I had to go to market, and went down, and saw one of the boys with his back <hi rend="italic">agin</hi> the wall not far from the door outside—I spoke to him, and in consequence of something he said I went back, and went up into their room—the door was shut, but on the latch—I opened it, and saw the prisoner standing up <hi rend="italic">agin</hi> the door, and Mr. Moriarty lying on the floor, and blood all over the floor, and the bed was covered with blood—there was a great sheet bound about his head and shoulders, off of the bed, I think—after lifting the sheet off his head, I turned to the prisoner and said, "I'm d----d, Mrs. Moriarty, if you <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> killed the man"—she said, "Yes, I am the woman that done it, and I had an occasion for doing it, and a good job too"—she was neither drunk nor sober, she was excited—I saw her face all black or blue—she had a regular black eye—I noticed no other marks about her face—I went to Bow Street, and returned with two policemen—we were then met by Mr. Bowles, the deputy of the court.</p>

I live at 9, Granby Place, and am manager of the house and court where these people lived—I live two doors off—on the evening in question, about a quarter to 8 o'clock, the prisoner came into my room very excited, and trembling so that she sat down, and then she told me that she had hit Mr. Moriarty on the head with a chopper—I said "Have you really hit him on the head with a chopper?"—she said "Yes"—I said "With the blade of it?" she said, "Yes"—I said "Whereabouts?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner some time—she has been in the buildings eighteen months, and I knew her before, but was not much acquainted with her—she was a sober person, and very striving for her family—she has five children at home, and one daughter out at service—the prisoner took a good deal of trouble to get her a good situation—she was in the habit of keeping her home neat and tidy—on this very morning she came to me and said, "Mr. Moriarty has got a pocket full of money, go after him for the rent"—I said "Where is he t"—she said "Gone down the court"—I said "If he is out of the court I cannot go after him"—she said "Then I must get some"—I generally get the rent on a Monday, but he was seven weeks behindhand, and owed me 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—therentwas 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—he was only a labouring man—she continually tried to get the rent for me—she is a peaceable, orderly, well-disposed woman; very much so as a rule—on the Saturday evening when this took place, I saw them come from Mr. Brown's public-house in Stanhope Street together, at a little after 3—they were both a little the worse for liquor—I saw them go home, and indoors—she looked to me as if she had been knocked down then—she had a kind of dirty face as if she had been knocked down, or had fallen down—I did not see her any more till she came to me—when she pointed to her arms, there were bruises there—she pointed to a place on her cheek-bone, which appeared as if it had been recently done, it was red, and was turning blue—it appeared to have been a violent blow, it was a goodish-sized lump, it was causing her face to swell—she said that she was so knocked about that she did not know what to do, and she had told me on the Tuesday previous that she really must take her children into the workhouse if she did not get some money to pay the rent—she had complained to me of being ill-used before, and said that she was driven out of her house nine days, and did not go in.</p>

I have been a very good mother, but I am sorry to say my husband behaved a very great brute and a very great drunkard to me. I had to take my child in my arms and go in the street of a night from him. I have been always in and out of the workhouse with them. My husband turned me out, and kept me in the streets. This last accident that took place he was all the week drinking, and he left his work. He drew the last of his money on the Wednesday, and came home that evening drunk, and in a very bad temper. He asked for some dinner, and I gave it him. He seemed all the evening in a very bad temper. I tried to amuse him all I could. Between 5 and 6 o'clock a man named Dwyer came and asked my husband to assist him with some pota toes into his cellar. My husband was sitting by the fire drunk. He turned round and said, "What brought Dwyer up here?" I said, "He came for your assistance with some potatoes. "My husband said, "No, he did not;" and he said he came for a very bad purpose. Many words passed between us, and he got up and beat me round the head. I cried out very loud, but no one came to me. He kicked me with his naked feet; then he dressed himself and went out. I went out afterwards, and I went and told Dwyer what my husband had said. I did not go into my room again except when my husband was out. He was all the week drunk up to Saturday; he lay in bed with his clothes on. On the Sunday morning he took a lamp and other things to sell. He did not come home till late. He got up early on Mon day morning, and said he would not be home till late; he came home in the evening between 6 and 7 o'clock, and I left the room I was with my children all day. He worked on till Friday night, five days of the week. He came home on Friday about 9 at night; I went out, and a little time afterwards my husband went to the public-house; my third son followed him there, and asked for some money to get bread. After that my husband sent a child to me for two pawn-tickets, and I sent them to him He went up stairs to Kay's room and sent for drink, and he remained there till the public-houses were shut I called my children at 5.30 on Saturday morning to go to their work; my husband was in the room in bed, and I was afraid to go in. Between 10 and 11 o'clock on Saturday morning I saw my hus band washing himself in the room; he sent the boy for some coals; he gave him no money for bread. When my husband went out I went up to the room. After that I went to look for my husband, and I found him in the Yacht public-house having rum and water. I went next to Twyman's, in Wild Street, and there I saw him sitting down with the woman Twyman. I asked him if that was the way he was going to treat me; he laughed at me, and got up and took me to Callaghan's. Six months ago he took this woman up to my room and sent my children out. After leaving Callaghan's we went home, and my husband lay on the bed in his things. I sat down</p>

               <p>and went to sleep; when I awoke it was dark. I went to the room where my husband was, and he beat me round the head. I got from him and went to Bow Street police-station and saw the inspector, and asked him to send for my husband; he took no notice, and I went back. My husband said, "You have been to Bow Street, as usual, and I'll give you cause to go there. "He drew me from the door towards the fender: this chopper was against the fender. He said, "I'll do for you now;" he picked the chopper up. I threw myself on his arm, and I wrenched the chopper out of his hand. He dragged me towards the door, and I hit him twice on the head. I saw him bleeding, and I went to Mr. Beale's, the deputy's, place. I gave my husband a month's imprisonment about eight months ago."</p>

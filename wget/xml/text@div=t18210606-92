I paid him three 1 l. notes from the drawer, to pay the expences of a barge which he was to take to the country - he could see there was notes there. I left him in the next room - there was five 1 l. notes there. On coming into the room, I missed one. I am certain I only paid him three; I got an officer, he strongly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060055"></xptr>denied it; the officer searched him and found three on him, and some silver. The officer found the other note under his hat by the stable; the note he stole was with two others in his purse. I had taken the numbers of the three that were left, and know that to be one of them; he said he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you say anything to induce him to confess - A. No, he could see them in the drawer. I intended him to see them, as I suspected him before.</p>

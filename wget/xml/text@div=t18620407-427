                  </hi>. My husband keeps a tobacconist's shop, at St. Andrew's-hill—on Thursday, 6th March, I came out of the parlour into the shop to serve the prisoner who came and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacoo, the value of which was 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a good half-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I laid the two shillings on the counter carelessly—they were separate, one was not on the top of the other—the prisoner then laid down a penny and said, "Take it out of that"—my suspicions were then raised that something was wrong—he said, "Give me back my half-crown"—on his saying that, I cast my eye upon the shillings I had put down, and saw that a bad one lay on the top of the good one that I had given him—they were still on the counter, but not exactly in the position in which I had placed them—I said, "I see through this, you have laid a bad shilling on the top of my good one"—I have every reason to believe that the two shillings I gave the prisoner were good—my husband heard me say that he had given me a bad shilling, and he came forward, snatched the bad shilling from my hand, which the prisoner before that had tried to get from me, but had not succeeded—I had taken it up—at the time the prisoner was offering the penny, I saw his hand more, but I had no suspicion until he said, "Give me back the half-crown"—he was standing quite close to the two shillings.</p>

I heard my wife charge the prisoner with the shilling being bad, that he had rung the changes, and I came forward and took the bad shilling from my wife's hand, and told him that it was bad—I proceeded to try it in the detector—he endeavoured to take it from my hand as I was in the act of trying it, and not succeeding, he bolted, and I went after him—he was running away fast—I did not catch him—he was stopped by a policeman in plain clothes, and I gave him in charge with the bad shilling.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The witness, Henry Brown, has sworn to a falsehood; he says he took the shilling off the counter, and the woman says she had them in her hand and never let them out of her hand; they lay on the counter, and all the time we were talking about them I could have taken them up off the oounter and gone about my business if I had liked; not being guilty, I let them lay there. She does not say she saw me touch the shillings, and I never handled them. She never marked or weighed the money, or sounded it, or tried it in the detector. She does not say what sort of shillings they were, Victoria, or William, or George the Third; she does not know whether they were good or bad. She say, "I think they were two good ones." The shilling that dropped out of my pocket was my own, and if it had not been I should never have given it up, but they held out a promise to me that they would not press the charge against me if I would give it up; I gave it np willingly. If ever there was a man sent to this Court innocent, I am that man, and as for running I was too tipsy to run. I had gone half way down the street when the prosecutor left the shop. He came up to me; I shoved him off with my-right hand, I never ran at all. He says I took it off the counter. That is a falsehood, and if he will say that he will say anything. I have got a respectable hard-working wife. I gave correct address, and the policeman saw my home, a clean respectable looking home. I have a family. I have no occasion to do such things. If I had done what a cunning man would have done, I should have put the had shilling under the good one, and not the bad shilling at the top.</p>

            . My husband's name is William; on the 10th of October, we lost the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name) the prisoner used to come every night till the night we were robb'd for a week before, and us'd to stay till we lock'd up the door; but the night we were robb'd she went away betwixt six and seven o'clock; I suspected she had taken them, because she had bought herself some new things, and she also being a person of bad same. I went to justice Welch, and got a warrant, and took her up, and charged her with taking them; and she own'd she did take them before several people.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she took them?</p>
               <p>E. Griffith. She said she came in at the back door, and we locked her in the house, and she took and carried all the things to her lodgings; we took her up but last night; she had pawn'd the watch, and here is a pawnbroker in court with whom she has pawn'd two white aprons, and one black silk apron, which he would not deliver; I ask'd her what she had done with the money; and she said she had spent that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>

            . I am beedle of Clarkenwell; Mrs. Griffith denied me to go along with her, her husband being now in misfortunes in Bedlam. I went, and we took the prisoner, and she charged her with taking the things mentioned; she own'd the fact; and here are part of the things which we found. I found the tea chest at the Half Moon at Islington, she delivered to us two aprons, some caps, and a pair of sleeves; she own'd she had sold the eighteen pieces of brass, which were shuffleboard pieces, for 16 d. I went to the pawnbrokers, nam'd Ellis, in Abel's buildings, Rosemary lane, for the watch, and told him it was stolen; he delivered it to me. ( produced and depos'd to by prosecutrix)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Ellis's?</p>
               <p>Clark. The prisoner went along with me there, and said she had pawn'd it at that house.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hall. The prosecutrix lives opposite me; she sent for me, and said, she had been robbed, and had a suspicion of the prisoner; we got a warrant, and I went with her, and we found the prisoner at Islington; there I saw the tea chest standing on a chest of drawers; then she confessed she had taken the other things; we went according to her directions, and got the watch, and some other things produced here.</p>

               <p>I did not pawn the watch; the woman that pawn'd them they had in custody last night, and they let her go; I know nothing about any of the things.</p>

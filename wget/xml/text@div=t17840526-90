               <p>The prisoner came up to me on Monday night last, a little after nine, on Hounslow Heath, on the side of the road, and he gave me a kick on the side of the ribs, two more were with him, I had been asleep, and was just awaked, I had been hard at work, he asked me what I lay there for, with that he caught hold of my arm, and pulled me up and said, where are you going? you shall go home, and they dragged me along, and pushed me along, they said they would have me home, for they were going that way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you in liquor? - No, not then, I was a little before, but no great deal, they dragged me along the space of a quarter of a mile, and then they dragged me up a lane, and this man put his hand in my pocket, and took my money out of my pocket; I caught his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - No, only jostled and hugged me.</p>
               <p>Under what pretence was it? - I suppose the pretence was to rob me, they pretended to carry me home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260109"></xptr>He did not ask any money from you? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor make use of any threatening? - No, when he had taken my money out I said, this will not do, then the other took hold of me and searched my breeches pocket; in half an hour I saw him again, I found them at the publick house, I said they had just robbed me, and out they came, I knew the men very well, one of them run away, I never saw them before.</p>

               <p>The prisoner is a stranger, I never saw him but once before that night, and I believe it was in the course of the day; last Monday night about ten, the prisoner and two men came into my house and called for a pint of beer, and drinking of the third pint I heard somebody call Joe, Joe, at the door; I went, and it was this Dewell, says he, are there three strange people in your house? I said yes; he said they have robbed me, where is a constable? As we were talking the men came out, and took a small circle round us, they did not come immediately before us, we immediately drew towards them, John looked at them, says he, these are the people that robbed me, he gave a snatch at one of them, but he missed his hand, and he ran away from him, and he ran I suppose about a hundred yards, and I heard a scuffle, and I thought he had got him, but when I came up to him he had only tumbled down, and the man was run off; he then says, that is the man that has robbed me, that took the money out of my pocket, and he left me to go for an officer, and before the officer came the other ran away; then they took this man to the Justice's; he was searched at the Justice's, we did not think of searching him before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Dewell sober at this time? - He was not drunk, he was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was he quite sober? - I did not perceive any thing deficient in him I give you my word, to the best of my knowledge he was sober.</p>
               <p>Answer the question? - I think he was sober then, what he had been I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing after he was taken? - A very trifle indeed.</p>
               <p>What was that trifle? - Nothing particular that I know of.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what it was? - He said, says he, master I will not run away from you; says I, young man, it is of no use.</p>
               <p>He did not attempt to run away? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he was innocent or guilty? - No.</p>

             came up and called the landlord out and asked him if there were some strange men in the house, and two men slipped out, and the prosecutor followed them, and when he came up again, says he, damn them, they are gone, but here is one of them: I came from Stroud in Berkshire, I never was in London twice before.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in the first place, with respect to the capital part of the charge, a robbery on the highway, which is taking money or goods from the person of a man by force or fear, against his consent, and the essence of the crime consists either in violence to the person, or putting in fear; now it does not appear that the money taken from the man at this time was taken with that degree of force which the law seems to require to constitute an highway robbery; there was no putting in fear, no weapon used, but whilst they were pulling him along, under pretence of taking care of him, this man slipped his hand into his pocket, and he found his hand in his pocket, if you believe that the money was taken at first, in the manner he describes, it was not by fear, but by having his arm over him, and there does not seem a sufficient degree of force to constitute a highway robbery. If you are satisfied therefore that he stole the money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260110"></xptr> I think it would be too much to find him guilty of the capital part.</p>

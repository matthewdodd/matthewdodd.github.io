               <p>COURT. Q. Did she own she had taken it before you said you would forgive her, if she gave you back the money? A. No, I think not - she did not tell me that till I told her I would forgive her, I think; but I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. After she gave you some account, did you require to have her boxes searched? A. Yes; I fetched the landlord of the house up - they were searched by three people - I was present, and the master and mistress of the house - among other things found, my maid found a piece of paper in a box or bag of hers - I was in the room when it was found - it was a rough memorandum which I had made of the money, and had left with the money in my desk - it is in my own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever told the prisoner you had money in the desk? A. No; I am a widow - I had never sent her to the bureau for money - she has been to it for other things - she came to me on the 30th of December - I had a good character with her - I returned from Bath on the 15th or 16th of August - it was safe then - and I then put 35l. into it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you returned from Bath there was 55l. in the desk, and you put 35l. to it? A. Yes; this is the memorandum I had in the desk with the money - it contains the particulars of the money I had before I went to Bath - there were several other memorandums with it - I missed all the papers.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell us when you last saw that memorandum before the 31st of August? A. I never saw it since I came from Bath - I left it safe when I went there.</p>

I came into the prosecutrix's service on the 7th of October - I found this memorandum last Friday in the prisoner's room among her papers - I was looking into her boxes by mistress's direction - this was after she was committed for trial - I did not come into service till the 7th of October - I found the memorandum either in a box or bag; but the room was in great confusion, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bag in a box? A. I cannot tell - there were several bags - some bags hung in a closet in the room - the closet door was locked - there was no padlock on the bags - any body could open them - the boxes were all locked - I received the keys of them from mistress, who was in the room when I found the paper, nobody else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Lindsey Smith, and live at Sydenham Common, in Kent—my maiden name was Hoy—I was present at a mar<lb></lb>riage between my sister, Emma Hoy, and the prisoner, at the parish church of St. Luke, Middlesex, on the 30th of Oct., 1836—they continued to reside together about seven years—they had a child by that marriage—I remember my sister leaving him the last time—I thinly she came to me in less than a week afterwards—that was in Nov., 1843—the child was with its mother—my sister is still living.</p>

On the 8th of December, between four and five in the afternoon, a young woman informed me I had lost a piece of meat; she took me to a court adjoining my house; there I saw the prisoner. I said, give me my meat that you have taken; she endeavoured to drop it; I caught it, it was part of a rump of beef.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner get away from you. - A. I took the beef and came home; the prisoner came to the door and remained there a long time, an hour almost, demanding the meat. An officer came by; I told him what had passed; he took her to the office in Worship-street.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. When I came up to the shop I observed the prisoner at the bar there and about forty or fifty people round the door; she wanted Mrs. Adams to give her some meat which she said belonged to her; Mrs. Adams told me she had detected her with two pieces of beef, one part of a rump and the other part of a mouse buttock; Mrs. Adams claimed the rump; the prisoner said she had bought the mouse buttock in Leadenhall-market; she did not claim the rump; while she was telling me that a man of the name of Patch, right opposite of Mrs. Adam's, said the piece of mouse buttock was stolen from his shop, he knew it to be his; I took the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The mouse buttock I bought in Leadenhall-market, it cost me two shillings; they took the meat from me and knocked it about my head. I never took the bit of meat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

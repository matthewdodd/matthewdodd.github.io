             sworn. - I am pot-boy to Mr. Roberts; I was getting my pots in between five and six in the evening, last Friday; I was going up stairs, at No. 88, London Wall, and was informed that the prisoner had taken up the strap into his hand three or four times; then I saw him go to the pots, and when he saw me, he walked away; the strap was lying at the corner of Phillip-lane, the strap was left full of pots; I put the strap down again, at No. 14, London-wall, and I went to No. 10. and while I was knocking at the door, I saw him take a pint pot off the strap; I came up to him, and walked by the side of him, till I got to my own door, and then I called my master, and the prisoner took to his heels, and ran down Aldermanbury, and I went after him, calling stop thief, till a man knocked him down, and when they lifted him up, the pint pot fell from under his coat; I took it up; I have had it ever since;(produces it;) he was taken before the Alderman and committed.</p>

               <p>Roberts. This is my pot; I went in pursuit, but the prisoner was got up before I came up to him; I did not see the pot picked up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been out all day drinking, I do not know any thing about the pot; I was not knocked down at all.</p>

I live at 33, Redwood Row, Stepney, and am a cabinet maker—about 7.30 on the evening of 25th August, I was passing from High Street to Stepney Green, when I saw the deceased, Thomas Hines cross the road opposite Garden Street—on hearing a vehicle coming up at a rapid rate, I turned, and saw the prisoner driving a horse and four-wheeled van—I said, "For God's sake, pull up, or you will kill the poor old man"—he took no notice of what I said, and then the near shut struck the deceased on the left breast, and turned him completely orer, and he fell head foremost on the ground—the prisoner did not stop his van, but went over towards the Royal Oak, Stepney Green, and he proceeded 180 or 200 yards before he pulled up—I followed him as far as I could—I lost sight of him, but in five or ten minutes afterwards I saw him walk out of the Maid and Magpie yard—he was a great deal the worse for drink—I told him he had knocked a man down on Stepney Green, if he had not killed him—I gave him in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the 2d of June lose two saws, a rule, and a gimlet? - A. We missed them, I believe, about three months since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all at one time? - A. No, one of the saws was taken from a job in <placeName id="t18050710-64-crimeloc360">Rolls-buildings</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see that saw again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the prisoners at work in Rolls-buildings? - A. No, only Sims; the other saw was taken from our work-shop; we found that by a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. They are two different transactions, we will take that the last - you found that by a duplicate? - A. Yes, in Sims's lodgings; we missed this saw about three months ago; we took Sims up first; on the 2d of July we took Sims at the public-house, and then I went with Chapman to search the lodgings; we found this duplicate of the saw; Sims said he was very sorry he had so many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge with him? - A. Yes, Watson; they both denied any knowledge of the saw when we charged them with it; I found the saw by the duplicate found in the lodging of the prisoners at the top of Hatton-wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was this saw your partner's property, or the property of yourself? - A. The property of my partner and myself.</p>

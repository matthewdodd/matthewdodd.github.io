               <p>Q. Did he put the pistol up when you told him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q.What money had he? - A guinea and a half, and nine shillings, as near a I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was there? - It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see enough of the prisoner to be sure of his person again? - His person I had surveyed before, and the horse, it was a horse rather remarkable marked, and his face, during the time of the robbery, he covered with his handkerchief, I did not see his face at that time</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen enough of his face before? - No, I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other circumstances by which you think you should know him? - By the general appearance of the horse and man, his coat and dress.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the horse? - The stable keeper is here, who hired him the horse; I have seen the horse, and I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt about the prisoner being the man? - Yes, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190019"></xptr>not like to swear to him, because his face was covered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. On your examination before the magistrate you entertained great doubts, and did not speak so positive as you have now done? - I said the general appearance of the man left no doubt in my mind, but on account of his face being covered I would not take on me to swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. He was remanded to a second examination? He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you still had the same doubts? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was remanded again on account of this circumstance? - It was not, it was on account of the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. What figure was the other man? - Not at all like this, a short man.</p>

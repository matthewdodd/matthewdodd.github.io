            . I am a constable. Dyson came to me on the 17th of November, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening, I went with him to Mr. Marshall's, and saw the prisoner with two companious; I secreted myself in a doorway, in James'-street, where I had a command of his actions - I found him and his companions repeatedly going up to the window; they attempted to get the glass out, and every time they attempted it, I passed them and saw the glass was secure, except the crack - the last time I saw the prisoner take from the window some articles, but could not perceive at the moment what they were; I went up and tried to catch hold of him first - he ran away and I after him; I cried out Stop thief! and as he ran he threw the glass bottles from him in every direction, from his hat and his pocket; I caught him at the corner of Mary-le-bone-street, and never lost sight of him - I was so close that I struck him with my staff three times: one or two patrols assisted me in taking him - it was five or ten minutes after six o'clock when we took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you took me back, I asked you where my hat was? A. You did: I believe somebody had taken his hat from his hand, but I cannot say - I thought he had thrown it away with the bottles, as he threw his handkerchief away; he ran at a tremenduous rate - if it had not been for the patrols, I do not think we should have taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said "Your hat is right, you can have it directly"? A. I do not recollect saying so.</p>

             I am watch-house-keeper of St. James'. The prisoner was brought to me on the 17th of November, soon after six o'clock in the evening; two smelling-bottles, a toilet-bottle, and some broken pieces of bottles were delivered to me, by the patrols, who picked them up - Dyson delivered me both the smelling-bottles, and Powell the toilet-bottle; I have had them ever since - Dyson delivered me the hat; I offered it to the prisoner, and he denied it being his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him mine was a silk hat, and that was a beaver one. Witness. He said his was a silk hat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing along the street, and going tdwards the square, heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round, and saw a young man following me; I was stopped and accused of robbery, and in the bustle lost my hat: as I was taken to the doctor's shop, I asked the constable where my hat was - he said I should have it directly; he had picked it off the ground.</p>

            . On Monday night the 2 d. of November, before the clock struck three, I was sitting in my watch-box, Ball came by with a bundle on his back; I took him to the watch-house, When I came to Holles-street, he said to the other prisoner, Ralph, come along and speak, you know where I had the things; when we came to the watch-house, I asked what things were in the bag; he said, there are something of every thing, good and bad; I said, that is no answer; then he said there were bedding; I looked, and found there were the things laid in the indictment; when I came out of the watch-house, the other prisoner was standing there; he said, what have you done with the old clothes-man; the next morning I took Ball before the Justice; there he said he bought the things of Ralph and two women; soon after Ralph came, Justice Spinnage took him backwards and examined him; upon enquiring, I found Mr. Lawson's house had been broke; then we went to the house and found the bricks out of the wall under the kitchen window, in the area; then we went up stairs and found the bed furniture gone; (the goods produced and deposed to by Mrs. Cole as Mr. Lawson's property.)</p>

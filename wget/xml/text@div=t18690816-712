                  </hi>. I live with my father, at the King's Head beer-shop Lea Bridge—on 20th July last, about 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner and another man came to the house together; the other asked for a pint of cider, and gave me a shilling—I gave him sixpence and threepence change—they went down the garden and took the cider with them—I put the shilling at the top of the till—the till goes down with a slant—the money does not go to the end unless you push it—there was other money in the till; but not at the top—I left the shilling on the slant—I afterwards went with my father to the till, and found the shilling on the slant, where I had put it—my father took it out—I noticed it was very bright—I then saw my father speak to the two men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am father of the last witness—on 20th July I came home about 2.30—shortly after the prisoner came in from the gardens and asked for some tobacco—I gave him a half-ounce and two pipes—that would be twopence—he gave me a bad shilling in payment—I tried it with my teeth—I threw it down and said it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>—I was going to bite it again—he said, "Don't bite it any more; I know where I got it from, and can get it changed"—he then paid with copper money, and took up the shilling—he went back to the garden and met another person of the name of Ellison, at the bottom of the garden—they came out of the garden about ten minutes after, and one of them brought in the pint pot—in consequence of something my daughter said, I went to the till, and saw a bad shilling on the slant of the till—I went out after the men, and found them about thirty yards away—I went and collared one, and brought him into the house, and the other one followed him—I sent for a policeman, and gave them in charge—I took the shilling to the station, and gave it to the constable on duty.</p>

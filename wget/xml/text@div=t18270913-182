Soon after four o'clock on the morning of the 24th of August; when I came down, I missed this floor-cloth, which must have been drawn from under the door. I went up stairs again, and in about a quarter of an hour I looked out of the window, and saw a person standing against the gas-light post. The prisoner came up to him with this roll of cloth under his arm - I went down and pursued them - the other got away - I took the prisoner into custody; when I first saw him he was about four doors from our house - it was then about five o'clock. The other person had something in his hand, but I could not see what - the prisoner said he found it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BARRON. I am master of this house. I know this cloth to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and that young man asked me to carry this for him, which I did. He turned his head and said "There is somebody coming," and he ran away. I did not run because I had done no harm.</p>

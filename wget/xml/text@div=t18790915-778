                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Cave, of Birmingham—on the 27th June the prisoner brought me this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 27,1879. Mr. Cave, Dear Sir,—If you have sold the cart I sent to you on the 18th inst., please send an open cheque for same by bearer and oblige yours truly, F. H. Hunter.") I looked into the sales book and found a trap was sold and the account had been made out—I compared it with the sales book and found it correct—I initialed it and filled up the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked "B.

Hunter and gave it to the prisoner—Mr. Cave signed it in the clerk's office—I fancy the "79 "on the cheque is in my writing, but nothing else—the endorsement on the back is in blue ink "John Andrews"—the number on the counterfoil agrees with that on the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not seen the prisoner before he brought me the letter—I knew a cart had been sold for Mr. Hunter—one of the clerks in the office (Goodeve) would know about the transaction whose special duty it is to receive instructions in this way for carts—there are about seven clerks in the office, but at the time of the signing of the cheque there were about three and Mr. John Cave—it is not usual for the parties to send for their cheques as we generally send them by post—the prisoner when he came to me had a moustache—I did not omit that from the description to the Birmingham police, which I gave on the Monday following the Saturday the fraud was practised (the 30th)—his face was very dirty—slight whiskers as of a week's growth.</p>

               <p>day—I saw him the next day about 8.20 a.m.—he made the remark that he had come rather early, and that he expected to meet a young man about 9—I afterwards saw Phillips and showed him in to the prisoner—there was no blue ink in the rooms when he took them—I saw some there after he left, about 9.40 that morning—I did not see him again till I saw him at the Mansion House—I am sure the prisoner is the man, only when he came to our house he had bushy whiskers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had a good deal of hair all round his face—I could not see his lips because of his moustache—he had a hat on—the lower part of his face is different now, but the upper is just the same—I noticed the time he went out, as I happened to go into the parlour—he said he should not come again till Monday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the General Post-office—I produce a letter which was returned through the Dead Letter Office, addressed to Messrs. Eastman and Co., 16, Curzon Street, May Fair—on the back are the words, "Not known," put on by the postman of the district—the letter was returned by the district office to the General office—it reached London on 29th June—it was opened by another clerk—then is a cheque inside, and it was brought to me as the head of the department, en account of its having a cheque in it, and there being no address to which it might be returned.</p>

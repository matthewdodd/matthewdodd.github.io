                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Stanlake, Oxfordshire. About 8th or 9th Dec. I came up to town to receive 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received it on Friday, the 12th, at Groves's, and different places, and returned with it to Mr. Barwell's, of the Marlborough Arms—I left it with him, and went into New Oxford-street, and met the prisoner there—he asked me whether I had been to the cattle show—I told him I had—he then asked me if I knew where Wadley was, and Latchford, and Farringdon, which is near where I was living—I said that I did, and he asked me if I knew Mr. Goodluck, the squire—I said, "Yes"—he said that he had been living there the best part of his time, and since then at Reading—he asked me where I was going—I said, "To Mr. Barwell's, to have a glass of beer"—he said that he would go with me; he pointed to a house, and we went in—there were several people eating, and he said that we would not stop there—we went to a second, a third, and a fourth public house; the fourth was empty, and he said, "This will do, we can have a pipe here"—it was near Mr. Bar<lb></lb>well's, close to Oxford-market—he called for a pint of porter, and paid for it; we had another pint, and I paid for that—a man then came in, and said that he had been kept out of a certain sum of money for the last six years, and had now got it; that it was 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and twenty houses, and that there was a certain sum to be given to the poor in different parishes—(he did not appear to know the prisoner)—the prisoner said that he should like to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to distribute where he was living, Reading, and said, "I dare say my friend," meaning me, "would like to do so also?"—I said, "No, it would be only a nuisance to me"—he said, "You may as well have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—the other man said that we must have a little capital of our own, and the prisoner pulled out a sovereign and a shilling, and said that that was all the money he had got, and asked me what money I had—I said that I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had left at Mr. Barwell's—the prisoner said that I might as well go and fetch it, to show that I had some, and he would go with me; so we went to the Blenheim-steps, and I went and fetched it, and came back, and the other man was standing outside the door—he said that if we would go down Tottenham-court-road, to his clerk's office, he would pay us—we went round the back way, and went to a public house, I forget the name; the other man said, "We will have a pint of beer"—the prisoner said, "We can drink a quart," so we had a quart—the other man paid for it, and said, "I will go to my clerk's office, and then I will pay you"—the prisoner heard that—the other man only drank a little drop out of one of the glasses, and was going out to his office when the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "How do we know that you will come back?"—he said, "I will leave my capital in your hands," and he did so, and the prisoner put his handkerchief over it—it was a pocket book, with some notes he said they were—he showed me some papers, which he said were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, but they were not very near to me—he came back in a little time, and said that his clerk would be there, and if we would go and get two stamped receipts he would give us the money, but said, "How do I know you will come back?"—the prisoner said, "I will leave my capital in your hands, and I dare say my friend will"—the prisoner then put his purse into the other man's hat—he had showed me a sovereign in it, as he said, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I said, "I shall not put my capital into his hat"—he went and fetched two stamped receipts, and wanted me to go outside with him, but I would not—he showed me two bits of paper, but I did not have them in my hands—he</p>

               <p>sat down, and the other man got up and went out, and said that he had been to his clerk again, and he could not come yet—he brought two purses back, which he said he had given a shilling for in the street—the prisoner said that he should very much like to have one of them—the other man said, "You shall have one, give me your money, and I will put it in for you"—he handed him his money, and he put it in—the prisoner then said, "No doubt my friend would like to have the other purse?"—I said, "It is of no use to me, as I have got one;" but he over persuaded me to have it, and so did the other—he said, "You give me your money, and I will put it in"—I said, "No, if you like to make me a present of the purse, I will put it in"—he said, "You hold the purse, and I will put the money in "—the purse remained in my hands all the time—the prisoner said that it did not appear that his clerk was coming very quickly, and he should much like to have a sovereign for his trouble—the other man put a sovereign in, and gave him the purse back—he then said, "My friend would like to have a sovereign, no doubt," meaning me—he said, "You give me your purse, and I will put it in for you"—I said, "No, if you like to make me a present of a sovereign well and good, I can put it in"—he held out his hand for me to take the sovereign, and as I was looking, the other man snatched the purse out of my hand, and pretended to drop a sovereign into it, and then gave it to me back—I was then between them; one was on one side, and one on the other—he said that he was just going across the road to a shop, and would send the shopman across to me, and make me a present of something—they both went out, and I was almost certain that I had been cheated; that was the first time that that dawned upon me—I did not look at the purse, but went out at the door, and saw them both running very fast—I ran after them more than 100 yards, and then caught the pri<lb></lb>soner, and said, "You have got my money"—he said, "I have not, you go and catch the other man"—I said, "No, I shall take you"—he tried to get away, but I said that it was of no use, as I intended to hold him; he struggled, but I held him, and gave him into custody—I found in the purse 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and seven counterfeit sovereigns—I gave the purse to the policeman, in the same state as I received it from the third man—it was a net purse, put on the outside of the other which I had got; mine was a sort of bag—the fellow purse was not found, but I saw it when the prisoner received it from the third person; it was exactly like this—I was perfectly sober—I had only had one glass of beer before I went in, but the part of the three pints of porter which I took had a wonderful effect upon me—some of the last pint was left when they ran away—when I left the second public house I was in no wise drunk, but I found the ill effects of the two pints of porter, I was quite as well as I was when I left the first public house.</p>

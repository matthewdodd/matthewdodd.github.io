               <p>(The parcel deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether these books were included in the parcel you put in the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why it was covered then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it wrapped in the same papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How can you swear that those books that are in that opened package were the same books, that were wrapped in that parcel? - Because the prisoner had untied the parcel, and left the paper as it was. I went out of the yard at six o'clock on the 21st of Jan. I went to the Green Man and Still, where we take up parcels or passengers, I got off the box, and went into the warehouse, and there was no parcels, when I came out again, this gentlewoman (the prisoner was standing by the door of the coach, she asked me what coach it was, I told her the Worcester coach, she said she was going to Hayes, and asked me the fare, I told her 2 s. 6 d. and I let her into the coach.</p>
               <p>Where did you deposit the parcel you received at the Angel? - In the fore seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Were then any other passengers? - No, I shut up the door, and proceeded on my journey; I stopped to water at the old Hatch, going along I thought I heard one of the glasses fall down, I turned myself about first of one side, and then on another: and not seeing any of the glasses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260044"></xptr> down, I suspected it to be the seat; when I came to Southall where we change horses, the waiter asked her to go out and have some breakfast, but she did not chuse any; she went with me to the Angel at Hayes, and there I set her down; she asked me, if I would have any thing to drink, I said, if you will go into the house, I will come to you: I perceived she had a large bundle, which I did not perceive she had when she got into the coach, I went and searched my seats directly, and pulled out this parcel, it was heavy when I put it in, and now I found it very light, it was filled with straw, and the books were gone, and it was tied up very curiously; I then said, says I, mistress, you have got some of my things, she said, no: I took the bundle out of her hand, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the bundle contain? - Some of these books, the books have been in my custody ever since. She was searched, and these prints were found in her bosom, and another book or two in her pocket; we took her before Justice Bishop, and he examined her, I was present; she said, she came on purpose to rob the coach, she told the justice so.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises of favour or threats? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Was her examination taken down in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it returned? - No.</p>
               <p>These examinations ought to be taken down by the Justices in writing, they are required so to do by the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>I shall certainly not receive any evidence of the confession, when the witness tells me it is reduced into writing, as that is the best evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bishop promised me my discharge: I leave it to your mercy.</p>

             the bookseller here? - No.</p>
               <p>The evidence is defective as it now stands, for what the parcel contained he is a total stranger to: Mr. Gardner ought to have been here to have established that fact, that the books that are here were the same that were in the parcel when he sent it to the Angel inn.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Are there any particular marks on these books to shew that they were the property of Mr. Gardner before they were sent to Mr. Glass? - On some of them there are, the titles correspond (looking at the books) there is a mark on the British Plutarch, 6 vols. Letters on the Mind, 2 vols. and I know them to be his property.</p>

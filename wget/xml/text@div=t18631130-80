                  </hi>. I am lieutenant and secretary of the London Rifle Brigade—on the night of 23d November, about 8 o'clock, I was passing down Ludgate-hill towards Fleet-street—on arriving at the end of Ludgate-hill I saw the prisoner—he hustled me in a very rude and unnecessary manner, there was no crowd—I tried to push him off, and he did it again, and directly he left me I felt in my pocket, and my watch was gone—I had bad it safe a very few minutes before—the prisoner was going quickly off—I went in pursuit of him—I was obstructed, and, in crossing the street, several men tried to trip me up; however, I continued the pursuit, and overtook. the prisoner before he came to the opposite corner of Fleet-street—I seized him immediately, and he fell down—we were then surrounded by a crowd, who tried to rescue him; but the police came up and took him into custody—I did not lose sight of him at all—I saw him searched, but no watch was found—he had an opportunity of passing it even before I pursued him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 317). I saw the prisoner running across from Ludgate-hill towards the west side of Farringdon-street, and heard cries of "Stop thief?"—I ran across the road, and got up to him at the same time as the prosecutor—he fell down—the prosecutor charged him with stealing his watch—I took him to the station and searched him, but found no property on him—he gave an address that I could not find out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in St. Alban's-place, Edge<lb></lb>ware-road. About seven o'clock at night, on the 3rd of January, I was going along the New-road—I felt a twitch, turned round, and saw the prisoner and another man—I said, "You have got my handkerchief"—the prisoner then dropped it—he and the other man ran away—I picked it up, and ran after them—I did not lose sight of the prisoner till he was stopped.</p>

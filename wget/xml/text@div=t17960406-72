               <p>Court. Q. Had you been drinking at all with him? - A. He was having a pint of beer, and I drank part of it; I thought he was a distressed man, and I gave him some.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. No; I met him at that public-house by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that public-house? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have drank? - A. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him your bundle to carry? - A. I did not; he followed me out of the house.</p>

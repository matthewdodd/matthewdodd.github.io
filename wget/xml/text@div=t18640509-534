               <p>9th April, and at the same time I received this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Mr. Sylven's card—the order was not executed—on receiving this from the boy Moore, who is a shoeblack, I immediately went to the file, and referred to an order that I had received on March 15th—I compared them, and in cones<lb></lb>quence of some suspicions we did not execute this order—Mr. Sylven is a customer of Mr. Adams—he carries on business as a gun maker in Leicester-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoeblack, and belong to the red, the City brigade—I received this card and paper from the prisoner on 9th April—he came to me in Orange-street, and asked me if I would take a letter for Mr. Sylven, of 33, Leicester-square; as I was going with it he came with me to King William-street, and when we got to the shop he said, "Take the letter in there, and ask them to send the parcel as quick as ever they can, because a gentleman is waiting for it"—I have no doubt about his being the man; I remember him.</p>

Q.</hi> You see a great many persons in the course of the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I can't say that I should remember them all—I next saw this man at the police-station; the officer took me there—he told me he had got the man in custody, and I went to see if it was the same person who gave me the letter; he had not a moustache on when I saw him first; he had the second time I saw him—they brought him out of the station with about six or seven more; some were rather tall and some short—I saw one short one—the inspector asked me whether I would go round and pick the one out, who gave me the letter; I went round and picked the prisoner out, the moustache made no difference—I never saw any one like him before, or since—I knew him by having a round hat on, and partly by his face—he had a round hat on when I picked him out—I should have known him if he had not had a round hat on—I am quite sure of that.</p>

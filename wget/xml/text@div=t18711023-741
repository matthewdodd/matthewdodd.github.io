                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on Thursday, 21st September, I was lodging at 36, North East Passage, St. George's-in-the-East—I was in Batch Street between 11 and 12 o'clock, and saw two young women there—I spoke to them, and the prisoner came up, and called me a "Yankee son of a bitch," and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me—I had never seen him before—I said "Mind what you are about," and then he struck me with his fist—I said "Mind what you are doing; you have got hold of the wrong man"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230035"></xptr>
               <p>—he said "No, you Yankee son of a bitch"—I got hold of him by the hair—he sang out "Please let me go," and I let him go—I heard people calling out that he had got a knife—I turned, and he gave me the knife in my belly, and twice in my arm, and once up here—he would have killed me on the spot, if it had not been for a policeman—I was insensible, and was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

About 12.30, on this night, me and another girl were going home—we had just left the dancing—the prisoner called the pro<lb></lb>secutor" The son of a bitch"—he said "No, I am not;" and the prisoner knocked him down with his fist—they struggled to get up, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor took hold of the prisoner's hair, on the ground, and pulled him up a turning in Ratcliff Highway; and I saw the prisoner pull out a knife and stab him in the stomach, side, and two places in his arm—he was about striking him again, when a constable interfered—the prisoner was the worse for drink, because he was turned out of a public-house where I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there, and I found two wounds on his abdomen, and a laceration of his fore arm—the wounds on his abdomen were dangerous, as the intestines had protruded—this knife would produce the wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was attacked, and defending myself. My clothes were on board ship three days before, and I had to join; it is not likely I should attack a man like that, and lose my ship. He had lots of prostitutes with him; they tore the buttons off my shirt; the second-mate and I had drank 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of gin and porter. I was knocked down, and the policeman will recollect that my face was <hi rend="italic">bunged up</hi> for a fortnight. A person kicked me in the side of my jaw, and a woman stood on my breast while I was down.</p>

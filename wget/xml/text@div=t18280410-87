I had been to the Mermaid, public-house, and about one o'clock in the morning of the 4th of March, in coming down Providence-row, I saw the prisoner and Malcolm coming out of the gate of Mr. Smith's premises; Malcolm had a bag on his shoulder - they went down a turning; Malcolm turned back, and wished me good night - there is a lamp close to the gate, and I am certain of their persons - I did not give any alarm.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The boy who committed the offence is my wife's brother, he had been discharged from two situations for committing offences. His mother asked me to allow him to stay at my place till she could get him to sea; I said there was an empty room next to mine, if she would take it, he might work with me; he slept there by himself, and went to his bed on the night of the robbery, after ten o'clock, and I went to mine. I was not out of bed till seven o'clock in the morning; he came into the room, and lighted the fire, as usual; I did not go into his room till the officers came. I said he was not at home, as I thought they had come about some pigeons which his master had lost; I did not wish him to be taken out of my room, as my wife was far advanced in pregnancy.</p>

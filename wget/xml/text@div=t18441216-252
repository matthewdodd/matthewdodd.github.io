                  </hi>. I am a president in the London district of the General Post-office. I marked two shillings and a half<lb></lb>sovereign, so as to swear to them again, and on the 13th of Dec. I en<lb></lb>closed them in a letter addressed to Mr. Smerdon, Chapel-street, Isling<lb></lb>ton—I sealed it, and gave it to Mr. Blott, a gentleman in the Inland-office, at half-past two o'clock, to be sent to the London District-office—in the early part of the morning the prisoner, who was employed in the office, came to take the letters from the boxes, and when I came to my duty on Saturday morhing, the 14th of Dec., at seven o'clock, I imme<lb></lb>diately searched the Islington letter-box, where the Islington letters are sorted out to, and not finding the letter there that I had sent, I mentioned it to my brother president and the superintending president, and he ordered all the parties whose hands the letter might have passed through into the president's room—one of the porters was searched, and nothing found on him—the prisoner was then searched, and out of one of his pockets was taken 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some coppers, and out of another pocket a purse and some</p>

               <p>other money—the superintending president said, "Look at that money," and I saw the two shillings which I had marked and enclosed in the letter the day before—the prisoner was given into custody immediately—he made no remark—the half-sovereign was not in his purse, or about him, nor was the letter, but he had had time to make away with the letter, and to have changed the half-sovereign.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Gutter-lane, near the Post-ofice. The prisoner changed a half-sovereign with me on the morning of the 14th of Dec., at near ten o'clock—I do not know what has become of that half<lb></lb>sovereign—I do not know that I paid it away—I took no notice of it—I remember a person coming and inquiring of me—I cannot say whether I had passed the half-sovereign away before that—I had several—I had no marked half-sovereign in my possession then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mean to swear that I have no recollection of what I did with that half-sovereign—I was applied to on the 16th—I then recollected that I had paid away a half-sovereign on the Saturday to my young man, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I believe my young man went with the Post<lb></lb>office authorities, but he is not here—the prisoner owed me an account—he called on the Friday for the purpose of paying it—I was not at home—my wife did not know how the account was, and would not take it—there were two half-sovereigns I passed in change early on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing before I received the one of the prisoner—after I received that I did not pay any to my knowledge, except to my young man.</p>

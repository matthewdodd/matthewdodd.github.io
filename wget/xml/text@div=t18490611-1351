                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Richard Parsons, who lives at Limehouse, and has a country dwelling-house at Barking, to which a fowl-house is attached. On Saturday evening, 12th May, I locked up the fowl-house, about half-past seven o'clock—there were then sixteen ducks and two drakes safe—about ten, the same evening, in consequence of some<lb></lb>ing I heard at the Three Horse Shoes beer-shop, I was going back towards the house, and met Marshall, whom I had seen at the public-house before, coming in a direction from the fowl-house—I stopped him, and asked what was the matter; he said he did not know—I asked him to come back with me, there was something amiss—he said, "No, I have done nothing, I won't go;" and he ran away—I went, examined the fowl-house, and found it broken open—I saw the ducks' feet at the police-office—they were Mr. parsons' property—the ducks would not keep, and the policeman cut feet off.</p>

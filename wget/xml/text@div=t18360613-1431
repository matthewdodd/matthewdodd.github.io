I am a publican, but have lately been driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> On Sunday morning, the 22nd of May, I was in Bond-street, at the end of Oxford-street—I saw a gentleman and the prisoner at a public-house—there were five or six persons round—the gentleman spoke to me, and asked if I had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and if I would drive him—I said I would, of course—this was a little after seven o'clock—I took the fare, and was away half an hour—I came back, and saw the same party there—the gentleman, who gave his name, "Simpkins," them asked me to drive him home—he got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I drove on with him—he pointed to me to go on—I went on in the direction of Baker-street—the prisoner jumped up behind as I was going—I have seen the prisoner before, driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he got up behind, and asked the gentleman to give him some halfpence, and then to give him some silver—I said, "If you have promised him any thing, you had better give it him, to get rid of him"—he said, "D—him, I will give him something to drink"—we went on to the corner of Baker-street, and got out at the Globe, but I would not have any thing—he got in again, and the prisoner snatched the gentleman's watch and ran off with it—we pursued him—a milkman caught the prisoner, and the watch was thrown away—it was found, and given to the gentleman—the prisoner ran about two hundred yards, and was taken, in Oxford Mews—I did not know the gentleman's name till he gave it at the station-house.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of February, about five in the evening, in consequence of an information given to Mr. Clark, I went with Mr. Clarke and another person to <placeName id="t17790404-15-crimeloc86">No. 2, in Oat-lane</placeName>

Foley had his hat off and a pair of spectacles on. With the sudden surprise of our approaching the room he dropped a sixpence, which he had in his left hand (producing it). He was on the opposite side next to the fire-place. Foley was rubbing that sixpence that fell, either with scowering paper or a file, the other was at work. I cannot say in particular what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Describe what things were found on the table before them. - The sixpence he let fall, I picked up, and these sixpences were on the table by Foley (producing five). By the fire-place, there were many crucibles, and by the left hand side of the door there were flasks set as moulds. Mr. Clarke will produce them; that is all I saw. Whether Foley was making use of the files or the scowering paper and cork I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I went, in consequence of an information, to this house, (No. 2) in Oat-Lane; we went up into the three-pair-of-stairs room, bursted open the door, and opposite to the door there was a table, where the two prisoners set at work. Foley was at work on the sixpence; I believe he was scowering it with sand-paper; I am very certain he was. Weldon was at work upon another with a file; he was without his coat; the other without his hat, with spectacles on; but the alarm of bursting open the door so suddenly frightened them; before them was a quantity of counterfeit sixpences cast; (producing a parcel) these lay before Weldon; that is the sixpence he was working upon; that is the file he was at work with. They were both at work, Foley scowering with sandpaper, the other at work with the file.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was filing sixpences? - Yes; the file and the sixpence both dropped out of his hands together. Here are three counterfeit sixpences I found in the draw in the room; they are finished. As I was searching Weldon I found five more played tricks with; they are not finished. In the same room was a quantity of wrought arsenick; there was some copper, likewise some sand, and what they call facing. There were two pair of flasks and crucibles; there is one pair moulded ready for pouring; there were about fifty impressions ready fixed. After finding the flasks I thought the patterns must be somewhere; I desired them to produce them, they refused knowing any thing of them. I had instructions to search in the cellar, and there I found as many sixpences as there were impressions in the flasks; there are fifty or fifty-one, I cannot be particular to one; they were the pattern sixpences. (The flasks produced). The impressions are all perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you had your information, did you know who the house, where these people were at work, belonged to? - I do not; I believe Weldon was the owner of the room, but they were both at work in the same room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040025"></xptr>That you are positive of? - I should be sorry to say that here if it was not true.</p>

               <p>Foley. When they broke into the room they said to me hold up your hands, that was to see whether I had been at work, and when Clarke came into the room he stood motionless awhile, and, seeing nothing going forward, he said, hold up your hands, let me see if you have been at work. I wish to know the reason of his bidding me open my hands to see if I had been at work.</p>
               <p>Court. I will ask it if you choose it? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Foley's defence.</p>
               <p>I had not been in the room four minutes; I sat down by the fire; there was nothing going forward in the room. He desired me to hold up my hands; I did it, and he saw nothing about them; he ordered me to stand charged.</p>
               <p>Weldon's defence.</p>
               <p>I never did any thing of the kind; this man never had a file in his hand; he never was in the room before in his life; he only came up to see me.</p>
               <p>You said one was without his coat; which was that? - Weldon was without his coat, the other with his hat off and spectacles on. I was astonished to be sure to see them both at work when I came into the room.</p>
               <p>Foley. There was a pair of spectacles lay on the table; he asked whose they were; I told him I knew nothing of them. - He is one of the blood-suckers.</p>

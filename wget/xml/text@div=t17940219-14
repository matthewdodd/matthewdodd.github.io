               <p>I keep a house in Long-alley, Moorfields; I bought the looking glass.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner with him? - Yes; one Mr. Wright, a neighbour of mine, came with them, to recommend them to sell the looking glass; they asked me sixteen shillings for it; I asked him whether it was his own? they all three came together.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom was the conversation? - I asked Vandome whether it was his own? he said, he had rather been a drinking, and he would sell the looking glass unknown to his wife, and asked me whether I would buy it? he said that he had had words with his wife, that he was drinking, and would sell the looking glass; I told him I could not give that money, for I must make money of it again; I gave him eleven shillings and six-pence for it; the bird was broke off it, and I said I could not give him any more for it; he said it cost him a golden guinea. They went out all together, and that was all that passed. I am perfectly sure of the two men; I never saw them but that once; Mr. Wright was with them, that was the reason I bought it, or else I never buy any thing at the door without I know the people.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Brown say? - He never said a word.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was the money paid to? - To Vandome. I did not know it was stole, I hung it out at the door for almost three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Brown. Your husband, Mr. Ferris, is a person employed in the police office? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore one would think that would be the last shop that a thief would take goods to, to the very thief taker's shop. When Wright came with the two people you knew him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Vandome brought the glass? - He did, and Brown only came with him, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I understand you to say that Vandome said that he had some liquor, and that he must part with the glass? - Yes.</p>

On Thursday the 16th of January I received an information from John Dorset, that his house was broke open on Christmas Day, at night, and robbed of a large looking glass, afterwards I went with John Dorset to a broker's shop in Long-alley, where he said he saw his glass hanging at the door, he said he had been the day before to cheapen it, to get inspection of it; I went and asked Mrs. Ferris for the glass, she told me it was in the house, I went into a house and saw it, and she gave me this glass, which Dorset said was his property. I have kept the glass ever since; I brought Wright and the glass to the office, and Mrs. Ferris.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take up Wright? - Because he ascertained that these two men came honestly by this glass, to Mrs. Ferris.</p>

            . I saw the Lighter come across the Hauser of the Dolphin; the Deceased asked them to loosen it, but they refused. He was then standing upon the Gunnel of the Lighter, and threaten'd to cut it; upon this, some Body in the Ship, (but I can't say it was the Prisoner) threw a Chip, and the Deceased fell from the Gunnel of the Lighter into the Thames and was Drowned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Chip fall upon the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Parrot. No, it went a Yard from him, on the left Side; and after it came to the bottom of the Lighter, the Deceased stumbled and fell Overboard?</p>
               <p>Arother. I saw the Prisoner throw the Chip into the Lighter. It alighted about 2 or 3 Foot from him. 'Twas but a small Chip, and was so small it would scarce fly with the Wind. After the Chip fell, the Deceased turn'd himself round, and slipp'd from the Egde of the Lighter into the Thames.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no Design to touch or hurt the Deceased, for I never saw him before in my Life, The Reason of my throwing the Chip was to direct him which way to go, to avoid the Ship's Hawser. <rs id="t17370907-46-verdict240" type="verdictDescription">

            . Last Sunday morning, about three o'clock, my maid heard a noise, and told me, the house was broke open; a little afterwards I heard another noise, and the Prisoner had left his shoes, and by these shoes there was a ladder standing at the window, which was left there, (as the house was repairing,) and had been there for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Barnard. He was a <rs id="t17480706-13-deflabel71" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17480706-13-defend147 t17480706-13-deflabel71"></join>, and had worked for the person who does my work, and had worked there ever since Easter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the windows were shut at night?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I cannot say they were; it is possible they might be left open upon the account of the beat.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I have two houses together; the house that he broke into is let to two gentlewomen, and the other I live in myself, in Fisher's-Street, Red-lion-Square. The watchman was called by one of the maid-servants, and found the Prisoner wrapped up in a blanket, in my kitchen, lying upon two chairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was drunk that Saturday night, and one of the plumber's men was as drunk as I, and whether I went in at the house, the two ladies live in, or not, I cannot rightly tell.</p>

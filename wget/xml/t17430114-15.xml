            . On the 27th of December I went to open my Bureau, which stands in the Kitchin, and found it unlocked. The Prisoner was my Servant, and was by me at that Time. I told her I missed some Money. There was a Piece of the Walnut-Tree broke off, and some Rust upon the Place where it was forced open. She said, she knew nothing of it. But after some Time said, If I must tell you, I left the Street-Door open last Night, and found it unlocked this Morning. I told her, That must be a Story; for I heard her bar it at Night, and unbar it in the Morning. I told her, I would send for a Constable: And then she said, If I must tell you the Truth, I am married. - My Husband lay with me that Night; and he had a Friend who sat up in the Kitchin all Night by the Fire, and she was afraid he had taken it. She told me, she knew nothing of the opening it: But, if I pleased, she would go with the Constable to the Place where these Fellows were, and would get them apprehended. And she, with the Constable, went to the Thatched-House , by Temple-Bar. When they came back again, she said she could not find them, and believed they were gone to work at Deptford . She said, she was sure her Husband had not taken it. <rs id="t17430114-15-verdict77" type="verdictDescription">

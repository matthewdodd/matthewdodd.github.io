                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Truman, Hitchcock, and Co., warehousemen, of Wood-street, Cheapside, and am one of the creditors' assignees—I have known the prisoners about eleven or twelve years—they have been in the habit of dealing with us for goods throughout that period—they owe us under the bankruptcy about l,035<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or somewhere there-abouts—I was acquainted with the firm of Kortoske Brothers in Canada—I first heard of them about 1854 or 1855—we understood the component members of that firm to be Kortoske Brothers and Mr. Keppel Fox; not the prisoner Kortoske—I do not know whether there were two or three Kortoskes—we knew them under the general name of Kortoske Brothers—how many composed the firm, I never knew—I am aware that during the early part of the prisoners' dealings with us he sent the goods he purchased of us to that firm, and we had some dealings with the Canada firm direct, not passing through the prisoners' house—those dealings commenced about the beginning of the year 1857, and went down to the autumn of that year, when the American panic set in; when, acting on a general principle of our business not to have shipping accounts at that time, I intimated to the person who represented himself to be Fox, to close the account, and that we should require, as it had been up to that period, the responsibility of Braun and Kortoske on this side—I communicated that by word of mouth—I called on Fox, who at that time had an office in Aldermanbury-postern, and said to him that, acting on a general principle of our business, we being almost entirely a home-trade house, must decline direct transactions with the Canadian firm, and should require a responsible house on this side, or</p>

               <p>cash, and should be perfectly satisfied with Messrs, Braun and Kortoske, of London-wall, as we had heretofore; charging the goods, in point of fact, to them—we then closed the account with the Canada house, and never re<lb></lb>sumed it in a direct form—we continued our sales to the prisoners with a knowledge that they would ship to the Canada house themselves, and be re<lb></lb>sponsible to us—we continued to do that until a very recent date before they stopped payment—I ought perhaps to state that the bulk of the goods for which we are creditors under the bankruptcy, were supplied to them in the spring of 1861, they suspending on 3d September, 1861—it was our habit to draw on the prisoners for the goods we sold, and down to the early part of 1861 those acceptances were met with unfailing punctuality, for until they suspended payment on 3d September they never asked an hour's grace—in May, 1861, we found that the bills they owed us exceeded 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, in consequence of that, on 14th May, I addressed a letter to the firm, it being a principle of our house to limit drawing credits—I have a copy of it here in our letter-book—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 14th May, 1861, from the witness to the defendants, requesting them, at their account exceeded</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic"> to suspend further orders until some part of that amount was written, off</hi>)—in consequence of that letter, Braun called upon me, and we had some con<lb></lb>versation as to their dealings with the Canada house, and the state of our debt—we inclosed in that letter a statement of the account, by which he might see for himself, and he called and said that he was much surprised to find that the shipping part of the account was so large; that he was scarcely aware of it, but that Messrs. Kortoske Brothers, of Canada, had represented that they were in a flourishing condition on the other side, and had remitted to them, during the year 1860, about 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but had made no remittance since January I understood him, that being in May—I still adhered to my decision and Braun left me—I deemed it a very liberal credit to give the house, our firm being a home-trade concern almost exclusively—I did not know at that time that Mr. Fox had retired from the Canada firm—I never knew that until long after the suspension—the account was then full; but if they had been prepared to discount part of the account, on the payment of that bill on 4th September, we should have been open again to that extent—there were acceptances running—a bill of theirs for 682<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd came due on 4th September—I believe that was the very largest bill in one lump that we ever had in the twelve years—they suspended on 3d September, and that bill was never paid—Mr. Hackwood, of the firm of Linklater and Hackwood, called on me on the evening of the 3d, and represented himself as solicitor to the bankrupts—in consequence of the interview with him and Mr. Lad<lb></lb>bury, I went, I believe, on the next day, the 4th, to their place of business, at London-wall, and found Mr. Braun and a gentleman who I had not the pleasure of knowing until this case, and who he introduced as Mr. Callisher, Kortoske's father-in-law—I understood his name to be Matthew—I had, in his presence, a conversation with Braun, and said that I was very sorry to find that they were obliged to suspend payment, he having intimated not very long ago that they were in a very good state—he replied that he had no doubt whatever, that if the debt due to them in Canada, which was a very heavy one, should turn out good, they had a surplus of several thousand pounds, and it would be merely a temporal arrangement for them—he said, also, that he had not had much to do with the books himself, and that Mr. Kortoske, his partner, had gone to Canada to look after this heavy debt—that is the prisoner Kortoske—I do not thing he mentioned what the amount of it was—while I was there, somebody applied to see Braun—I do</p>

               <p>not know who, but I think it was a creditor, from his manner—Braun appeared very nervous throughout the interview, and very agitated—he was evidently averse to see the party, but he did not say so—Callisher said to Braun, "What are you afraid of; are not you a man?" or words to that effect—I do not remember that Braun made any answer—I do not think he saw the party who wanted the interview while I was there—a meeting of creditors was called on 19th September following, at our City rooms for holding those public meetings—I attended it—neither of the prisoners were there—they were represented by Mr. Linklater—Kortoske at that time was said to be out in Canada—at my previous interview with Braun I told him I called in consequence of the communication of Mr. Hackwood—I saw Kortoske again in this country, to the best of my belief about the middle of November, when he returned—I then saw him at the office of Messrs. Lad<lb></lb>bury and Co. the accountants, and we had a lengthened interview, at which we made most express and particular inquiries (myself and my colleagues appointed by the committee of creditors, of whom I was one) as to what he had been doing in Canada, and how it was he came to go out without coming to consult any creditor—we begged him to give us the fullest infor<lb></lb>masion in his power as to the estate of Kortoske Brothers, on the other side, it being so large a component of our estate here—he gave us substantially no information about that house, after two hours' hard, and I regret to add, ineffectual attempts to get information—we knew at the first meeting that 36,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was due from the Canada firm—I asked him whether he had seen his brothers when abroad—he said that he had seen them, and had done his best to get information, and understood that they had promised detailed accounts through the accountant, Mr. Court, of Montreal, to whom a power of Attorney had been sent out by the official assignee, and that when those accounts came he would look them over, and see if they had omitted any<lb></lb>thing, when he should possibly be able to give some information—at that interview Mr. Baggally and Mr. Chadwick, my solicitor, and the Committee, and Mr. Sole, of Aldermanbury, were all present—knowing that large quan<lb></lb>tities of goods professed to have been sent through their house to Canada, I asked him many times what had become of them, and pressed him closely on that point—it was the gist of our inquiry—he said that he was unable to obtain much information, but he thought that goods had been deposited with various parties—we tried hard to get the names, but could not—he said that he went out to Canada to look after the large debt due to himself and partner—I told him that it would have been better if he had consulted some creditors before going; as a more usual proceeding—I asked him many times what chance there was of the debt being paid—he said, that as a power of attorney had been delegated to Mr. Court, in Canada, by the official assignee, he thought he was relieved from further duties, and therefore he at once came home—he said that he understood the firm in Canada were willing to make an assignment of their estate and effects, and pressed us to take it—we pressed him many times at that interview to make an offer of compen<lb></lb>sation to the creditors, which he declined—as a reason for urging him to make an offer, I told him that he could deal so much better with his brothers than we could—all this was after the September petition for arrangement—after it had been turned into bankruptcy, and I became an assignee, I again saw the prisoner, Kortoske, with Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ladbury, on 24th January—I do not think Braun was there—Kortoske made no com<lb></lb>munication about the assets that day that I remember—that day was the choice of assignees at the Court of Bankruptcy—I was over at the Court of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270136"></xptr>
               <p>Bankruptcy, and Kortoske came there with Mr. Linklater, and brought a parcel, which he said contained precious stones, and gave them into the care of Mr. Ladbury, the accountant, in my presence, saying that he had others as well, at London-wall, and the total value of the whole, including those at London-wall, and likewise some out with his two brothers, would be about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the others which he mentioned were subsequently given up—from 19th September, when the petition for an arrangement was filed, down to that day, I had never heard a syllable about that property—I did not know that they had any dealings in precious stones, or I should have had no deal<lb></lb>ings with them—we had a meeting of assignees at Mr. Ladbury'a office early in February—I believe it was the 5th—I sent for Kortoske to attend me in my capacity of assignee—Mr. Boggallay and myself were there, and likewise Mr. Chadwick—we made the fullest inquiry of him respecting the estate of Kortoske Brothers, in Canada—the inquiry lasted, I believe, five hours, but we learned, I believe, substantially nothing—we heard nothing at that time from either of the prisoners respecting Bernard Kortoske, but in consequence of a letter, informing us that Bernard was over, the assignees sent for Kor<lb></lb>toske to the office of Sole and Turner, the solicitors, and told him that we were surprised to hear that his brother Bernard had come from Canada, as had previously promised that as soon as he arrived he would let us know, and we understood he had been in the country a fortnight or three weeks without letting us know—he appeared very nervous, and said that his brother Bernard should come round to me on the evening of that day, which he did—this was some time in February, 1862—it was then arranged that a meet<lb></lb>ing should be held at Messrs. Sole and Turner's office, of Benjamin Kortoske, the bankrupt, and Bernard, his brother, and on the following morning they came—Mr. Ladbury was present, and Mr. Baggallay and myself—a note of the conversation which transpired was taken, partly by Mr. Turner and partly by Mr. Ladbory—I had no official powers to look at the bankrupt's books; but about the middle, or latter end of January, 1862, I made a most critical examination of them—I had not then looked at them for several months—I did not, on the last occasion, see all the books which I had seen on the first occasion—I looked at them at Mr. Ladbury's office, and likewise at the solicitor's, and I missed a journal which I had before seen at Mr. Ladbury's—we went to Mr. Graham, the official assignee, whose clerk assisted us, and we made a search, but as far as I know it has not been found to this hour—it is, I should say, a book of very great importance.</p>

               <p>mentioned—we were concerned principally in the home trade—it was decidedly an increasing business that they carried on up to she time of their stoppage—the increase, in 1861, bore no conceivable proportion to the increase before, but exceeded it four or five fold—it clearly increased—Mr. Keppel Fox had an office in Aldermanbury in 1857—he had it there one or two years, I think—he was represented as a member of the firm of Kor<lb></lb>toske Brothers—I have had very few interviews with him, and limited to that time—I have not seen him for several years.</p>

I am an accountant, in partnership with another gentleman, at 16, King-street, Cheapside—On 3d September, 1861, I saw Braun at London-wall—I had also seen him on 1st September, at the premises—I went, at the request of Messrs. Truman and Co. the creditors, to investigate the affairs—Kortoske was not there: Braun said that he had gone to Canada—there was no clerk there: Braun said that he had gone for a holiday, and they could not tell his address—I saw Mrs. Kortoske the next day—Braun could give me no information—next day, 4th September, I saw Mr. Callisher, senior, there; Kortoske's father-in-law—I saw, I think, three books there, the bought ledger, the sold ledger, and the daily entry of sales, or journal, which is not to be found now—I have not searched for it, or seen it—the books pass from one person to another—from those three books I made out a statement of affairs—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it—Mr. Braun adopted it at the meeting of creditors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">withdrew it</hi>)—after the time I have been speaking of, I was employed as accountant to the creditors under the bankruptcy—I then made a full examination of the bankrupt's books, and particularly of the account of Kortoske Brothers, which com<lb></lb>mences in August 1852, up to 1855—the total amount of shipments, in 1852, are about 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., worth of goods were consigned by Braun and Kortoske to Kortoske Brothers in 1852; 2,546<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 1853; 6,056<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 1854; and in 1855, to Keppel Fox and Co. 4,538<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I find that account in the books transferred from Kortoske Brothers to Keppel Fox—Keppel is a Christian name—in 1856, the amount is 7,741<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., still to Keppel Fox and Co.; in 1857, it is 578<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1858, 1,693<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1859, 7,955<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and in 1860, 7,893<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; those are the whole shipments of 1858, 1859, and 1860—Messrs. Braun appear to have paid money for Keppel Fox and Co. for goods shipped out, or paid some of their creditors for them—a portion of that is in 1860—the account terminates in 1860, and a balance is struck; and in 1861, the account of Kortoske Brothers begins again—the account in 1861, for the eight months up to September, is 36,587<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more than four times the amount of any previous year—at the end of 1860, when the account changes, the debt due by Fox and Co. to Braun and Kortoske is 8,879<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the interest is 1,347<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and commission 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making the total debt 10,727<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I can trace, by the books, that that interest had been accruing from 1855; the debt had been accumulating for years, the interest will show that—the amount of money remitted in 1861 was 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the amount remitted to Kortoske Brothers, by Braun and Kortoske was nearly 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—that paid off the whole of Keppel Fox's credit—1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is put to Keppel Fox's credit—that 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is the only thing that is put against the account—at the end of June they were indebted 20,797<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notwithstanding that debt, they sent in July, 11,363<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and August, 8,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; so increasing the debt from 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I do not find in the books any security for Fox and Co. and I have never heard of any—the caps and goods gene<lb></lb>rally disposed of in London, in 1861, if about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l.:</hi> I speak from the woks—out of that amount, Wilhelms had, I think, about 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—that includes all the goods I see entered in the books to Wilhelme—the books</p>

               <p>are all here, but some goods have been in his hands which are not in the books; some Spanish stripes were in his hands, and are not in the books—the amounts to Jones Brothers are merely cash matters—Mr. Henry Callisher's amount is 1,380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Tallerman's, 472<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—there are no other people who carry on business in that particular line, except Brent Brothers, 396<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—that if about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether—I am sure that the total amounts sold and got rid of in London, are 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the whole amount purchased in London is nearly 52,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I had nothing to do with making the bankrupt's balance-sheet—on comparing the account I subsequently took with that which I first took, I found that goods had been brought into stock of which I was not informed at first—I do not know to what extent—I did not per<lb></lb>sonally superintend it, but my clerk told me that there were some—no stones were mentioned in the first statement—I find no stones mentioned in the books at all—I received them on the day they were given up to the assignees—that was nearly three months after my investigation of the affairs—I had frequently seen Kortoske, as well as Braun—there were no Spanish stripes in the stock book, I only knew of them from what my clerk told me—when I first saw the ledger, in September, 1861, Wilhelms was a debtor for 785<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and now he is down as a debtor for 558<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a difference of 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—the last credit is August 29th, 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the pre<lb></lb>ceding one is May 28th, 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the total is 542<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—Mr. Tallerman was at first down as a debtor for 164<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but now the account has been exactly balanced by introducing a "1" before "70," making it 170, and adding 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is called "Contra, P.

               <p>but from Fox and Co.'s account—that sum represents payments for goods on account of Fox and Co.—that represents the whole transactions of the year, but not bill transactions as well—I understand it to include goods shipped and bought, and payments made on their account to large wholesale houses, but I do not think it would include bills accepted in their behalf—I know of no bill transactions in addition—I have not particularly looked to see, but I do not anticipate that there are any—I ascertained that, in 1860, Fox and Co. remitted 13,964<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all they were liable for in 1860—I do not consider that Kortoske Brothers were in existence in 1860, because that account commenced in 1861—there was no separate account in 1860 with Kortoske Brothers—there was a remittance in 1860 when only one account existed—the 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd was to the general account—at the end of 1860 there was a balance, including interest, of 10,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in 1864 they received a further remittance of upwards of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with which they wrote off the debt of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and appropriated the rest—when I speak of these shipments to Canada, I receive the whole of my data from entries in these books—every one of those shipments is entered—the account I made out on 14th Septem<lb></lb>ber, 1861, I took from the ledger—I did not go through the other books to see whether the ledger was correctly posted—a balance sheet was subsequently prepared, not by me, but under the superintendence of Mr. Hart, who was at one time a clerk under Mr. Pennell, the official assignee, and set up after<lb></lb>wards in business for himself as an accountant—the books were for a long time in his custody at Mr. Pennell's office—they first got into Mr. Hart's custody about January, I think, when they were absolutely declared bank<lb></lb>rupts—he very likely had access to them on the bankrupts' premises, but I never saw him there—it would be quite in the ordinary course if he did, as he was employed by them—there was a messenger nominally in possession of the books at the bankrupts' office, but the bankrupts had access to them, and Mr. Hart, or anybody else—they were not bankrupts then—it was a private arrangement—if Mr. Hart was making their balance-sheet, and found things not entered, he would enter them, but in blue or red ink, not black—that is the understanding with the official assignees—the books would not remain intact—it is understood that the bankrupt is to balance his own books—the accountant would in the ordinary course, if he finds things not entered, enter them himself, and there are a good many alterations here in blue ink—they carried on business after this petition, to some extent, and those transactions would be entered by their clerks—those entries would not be in blue ink—leaving the books in September, I should certainly expect to find some additions in January—taking all the accounts, the balance now due by Wilhelms is 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I cannot say whether that is correct or incorrect—Tallerman's account is in the private ledger, folio 85—I did not look at that account in September—it was not on the premises, and Kortoske was not there at that time—I have examined the books, and that account exists in no other books but these two; it is not in the bill book—I have not seen this bill before (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I fancy this bill stamp is in September—I think it is 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in this entry "170 Contra P.L." contra means "opposite"—it is entered 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 24th August in the petty ledger—I am not able to say whether this entry was there in September—I only made up my account from the books I had—I examined them carefully—a number of new accounts had been opened, but I did not see that a number of old accounts had been closed—I think you will find that from the beginning almost every account is open, except trifling ones—those which are closed are very unimportant—I have not</p>

               <p>looked to see how many are closed—I can tell that they are unimportant, because I have looked at the books, but I have not counted them—it is probably more than a dozen—I am speaking entirely from guess—I believe the stamp on this bill is of a date subsequent to that upon the face of it—it appears to me very much like a 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No; there is not; it is a delusion on your part, here is nothing of the sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are lots of "contras," but perhaps you have got a wrong account.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 34, Monkwell-street, and am agent for several manufacturers in the north of England, and among others for Mr. Willcox—I had only one transaction with the defendants as his agent; that was about August 20th—I called there to sell goods in the regular way, the same as I do at any other house—I took some patterns of Spanish stripes, and saw the prisoner Kortoske; he said, "They are the very things I have been looking for for some years, I can do a large trade with you, as I have a connexion in almost every part of the States," and I think he also mentioned Malta and India—as they were large shippers, I left him the patterns, and he gave me an order for two sample pieces of each colour—I called immediately on receipt of the goods, and saw him; he said, "Look in at half-past 4 o'clock"—I did so, and he said, "We cannot give you an answer to-day, as we have not seen the merchant"—Mr. Willcox then came up, and I made an appointment to see him next morning at half-past 10 o'clock—I saw him, and we were to call again in the afternoon—I did so; he came out and spoke to me first, and then his wife came out; she seemed rather active in the business, and anxious to buy goods—Kortoske gave me an order for 100 pieces, and said that they would take 300, and that they wanted them for shipping, and that they must be there on Monday or Tues<lb></lb>day morning, as the ship would sail, and they would be too late for the parties they were wanted for—he did not tell me what part of the world they were going to—after the goods were sent up, I saw him; he said that they were not as good as they ought to be, and wanted a reduction on them—eight or ten days after that I went to Britton's, the packers, in Basing<lb></lb>hall-street—I was told that the goods were there, but the men had gone to dinner, and the old man there would not let me see them—I act as agent for four or five other people besides Willcox, and have sold on their account to Braun and Kortoske—the first sale was in July, I believe, and the next in August—the first transaction was for four out of five of those persons, and the amount was altogether beyond 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—1860 was the first time we dealt with them as commission agents, and the goods were all paid for—I had no more difficulty, when I first went, in selling the goods than I have with anybody else—I found no greater readiness to buy goods till the end of August—I went one day, and they gave me an order for thirty pieces of black cloth, which I never solicited—I then began to be cautious, and never sold them any more, because they were bought in a very loose manner, such as no man, who meant to pay for the goods, would have done.</p>

I am a merchant and tailor, carrying on business at 14 and 15, Poultry—I have known the defendants fourteen or fifteen years—my clerk will produce my books—I cannot tell without them when I first began to do business with the defendants—I do not keep my own books—(<hi rend="italic">The books were given to the witness</hi>)—it was about April, 1861—I know, without my books, that I bought goods of them, and also took dry goods on consignment—my memory is so short that I cannot tell what amount of goods I have taken of them, as a purchaser, unless I look into figures—by receiving goods on commission I mean goods consigned to me, shipped at Barbadoes or Australia, or elsewhere, for their account—the terms are usually such as merchants receive, a commission of, say, 10 per cent., according to the time at which the return may come, also 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per cent per annum, for bills drawn on their account—if an account is returned in six months, of course it would not be so much as 10 per cent; it all depends upon the distance; but my commission as a merchant is 10 per cent—the defendants did not employ me to sell goods for them abroad; they con<lb></lb>signed goods to me—I was responsible to them, and charged 10 per cent commission for the purpose of having them sold abroad for their interest, and to guarantee to return the profits of their goods—that is my charge—I am a foreigner, my lord, and I wish you would observe that I am used properly—it was at my option, if the goods were not returned in twelve months, to charge 10 per cent.—I cannot say whether that was the arrange<lb></lb>ment, because it is so long ago, but that is my charge—I do not think I made a specific bargain with them—I do not think they intrusted me with the goods without asking my charge; but the parties are here, and they know what business is, and whether that is the usual charge or not—I have never been asked for account sales, and they have not come forward yet, but I have some, though I have not been asked for them by the assignees, or any one—some have not yet come at all, but I got some about a month ago—I continued to do business with the defendants up to 1862; the last goods I received were about August, 1862—there was no time to make up any account before their failure; the only account made up was when I received the notice from the assignees respecting it, which amounted to l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which I gave them a cheque, and there was a balance besides in my pocket—I remember receiving some stripes—all the communication I had with the defendants about them was, that Mr. Callisher produced an order to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I advanced 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on it on conditions for me to consign the goods to India; at least, to the East Indies—they remained on my premises, because I could not get any merchant to take them, in consequence of their beings so dear, and the colours did not suit the market—at the time they were delivered to me I had no ship for them, and had made no arrangement—I tried to make arrangements; I showed the patterns to different merchants, and they would not suit the price of the market—Mr. Collins paid me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by cheque,</p>

Braun and Kortoske—I advanced the defendants two-thirds of the cost price on the goods—I should be very glad to get fifty per cent. on some goods—that is more than anybody would advance for that—I charge the amount—I sometimes advance cash upon goods, and sometimes bills—I do not understand anything about accom<lb></lb>modation bills—I am referring to my giving bills to them occasionally, by way of advance on the goods, instead of actual cash—to the best of my belief, I never gave them any other bills—I should not call those accommoda<lb></lb>tion bills; you may as well call the Bank of England notes accommodation bills—I do not call these accommodation bills at all; I have goods to represent them—I do not know whether I gave up the stones a considerable time before the bankruptcy—all I know is, that when Mr. Kortoske came back from Canada, I had not disposed of those stones, and I returned them to him as soon as he came back, having had my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., back for the Spanish stripes, and there was an end of the transaction—I could not get a price for the stones from several first-rate merchants of the City of London, and gave them back—he put a high value upon them, but very likely he had been deceived, not knowing anything about them—I suppose, if you were to give</p>

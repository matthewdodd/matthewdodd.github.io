                  </hi>. I live with my son, who keeps a stationer's shop, in Old Broad-street—on Tuesday afternoon, the 8th of Oct., the prisoner cane in, about a quarter past three o'clock for a sixpenny memorandum—I served him—he put a half-crown into my hand—I gave him change, and he went away while I was serving a gentleman—I laid the half-crown on a shelf behind me—I then looked at it again, and considered it was bad—I put it in a bowl in the till—I noticed that it was of the reign of King William the Fourth—there were four other half-crowns in the bowl, which I had put in just before—I considered they were good—I used two of them to give the gentleman change—none of them were of the reign of William the Fourth—that I am sure of—I left the prisoner's half-crown in the bowl when I took the two half-crowns out—when I looked at the prisoner's half-crown and put it in tin bowl it might be about a quarter to four o'clock—no one had been in to interfere with the bowl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of George Syrett. I returned home about a quarter to four o'clock that afternoon, and my father went out—I looked into the till, and discovered a bad half-crown of the reign of William the Fourth, and two others of a different reign, and good ones—I took the bad half-crown out of the bowl, and threw it into the till, loose, away from the other money—I locked the till up, and the half-crown remained there till the next morning—I kept it separate from the other money, and I have it now—this is it—on Saturday, the 10th of Oct., the prisoner came to the shop to me to purchase half a quire of note paper, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a bad half-crown—I saw it was bad immediately—I fastened the door, and said, "Have you any more of this sort about you?"—he said, "No"—I said, "This will not answer my purpose; perhaps you have a good one, or some other money?"—I said, "I think I shall lock you up"—he said he was out of employ, and could not tell where he got the half-crown; that he had been down to the neighbourhood of Blackwall to see his sister, and he had no other money—he said he came from Chelsea, and had no other money when he came out—I sent for a policeman, and gave him the half-crown.</p>

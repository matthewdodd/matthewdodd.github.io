            . I am a City policeman. On the 20th of March, I was on duty in Long-lane - the prisoner was pointed out to me - I went up to her, and asked if she had any counterfeit coin on her - she said, "No" - her right hand was clenched - I seized hold of it, forced it open, and found three counterfeit shillings, which I have had ever since - I found on her a sixpence and 3d in copper.</p>

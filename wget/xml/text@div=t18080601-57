            . Q. You are shopman to Mr. Hoskins. - A. Yes. On the 29th of April, between six and seven o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop together, they said they wanted a gown. Gagan had a brown great coat on and the other had a cloak on. The first thing that I shewed them was twenty four yards of buff printed cambric, they both made answer that they did not like a buff colour. I left it on the counter and proceeded to shew them many more; I found a great difficulty in finding one to please them, but at last after giving a great deal of trouble they fixed upon one pattern; they did not want to take the gown with them but to pay three shillings on account, and laid the gown by till the rest should be duly paid.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it to come to - A. Seven yards at one shilling, and ten pence a yard; the next morning I missed this twenty four yards of buff printed cambric; we were shutting up the shop when they came in, and we had no person in after them nor the next morning; there were some customers in at the same time, people that we knew very well; they left before they went; one of them lived with us, and the other is a responsible tradesman.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you miss it the next morning - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the things again - A. They have owned to it, but we have never found it; about that day three weeks, the prisoner Gagan came in, she wanted a piece of cotton for a frock; I knew her again. I took the identical pattern which they had laid by; I asked her if she and another person had not laid that by, leaving three shillings on account; she said that Burgess did, she added that she had not spoke to her for a fortnight. I saw that she was affected; I told her that evening they were there I missed this twenty four yards of printed cambric; I told her I had given a description of both the persons that they might be apprehended in case I might be out of the way; that I was very glad I had the opportunity of apprehending her myself; I should send for an officer and have her taken in custody; the officer was sent for, and before he came she confessed to me that she did not steal this but the other prisoner Burgess stole it; that she did not know that she stole it till she crossed the street, and that she shewed it to her, and when she saw if she advised Burgess to take it back again. Burgess told her to mind her own business; when the officer came she gave information where Burgess was to be found, but it was not a true one.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the piece have you - A. We found fourteen yards more which they stole the same evening, it is in the court now. The prisoner Burgess before the magistrate convicted the other of stealing one gown on her back, and one in pawn which we have brought forward.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the other person in the shop - A. The boy which we have not brought here.</p>
               <p>Burgess. The print that he had at the pawnbrokers, which is seven yards, I bought on Ludgate hill; I told him that I had a ticket that I had lost, and when he saw that seven yards, he said it was his property.</p>
               <p>RBOERT BROWN. On the 20th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Hoskins to take a woman into custody; I found Gagan in the shop, he said that was the woman I was to take in custody; I asked her where she lived, she said in Bell court, Bell alley, Golden lane; Mr. Greathead said there was another woman concerned in the robbery; she told me if I would go to the corner of Long alley, at a pawnbrokers, I should find a person of the name of Burgess; we could find no such person there, she misled us; I received information from a woman in Bell court, that Burgess was at the George, in Compton street, Clerkenwell, there I found her; we then proceeded to a pawnbrokers on Snow hill. I searched her at the public house, and found some duplicates; we could find no property of Mr. Hoskins, we took them before the magistrate. Gagan acknowledged that she was there, that Burgess had taken the piece of print; she went across the way, she immediately asked her what she had got there, and desired her to take it back; Burgess told her to mind her own business; we had a hard matter to keep Burgess quite till Gagan was done; the magistrate asked Burgess what she had to say, she said that good for nothing hussey has told against me; that night she stole fourteen yards of print out of the shop; that gown on her back is part of it; and the other part is in pawn for seven shillings at the pawnbrokers Wellclose square. I will go and shew you where it is; accordingly I went there with Burgess, and there we found seven yards of print pledged for seven shillings; we could trace nothing of the twenty four yards. Burgess said she believed the other must have lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Gagan accused Burgess with stealing the twenty four yards, did she deny it - A. She said that Gagan stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Burgess said that Gagan stole the fourteen yards, what did Gagan say to that - A. She did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Burgess. I told him I had one ticket which I had lost. I shewed him where it was in pledge, seven yards for seven shillings.</p>

               <p>Gagan's Defence. I bought the gown on Ludgate hill, I gave eighteen pence a yard for it; he asked me whether I had not a gown put by, he said did I not take a piece of cotton; he said if I would only own to taking of the cotton he would take four shillings a week for it; I told him I could do no such thing, I never had it.</p>
               <p>Greathead. I know the pattern very well; there were exactly fourteen yards of it; I am sure it was our own cotton, they had divided it exactly; we went immediately and saw the cotton was gone; they had tore the fag end off.</p>
               <p>Burgess's Defence. I bought that cotton and gave eighteen pence a yard for it on Ludgate hill; this young woman bought a gown about a fortnight before, she gave me a pattern when I bought mine; I pledged it on purpose to pay off another; and when I saw another that I liked better, I paid three shillings off it. He told me he kept them in general six months; I told him I should fetch it between this and Whitsuntide.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Greathead.) What is the worth of the cotton - A. About two shillings and two pence a yard.</p>

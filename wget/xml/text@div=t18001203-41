             sworn. - I am a drover in Smithfield-market, to Mr. Earle the salesman: On Monday the 24th of November, I saw the prisoner just within the hospital-gate in Smithfield, about three o'clock in the morning; he had a Scotch bullock and a Welch bullock; he called me, and asked me if I would take and tie those two beasts up; I said, yes, bring them on, and I will tie them up for you; my man tied them up, while I stood by; he said my master was to sell them; I had seen the prisoner before, and knew him again; I am sure he is the same man; he pulled out a pocket handkerchief, and offered it for sale for one shilling; he sold his handkerchief to a little boy that worked for me, and then we went into a public-house together; we stopped there till about half past five; I spoke to my master, and then my master and I went into the house, and took him into custody; the prisoner was sent to the Compter, and the oxen were locked up at the Ram-inn, in Smithfield; Mr. Dehaney and Cooper have since seen them.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of oxen are they? - A. One is a pole Scot, with white along the back; they were both black cattle; the other was horned Welch one.</p>

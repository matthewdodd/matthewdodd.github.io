                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Thomas Wilkinson, and am employed at his shop in Batters-street, Paddington. On the evening of the 28th of September, I deposited some wire in a particular part of the shop—I afterwards closed the shop on that evening, and I was the first person who entered it the next morning, a few minutes after six o'clock I first went and opened the shop-door—I did not go through the shop in to the workshop, and I am sure nobody had been in the shop before me—the prisoner, who was in my master's service, came in just after me, and he passed through the shop into the workshop—he staid there two or three minutes, and in the mean time I went out to take down some of the shutters—before I had taken them all down, the prisoner came through and went out—I then went to the place where I had deposited the wire the night before—I missed one hank of copper wire, which was worth about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I immediately followed the prisoner to the job that he was at, and saw him there—that was about a quarter of a mile from my master's workshop—I said to him, "You have taken some copper wire off the counter"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "It is here," and in the mean time he pulled it out from under some shavings, and gave it to me—I told him he must come to the shop, and speak to Mr. Wilkinson—I brought the wire back in my hand, and when we got back to the shop, I acquainted Mr. Wilkinson with what had hap<lb></lb>pened—(as we had come along, the prisoner begged me not to mention it to Mr. Wilkinson, and he would make me any recompence I would accept)—Mr. Wilkinson had an engagement to leave for the country that day, to superintend a large job for the Earl of Hardwicke—I kept the wire, and put it in a place where no other person had access to it—I afterwards</p>

               <p>gave it to the officer—I went with him to apprehend the prisoner—this is the wire.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the job he had to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To measure for some iron rails—copper wire is not used for fastening the rails, and he had only to measure them—it was not wanted for tying the tabrets, according to my judgment, and I have never seen it used at such jobs as that—if any rails are broken, they are spliced together with a tack or a brad.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For area-step work and balconies is it not used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I will not swear it is not—when I took the prisoner to Mr. Wilkinson, he told me to let him go back and finish his job—I went to the prisoner's house to take him, on the 10th of October, and he had worked for Mr. Wilkin<lb></lb>son till nearly that time—Mr. Wilkinson came home on the Wednesday following, which was the 5th or 6th of October, and it was not till five or six days after that the prisoner was taken—we then found him at his house, which is at No. 2, Burr-street—I do not know that he made several applications to Mr. Wilkinson for his Wages between that time—I saw him every day while he was at his job—he did no work after that job.</p>

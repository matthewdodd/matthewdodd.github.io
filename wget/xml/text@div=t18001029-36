             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Bartholomew's: Sumner, the watchman, brought the prisoner to me, about ten o'clock in the morning of Friday, the 10th of October, with these three boards; I have had them ever since, (produces them); he said, he had bought them of a friend; I asked him where his friend was, and he seemed to me to be quite stupidly drunk; he gave me no answer; by and by, he said he would tell the truth; he saw them laying in the street, near the Blakeney's-head, and he picked them up; he appeared to be very much in liquor, and very foolish in his answers, and I sent him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He was so stupidly drunk, that he did not know what he was about? - A. He was very drunk.</p>

             sworn. - As I was going round my beat, I met the prisoner at the bar in King-street, with these three boards upon his shoulder; Mr. Sherwood's house is at the back of King-street; I asked him where he had brought them from; he told me, he had brought them from Piccudilly; I told him, he must take them back to the watch-house; I asked him how he came by them, and he said, he came honestly by them, he had got a receipt in his pocket, and he would shew me; then he pretended to put his hand to his pocket, and ran away; he ran about the space of a hundred yards before I caught hold of him; upon that, I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that there is no getting at his wood, without getting over a high wall? - A. A paling.</p>

               <p>Q. That must be worse for a drunken man to get over? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. No drunken man could get over that paling? - A. I should think not.</p>

             sworn. I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherwood.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of premises are these, where this wood was kept? - A. There is a paling, but a man might reach over, and take them out; I was called up by the watchman; I went to the watch-house, and looked at the boards; the man seemed very much in liquor; they were Mr. Sherwood's; I compared two of them the next morning with the others, and the knots and grain, and every thing matched.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any of them? - A. Yes; and some of the pegs were pulled out, by reaching over the paling.</p>

               <p>Q. What pegs? - A. Pieces of wood put in, to hold the boards up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr.Alley. Q. You did not see any body take away these boards? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How often do you take stock at your house? - A. Once a year.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not taken stock lately? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And it is only by comparison that you say these boards are your master's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had seen one of these boards twenty miles off, you would not have known it was your master's? - A. Yes, if I had compared it.</p>

               <p>Q. But not without comparing it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sherwood. I have no doubt of their being my boards, from the appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible for any person to reach these boards? - A. I have tried myself to-day, and cannot do it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at a benefit club at Doctor's-commons, and had had two or three pipes of tobacco, which I am not used to, and drinking beer and punch, till I was so intoxicated, that I did not know where I went, or what I did, till I waked, and found myself in the watch-house in the morning.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290024"></xptr>known him up to the present time for many years, and who all gave him an excellent character.</p>

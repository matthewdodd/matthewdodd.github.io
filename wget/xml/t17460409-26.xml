            , the Girl in the House; she was to be such, and officiated as such: She got up that Morning with an Intent to go to Washing, as she told her Mistress, about Five o'Clock; about Six o'Clock, I was surpriz'd by the knocking and thundering at my Door; there was a Boy come to my Shop for Goods: At that Hour in the Morning we found the Door standing a-jar. I came down, and a Person I saw in the Street said I had left my Door open; whe n I came down there was no Fire, nor no Appearance of Washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the Girl in the House.</p>
               <p>Russel. No. I went up and told my Wife; she ask'd me if I saw any Thing missing; I miss'd several Things. Then I consulted what I should do, as the Girl could not be found; I went to a Broker's and discover'd some of the Things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you discover?</p>
               <p>Russel. I discover'd two Caps and a Shirt. I went about to a great many Places, and heard no more of them 'till Ten o'Clock; a Broker came to me, and he stopp'd the Girl by offering a Cap of my Wife's. When I came to the Pawnbroker's I saw it was the Girl that was with me: She had a Woman with her, and another in the Street.</p>

               <p>Turner. On the 13th Day of March the Prisoner brought a Child's Cap; she said it was her Sister's; I look'd down Stairs to see how she was dress'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, do you hear what Mrs. Turner says; and Russel says he lost some Linnen out of his House, and she says you brought some of those Things to her to pawn.</p>

            . The 13th of March last the Person was brought to me, (the Prisoner at the Bar) but there is a vast Alteration; for she was then dress'd vastly clean. She brought to my Shop one Gown, an Apron, and a Piece of Stuff-Damask, and there was another Woman with her. She wanted 12 s. for it, I told her I could not lend her so much upon it; then when she came again I ask'd her whether they were her own, and she said they were her Sister's.</p>

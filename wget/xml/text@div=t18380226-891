                  </hi>. My father is a blacksmith and farrier. I saw the two prisoners together on the 1st of March, by Atkins, the doctor's—they came up to me between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I passed into the road, as I thought they were going to hit me—they said, "Do not be frightened," and asked me if I would go on an errand, and they would give me three pence—I said yes, I would, and they gave me this plane—Heath spoke to me—they were both together—Crowley told me to ask 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—then Heath gave it to me—I went to the pawn<lb></lb>broker, and I heard them say, if the pawnbroker stopped me, one was to come in, and say it was his tool—they were dressed as they are now, like soldiers—they had caps on—I went to the pawnbroker's, and he was stopped—I took the pawnbroker to the two prisoners, and they said, "I will come and have a talk to you," but instead of coming up, then ran away—they were taken on the Friday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. The last witness, Symes, came to me to pawn this plane—he said he would show me the person who gave it him—Heath came into the shop first—I asked him if it was his—he said yes, he bought it in London—he went and fetched the other prisoner—I said "Is this yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Does this belong to you?"—he said, yes, he bought in King-street, of an auc<lb></lb>tioneer—I asked him who—he said Jackson or Johnston—I called for the police, and they then ran away—I am sure they are the same persons—I picked them out of the regiment on Friday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Norwich. I was in London on the 7th of September, in the evening, at the corner of St. Mar<lb></lb>tin's-le-Grand—the lamps had just been lighted—I observed a cabroilet coming from Cheapside, towards where I was standing—It was not more than three or four yards from me—It was not driving at an unusual pace—than did not observe any other carriage about at the time; the road was clear—I saw an elderly gentleman pass me, going from the umbrella shop to Panyer-alley, crossing form St. Martin's-le-Grand, across Newgate-street—I saw the horse's head, or some part of the animal, knock him down—he came in contact with the near wheel, and the street being slippery, forced him some little distance, and the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over him—he was first knocked down by the horse, and came in contace with the wheel, that pushed him along about two yards, and at last went over him—I was at the hind part of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and did not see the driver—I called out. "Halloo! stop"—as soon as he was knocked down—I called out loud enough for the driver to hear—he did not stop when I called—one or two witnesses picked the gentleman up, and I ran after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a witness had hold of it before I got up—It had proceeded nine or</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Milton-street, Cripplegate, and am an undertaker. I was four yards from St. Martin's-le-Grand, and saw the cab coming from Cheapside—It did not come down St. Martin's-le-Grand it—the driver was coming along at a fast trotting pace, what I should call <hi rend="italic">swinging</hi> round the bend of Cheapside—I saw an elderly gentleman cross<lb></lb>ing the road, and saw him knocked down by the horse—he went under the horse, which must have trampled on him—he then went under the off-wheel, the mud being slippery—he drew himself up from one wheel, and got under the other—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> kept going on—the gentleman was pushed by the wheels, and at length the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over him—I called out loudly to the driver, directly I saw the gentleman against the horse's head—I said, "Halloo, for God's sake, stop, for you are running over some<lb></lb>body"—I was then within a yard of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did not take the least notice, but kept striking the horse with the whip after I used that expres<lb></lb>sion—a gentleman was sitting in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the time, who did not attempt to get out—I went round the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and took the name and number, while it was going on—It had just passed over the body—I did not see him stopped, for my attention was directed to the gentleman, whom I assisted to life up—he walked two or three paces—he said, he had just left some friends at the Bull-and-Mouth inn—he had no sooner spoken, than he suddenly dropped, and I did not hear him speak a work afterwards—he was taken into Mr. Peppercorn's, in Newgate-street, and examined—I kept hallooing to the driver to stop, while the gentleman was in contact of the wheel—the whip was used after I called out, and before the wheels went over the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live in Titterton Terrace, Islington. I was in New<lb></lb>gate street, against the second house from St. Martin's-le-Grand, on the north side of the street, within one door of the corner, standing on the curb with my face towards the road, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming from the East—I cannot say whether from Cheapside or St. Martin's-le-Grand—It was going at the rate they usually go at when they have got a fare—I should think from seven to nine miles an hour—I saw a man in the road in very immi<lb></lb>nent danger, in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> horse being so close to him—I thought it impossible he could get out of the way—I called immediately to the driver—I stood abreast of the driver at the time, and called out to him to stop—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was about the middle of the road—the road is about wide enough for three carriages to go abreast—the driver was directly facing me, on my side—the horse was close to the gentleman when I first saw it, but it had not touched him—I called out "Stop," loud enough for the driver to hear me—I should consider he might have heard me at three times that distance—the instant I called out, the man was stopped by the near shoulder of the home—the gentleman's face was rather obliquely towards Paternoster-row—he was knocked down—I saw him under the wheels a foot or two before the wheel came on his body—I never ceased calling out till I seized the horse by the reins—the driver used his whip and shook the reins to urge the horse on after I had called out, and other persons had called out—I ob<lb></lb>served the wheel go over the gentleman—It brought the horse rather to a stand still—the man being so bulky—the driver was not allowed to proceed further, in consequence of my seizing the horse—the constable No. 99 came and took him—when I stopped the horse, I said, "You d----rascal, why did you not stop, you have run over the man"—he made no answer—he appeared quite stupid—I do not think he was drunk—he appears a very heavy stupid man—he said, "Take my number," or "You have got my number," and wanted to go away—If he had stopped when I first called to him the accident would have been prevented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear any one besides yourself call out "Stop" before the accident happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—the horse was brought nearly to a stand still by the accident, and at that time he struck the horse with the whip—the near wheel came against the body, and at that time he whipped the horse—the gentleman was close to the horse when I called "Stop"—he was struck and staggered several paces, and the near wheel came against his side—he was struck almost at the same time as I called—the cabman could not have prevented the first blow being struck, I think, as he was too near the man—I have not driven lately myself—I have driven a chaise—he was going at a quick pace—I cannot exactly say the number of miles an hourhe had all the road to himself—there was no other carriage—"I</p>

               <p>think it was impossible for the gentleman to avoid the horse—he was on the near side shoulder of the horse—pulling the right rein would have prevented the accident—I think the gentleman was aware of his danger—the gentleman's face was in an oblique direction towards St. Paul's—I had not seen him before he got close on the carriage—I saw a gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and spoke to him in the prisoner's presence, when the policeman came up—I think the prisoner said he did not know that he had done wrong—t e gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> told the prisoner where he lived.</p>

He was about 56 or 58 years old—he came over to this country in June, having a cataract in both eyes—one had been removed, and the other also—he had a shade over his left eye—he was in perfect health—I never knew him at all deaf—I saw him in the hospital—that was the gentleman I speak of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had both eyes been operated upon at the time of the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and one had a shade from a slight inflammation which he had—he was in the habit of wearing spectacles in the street—I heard him express himself that his sight was considerably affected, but he could see perfectly well with his right eye with his spectacles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not see the gentleman at all. I never knew any thing of it—the gentleman in the cab said he did not see the gentle<lb></lb>man, and asked what I was stopped for—he told the policeman where he lived, and gave me his direction, but I was so frightened I could not take it—I was going to Berkeley-square with him—I declare to God I knew no more about it than a child unborn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in John-street, Tottenham-court-road. I was in Newgate-street on the evening of the accident, about seven o'clock—I was standing at the corner of, I think, Mr. Walkins's umbrella shop, waiting for a friend of mine, and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming up—I heard "Stop, stop!" called—I immediately went on the other side of the way and saw a horse stumble and plunge a little way—soon after that a tall thin gentelman, (I think, dressed in black,)got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw the prisoner taken into custody—he said, "Take me where you will, I am willing to go, "or something to that effect, "I am not con<lb></lb>scions of doing any harm.

                  </hi>. I am out of business. I have been a coal-merchant, and live in Gough-street, Gray's-inn-road. On the evening of the 7th of September, I was coming down Aldersgate-street—I saw the prisoner with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he was sitting on the driver's seat, at the beginning of St. Mar<lb></lb>tin's-le-Grand. in Aldersgate-street, on the rank—I saw him called, and he went off to the left band, to the corner of the Post-office—It</p>

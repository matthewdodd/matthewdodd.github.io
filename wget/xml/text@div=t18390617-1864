                  </hi>. I am store clerk to Mr. Thomas Goding of the Cannon Brewery, at Knightsbridge—he rents store-cellars for ale in Charlotte-street, Pimlico—Mr. King's yard adjoins to those premises—I went there with the officers on the 30th of May—we found two barrels, and part of another had been drawn out—Mr. Goding's ale had been drawn out of them—18 gallons, or 72 quarts—we have some particular candles there—the wicks have one red thread in them—we take them there, a few at a time, and put them in the box—I have examined some stout now produced, it is Mr. Goding's—it is the same as is in the casks in those cellars.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the B division, of police. On the 1st of June I went to the cellars under Charlotte-street Chapel—I placed myself in one of the vaults—it is divided into six departments—I was in the middle one—I heard a rumbling noise in the adjoining vault at the end, and soon after I saw the prisoner Doherty with a lighted candle in his hand—he examined the place, and immediately after went to a bar<lb></lb>rel with this measure in his hand—I saw him take out a spile from the barrel, and fill the measure with the beer in that barrel—he then conveyed it to a hole in the wall where he got in at—I did not see him get in, but he could get in no other way—he gave the beer to Morse and another—he returned three several times more to the same barrel, filled the mea<lb></lb>sure each time, and took it to the bole in the wall—on the fifth time, while he was in the act of knocking the spile in he moved his position, and saw me advancing, he fell down, and the light went out—I fell on the</p>

               <p>top of him—I saw decidedly that the other person was Morse—I after that went to King's yard, and took Morse—I went into the stable, and found this funnel with the froth of malt liquor on it, and close by it I found this bung, and the cuttings of another bung—when I took Doherty I took this measure of beer from him—I put it into this jar now pro<lb></lb>duced—the hole in the wall is 16 inches by 10—I could not get through it—there were three bars built in the wall, which had been sawn asunder top and bottom, and put in their places with a quantity of hop matting to support them—I found them so when I went at 4 o'clock in morning—both the prisoners are servants to Mr. King.</p>

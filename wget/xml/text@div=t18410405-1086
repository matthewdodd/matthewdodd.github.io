                  </hi>. I am a pauper in Mile-end workhouse, and so were the prisoner and William Spence—the prisoner is sixty-six years of age, and the deceased was seventy-eight—they had had some aggravating words before the day in question—the deceased aggravated first. On the 17th of March, the deceased got up and said be would knock the prisoner's b—y head off—the prisoner said, "Come on"—they collared one another, and wrestled for about ten or fifteen minutes—they <hi rend="italic">capsized</hi> a form, and at last the deceased fell, and his head went against the form, by his left ear, very hard—I told him he had better have no more of it—he said he would die first—he could scarcely stand when I lifted him up—they wrestled again, and he got the prisoner down—I did not at that time apprehend that any mischief was done to him—he ate his broth afterwards, but not his bread—this happened between ten and eleven o'clock—at six in the evening he said he was not well, and two men led him to the sick ward—he died between five and six o'clock next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in between six and se<lb></lb>ven o'clock in the evening of the 17th of March—the deceased was in bed, quite insensible—he had several bruises about his face, and one on the left ear, and he was suffering from concussion of the brain—he died next morning—I afterwards opened the head, and found a large quantity of blood effused on the brain, which was quite sufficient to cause his death—falling with his head against a form was no doubt the cause of it.</p>

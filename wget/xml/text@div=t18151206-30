Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the 4th of December, Mrs. Walker was sitting in the parlour, and said, she heard something fall in the shop. I immediately looked, and saw a piece of flannel laying on the ground; I was in the shop; at the same time I missed a piece of bed tick; I did not see any person in the shop at all. I ran out, and turned into East street, and saw the prisoner running with something under his arm, and under his coat; I called stop thief, and ran after him; I got within two or three yards of him, and then he dropped the tick; I picked it up; he ran about twenty yards further, and was stopped by somebody else. That tick was on a stool inside the shop door, at about two feet from the shop door; the flannel which was knocked down, was on the same stool. That is all I know. The tick is here, and is worth thirty shillings; that is the buying price. (Tick produced.) That is my tick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the street, and heard a cry of stop thief, and I ran; I never had the tick in my possession at all.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, after summing up the evidence to the Jury, resolved the case as follows for their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060018"></xptr>consideration. "I then asked the witness as to the situation of the ticking in the shop; he said it was inside the shop, about two feet from the door. If you are satisfied that the prisoner is the person who had the tick in his possession, and dropped it on being pursued, it is then for you to say, whether that is conclusive evidence of his having stolen it; and then, (this being a capital charge,) only one question will remain for your consideration, namely, whether the situation of the tick was such that a person coming by, could snatch it without going into the shop, for that would not be privately stealing in the shop."</p>

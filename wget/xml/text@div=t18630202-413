I am a traveler, and live at No. 15, Golden—square, Regent—street—on Tuesday, the 13th January, I was in West Smithfield, at the top of King—street, between half—past 5 and 6—as I was walking along somebody came up and touched me at the back of the hat—Jenkins did that—I am quite sure of that—at that time there were five or six others in his company—two others took me by the collar of the coat, while Jenkins came and pulled my watch—guard, which was round my neck; the watch was attached to it—he took away a gold key, a cornelian ring, and a threepenny and a fourpenny piece, very old coins—the watch was not taken, in conse<lb></lb>quence of the chain breaking—the other things were attached to the chain as "charms"—the watch was snatched at, and the swivel broken—I called out, u Police"—I did not seize the prisoner, I seized one that was by the side of me, and the prisoner came and struck me with his left hand upon my left cheek—he then got away, and the other two made off—they all got away—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my hat, which they knocked down—I did not see the prisoner until he was taken into custody on the Friday week following—the police sent for me; I identified him—he was then among five or six other prisoners—I could identify him very clearly—I am quite positive he is the man.</p>

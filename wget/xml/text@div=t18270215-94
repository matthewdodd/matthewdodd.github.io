             generally paid ready money; I hardly ever knew her omit - on the 31st of January I sent a bushel of coals to her house by the prisoner, between three and four o'clock; he came back, and said, in the evening, that she had not paid, and he had put it down on the slate; they came to 1s. 4d. On the 2d of February a lady came to pay me for a sack of coals - I said it was a sack and a half; the prisoner heard that, and ran away; he lived a few doors from me; I took him when he came home at night, and accused him of it; he said he had only taken 2l. 5s., and hoped I would let him come back and work it out.</p>

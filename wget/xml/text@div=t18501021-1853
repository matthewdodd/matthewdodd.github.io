                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe warehouseman, of Chapel-street, Somers'-town. On the night of 3rd Oct., about one o'clock, I was returning home with my cousin, Joseph Jackson—in Brill-row we went into a pie-shop—the prisoner came in—I had seen him before—he began to abuse my cousin; called him a white-livered b——, and told him to go home and die—I told him not to use such language—we remained in the pie-shop about ten minutes, eating two twopenny pies—we then left, and went towards our home, straight up Chapel-street—the prisoner followed after us, still abusing us—to get rid of his annoyance, I made up my mind to go home with my cousin, who lives opposite the railway-station—I parted with him at the African Chief, about six yards from where he lives—the prisoner was then on the opposite side of the way—I turned back and knocked at my own door—the prisoner then crossed over to me, and I left my door and went down the street, then turned back and met him—he got in front of me, and struck me, and snatched at my chain, and broke my key off in trying to get it away—it was a gold Albert chain—the swivel was in my watch, and my watch was</p>

               <p>in my fob, and the key of the guard was put through the button-hole of my waistcoat—I put my hand down and saved the chain, and said, "Is that what you mean? I will <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to you for this"—the key was caught in my trowsers and I saved it—the prisoner then walked away, and I after him, to see if I could get a policeman—he went up Ossulton-street, and then crossed over to the African Chief—two men were standing there—I stood twenty or thirty yards off, being frightened seeing three of them, and I heard him say to one of them, "There is the b——; he is following me now"—he then crossed over up Ossulton-street again—I went after him, and hallooed out "Police!" as he was going rather quick—two policemen then came up, and I gave him in charge for assaulting and attempting to rob me—I had kept him in sight, thinking I should see a policeman, but did not.</p>

I heard cries of "Police!" in Chapel-street, Somers'-town—I went in that direction, and saw the prosecutor having hold of the prisoner by the collar—he said he gave him in charge for assaulting him, and attempting to steal his watch-guard—the prisoner said he did not attempt anything of the sort—the prosecutor showed me the chain broken—I have it here, it is exactly in the same state—it is one of the links that is broken—the prisoner and prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>

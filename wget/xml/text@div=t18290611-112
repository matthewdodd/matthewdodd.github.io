            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 19th of May I saw the two prisoners a quarter of a mile from Frederick-place; I followed them - two persons stopped them, and gave them into my care; I found some covings belonging to a stove, which I produce, but I found no glass - the prisoners were taken into the George public-house; I found nothing on them but this rule: I have fitted these covings to the house, and they fit exactly.</p>

            . My attention was attracted by seeing the sashes cut from the prosecutor's houses; they had been safe the night before, when some persons had been removing out; I went to give an alarm, and Hollington passed me within fifty yards of the house, with a bundle in; his arms; a woman gave me information, and I ran after him - when he got near the Geroge these covings were on the ground; I saw the back of some other man which him, but I cannot say who it was; they were then taken to the public-house; Hollington ran full a quarter of a mile - I kept him in sight except when he turned the corners.</p>

            . I was going to my work that morning, between five and six o'clock. down Jubilee-place; I saw the two prisoners coming up a turing-Guy was pursuing them, crying Stop thief! I pursued, and nearly stopped one, and then I ran after the other; a man came out of a door and stopped Breeling, and Hillman caught him; no glass has been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BREELING. Q. Which had the covings? A. I cannot exactly say, but they were dropped between them; I think Breeling had them.</p>
               <p>HOLLINGTON'S Defence. I saw these two pieces of iron lying, and put them in my lap; I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I had got about a hundred yards.</p>

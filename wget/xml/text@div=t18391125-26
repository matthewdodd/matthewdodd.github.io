On the 23rd of September Jackson took a room of mine, at No. 14, Little Church-street—I went to the room the next morning, and she promised to give me the earnest—I saw Valentine there—I called him Mr. Jackson—he lived with her as her husband—I went to the room afterwards, and saw Valentine there alone—I asked if Mrs. Jackson was at home—he said, "No"—I went two or three days after, and there was no one there at all—I examined these rooms, and missed the articles stated—I did not see the prisoner again till they were at Marylebone office—this is my glass.</p>

               <p>and enter it on the card, to return the card to the person paying, and to make an entry in his book corresponding with the entry on the card—Friday was the day he would come to me to account—he would produce this book and make out a slip which should correspond with the total entered in the book for that week—there is the page of the collecting-book referred to in the first column, so that from this you can tell what amount he has attri<lb></lb>buted to each column in the collecting-book—it was his duty to give me this slip, to produce the book, and then to account to me for the total of the weekly collection—he would pay over the money to me in accordance with those accounts—his signature is at the bottom—on Mrs. Fogarty's sick-fund card on 22d June the prisoner has entered in his book fivepence instead of sixpence—the card is sixpence—nothing is entered on the burial-fund on that day; that makes sevenpence in the burial, and one penny in the sick, defi<lb></lb>cient—on Garris' on 22d June there is fivepence entered instead of sixpence—to Cockwell on the same day fivepence is entered in the book and tenpence on the card—there is nothing entered in his book on 15th June, the week before—on 27th July there is nothing entered on Fogarty's burial-fund in the book—on the card is twopence and five single pennies—on 3d August nothing is entered on the burial account; by the card, sevenpence was received—on 27th July on Martin's sick-fund fivepence is entered and on Cockwell's five-pence—nothing is entered in either case for the previous week, the 20th—by the card tenpence was received for each of them—there is nothing entered to Gale's sick-fund on 3d August—fivepence is on the card—nothing to Dredge, fivepence on the card—fivepence entered to Fogarty, sixpence on the card—there is nothing entered to Gale's burial-fund, on the card seven pence—Dodge's burial on the same date nothing, fivepence on the card—on Blight's there is nothing entered on the burial-fund—there are ticks made to indicate nothing as in all the others I have spoken of—there is eightpence on Blight's burial-card—on Kemper's there is nothing entered—fourpence was paid for two weeks, nothing in entered for either week—nothing entered to Pearce, fourpence on the card; that makes 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered short on that day—I have the slips for 22d June, 27th July, and 3d August—I have compared those slips with the entries in the book, and they correspond—all the deficiencies left out in the book are left out in the slips, the slips and the book tally—he accounted on those days from the slip—he did not at any time account to me for any of the sums we have been speaking of, or pay them over to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this man in the service when you joined the Society first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—a person named Degg was the manager before me—I am not aware that ho is here to-day—the prisoner received instruc<lb></lb>tions from him—I don't know where Mr. Degg lives now, his office is in Moorgate-street—in the burial-fund alone, and all new business, the prisoner was allowed to retain six weeks' collection on all newly entered members, not transfer members—the date of the entrance of new members would appear in the book—it was some years ago that he transferred members from other societies, consequently he must know that the members, he collects from now are not new members—he is allowed 25 per cent: on the burial collections and 12 1/2 on the sick—he would not have to account for the six weeks' collections or enter them at all, he would put them on the member's card, but not in his book—I am not aware that the prisoner collected from any members except those he had himself introduced—he had to collect from about 1, 200 people, I think—I believe he did his collection in the week—it would be about 200 persons a day that he would have to collect from—to some places he only went once a fortnight, when they lived at a great distance—he</p>

               <p>would have to walk a great number of miles to earn 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I would not say twenty—I obtained this book from the prisoner—he has not applied to me since to see it—I believe that an application was made by a solicitor—I be<lb></lb>lieve Mr. Carpenter wrote in reply to the effect that from 10 in the morning till 3 in the afternoon the attorney could see the books, but that they could not be sent to the prison—the prisoner was in Newgate at that time—after this charge was made, the prisoner went round with me to a few customers in one street—when I first asked him he refused—we went to about fourteen or fifteen customers—the mode by which we discover that sums have not been paid, is by comparing his books and the cards—the amount of our income this year is about 77, 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the burial branch alone—I cannot say how much is paid to officers without the balance sheet—I am not aware that somewhere about 29,069<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in salaries to officers, making a whole expenditure of 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think that includes the per centage for the collectors—I cannot say whether the whole expenditure is 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have not read Mr. Tidd Pratt's report—I have seen my own balance-sheet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the prisoner was allowed to retain six weeks' collection on new subscribers, are any of those persons whose names are mentioned here and who have been called as witnesses, new subscribers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe only one—the prisoner's payment was about 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and for that he had a great deal of work to do, and a great deal of ground to go over—he did not at first make more than 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—nobody has been to look at the books to my knowledge since the offer was made—we have always been ready to give them any information from the books—the prisoner was out on bail nine days, I think, after this charge was made—he did not then apply to see the books—to my knowledge copies of the indict<lb></lb>ment have been sent to the prisoner in this case—at the end of this book there is entered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. arrears—that is brought over from the old to the new book, from a subsequent book—that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is an arrear for Fogarty's sick fund—according to the card with the prisoner's figures on it, there is no arrear at all in the sick-fund, it is his private mark—I find in the first book that five sums of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each are omitted in Fogarty's sick-fund, which would make the half-crown entered in the new book—in Fogarty's burial-fund, there are two weeks omitted here for all of them—there are no arrears entered in this book—on Joseph Gale's sick-fund in the new book 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. arrears are entered; on George Dodge's 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Garris's 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Martin's 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on Cockwell's 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—by the cards there is nothing due; but in his new collecting book all those amounts tally with the omissions in the former book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did the prisoner have to account by his books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every week the book came in and the slips, and he would cast up the columns, and I should compare it with the slip—one book lasts six months—he would retain it for six months—these several Amounts tally with the castings as the book now stands—I call the figures out to a clerk in the office page by page, to see if they are entered right—I do not add them up to see if it is added right—the prisoner pays in the amount less 25 per cent, on the burial, and less 12 1/2 on the sick—we have a general audit every six months.</p>

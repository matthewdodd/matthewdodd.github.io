After our removal to the Isle of Wight, I was absent upon a voyage to the South Sea; upon my return, I found my wife connected with a gang of smugglers; she had taken to drinking, and was in a deseased state; I did every thing to recover her again; it was ineffectual. I placed my wife with Mr. Pearce. I went down to Rye; where I formed an inproper connection with my second wife; her friends were very inportunate with me to marry her; I offered to give a bond of five hundred pounds to marry the second wife upon the death of the first. I obtained no property by either of my wives; I have neither deserted my first wife, or any of my children, to be sure, about a twelvemonth back, my means would not afford me to do as much for them as I had before. I entreat the merceful consideration of the court.</p>

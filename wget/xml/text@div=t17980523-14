               <p>Prosecutor. He had applied to the parish, and they would not take him in; the night before this happened, he told me he had fell into a well; and I told him, it was very strange he could not see a well in the middle of a field; why, says he, I went backwards into it, to get some water to water the garden; I asked him how he dried his clothes; and he said, he walked about the field; he was not in liquor. <rs id="t17980523-14-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

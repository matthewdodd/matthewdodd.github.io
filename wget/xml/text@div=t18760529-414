                  </hi>. I live at Baldwin Street, and am a shape'maker—on 16th May I was in the City Road with a man named Williams—the prisoner came by in a trap, and Williams hailed him, and we went into a public-house, and I drank with the prisoner and Williams—Williams left then, and I went with the prisoner in his trap—we stopped at East Road, at the Prince of Wales—the prisoner offered to drive me to Leytonstone, and I accepted the offer and went with him—on the road two men were hailed that I knew nothing of, and we went into the Belgrave Arms—there some liquor was called for, and the prisoner and the other two men began quarrelling—one of the men said "You have got a b——lot to say about it," and put his arm under my chin—I had taken no part in it before, and the prisoner put his hand into, my pocket—I took hold of his hand, and I said "Is that what you mean?" and I took hold of the man who had put his arm under my chin with my left hand—the prisoner or a little dark man who is not in custody, I cannot tell which, said "We mean having it; you had better let go"—I struggled with them as well as I coul'd, and they kicked me about the legs until I had to let go—they all went away in the trap, I expect—I went to the station and gave information, and afterwards saw the prisoner in custody on the 18th—Mr. Titmus was present when I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290066"></xptr>
               <p>identified him, and the prisoner said "Have mercy on me; think of my wife and children. I know you can transport me, but what good will that do you now?"—when I was going in to sign the charge he said I should put him away, "but so help me God it was the little dark man who had it"—that was the second admission he made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had been into three houses; the first was in the City Road—that was before I saw the prisoner and his cart—I was in the company of Mr. Williams, who is a fishmonger—I had a little cold sherry-and-water; that was the first thing I had that day—we then went to the Prince of Wales in East Road—the prisoner was with me then, and he was the only one I was talking to; I didn't know anyone else—I was sober—the landlord of the Prince of Wales did not threaten to turn me out; there was no suggestion that I should leave the place—I was robbed at the Bel<lb></lb>grave Arms—I was not drunk there; the landlord did not tell me to take care of myself and not show my money—there was a quart of stout-and-mild called for at the Belgrave Arms, and one glass consumed; in fact we hardly touched it—at the Prince of Wales we had cold sherry-and-water—I went into three public-houses—the first was the Fountain, where I had cold sherry-and-water, the second cold sherry-and-water, and the third, where I say the robbery was committed, there was a pot of stout-and-mild called for, which was not drunk—Mr. Williams and I had been together that morning to a parochial election at Radnor Street—I went to the Green Gate public-house with Williams, and I had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of cold sherry there—that was about 11.30 a.m., as near as I can recollect—I do not usually begin at that time—I do not remember any other gate or sign—when I was at the Fountain with Williams, he saw the prisoner and his wife pass in the cart, and Williams hailed him—Williams did not go home with me—in the evening I called on him; we did not go to the prisoner's house or lodgings that night—we went to inquire what cart it was that the prisoner was in, so that we might try to find his lodgings—I admit I had had four 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worths of sherry-and-water—I was sober.</p>

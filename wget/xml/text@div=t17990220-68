               <p>Mr. Fielding. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. From the indictment which has been stated, by my learned Friend, you perceive, that you are called upon to enquire of a robbery committed in the Mint, for which robbery the prisoner at the bar is indicted as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200072"></xptr>the principal offender; the two persons who have just retired from the bar, are not at all involved in the consideration of the guilt of the person at present standing there, they not being looked upon in the present case as principal offenders, but only as accessaries after the fact.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will find, in the course of your enquiry here, that the robbery complained of is of as bold an aspect as has been heard of late. It happened on the 20th of December last that the offence was committed; it has been told you, by my learned Friend, that the property upon the present occasion is described in three different ways in this indictment, on account of the manner in which the different persons concerned became possessed of the property; it was necessary so to describe it, conformable to the custom that has prevailed. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England are interested, because the bullion which goes from the Bank to the Mint in order to be coined, goes there in ingots, is delivered over to the officers of the Mint, who have the custody therefore of it, and when it is complete in its coinage, it is returned back to the Bank; so that you perceive, the Governor and Company of the Bank of England have a property in the bullion; that being delivered to the officers of his Majesty's Mint, they, as officers, become likewise possessed of, and have the custody of it; and, upon the present occasion, those gentlemen, who are called moniers of the Mint, have an immediate custody of it from the stage that I shall presently describe to you; and the gentleman upon whom the robbery has been committed, Mr. Finch, being an immediate servant of their's, and having the immediate charge, custody, and possession of this property, the robbery being committed upon his person, and the property, which I have so described, taken from him, the offence is complete, And you being satisfied that it is the property, so far as it will be necessary to consider the property, of the moniers of the Mint, or he, as having the custody of it, that will constitute the offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It happened on the 20th of December, that the prisoner at the bar, who is a <rs id="t17990220-68-deflabel366" type="occupation">soldier in the third regiment of Guards</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17990220-68-defend571 t17990220-68-deflabel366"></join>, with another comrade of his, and two other men, I believe, belonging to the Guards, were employed in the press-room at the Mint; it being customary, in order to carry on the business of coining, to take the advantage of those men who are upon the spot, that they may come to turn what they call the fly. You, very probably know what that sort of instrument is, requiring a considerable degree of force to impress the likeness upon the coin; the gold being first cast, and then formed into blanks, it is delivered by a monier to this gentleman, Mr. Finch, in different bags, of different quantities, placed by him in a chest, where he sits and seeds the dies; and the impression being taken out, is put into another place: in this employ was Turball; on the morning of the 20th of December, his comrade, of the Guards, a man of the name of Daiton, was present; and it is the custom, in that office of the Mint, for the persons to go to their breakfast about nine o'clock; Mr. Finch being the immediate person superintending that business, dismissed them, as he thought, telling them that was the hour when they were to go to their refreshment; Dalton and Turnbull, and the other men, retired from the press-room for a little while; when the other two persons were gone, Turnbull and Dalton returned into the room; Turnbull advanced up to the spot where Mr. Finch was sitting, while Dalton kept the door; when he approached Mr. Finch, who had been sitting near the same place during the morning, Turnbull presented a pistol to him, and demanded the key of the chest; at first, Mr. Finch was not very much dismayed, he attempted, I believe, to seize the pistol, but not succeeding in that, the prisoner being a much more powerful man than himself; upon his recovering the pistol completely, he swore he would shoot him, unless he immediately delivered him the key; the key, I believe, was lying by him, and not immediately in his pocket: during this time, no assistance seemed to be offered by Dalton, and Mr. Finch began to waver, and was very considerably alarmed. I do not exactly know, he will describe himself, in what manner he behaved. There was another gentleman in the room, an elderly gentleman, of the name of Chambers, he seeing what was going on, made his advance to Turnbull, and interrogated him in this way: Are you mad, are you in your senses; what are you doing? upon which, Turnbull immediately forced him to retreat, I believe, forced him into a passage. Mr. Finch, when he saw that Turnbull had got possession of the key, he being upon his legs, was served in the same manner that Mr. Chambers was before; they were shoved into a passage, and there kept. When Turnbull had, therefore, the coast clear, and nobody to have offered the least sort of impediment, then he went to the chest and took away different bags; he had taken one bag out of this place before Mr. Finch had followed Mr. Chambers; then he took other bags away, I believe, to the amount, pretty nearly, of 2308 guineas. Here then, the offence seems complete. And with respect to the man who is now at the bar, you will have little more to enquire of, than the evidence relating to these facts. Here then the matter will first of all require the consideration of the learned Judge. I apprehend that no difficulty can, by any means, rise in the way of the most speedy determination. A robbery, as it is called in law, must be a taking from the person of another, by putting him in fear; but, as you very well know, I am sure many of you know, that the possession of a thing is not immediately limited to any definite space, but may, by construction, be carried farther or nearer; so it is with regard to personal possession, that is not confined to the actual limit of the body, but is co-extensive with the person's presence of the man; therefore, putting a personin fear, and taking from him that which is his property, and which he has the possession of in his sight, and in his presence, is certainly a taking from his person, and therefore will constitute a robbery. Why then, with respect to the crime itself in the outset, merely going upon these facts, it will be complete. This happened on the 20th: soon after the commission of this crime, Turnbull, with the property he had about him, made his escape; he happened to go one way, when Dalton went another; how it happened, it is not for me to guess, but so the fact appears; whether it arose from timidity, whether from alarm, or whether from honesty, it is impossible for me to say; he some how or other spread an alarm, and it was soon discovered. Soldiers, being necessarily about that place, came to the spot, and Mr. Franklin, the immediate superior of Mr. Finch, hearing some disturbance in the press-room, he went to the spot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200073"></xptr>where he did not find Mr. Finch, Mr. Finch and Chambers at that time being in the place where Turnbull had put them: Turnbull effected his escape for that morning; of course, upon the discovery that was made, every activity was put in force in order to discover the man; he was not heard of from that time till the 5th of January following, when he was apprehended at Dover. He had arrived at Dover in a vessel belonging to a man of the name of Rufford; but Rufford not being contented to carry him to the coast of France, where he wanted to go, he made what enquiry he could at Dover to effect that purpose there; first of all by a servant of Rufford, he was led to a man of the name of Ward; Ward happened to have in his possession at the very moment of his application a description of the person of Turnbull, and a description of the robbery at the Mint, and therefore he immediately made his application to another man of the name of Collison, a constable, and another person was likewise called in, three of them together, who, instead of enabling him to escape to France, took him into custody. Upon taking him into custody, and searching his person, 1000 and odd guineas were found about him, upon which occasion, without much reluctance, he acknowledged to Ward and to the other persons that were with him, that he was the man who had committed the robbery at the Mint; they then took him to a gentleman, the Town-clerk, I believe, of Dover, and he was sent to town.</p>

               <p>Here then, in the front of the case, will stand his confession, which will be complete evidence; but, upon the evidence of Mr. Finch, there will not remain the least doubt, that, without that confession, the evidence would be irresistible. Thus stands this most uncommon, this most andacious, this most intrepid robbery. At present, therefore, you will hear these circumstances from the evidence; and, I apprehend, no doubt can be entertained of the case, and it will be your duty to find him guilty.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before now, some questions have arisen with respect to the parish in which this robbery was committed, that question, my Lord knows, is now perfectly at rest. Then, upon the present occasion, it is necessary for me to state to you what was the immediate situation of Mr. Finch: he is a young man, who is an apprentice to a monier; the moniers are described in the indictment by their names; they are,

            , John Nicholl, and Richard Franklin. These gentlemen, who go on in the employ of the Mint, are immediately the superintendants of the coinage; they take to themselves a set of young gentlemen, who are brought up to succeed to these places. In this situation Mr. Finch was then acting; so that he certainly was in custody of all these several bags that I have described. These, gentlemen the moniers, are responsible for the failure of the lowest species of weight after the bullion is delivered to them; so that they have, to every intent and purpose, that sort of custody upon which the depredation mentioned in the present instance is imputed.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Were you engaged in the business of coining on the 20th of December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any blanks delivered to you that morning? - A. I had eight journies of blanks delivered to me to coin.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a journey? - A. A bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much was contained in each? - A. Six hundred and sixty-eight blanks in each bag, to be made into guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they delivered to you? - A. By Mr. Franklin, one of the moniers.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you begin to work in the press-room? - A. About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is necessary to have four people to work the fly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the four people? - A. The prisoner, Turnbull; a man, who turns out to be Dalton, but I did not then know his name; and two of the Tower Hamlets militia.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business? - A. To seed the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, I believe, to put a blank between the two dies, that it may be stamped with the proper impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what end of the room do you sit? - A.Sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another. At the end where the fire is, there is a hole in the ground before the press, where I sit to feed the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these eight bags of blanks at the time you were at work? - A. In the same room, at the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did these people, who were managing the fly, stay in the room? - A.Till nearly nine o'clock, we always go to breakfast at that time; I told them all to go to breakfast; they all went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a Mr. Chambers in the room at the time? - A. Yes, he is surveyor of the presses.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the nature of that business? - A.He takes care of the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any charge of the blanks? - A. No, that was my charge.</p>
               <p>Q. After these people had left the room to breakfast, what happened? - A. In about a minute, or scarcely a minute, two of them returned; Turnbull came in first, and Dalton came in next, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dalton remain within side of the room?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200074"></xptr>- A. Yes; Turnbull then came up to me with a pistol, and said, give me the key, saying so once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the key? - A. It then laid before me, I had just taken it out of my pocket; I caught hold of the pistol, which Turnbull wrested from me in an instant: seeing the man at the door offer no assistance, I was so struck with fear, that I could not resist any farther; Turnbull then held the pistol to me again, saying, give me the key; he swore several times; I do not immediately recollect the oaths; he took the key up from off the press, where it laid before me, unlocked the chest, took out one bag, which he put within his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him do that? - A. I saw him do that, he put it within his coat; I do not know whether it was a pocket or bag, or what.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that which was contained in the bag he took? - A. Coined guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.What year had you been coining that morning? - A. The date of 1798; I offered to move out of the hole where I was sitting, when Turnbull said, if you offer to stir, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had taken possession of this one bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he come up to you at that time? - A. No, he only took a step towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards might the trunk be from you at that time? - A.Five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after he had threatened you? - A. Mr. Chambers, who had been making breakfast, about four or five yards from Turnbull, came up with a poker in his hand, and said you are mad, man, what are you doing, consider what you are about; Turnbull put the pistol to Mr. Chambers's forehead, and shoved him into a passage; I then made for the door that goes out into the Mint.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the door that Turnbull came in at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Dalton there then? - A. I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him in the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. If you had got out at that door, you could have given the alarm? - A. Yes, I could have got to the monier; Turnbull came up to me, and holding the pistol to my ear, said, go in there too, pointing to the passage where he had put Mr. Chambers; I went in, and he locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you effected your deliverance? - A. We were let out in about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you returned, what deficiency of money was there? - A. Four bags were gone, but part of one of the bags was spilt in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were missing altogether? - A. I do not know exactly; Mr. Franklin weighed them.</p>
               <p>Q.Turnbull had been at work two hours? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man? - A. I am certain he is the man, he had worked there several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.What is Mr. Chambers? - A. A surveyor of the presses.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the charge of the money, in consequence of your being an apprentice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And only in the character of an apprentice? - A. Yes, I am apprentice to Mr. Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the moniers do not trust the money with any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not hold that to be material; it appears, at present, that he has the charge and custody of the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. The moniers frequently superintend this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not committed entirely to your care, the moniers superintend you? - A. Yes, they come in.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence do the blanks come which were put there for the purpose of being stamped? - A. They come from the mill-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who superintends the mill-room? - A. The moniers.</p>
               <p>Q. In all the stages of coining, the moniers superintend? - A. Yes, every thing, except the casting, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the blanks given out by any particular monier? - A. I had these from the mill-room from Mr. Franklin; I was to bring them back when I coined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Franklin to give an account to the rest of the moniers? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were any of the moniers superintending you at the time this robbery was committed? - A. No,</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose any of these guineas had been lost, are you responsible? - A. They may make me responsible.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person entrusted? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the morning of the 20th of December, what you entrusted to his care? - A. I do. On the 20th, about seven o'clock in the morning, I delivered to Mr. Finch eight bags of guinea blanks, each bag containing 668 pieces, for the purpose of being coined. About nine o'clock there was an alarm, I was in the millroom; I went to the press-room, which is about seventy yards, I believe, or thereabouts, where Mr. Finch was employed; I opened the press-room door, but did not see either Mr. Finch or Mr. Chambers there, the two persons who ought to have been there: in consequence of some information, I saw them let out of a passage that goes out of the press-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the place where these bags were deposited? - A. I opened the chest, I think it was shut; I opened it, and saw three bags and part of another at the bottom of the chest, and the contents of another bag in a tray at the press, and the bag lying by it; I took them up to the mill-room, and weighed them; I found deficient 2308 guineas</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the press-room that morning yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had not seen the prisoner that morning? - A. No, I had not; I had seen him before, several times, coming to fetch the blanks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether the moniers are incorporated or not? - A. I believe we call ourselves so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you, or are you not, a corporation? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you undertake to say whether you are or not? - A. I can say we are not.</p>

               <p>Q. You receive gold from other corporate bodies, besides the Bank? - A. No, we do not; we received it from the Mint-office.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Bank send you a quantity of bullion, you are to return a certain quantity of guineas? - A. We return weight for weight.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, if they sent you 20lbs. weight of gold, you return them 20lbs. weight of guineas? - A.Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. He wanted a boat? - A. Yes, or any thing else. I suspected that he could not be any thing of any consequence, and I thought it might be Mr. Turnbull; I had a bill in my pocket at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to give you, if you could have got a boat? - A.Thirty pounds. I applied to Mr. Hills, and apprized him of the business, and he went and informed Mr. Collison.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Turnbull gone away from you after the first application? - A. Yes; he was to meet me again at my store-house, which he did; and Mr. Hills and Collison came to the store-house; we all met together, and they took him down to the guard-house, and examined him, to know whether he was the man or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then what did they say to him, when they took him to the guard-house? - A. They desired to search him, to see if he had any fire-arms about him, and they found upon him 1010 guineas in a belt round his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Turnbull say any thing about this money? - A. He said, there were 1000 all but two guineas; and when we came to count them, there were 1010.</p>

Yes, on the 6th of January, about one o'clock in the morning, in consequence of the information Ward gave me, I went to my brother officer, Collison, and then I went with him to Ward's store-house, there I saw the prisoner; I said to him, sir, are you ready? he said, yes, I am all ready, and spoke to one of the men to bring his trunk; and just as he got to the cill of the door, I collared him, and my partner took him round the body; I told him, he was my prisoner; we searched him, and he said, he had got a belt round his body, containing 1000 guineas all to two; (produces the belt); I counted them, and there were 1010. As he was coming up, he said, he thought he could save himself from death; that he would tell his concern, and he would have the money in a quarter of an hour.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is your press-room in the city of London? - A. It is, and has always been so accounted; there is the old wall remaining now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that wall eastward or westward of the press-room? - A. It runs in a direct line from north to south, so as to lead from the mill-room to the press-room.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite certain of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The arguments of Counsel will be given at the end of the next Session.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What I have to say is merely to clear the innocent. On the 20th of December I was employed at the Mint by Mr. Finch to go and get some strong men to work in the press-room. I went into the barrack with Dalton, and asked who would work at the Mint; Dalton said, he would go; we went to work, we finished six journies, and after that Mr. Finch desired us to go to breakfast. Now it was a customary thing for one to stop, but he told us all to go; I was in hopes he would have said, one of you stop, and then I should have done the business by myself, the two Tower Hamlets men went first; I used to go to breakfast with Dalton: when I had got outside the door, I said, Dalton, you come in here; says he, what do you want; says I, don't mind, come here, I told him to follow me, and he came into the room; he said again, what do you want; and I said, I had left something, he knew nothing at all about this; I pulled out a pistol, and presented it to Mr. Finch, and demanded the key; Dalton said, several times, what are you at, and then he ran away and gave an alarm to the serjeant of the guard. There is another thing; I wish to say something more concerning other people. There were about four very respectable housekeepers in the City of London concerned; I immediately went to one of their houses, and there I stopped till the 29th of December, and got a suit of cloaths, one hundred pounds worth of Bank notes, and about a hundred old guineas. I, and another that was unsuspected, went and agreed to get a boat. I went away with my accomplices, who are unsuspected people, and are now housekeepers in London; they are unsuspected at this moment; I said to them, gentlemen, I am going on a shooting party, and shall he glad of your company; several said, they were engaged otherwise; and, at last I persuaded Bryce and Pollard to go with me; I had a gun in my hand; and upon my promising to pay all the expences, they agreed they would go with me. When we had got into Essex, I left them, and went on board a smack, I agreed for my passage to France; I gave them 98l. worth of notes. Says the captain, I had 100l. for taking a man over that had committed murder, of the name of Thomas; he said, he lived at Dunkirk, and desired me to call upon him. I believe it was the captain's inclination to take me to France, but he came to me and told me his men were not willing to go, but he would get somebody else to take me over; he said, he had got somebody to do it for 30l. and this rascally captain, after he had got the 98l. kept it.</p>

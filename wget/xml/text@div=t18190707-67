            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 16th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I went and took the prisoner at No. 3, Church-court, at work in an old iron shop; he was filing a key, or doing something to a lock; there was another man and woman in the shop. I asked the man if his name was Alabaster? he said, No. I asked the woman which was Alabaster? she pointed to the prisoner, and said that was the man. I took him into custody, and took him to Mrs. Blundell, who took the hat off his head, and the handkerchief fell out. She claimed them, and gave me another hat. I produce a third hat, which was left in Lee's room. I tried this on the prisoner's head at Queen-square, and it fitted him.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am one of the Master of the Court of Chancery, and have chambers, with the other Masters, in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. James Grant was messenger and porter—he hadthe sole care of the building day and night, had apartments in the building, and a very good salary—the House of Lords, on different occasions, have tocommunicate with the House of Commons—it is the custom to remit the"Reports of the Houses of Lords and Commons" to the Masters—these six"Reports" all have my writing in them—I kept them in a small retiring-room, to which James Grant has access—I did not give him leave to takeany of them—this was discovered by Sir William Hall missing some papers—I have seen one of these since Easter.</p>

On 1st June I took William Grantinto custody in the messenger's room, and Pocock, who was with me, took Baker—I afterwards took James Grant—when the charge was made againstthe children, the father (James) stood forward, and said, "I wish to contra<lb></lb>dictthat charge; the children have not taken the paper, I gave it them"—Isaid, "You take a great deal on yourself; am I to understand you havegiven them the whole of the papers that were stolen from Mr. Farrer?"—hesaid, "Yes"—he was then charged with the other prisoners—the charge wasread over to him, and he said, "That is a lie; there was no paper takenfrom Wingfield's"—the papers taken from Mr. Farrer were mentioned, but notcharged on the sheet—I took Baker into custody, and in the presence of allthe prisoners I asked Sarah Grant if Baker was the woman that gave her thepapers—she said she was—she had said before, that the woman gave her thepapers—Baker said, "How can you be such a wicked girl to say I gave youthe papers?"—Sarah Grant said, "You did; did not you go to Master Farrer's chambers when I was ironing, and says you wanted a few halfpence, and took some papers?"—James Grant then said, "You had better holdyour tongue; you will get into a 'mess,' or 'a scrape'"—I then told themthey had better all hold their tongues, and they were charged.</p>

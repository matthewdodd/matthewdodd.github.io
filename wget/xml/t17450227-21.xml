               <p>- Mulliner. I am servant to Mrs. Giles in Addle-street. I think it was on the 15th of October, the Prisoner came into the shop, and asked Mr. Giles [my mistress's son] if he sold nails. Mr. Giles told him, he did. He said, he wanted a parcel of nails, and if he would sell him as cheap as another, he would buy them of him. Mr. Giles asked him, what sort of nails he would have? I think he said, ten-peny nails. Mr. Giles asked him, whether they must be rose-headed nails, or clasp headed nails. He said, he could not tell; but they were to go into the country. Then I concluded they were to be rose-headed nails. He said there was a vessel lying ready for them. He pulled out a paper, whereon was wrote down what he wanted. He desired they might be looked out, and said, he would call for them in the morning. I told him, they would come to about 13 or 14 l. I went into the counting-house to Mr. Giles, and told him what the Prisoner said. Mr. Giles said to him, You are a stranger to me, and I shall expect the money. He said, he should have the money before the goods went away. Here is a note, said he, on one Mr. Simpson on Tower-hill. I looked on the bill, and there was not the name of any town upon it. Says I, Where had you this bill? He said, he had it from Yarmouth in Dorsetshire; and that he had done work, as a carpenter, for this Mr. Pierce, near Yarmouth Mr. Giles said, he would take the bill, and send it to Mr. Simpson's. The Prisoner said, he would go with him himself. Mr. Giles said, he was busy then, and could not go. There were some brads in the order: I asked him, what sort. He could not tell, but I should know in the morning. I went to Mr. Simpson's, and shewed the bill to one of his clerks, and asked, if it was a good bill. He looked upon it two or three minutes, and said, it was not a good bill: Mr. Simpson looked upon it, and said the same. I told him how I came by it. He said, he should be glad to have the person who brought it apprehended. I told him, he was to come in the morning. I went home, and acquainted Mr. Giles with it, and went afterwards to Mr. Simpson's, to desire he would send his clerk to be there, for we did not care to apprehend him ourselves. Mr. Simpson accordingly sent his man to our house, and when the Prisoner came, we sent for a constable, and secured him. [The bill was produced and read.]</p>

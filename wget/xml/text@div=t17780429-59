             on the road; when I came into town I desired him to get into the basket and mind the things because I had been robbed just before. When I got into Bishopgate-street, I turned about to set the passengers down; the porter at the Spread Eagle, in <placeName id="t17780429-59-crimeloc280">Bishopgate-street</placeName>

I gave Crawley a fresh caution to take care. I let the passengers out, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290044"></xptr> Crawley gave some of the parcels out of the basket to the porter of the inn. Crawley had a side of pork on the wheel to deliver to the porter; and I observed a man pulling at it. I went and asked him what business he had with the pork, and put my elbow against his breast, and pushed him away, and Crawley pulled it in. I then saw the prisoner on the other side with his hands in the basket. I went round to see what he was about; he jumped down; I followed him and took him by the collar and brought him on the pavement; he struck me, and three or four more fell upon me at the same time: I defended myself as well as I could; I knocked one of them down under the coach; the prisoner struck me on my breast and several parts of my face: I had scarce a free part but what was cut or bruised. We dispersed them a little, and I believe the prisoner was knocked down; after they were a little dispersed I went to look into the boot to see if I had lost any thing; the prisoner came and caught me by the leg and pulled me down, and intangled my leg in the wheel of the coach: a neighbour came to my assistance, and we secured him. Since he has been in confinement, he says, he will never leave me nor my coach while he lives; so that if he is at liberty I shall not only be in danger of my property but my life.</p>

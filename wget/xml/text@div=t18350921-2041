                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 19th of September the prisoner came and said he had come from his father for a second-hand single gun, which was for his uncle—I said, I had no single gun, but a double one—he said, it would make no difference, as his uncle had plenty of money; and as I was cleaning it, he said, "I want a pair of pistols, for an officer of the Osborne-street Court. whose life has been threatened"—I showed him a pair of the case—he said they were just the thing, and he should see the officer on Sunday—I had cleaned the gun—he requested me to make a memorandum of the gun—I said, "In what name?" he said his father's name—the price was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "What name shall I put the pistols in? he said, "The same"—and after doing so, he took the pistols off the counter, and I gave him the gun—he said he would return in two hours, and bring back the gun or the money—I believed all he said—he said he would go home, and that his father and uncle were waiting at Redford-place—I trusted him on his father's account, supposing the father could pay me—I did not sti<lb></lb>pulate that it should be returned in two hours—he proposed it himself—If he had said three or four hours, I should have been satisfied—the mo<lb></lb>ney for the pistols was to have been brought on Monday—If the things were not approved of, I expected they would be sent back—after the pro<lb></lb>perty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210131"></xptr>
               <p>was gone, I felt that it was not exactly correct—I went to Mr. Wal<lb></lb>ker, a Commissioner of the Osborne-street Court, to know if the prisoner's father held the situation he used to do—I knew his father before—I parted with it with a full belief that it was for his father, and on his credit—If the father had approved of it, I expected he would have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been a true transaction, and the father had kept it, and not paid for it for a week or so, should you have taken any steps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have called on the father, to know if he kept it—If the father had asked for three months' credit, I should have gladly given it him—I did not consider it sold till I was informed whether it was kept or not—I con<lb></lb>sidered the prisoner merely a porter, bringing a message from his father—I did not debit the father in my book, but made a memorandum of it, according to his wish—I should not have let the prisoner have it on his own account—I had not the least suspicion at the time, as the father bore the best of characters—I meant to part with the property at the entire option of the father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was said when you were making the memorandum about my having a commission, when I got a customer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever: I declare I did not say I would give him a commission to find a customer—I did not trust him with them to sell—he said he himself was an officer of the Court, that his father was Coming, into property in three days, and at the death of his uncle he was coming into a great deal of property, and if he was like some young men, he should be very proud indeed—this was after it was settled—when he went away, he said he was going to his father's house, where his uncle and father were waiting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pawnbroker, and live in the Minories. On the 19th of September, at half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner pawned this gun for thirty-five shillings.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 64.) I apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soner at Mr. Kilday's, a pawnbroker, in Hackney-road—these pistols were on the counter—he said they were his brother's, who had authorized him to pawn them—I found the duplicate of the gun on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I told Mr. Sturman I wanted the gun for a friend of mine. I did not say it was for my uncle; nor mention my father's name, being aware if I did, I should be furnished. I was promised 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission for selling the gun, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the pistols; but was not to charge my friend more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; because if he called at the shop afterwards, he might think it too much. There happened to be another case at Worship-street, which they could not make otherwise than a debt of; my opinion is, he finds there is no means of getting a verdict in his favour, nut by swearing falsely, and I assure you he has done so; when the bill was made out, he said, "What name shall I put it in?" I said "You know my name, and make it the same for the pistols;" here is the bill.</p>

On Tuesday, 2d December, I was in Turk's-row, at the corner of Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea, at a little before 12, at mid<lb></lb>night, with Harriet Miller—when we got to the corner of Turk's-row, I saw Hurley seize Harriet Miller by the throat—I had not known him before—Hurley is the one this side—he went behind her, and put his hands round her neck, and pressed her so that she could hardly call out—she called out, "Mary Ann," and I turned round and saw Hurley seize her by the throat—she said, "If you want to rob me, I have got nothing"—he said, "Oh! haven't you; we will see"—Lee and another one were then coming towards us, and I called out, "Police"—two policeman came up, and took. Lee and Hurley; the other one ran away—Lee was about three yards from Hurley when Hurley seized the prosecutrix—they were taken on the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday evening, 2d December, about 12 o'clock, I was with the last witness near Turk's-row—I saw both the prisoners—I had never seen them before, to my knowledge—I knew nothing about them—I was going to see my friend home, and when we arrived at the corner Hurley seized me by the throat—he came behind me, and took hold of me—I told him if he wanted to rob me, I had got nothing—he said, "Oh! haven't you; we will see"—he seized me with both hands, and it was at much as I could do to call for my friend—I was not much hurt—I called to my friend, and she turned round—Lee and the other one were then coming towards her—the other one had got his hand up to hit her, and she called out "Police"—two policemen ran across the road immediately, and caught the prisoners—Hurley was behind me at first, and then came in front of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley.</hi> I told her name at the police-station, before she told the police<lb></lb>man, and where she lived years ago. Did I put my hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You had not time; when you saw the policeman you ran away.</p>

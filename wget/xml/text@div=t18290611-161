Willetts and her husband came home - I heard them going up a airs; I went no further than the step of the door, and saw nobody but Jane Humphries, but am certain there were two persons, if not more.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, Little James-street, about one hundred and twenty yards from Willetts'; I keep a horse and cart. On the 8th of May, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, I was smoking my pipe over my half-hatch door - I have known Humphries from a child and his wife, and I knew Phillips - I saw Mr. and Mrs. Willetts and the three prisoners all go up the street towards the Sun public-house; I did not see them go in, and in the course of four or five minutes I saw Humphries and Phillips come running back again as hard as they could towards Willetts' house, which is in Lisson-place - they turned down Lisson-place; I continued at the door, and saw them come back a few minutes after, walking; Phillips walked first - they were about three feet from me; I heard Humphries say to Phillips "D - n your bl - y eyes, it won't do: old mother Broadfield is up;" Phillips answered, "Come on, you b - r, what are you afraid of;" they were then coming in a direction from the house - they went towards the public-house, and I saw no more of them; I am sure they are the persons, but I did not see the woman.</p>

James-street, and the female was standing at the door - I went round my beat at half-past eleven o'clock, and saw the two Humphries come running up James-street; I have known them these twelve months - they were going from Lissonplace; I was about eighty yards from them, and could not tell whether they had any thing with them - the man had his hat holding it over his arm.</p>

            . I am an officer of Maryle-bone. On the morning of the 9th of May, the female prisoner was brought into the yard, charged with robbing the prosecutor - the prosecutor named the two male prisoners to me, and in a short time they came to the gate; as soon as I laid my hands on Humphries, they said there was no occasion to do that, for as she was taken they had come to deliver themselves up - I then went for the prosecutor and his wife, and they identified them; I locked them up, and on Humphries I found a pen-knife - I went to his lodging in Charles-street, Lisson-grove, and in a box found some duplicates - Humphries admitted that they were his lodgings; I found this box, containing the certificate of their marriage, and several other duplicates not relating to this property.</p>

            ' Defence. Willetts asked me to go and drink - I went and stopped there from eight till half-past ten o'clock: a gipsy-man came in - Willetts did not approve of him, and asked us all to come out; we came out - he put his ear to the shutter to listen if they were talking about him; his wife asked mine to go with her to fetch some money to pay for beer - when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110069"></xptr>came back we all went up to the Sun; she asked my wife to have some gin, which she refused, and gave it to a girl - my wife and I had some words; Mrs. Willetts and her husband went down the street - I saw no more of them, and was not near their place.</p>
               <p>PHILLIPS' Defence. Humphries and his wife had a few words at the Sun - the watchman sent them away; I walked down James-street for a necessary purpose, came home and went to bed at three minutes past eleven o'clock - on Monday I heard I was charged with the robbery, and gave myself up.</p>

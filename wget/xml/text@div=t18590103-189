                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and live in John-street, Mile-end-road On Tuesday evening, 21st December, I was in Mile-end-road, about 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another person—they were in<lb></lb>toxicated—the prisoner's friend was very much intoxicated—when I came up first, he was standing, leaning against the fence—he had been on the ground—the prisoner asked me if I would assist him with his friend—I said "No," but I did do so—I walked on, holding the prisoners friend by the arm—the prisoner then, accused me of picking his friend's pocket, and made a blow at me—I jumped into the road to avoid it; the prisoner ran a little way after me, but turned back to his friend, who was lying on the ground—I followed him, and when I came back, I saw the deceased, Mr. Williams, standing near the prisoner's friend—the prisoner then asked Mr. Williams to assist him with his friend, and Mr. Williams would not—I don't know what he said—I believe there were two or three words passed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030050"></xptr>
               <p>between them—when Mr. Williams refused to assist the prisoner with his friend, the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams to go out in the road and fight—I can't say exactly what he said, but he asked him if he would fight, and the prisoner went out in the road—the prisoner came back, finding Mr. Williams would not follow him—Mr. Williams said he had better sense than to fight—that was the time the first scuffle took place—the prisoner struck Mr. Williams with his fist—he struck him three or four times about the head and shoulders, and they fell down together—Mr. Williams was the undermost—the prisoner then got up, and Mr. Williams did the same, and walked towards the road—the prisoner then pulled off two coats, and struck Mr. Williams again, and they fell down from the kerb into the road—the prisoner then struck Mr. Williams three or four times about the head and shoulders, and they fell down—I believe they did not close, but Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liams fell on the stones, and the prisoner fell by the side of him—Mr. Williams did not get up—he was lifted up, and the men who lifted him up took him on the other side of the road—the prisoner pursued him, and was in the act of striking him again—Mr. Harris struck him with some stones in the road—the prisoner put his hands to the back of his head, and returned to his friend, who was drunk—assistance was procured; he was taken and set on the step of a door—from my observation of the deceased, he was perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Harris walking with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was the first who was asked to assist the prisoner's friend—there was not a crowd looking on at the time I came up—there was no one—they were not noticing that there was a drunken man falling on the ground—there was nobody there when I went up but me and Harris—I did endea<lb></lb>vour to assist the friend—I went about ten yards, more or less, before I was accused of attempting to pick his pocket—on the prisoner charging me with that, and making a blow at me, I ran into the road—I ran about twenty yards, or it might have been a little more, when I turned round, and saw that the prisoner had got back to his friend, and Harris was still standing by the friend—when I got close to them, I found several persons had then collected round them, and, amongst others, Mr. Williams—Harris stood nearer to them than I did, and he could see all that occurred—I did not hear the first words that occurred between Mr. Williams and the prisoner—the first words I heard were, the prisoner said, "Will you help me to take my friend"—Mr. Williams said he would not—it was after that that some words passed between them, which I did not hear—I am not aware that they were spoken in an angry tone—I cannot say that I heard Mr. Williams raising his voice, as if speaking angrily—after hearing a word or two, the next thing was a challenge from the prisoner to fight Mr. Williams—at that time Mr. Williams was on the pavement—the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams, and then he walked out in the road—before the challenge they were both on the pavement, and the friend was lying between the pavement and the chapel—I should say the friend was three or four feet from the prisoner when I heard those words pass—at that time there might have been as many as twenty people present—I cannot say that I heard the people who were there laughing and crying out—there were some laughing and some crying—they were not chaffing the drunken men—there was not so much of that as there might have been—some of them were chaffing and some hooting the prisoner—there were some persons sneering—there were some talking—some persons talk louder than others—when I heard the challenge to fight, the prisoner and Mr. Williams were</p>

               <p>not far off from one another—the prisoner was on the pavement when he struck the first blow—I did not notice whether Mr. Williams had an umbrella with him—I did not notice whether Mr. Williams was upwards of six feet high—he was a powerful-built man—I do not know how high he was; he was a big man, that is all I know—when Mr. Williams was struck once, twice, or thrice, he did nothing to protect himself—if he had an umbrella, I did not see it—the prisoner struck him three or four blows, and then there was a fell—there was a scuffle immediately, and both fell on the pavement—I mean to say there was more than one fall—the leg was not broken by the fall on the pavement—I should think if the leg were broken by the fall on the pavement, Mr. Williams could not have got up and walked into the road—I did not know his leg was broken till he was over on the other side of the road, and I saw the blood—they fell once, and the prisoner proceeded to take off his coats, and struck again—he took off two coats after there had been one fall—the second striking was when they were between the pavement and the road—Harris was nearer than I was, and there were several persons between us, but I could see whether a man was on the ground or on the pavement—after the first fell Mr. Williams got up and was walking towards the kerb—he had not got off the kerb, and the prisoner struck him again—it was when Mr. Williams was being taken across the road that Harris took up stones and struck the prisoner at the back of the head—at that time Mr. Williams was not lying down; he was being taken across the road—he was not actually lying down—that I am certain of—I don't know whether Harris striking the prisoner with stones appeared to hurt him—he put both his hands to the back of his head and came back—they were not large stones, not granite: they were gravel—the prisoner, in consequence of that, returned to his friend.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Regent-street, Mile-end—I was on that night with my friend Mr. Carter, going along the Mile-end-road—I observed the prisoner and some person with him—the prisoner was slightly intoxicated, and the other person very much so, and lying on the ground—the prisoner requested Mr. Carter to assist him with his friend a little way down the Mile-end-road, and Mr. Carter did so; and while he did so the prisoner accused Mr. Carter of picking his friend's pocket—with that Mr. Carter refused to have anything more to do with him—just about that time I saw Mr. Williams, the deceased; he was on the pavement, and when he came up close to them, the prisoner asked Mr. Williams if ho would assist him—Mr. Williams refused to do so, and they had a few words together which I can't recollect—I have been trying to recollect them since the last examination, but I cannot—the prisoner spoke and Mr. Williams—finding that Mr. Williams would not assist him with his friend, the prisoner challenged Mr. Williams to fight—he refused, and told him he had got too much good sense to fight—on that they had a few words, which I can't recollect, and the prisoner struck Mr. Williams with his clenched fist about the head and body—they had a scuffle together, and both fell—I did not see Mr. Williams strike, or attempt to strike any blow at the prisoner—he did not make use of any offensive language</p>

               <p>or behave in any offensive way towards the prisoner: quite the reverse—when they fell, Mr. Williams was undermost—they fell down off the kerb to the road—I believe Mr. Williams was assisted across the road—I cannot call it two scuffles—the policeman was called, and the prisoner was given into custody—after the time when Mr. Williams and the prisoner fell together, the prisoner went back a yard or two, and while the prisoner was going to make another attack, I took up a few stones and struck him on the back of the head, which I believe prevented his doing so—assistance was procured, and Mr. Williams was conveyed across.</p>

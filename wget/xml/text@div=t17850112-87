               <p>I am here for piracy, I have not been tried; the 7th of September at night, one of Mr. Akerman's servants came to lock us up, and this blind Dick was making a noise, I told him, says I, Dick you are always making a disturbance in the sick ward; I am in the sick ward; with that he says to me, what business have you with it; and he shoved me on a bench, Stockton sat by me, and Dick pulled Stockton from me, and when I turned round, I heard that Stockton was cut, I did not see him do it; I heard the people that were in the ward say he was cut, and I went up and saw he was cut.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body have a knife in their hands? - I did not see the knife in his hand, nor the person that cut him.</p>
               <p>Do you know, of your own knowledge, who cut him? - I cannot say that it was the prisoner that cut him, I saw no knife in his hand afterwards.</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing? - I did not hear him say that he had a hand in it; he said that he was sorry for what he had done; the knife was found under the bed; when I knocked him down, I did not see him throw it away.</p>
               <p>Was he told what he had done, did any body tell him? - Yes, they told him he had cut Stockton, and he said he was very sorry that he had cut him.</p>

               <p>When I went up into the ward after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120102"></xptr> looking about I saw blind Dick standing up, and the man sitting down, and I thought he would have died every minute, I said, villain, what have you done, do you know you have murdered a man? says he, I am very sorry I have cut him, he was the best friend I ever had in my life, he owned the knife afterwards, he owned he had cut him.</p>

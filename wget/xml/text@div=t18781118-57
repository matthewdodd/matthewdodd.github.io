On 6th November, about 1 in the morning, I saw a fire On Purbright Common—I ran to the spot, and saw three men run away—the prisoners are two of them—the fire was burning when I got up to it—I took Saunders into custody that evening, and charged him with setting fire to the common—he said he did not do it—he afterwards said if he had not seen me he would have had another fire—I then showed the spot where the fire was to Mr. Hacker, a clerk in the war department—I had some difficulty in putting the fire out—it took me a quarter of an hour—I don't call that hard work, but it was rather warm work.</p>

It was a frosty night, not very damp, it was damp—I was speaking to a man named Boylet when I first saw the fire; I was then some distance away from it, I should say 200 yards—it was not a quarter of a mile, not in the direction that I took to the fire—Boylet did not go with me to the fire—Stevens was taken into custody after Saunders had been before the Magistrate on Saturday the 9th—I didn't know then that Stevens was working for Mr. Elsey—I know it now—I have known him ever since I have been at Purbright—he lives on West Heath Common—I have spoken to him several times—there was a party of six who went along the road, the prisoners were three of them, but they went on before—there were some fireworks that evening at a place called Skeate's Farm—the farmer had fireworks that night-that is about a mile away from where this fire was—I was about 10 or 12 yards from the man who ran away—I crossed a field opposite the furze—there are trees round the field—I saw the witness Baker on the afternoon of the 6th—he was a witness before the Magistrate on the first hearing.</p>

               <p>fireworks let off on the Common, there were some that night but not near this spot—there were some let off on the green about a quarter of a mile away, about half-past 10 o'clock, but no more after that—there were no rockets, only a few squlbs, crackers, and Roman candles—I put out the fire—I trod it out, it was about two rods in extent, it was not two rode when I got there, it was spreading, some part of it had burnt out, it was not very dry—the men who ran away crossed me and ran by in front of me, I did not run after them—I stopped to put the fire out—I did not see which way they had gone—Baker and Saunders came back again about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and two others with them—I did not take Saunders then because I had not sufficient proof which it was set fire to the common—I had sufficient proof in the evening—I had seen Baker then—I recognised Baker and Saunders when they came back, as two of the men that ran away—I said to Saunders that I should accuse him of setting fire to the common, and he said he did not—I did not say anything to Baker about it—he did not stop to speak to me—Saunders did stop—in putting out the fire I did not get any damage—I did not burn my trousers—I had leggings on.</p>

The fireworks I hare alluded to were on Purbright Green, about a quarter of a mile from the place where I saw this burn<lb></lb>ing; they were let off at half-past 10—I dirt not see any let off at 1 in the morning, most people were in bed then—I had a view of the prisoners' faces as they ran past me—the moon was shining brightly—I had known both of them before, and I recognised them when they passed me—when the two came back three quarters of an hour afterwards, I was hiding in a bush, they did not see me before they came up to me, they were going towards where the fire had been.</p>

On 9th Novem<lb></lb>ber I apprehended Stevens—I charged him with maliciously and wilfully setting fire to furze and heath growing on the common at Purbright, the property of the Government, and I told him he would have to go with me to Guildford—I took him to Guildford, and at the police-station there Saunders was brought into his presence and stood beside him in the office—the charge was read to both of them by the Superintendent Deputy Chief Constable—Saunders then said Baker was as bad as us, and then turning to Stevens, he said Baker tried to light some furze—he stooped down and struck a match, but it would not burn—Stevens went on the right side of the road and set fire to the furze, which did bun and burnt about a rod—Stevens replied, "I did not"—Saunders again said, "I know very well that you did, and I did not burn any "—he also said "When the fire had been lighted the two ran away, "referring to Baker and Stevens, "and I followed them."</p>

I am a groom in the service of Major Armstrong, at Purbright—on the morning of 6th November, about 1 o'clock, I was in company with the two prisoners—we had been together from about 10—we went to see some fireworks at Nap Hill; we started from Purbright village about half-past 10—the fireworks were over about half-past 12; they were let off about a mile from the common—after they were over I</p>

               <p>went along with them, I was along with Saunders—when we got on the common, Saunders went behind the furze, struck a match on his trousers and lit the furze on one side of the road, and Stevens did the same on the other side of the road—there is a road or path that goes between the furze; the two were about four yards apart; there was a fire in each place, the furze was lighted in each place—I saw the constable Tapner come up—he came up to Saunders and called to him about the fire, and I believe Saunders said that he did not do it—I did nothing, we just passed by, and stood about a couple of yards off from the constable and Saunders; all three of us—we stood there about 10 minutes and then went on—I was spoken to by the police that afternoon, and I then made a statement.</p>

I was not out all that night; I have leave to go out every night; there were other people out as well as me to see the fireworks—Saunders first pulled a match out of his pocket and struck a light and lit the furze, and Stevens on the other aide did the same—Stevens ran off first; I did not try to prevent him, I went off along with them—it was not all done in a second, I suppose in about five minutes—I sometimes smoke, I did not have any matches or fusees that night; the prisoners are smokers, they had matches; it was not a damp night, it was dry and frosty—I had no fireworks in my pocket—I did not let off any fireworks at Mr. Skeat's, I merely looked at them—I did nothing to run away for—they said "Come on, Tom, "and of course I went; I did not run, I went slowly; Stevens went first, Saunders second, and I came behind—the policeman did not make any attempt to catch me—he came up to the fire and put it out</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a clothes-shop in Lower-marsb, Lambeth. I employed the prisoner as a cutter—on the 4th of February I marked eight half-crowns and placed them in the till at six o'clock in the evening—I left, and went to my other shop at No. 60—I came back about ten o'clock, and found one half-crown missing from the till—I went for a constable—I took him round to a tailor's, where the prisoner had gone, in Harriett-street, and found him, and had him searched—I found a shilling on him and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, but no half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor. I saw the half-crowns after they were marked, and saw them put into the till—I remained in the shop till half-past nine o'clock, when 1 left for a few minutes—I counted the money at that time—there were eight half-crowns all marked—I then left for about five minutes, and when I came back, one was missing—I went to the house in Harriett-street, and then the prisoner was searched, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him—I had followed him from master's, and he went nowhere else.</p>

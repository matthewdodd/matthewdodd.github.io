            . I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 28th of June I saw the three prisoners coming down Tottenham-court-road; while I had my eye on them, I saw a little girl with a basket of linen on her head coming towards St. Giles's - they looked at her, and followed her, and I followed them - she walked on to the chapel, and put her basket down to rest - I saw Chapman go up and begin to talk to her - the other two were standing about ten yards off, one on one side, and the other on the other - I had before that met a person I knew, and took him with me - we watched them - Chapman talked with the little girl for five or six minutes - Taylor then went to Chapman, and put his hand to his hat, as if he knew him - in about two minutes Taylor took the basket from the ground, and they all walked together with the little girl down Tottenham-court-road - I followed them; and when I got to the corner of Goodge-street I met with two other persons I knew, and we all followed them to <placeName id="t18340703-68-crimeloc367">Sutton-street</placeName>

            . I am nearly ten years of age - I know the nature of an oath - my father lives in College-street, Camden-town - my mother was ill, and I was sent with the basket containing the articles stated to St. Martin's-lane - I set down the basket, and Chapman, who appeared quite a gentleman by his dress, came up and said, "Is not that basket too heavy for you?" - I said, "No, Sir" - he said, "O yes it is; stop a minute, and I will give a man two-pence to carry it for you" - Taylor, who was dressed shabby, then came up and took the basket, and we all walked on till we came to the public-house, when Chapman (the gentleman) said, "Come, my lad, I will give you a pint of beer now;" and he sent Williams in for a pint - we drank it, and they sent me for a half-pennyworth of biscuits - I was afraid to go, and stood peeping round the corner - I saw them start with the basket - I went after them, and cried, and the officer came to me - he took me to the office, where the basket and linen were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather! merchant at Overstone Road, Northampton—I first became acquainted with Summers about November, 1878—I know nothing of the other prisoners—Summers was introduced to me through one of my travellers, and on his representations I made a small sale to Summers of goods to the amount of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent them to the address given me, 10, Worship Street, London—in the beginning of December I saw Summers at 10, Worship Street, on the second floor, respecting the account that he owed me for the goods that I had sent him—I think his name was there; there was no stock there—not many pounds' worth—he represented that he was going to do a large trade, and wished to make arrangements for me to supply him with more goods—I arranged to take part leather and part cash in settlement of my account—I sent him goods for that, and on or about 24th December I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">This and the subsequent letters were proved by Andrew James Irving to be in Summers's handwriting</hi>)—previous to that letter I had received a consignment of leather by the North-Western Railway, and this invoice gives the details of it—on the 14th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Summers had removed to 24, Castle Street, Finsbury</hi>)—the value of the parcel I dispatched was 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another parcel to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 16th January another parcel, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him per<lb></lb>mission to draw on me for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill I accepted and subsequently met; that balanced the account between us.</p>

I live at 33, Myrtle Street, Hoxton—I have known Mannion six or seven years—I knew him when he was trading under the name of Stokes and Co., in Sun Street, Finsbury—I was a warehouseman and salesman in the hop trade in 1876—I went into Mannion's service as ware-houseman and salesman—I received weekly wages—I was there when the failure took place; Stokes and Co. became bankrupt—I knew that Man<lb></lb>nion was bankruptr—I recollect after that the Leather and Shoe Co. being commenced about 4th January, 1877—the warehouse was in Sun Street, and the offices in Finsbury Place—they took the premises of Stokes and Co., and I occupied the same position as I had hitherto, warehouseman and salesman—I did not act and write letters as the secretary—I acted as manager for about fortnight—I believe Mannion was manager when it commenced—I never knew what Lordan was; he was there on and off—they held their meetings at the offices, which I knew nothing about; I was never there—I had my salary, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and then 21. at the latter part of the time the company did business—they got goods from various places; I was not the buyer—Watson merely called in there casually—I believe the company lasted'a bout 12 or 15 months; it was registered in January, 1877—it afterwards became a limited company—we had transactions with John Pantony, of Liverpool—I received this telegram from him—I recollect Lordan and Co. starting at 10, Worship Street, in September, 1877—I remained in Sun Street for about two months in the Leather and Shoe Co.; after that I went to Hoxton Street, and started a small business as a leather-cutter—I had no capital—it was agreed between Mannion and I that I should take that shop; he was to supply me with the leather—Lordan and Co. had started then—I did not know the position of Mannion at Lordan's; I did not inquire—they did supply me with leather from 10, Worship Street, to the extent of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I have paid them money on account—I can't say how much, perhaps 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with bills and that—I had grindery goods from other places, but no leather—I accepted bills for them; I can't tell you the amounts—I did not pay any of them with my own money; I met some of them, and a good many I did not—directly Lordan and Co. failed, I failed; I owed about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with these bills—I only had what I stood upright in—some of the bills were brought blank; I do not know what I accepted; I accepted them as they came from Worship Street—I recollect going heme one day, and finding some boots there—at that time I did not know that Lordan and Co. had failed—I had not ordered them; I asked my wife, and she said they came from Worship Street; they remained there two or three days; Butler fetched them; I saw Mannion the day before, and he said they would be fetched to-morrow morning—I think Watson called twice in</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I had known Mannion some years—I was in his service when he was carrying on business in the name of Stokes and Co.; that was a leather warehouse—from all I saw, it Was a bond fide business—I never saw anything that was not bond fide—gooda were bought and sold in the usual way—there was nothing suggestive of fraud—just before the business failed Mannion sprained his ankle or knee, and he was away for a week or a fortnight; and then he used to come in a cab, and go away again directly—for a considerable period he was practically unable to attend to the business—there was not much business doing there in conse<lb></lb>quence of there being no one there—the result was that the business fell away; it never recovered from Mannion's absence, and he was obliged to file his petition—previous to that, Stokes and Co. met all their liabilities to the best of my knowledge—the Leather and Shoe Co. was started after that; it did a comfortable trade; it was a bond fide business; it after<lb></lb>wards became a limited company, and Mannion continued as manager up to a short time before it closed—a. great many of the creditors of Stokes and Co. were also creditors of the Leather and Shoe Co., and they con<lb></lb>tinued to supply goods—when I started in business for myself I asked Mannion whether he would assist me by letting me have goods—I hoped to he able to make the business pay—I did tolerably well at first, but I was never able to get over the fact of starting without capital—I was origin<lb></lb>ally supplied with stock by Lordan and Co.—I did not pay for those goods when I first had them—I subsequently agreed to accept bills on account of those goods, and some for the accommodation of Lordan and Co.; I can't say to what amount—some were taken up by Lordan and Co.—at the time of their failure there were acceptances of mine out—there were two bills due—I don't know the amounts—about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due from me to Lordan and Co. at the time of their failure—I could not say whether or no the bills were in respect of goods I had from Lordan and Co.—I was never told what they were for—I accepted hills previous to that, they were not all taken up—I know Hammersley and Splenthall—I have had an intima<lb></lb>tion that they were connected with the business of Lordan and Co.—I heard it just after the failure, not before—I know them personally.</p>

I still say that as far as the business was concerned, and I was connected with it, it was bond fide—I do not know whether five bills had been dishonoured—I was not manager at that time, I was only temporary manager for a fortnight—a business was certainly carried on—Mannion used to buy goods as manager from Pantony and other places—I only had the sale; I did not have the buying—I had invoices—I hate not them with me; I know some came from Finsbury, and some from Bermondsey—I did not keep any books; they were kept in the desk—I merely entered in the rough book.</p>

                  </hi>. About December, 1877, I entered into the service of Lordan and Co. on the introduction of Mannion; I had known him very slightly for some years—I had not known Lordan, Watson, or Summers until I entered the service—I was engaged as clerk—I found a set of books, but they had not been opened; I did the beet I could, not particularly to open the books; they had got in arrear—I saw the delivery order book and the initials "J. D. and S."In one part of it—I asked Mannion what they meant, and he said I most not bother about it, that they were some things that had been sent to John Davis and Sons for auction sale—I subsequently knew them to be auctioneers—there was no account in the ledger at that time opened to John Davis and Sons—I don't think I opened one—they kept a bill book in which bills taken from customers were entered at one end, and hills payable at the other end—the business of Lordan and Co. was carried en in the basement—I believe Ay res was on the top floor; I did not know him then personally—Summers was not there when I first went—no agreement was made with me as to salary; it appeared to me to be temporary work at first; I was paid a regular weekly salary, about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week at first, and subsequently 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mannion took a part in the business; he had a great deal to do with the financing, the cash part of it, attending to the bills, and looking of cus<lb></lb>tomers—Watson was salesman—I have seen a Mrs. Ellis in the place; I can hardly speak from memory as to when she first became a customer; the only entry in the ledger is March, 1878, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had the most to do with taking up dishonoured bills; I took up a great number; the book will show them; the margin of the cheques will show where I get the money to pay the bills—the "cash received" book will show what goods were sent to auction sales; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the first I look at is 13th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Summers—I presume that refers to goods sent to Davis in Summers's name—whose goods they were I cannot tell—the receipt of the money is entered in this book—on 21st February, 1878, there is an entry of "Davis and Co, per Summers, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and on March 1st "T. Summers, cash, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I made all these entries from verbal information given me at the time by some of the partners; I saw no documents—there is an account entered to Ayres from October, 1877—the sum total appears to be 1,646<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount paid by him in cash and bills is totalled of as 536<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether the bills were paid, without referring to the bill book—from October, 1878, 4th 4th December the amount of goods he received was about 583<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that includes an account rendered of 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is entered in pencil—I can't tell whether that wen part of the 536<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are "returns in goods;"I suppose that would be manufactured goods; in cash, bills, and goods it is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no entry in this book of a sale of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of goods after the petition in December—I was there up to the day of the filing of the petition—I do not recollect any goods being sent up to Ayres the day before the petition; I was then leaving the employ, and lor about six weeks before I was engaged out of doors collecting bills and looking up customers whose bills had been returned—I was very little in the place, and I was frequently buck when the place was dosed—I cannot tell yen how many executions had been put in during the three months previous to 18th December, perhaps half a dozen, all of them had</p>

               <p>been more or less partly paid out—I knew of people calling to serve writs—it was some months after I entered the service before there was any execution put in, I would not pledge myself to say exactly—as far as I know, there is no entry in the books of any loan by Watson to the firm; it is possible he did from his own cash, but he kept his own private cash book—an accountant was called in in July, and he made up the cash account—the margins of the cheques will show what each person drew; they drew as they pleased—when I first knew Lordan I believe he was living with his brother in-law, Mannion—iu the early part of 1878 he was living at Payne's Hotel, Brighton—I had a great many letters and tele<lb></lb>grams from him from there; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them. (<hi rend="italic">These contained repeated applications to the witness to send him money, and com<lb></lb>plaints of delay.</hi>) His drawings from 1877 amounted to perhaps 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he occasionally came to 10, Worship Street—the books were always there; he had them to look at—he used to make inquiries about the business; I told him the books would show what we were doing—a few days before 10th December I sent some skins to the cloak-room of the London Bridge Station in my own name—I sent them from a letter I had from Lordan asking me to do so, to borrow some money, or rather to sell some goods if I could—this is the letter—I believe I told him what to say; he wanted some money, and so did I; there was great difficulty in getting it—I think that letter was written about the early part of December—I did not send the goods, they were sent by my direction; I asked Watson if he could get a cash customer for them, and he promised to do so—I saw no more of them—I think he gave me a sovereign, I was very short of money—all our moneys had been taken away by Mr. Holland, the gentleman who had been carrying on business for Mr. Hammersley; all the bills and money that had been collected—in September, 1878, Watson said "There are some goods we are sending to Davis, and I am going to send them in your name;"I said "Why?" He said "We have sent there before, and we want another name;"I said "I know nothing about it;"I had no idea there was anything wrong in doing so; he sent them, I did not—I received the money and put it into the cash received book—I presume I paid it into the bank; I accounted for it, it was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—the prices were put on them by Watson; they came to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., they realised 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter from Summers in August, 1878—he was then on the second floor, as I thought as a servant of Lordan's—when Lordan was going away he used to leave blank cheques—I received this letter of 2nd October, 1879, from Mannion the day before I went to sign my deposition, after I had been examined—I handed it to the solicitor for the prosecution—it is not signed, but I took it to be Mannion's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained suggestions as to the questions that might be addressed to the witness on his cross-examination on the trial.</hi>)</p>

I was engaged by Mannion—I think Lordan was there within a day or two, he was in town at that time—I arranged as to salary with Mannion, I always looked upon him as the principal manager—Lordan did very little with regard to the business, he did not seem to know anything about it—he never seemed to enter into it as a man of business would—he did not appear to know how to raise money on the goods, and I told him what I considered was the best way—he was very frequently at Brighton, he stayed there for a month</p>

I do not know that Mannion's wife's private income has been stopped during these proceedings—when I first went into the business I thought it was a prosperous one—I thought it was a very good thing for me to go there; that it was a good bond fide trade—I thought it was merely when they were short that goods were sent to auction, when customers' bills came back and they had to meet them—I think I knew Hammersley within a few weeks of the first—I believe he and Mannion had done business together in some company—I think he was a director of one of the companies, and goods were supplied by Lordan and Co. to the company—I remember witnessing documents, at one time, some agreement with Hammersley and Splenthall—I can't tell when that was—it would be at the first part when Some money was put in—it was long before Mr. Holland was sent to manage the business; that was about October, 878, about two months before the stoppage—I considered it was Hammersley and Splenthall's business from the date of my leaving—I cannot say that they took over the business in October, but they sent Holland to take control of matters—I suppose they were not satisfied with the way things were going on. and they would have financial control, in conjunction with Watson—Hammersley opened a banking account at the Capital and Counties Bank, Paddington branoh, and gave Holland permission to sign for him—Manuion still came there; he told me he was very likely to leave as well as me—I can't tell whether he considered himself a servant; he never was in the position that I was—I can't say that from the time Holland came Mannion practically ceased to be manager, because he was there, and I still looked upon him as the same—I believe Mr. Barrow was one of the largest creditors of Lordan and Co. at the time of the bankruptcy—I have seen, him frequently at 10, Worship Street—I have seen him and Mannion at the desk together, with the books before them, talking over matters—I did not leave previous to the filing of the petition—I was with the trustee for a time to assist, but I was out so much—I have no doubt that I witnessed certain documents between Hammersley and Splenthall—I can't say</p>

Lordan and Co.—I had previously been appointed receiver and manager of the estate—on 11th December, 1878, I took possession of the books, papers, and cheques—I am not quite sure who I found on the premises, I don't think Maunion was; he did call—Watson was on the premises in charge of the stock; Irving and Darkey, not Summers—I don't remember seeing Lordan there; I saw him at my office for the purpose of getting out a statement of the affairs of J. Lordan and Co.—on the first occasion I saw him with Mannion respecting the accounts when they were nearly completed—I had a general conversation with them in order to draw out a general statement of the affairs—they and their clerk Irving gave me information, and ultimately on the information they had given me a statement of affairs was got ready for their signature—this is a true copy—the reversionary interest of Lordan is set out at 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it states "The debtor is entitled to one moiety of the estate under the will of his father, of which he has received 4,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the residue estimated to produce 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that includes the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that sheet is signed by Lordan, it is treated as an asset—I got the information in the first instance from Lordan, after that from Mannion, and subsequently from Grueber, the solicitor to the</p>

               <p>proceedings—he agreed to the wording of the statement—I was not told by Mannion, Lordan, or Grueber that there was any charge on it—I treated it as an unencumbered asset—I have examined all the bills referred to by Mr. Hamilton, and find they are entered in the bill-book of Lordan and Co.; they are copied into another list which Mr. Hamilton has detailed—I practically found the stock that they have set out; it is estimated to realise 943<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have actually realised 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that includes dividends from eight insolvent estates—there are 59 debtors put down—I have traced that 21 out of those have failed, 11 gone away, and 16 dispute the debts entirely; they either deny their indebtedness altogether or dispute the amount; most of them entirely dispute the debt—I have done my best to collect the debts that appear here, and the result is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have had considerable experience in the leather trade as an accountant—I know the names of nearly all the debtors who appear here—I have been an accountant upwards of 10 years—a large number, I should say about half, of these debtors failed to meet their engagements before 1878, before these debts accrued—I found Summers on the first floor latterly—I did not find any books of the Leather and Shoe Company, they were given up to me by Summers after some difficulty—I did not get the minute book of the Leather and Shoe Company from Summers's premises; the first floor was subdivided, this was found on Lordan's premises on the first floor, in the room known as Mannion's room—this affidavit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed by Watson (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), it relates to a claim made by him on behalf of Mrs. Ellis to the amount of 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon goods which I took possession of at 10, Worship Street—Mrs. Ellis did not file any affidavit in support of her claim—she was subpœnaed on several occasions to appear by order of the Registrar; she did not appear; I never saw her there, and the matter was dismissed; I am not sure as to the costs—after thai I saw Summers and Watson at 24, Castle Street, Finsbury, and had conversation with them as to the assets belonging to the estate—up to the time they were examined in the Bankruptcy Court they had not told me of any removals from Worship Street to Claro Terrace, or any other place; or to Ayres on 9th December, or about the removal by Mannion to Hodd's—I did find, among the papers some account of Patten's, the carman, but no account of any removals after 2nd October—I was present at the Bankruptcy Court when Watson was examined, and produced what purported to be an account of Patten's with reference to these removals—none of them accounted for the money they had received from Collins, of Northampton—it is not in the books—I have taken out from the invoices the purchases made by Lordan and Co. within four months of 25th January, the total amount is 4,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. between.25th September and 10th December.</p>

Barrow and Mr. Grimsdale—I do not see Mr. Barrow here, but he was here yesterday—he supplied 2,690<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth out of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Grimsdale 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Barrow 212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Warre and Son of Bristol 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have had numerous conferences with Mr. Barrow—he was one of the original committee of inspection, but it was the trustee's duty to investi<lb></lb>gate—I do not know that the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were supplied by Mr. Barrow not to the order of these persons, but by Splenthall and Hammers<lb></lb>ley—I have heard exactly the opposite from Mr. Barrow—all the defendants had to do with the business up to the filing of the petition—Mr. Hammers<lb></lb>ley's name was up on the second floor, and as far as I know had nothing to do with Lordan's business—the earliest debt which I have in connection with this establishment was about May—all goods supplied previously have not been paid for—they owe Mr. Barrow for goods supplied in May and August—a bill was given but it was never paid—the debt was commenced about May, amounting to about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—unless the goods had been paid for in May they would not have been able to get further credit—the other 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not all incurred between May and October, because some of that is technical liabilities and accommodation bills—about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing for goods purchased—I should say that all goods up to May had been paid for—the sales of Lordan and Co. from their commencement to their failure amount to about 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to the sales by auction, 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the bulk of which were by Davis and Son—I have not referred to the delivery order book to see what amount of sales are entered to Davis and Son, but I looked at it before the Magistrate, and can say that there are none after January, 1878—I pointed this out to. my clerk yesterday—I prepared the statement of affairs with my clerk's assistance—Mannion's examination took place in February—this reversion was entered in the statement of affairs as an unencumbered asset—the wording was I believe settled by Mr. Mannion and Mr. Grueber, the debtor having given the the intimation that there was that 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will not pledge myself, as we had several inter<lb></lb>views, and I was engaged on other important matters—it was read over in Mr. Grueber's presence after it was completed—I said before the Magistrate "In the presence of Mr. Grueber we agreed the wording with him," and that is what I say now—I will not pledge my oath that Mannion; was present at the time the wording was agreed—supposing Hammersley and Splenthall's bill had been met, the firm, though not absolutely solvent, would have been a going concern; they would have been able to carry on business for some time longer—Hammersley and Splenthall were not examined with the defendants at the Bankruptcy Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. The books do not disclose that Hammersley and Splenthall were taking part in the transactions previous to December; I know that they were to put some money into the business—there is no deed of partnership, if the word "partnership "Is put in, that is a mistake; but I believe the solicitor referred to it as a partnership deed as you have now—a man named Musgmve was not hi the business on behalf of Hammersley and Splenthall, he was a nominee of theirs, and was attempting to inspect a set of books—they had a clerk named Holland—I did not know that they were buying goods and having them consigned to them in their name—from inquiries I have made as trustee I believe it is utterly untrue—their name was on some of the bills in Lordan and Co's bank<lb></lb>ruptcy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240030"></xptr>
               <p>—I do not know that goods sent by Barrow shortly More the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy were consigned and were upon the orders of Hammersley and Co.; I have made special inquiries, and Mr. Barrow will support me if he is put in the box—the butts said to have been removed on 15th December were not consigned by Barrow, they were sent by him—when I took possession they were not entered in the books, but these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are Barrow's original invoices—the earliest items are Lordan and Co., Hammersley and Splenthall's name only comes in on the later transactions—the butts which were removed were a portion of these goods—they were not consigned, they were sold out and out to Lordan—I had nothing to do with purchasing those goods, I only know it from my inquiries as trustee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Watson.</hi> I recollect you calling on me in January, relating to a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—you brought a consignment sheet, which you said belonged to Hammersley and Splenthall, and was put under your care—I had stock taken at 10, Worship Street a few days after I took possession—you assisted my clerk to take stock, and this is the stock-book you went through with him—there is no note of any of them being consignments at that date—the whole of the stock was taken as it stood, and you pointed out certain goods which you said were Mrs. Ellis's—I had a claim sent in from Hainmersley—the notice not to sell his stock is on the file—I do not believe any goods were purchased by Mrs. Ellis; there is only a memo<lb></lb>randum of yours in the books—I sent an order that you were not to com<lb></lb>plete any orders, and I took possession of the premises, and left my representative there—on 10th December you wanted to send a parcel of goods to Mrs. Ellis, and I refused to let them go—she owes me 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she cannot be made bankrupt, because her husband is in America—I made an affidavit that I believed this was done to cheat and defraud the creditors—you have threatened to follow me till the day of my death—the stock taken by Musgrave on the premises on August 31st, 1878, was 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk has checked the goods sold by you up to December 6th, and the result is that in leather alone there appears to be a deficiency of 60 cwt.—I have gone through the books of the sale of all the butts from September 1st to December 6th; the weight is 259 cwt. 3 qrs. 27lb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I have taken all the purchases and the stock on 31st August, and the stock I found on the premises, and I find a deficiency of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all from the books of Lordan and Co., and there is a further deficiency in the kid skins—the weight of stock on 31st August was 234 cwt 1/2 lb.; the purchases since are 566 cwt. 11 1/2 lb.; total, 800 cwt. 121b.—the sales are 631 cwt 1 qr. 21 1/2 lb., leaving a balance of 189 cwt, 23 1/2 lb.; the deficiency on some articles is 104 cwt 15 1/2 lb., but from the difficulty of describing some items there is an apparent excess of 43 cwt 26 lb.—those which Mrs. Ellis claimed are included.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. I said before the Magistrate "I have not been able to learn the true position of the sales between Lordan and Co. and Hammersley and Splenthall because Lor dan's books were kept so badly"—there are a large number of cash transactions which it is impossible to understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Musgrave has claimed about 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the estate for his services—when I took possession of the premises both Hammersley and Splenthall were there; nothing was said about their being the proprietors of the business—I attended both meetings, claims were made by the receivers of both estates, who I fought successfully; one of them withdrew.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi>). I took charge of these transactions from the commencement before any of the persons were arrested—I had had the premises of 44, Snn Street, under my inspection—I arrested Mannion and Lordan on Sunday night, 17th August, up a small turning in Featherstone Road—they were in company—I had been watching them for some time, but had not seen them together before—Inspector Hoots was with me—it was dark—I said that we were about to arrest them in connection with Lordan's bankruptcy—Lordan made no reply, Mannion said "All right, this matter has been on the tapis three months; it has been to the Treasury and they have thrown it out, and now it is taken up out of spite"—I took them to Mann ion's house, where I read the warrant to Mannion, and asked if he had any papers connected with the matter—he at first said "No"—I found a bag and asked him what it was—he said "There are some papers there, but they relate to Sun Street"—I have gone through them with the solicitor's clerk and sorted them—I went on to Watson's house, 146, Church Street, Islington, and saw him at the area steps—I said we were police officers and were going to arrest him in connection with the bankruptcy of Lordan—we went into the house and I read the warrant—he said "Well, I am not at all surprised; I am glad it has come to a point, as the matter can now be settled; I have lost a great deal of business during the three last months that this matter has been noised about; the business was a curious one, but I was only a servant, and as far as I am concerned it is quite straight"—I took them to the station, where Watson handed me some papers, which I brought away; among them was this document relating to 10 butts delivered to Hodd (Handing in several documents awl dishonoured bills for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I went to Sheer<lb></lb>ness next day and took Summers about 10 p.m—I told him the charge; he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I live in Acre-lane, Brixton. On Friday, the 2nd of December, I was walking with my daughter, between five and six o'clock in the evening, coming home from London; and as we were passing a field very near our house, a man came behind my daughter, and took hold of both her hands—I gave the man a push, and told him to go along—I had no idea of his being a robber at all—he then caught hold of my boa, and pulled it, but I put up my hand, which had a bag on it, to prevent his taking it—he then took hold of the bag—I still resisted—he then took something from under his coat, and presented it, first at me, and Chen at my daughter—my daughter said, "Give it him, mamma," or "Let him have it," and on that he took it from me—he had said, "Give it me," meaning the bag—he took it from me forcibly, and then ran off—it con<lb></lb>tained a pocket-book, a silver pencil-case, a pair of scissors, a pair of silver-mounted spectacles, a pocket-handkerchief, a gold watch-key, and a lace collar—I think I have seen the pencil-case since at Mr. Turner's, the pawn<lb></lb>broker's—there were several other trifling things in the bag which I can<lb></lb>not recollect—I did not take notice of the person of the man—I could not, except that he was a tall man, and the make answers to the prisoner; but his countenance I cannot speak about, I was so alarmed at the time.</p>

I am the daughter of last witness—I re<lb></lb>member being with my mother on the evening of the 2nd of December, between five and half-past five o'clock, returning home—I did not hear any thing, till a very tall man pushed by me, and started before me—the pathway is a little raised from the road—I was walking on the edge, and he jumped from the road on to the path—it was the prisoner—I have not</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Langham Christie, of Cumberland-street, St. Marylebone. On the 19th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at noon, I was in the pantry, and heard the street-door bell ring—I went up to answer it—the door leading to the area, I believe, at that time, was left open to dry the passage, which had been just cleaned—I shut the pantry door, but did not lock it—it is a common latch—when I got to the door there was a person there with a newspaper—I took it up to the drawing-room—mistress sent me into the dining-room with it, and I went, down to the pantry, in less than five minutes—when I got to the top of the stairs I saw the pantry door wide open, and the prisoner in the pantry—I called out, and asked him what he wanted there—when I got to the bottom of the stairs he asked if I wanted any black lead—(he had a parcel, of black lead in his left hand, and a blue bag in his other hand)—I said, "No—where do you come from?"—he made no answer, I felt the bag, and heard something rattle—I looked at the tray, and missed some plate—I said, "You have been stealing the plate"—he put his hand into the bag to pull it out—I said, "No, I will take care of that"—he begged of me to let him go—I sent for my master, who came directly, and went for a policeman himself—I kept the prisoner in one hand, and the bag, in the other—the bag was examined at the station-house, and contained two silver dessert forks, a table-spoon, and two papers of black lead—they were my master's forks, and had been on the tray, which I had just set ready for lunch—there was a silver salt-spoon, which he had not touched.</p>

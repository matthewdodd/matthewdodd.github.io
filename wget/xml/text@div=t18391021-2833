The prisoner had been nearly four years in his service—he was employed particularly to take satins from the shop to a cellar, where they are damped before dressing—we mark every piece of satin which is sent to us—at the latter end of September we missed portions of the lengths of satin sent to us, in many instances, and on the 1st of October, in consequence of sus<lb></lb>picion, I sent for Dubois, the officer, and went with him to the prisoner's lodgings—he was not there—we waited until he came home, and we were searching his room when he came in—I gave him in charge—Dubois told him it was for robbing his master, and asked him if he had any duplicates—he said yes, he had, and gave up two which did not relate to our pro<lb></lb>perty—Dubois searched his person and found nine duplicates in his coat pocket, all referring to remnants of satin which have our mark on I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>

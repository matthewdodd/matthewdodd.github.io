I am the wife of Edward Henry Frost, and live at St. James'-place, Bermondsey—about 12 o'clock on the morning of Monday,. 5th August, I was going down Long-lane, Bermondsey—when about half<lb></lb>way down I was pounced on by somebody—I had my purse in my right hand—we had a short struggle and he extricated the purse from my hand—it contained two sovereigns, a half-crown, and threepence—I was about to follow the thief who had run some few yards, when some young youths came up and asked me what was the matter—I paid very little attention and made no reply, but followed the person with my purse—at that time I was tripped up, I cannot say by whom—I fell and was injured very much—my dress and mantle were torn all to pieces—I was quite unconscious for some time after.</p>

I am a painter, and live at 20, Great May's-court, Balls-pond—on Monday, 5th August, I was at work on some ruins joining Smith's-buildings, when the screams of a female attracted my attention, and I saw running ahead—the prisoner ran after him, saying that they would apprehend the prisoners in the act of getting her down—after she was down they ran him—he and Mr. Poolbrook. my brother-in-law, went in pursuit, and I being a little way behind sung out, "Stop the three"—I took one, and my brother-in-law took the other—we did not catch the third—he went after him, but did not catch him.</p>

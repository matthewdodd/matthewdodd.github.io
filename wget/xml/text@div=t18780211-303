On 12th January I was in Mr. May's shop in plain clothes when the prisoner passed—I went out; he was Walking as fast as he could, and when he saw me walking after him I think he knew me; he began to run and I ran after him, and caught him in 8 or 10 minutes—I took him to the ship and told him the charge—he said that the young <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> had made a mistake—I received these four half-crowns from the post-office, and one from Mary Brooks.</p>

I was not the first to begin to run—I was walking fast and so was he—he did not stop in 50 yards, or of his own accord—I followed him to Tulse Hill, and run him down—he was out of breath—he did not say ''I do not know what you want, but I will go back with you"—I had to take him back by force. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER</hi> These five half-crowns are bad.

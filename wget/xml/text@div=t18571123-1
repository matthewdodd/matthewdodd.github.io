On Monday night, 28th Sept, about half past 7 o'clock, I was at home, going to have tea—I had occasion to go down stairs to the yard—when I was in the passage I was met by the prisoners—Mulvey said, "You old b——, I shall pay you"—I turned my head round and said, "Is it to me you are speaking?"—she up with her hand, and struck me a blow on the side of my face; I put my hand up to save myself, and she caught my thumb in her mouth and bit it through—she said, "You called my daughter a w—," which I never did—Connor said, "Give it to her, Annie, the old, diseased, rotten w—," and kicked me; they were both at me when Mulvey's daughter came forward and said, "Mother, here is something," but what it was I could not see, it was quite dark—she handed it to her mother, and I received a blow with some weapon which knocked me down, and the blood came directly—they than all three commenced beating me, and I remember no more; I did not miss my ear until I got to the London Hospital—my eyes were affected; I was bled for four days at the hospital, and cannot properly see yet—I am sure Connor kicked me when I was on the ground—my hair was pulled out by the roots, and when I got to the hospital I found part of my ear was off, and also a back tooth</p>

On 28th Sept, about 11 o'clock at night, Mrs. M'Dermott was brought to the hospital; there was a good deal of contusion about the lower part of her face, and a portion of her left ear was missing, from which blood was flowing—she was under my care till 5th Oct.—I have seen the piece of the ear, and matched it; it corresponds.</p>

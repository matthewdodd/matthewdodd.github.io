                  </hi>. I lived in Jane Shore-court, Shoreditch, for some time, but on the 27th of December I lived in George-street, Spitalfields—I cannot say when I left Jane Shore-court, but I lived in George-street at the time of this accident happening. On the 26th of December, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going from <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's room in George-street, where the prisoner lived, to my own house—I had got to the foot of the stairs and was groping for the latch, to go out, when the prisoner came out of his own room, and said, "Who is this?"—I said, "A friend"—"What makes you here," says he, "so late?"—I said, "I have been up to <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's room here"—he said, "Very well, I will open the door for you"—"Thank you," says I, "I am much obliged to you"—after I got into the street he said, "If I catch you here so late any more, you will get something for it"—I turned and said, "You may catch me here later or earlier, but no harm"—"Very well," says he, "I must know more about you"—so he ran out in the street after me—"You have no occasion," says I, "to come out"—I turned back—he went to <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Col<lb></lb>lins's room and called, and he made him an answer—he said, "What man is this I caught in your passage?"—Collins said, "No man, but one going home to his lodgings"—"Yes, <hi rend="italic">Mike"</hi> says I, "I am here"—with that the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his left hand and took my collar—I, with my right hand, took his collar—I said, "What do you mean to do, what do you collar me for?"—with that he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand with a knife in it, and made a rush with the knife at my belly—it missed me—he said, "You wretch," or, "you vagabond, I will run this through your guts"—I took my hand out of his collar, and took hold of the knife, which was open—I called out to Collins, who was in bed, that he had got a knife and was going to murder me with it—so he got up and laid hold of Hayes, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hayes, that is my cousin; don't strike him in my house, if you do I'll strike you"—I put myself away from him, and was going away, and he got the opportunity of striking me with the knife in the cheek—it went through on the right side, and the teeth on the other side stopped it—he dropped the knife then—<hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's wife was after lighting the candle, and she seeing him drop the knife, said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hayes, it is too late to drop the knife, now you have struck the man," and out Collins's wife went to fetch the policeman, and I kept the knife till the policeman came—the blow injured me—I have been ill a long time, and could do nothing for myself afterwards—I consider in my own mind the man must have made a mistake—I am informed since that he has got a drunken wife, and that might be the cause of his making a mistake in me, for they behaved very kind to me afterwards—they gave me some money during the time that I was ill—it was God's will that I got over it, and I would not like to hurt the man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you had the prisoner first up, did you not charge him with an assault, and was he not fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or to go to gaol for two months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what he was fined, or whether he was fined or not—I heard he was fined—I cannot tell how long it was from the day I made the charge till the prisoner was sent to gaol—I got 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner's wife, and they provided lodging for me for nine or ten days—they acted as kind to me as they could—I caught hold of his collar when he caught hold of me—there was no struggling together—I had never been in the prisoner's room—I knew Collins sixteen years ago in Ireland.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I live in New-court, George-yard, Whitechapel—the prisoner lived in the same house—we have got no landlord—we pay no rent to any body—I remember, one night in December, hearing a cry out, it was between twelve and one o'clock in the night—Bryant had been visiting me that day—Hayes called out to me, "What man is this in my passage?"—I said my friend was going home to his lodging, and then they both came into my room—there was a good fire, but no candle—they were talking to one another, and then Bryant hallooed out to me, and I told Hayes to let that man alone, he was no harm to him—then directly Bryant hallooed out to me that he was going to murder him with a knife, I jumped out of bed, and caught hold of Hayes by the collar—I said, "Don't hit my cousin, else I will hit you"—before I had the word out of my mouth my mistress lighted the candle, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and stabbed Bryant on the right cheek, and the blood flowed on my shoulder, just the same as you would let a water-cock go—the prisoner dropped the knife, my wife took it up, and said, "It is too late to drop it now"—I opened my door, and sent for the policeman—Bryan's cheek was cut right through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say it was a friend of yours who had come to see you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I am sure of that—Bryant is a first cousin of mine—I saw him in London about a month or two after Michaelmas—the first <hi rend="italic">month</hi> of the year is New Year's-day, and I suppose the last <hi rend="italic">month</hi> is Christmas-day—I know the last month of the year, but I do not know the name of it—I came to this country to get my living, the same as others—I have been here twenty-five years—I was never accused of any thing in my country—I have been accused in England.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the first thing you were accused of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I cannot tell—I was not taken up for any thing—I was accused of breaking into a house and taking the things out, but they did not find it—I was at the Old Bailey for that, but they did not follow it up—they sent me to this jail and I was here till the Sessions came on—I do not know how long it was—I was in jail above a week—it is twelve months ago or so—I was not tried, they did not follow me—I have not tried to get any money from the prisoner's friends, nor asked for any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send word to the prisoner's wife that you would not appear if they gave you a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she sent a woman to me, but I do not know her name—I do not know Hannah Sullivan—I may know Ellen Harley, but I do not know that I do—I was at the Magistrate's office on the second examination—Bryant then lived in George-street—the prisoner was fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the assault, or to go to jail for two months if he could not pay it.</p>

I was on duty on the morning of the 27th of December—I was called to No. 16, New-court, George-street—I found Byrant on the first-floor front room, he was bleeding from a wound in the cheek—it was a wound about an inch and three-quarters long, quite through the cheek, and there was a great deal of blood on the floor—I went to the bottom room after Hayes, but I did not find him—I received this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) which was quite wet with blood—I took Byrant to the London Hospital, and in about two hours and a half I took the prisoner—MR.

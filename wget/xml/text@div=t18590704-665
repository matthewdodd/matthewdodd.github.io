                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Cox, 14, Queen-square Mews—the prisoner first came to me there, about three weeks before 9th June, he bought some hay-bands of me for which he was to give me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—I put the shilling in my pocket—I had no other shilling there—in the course of that day I went to a public-house and got something to drink—I tendered that shilling in payment and found it was bad—I kept it by itself at home till I gave it to the constable on 9th June—I kept it separate from all other money—on 9th June, the prisoner came again to the mews between 9 and 10 in the morning; he bought some more hay-bands—he was to give me 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he tendered me in payment a shilling—I took it up and tried it and found it was bad—I sent for a constable—when the constable came, I told him he had given me a bad shilling when he came before—he said he had not been there for five weeks and he had never bought any bands of me before—he said, before the constable came, that he had got a sixpence if I had got a penny—I gave the two shillings to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 86).

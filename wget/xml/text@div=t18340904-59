            . I am a policeman. I remember seeing the prosecutrix crying in Broadway - she was bleeding at the temple - in consequence of what she said, I went and took the prisoner - I found a poker in her room by the side of the fire - there were two pokers - I took up one first, took it, and shewed it to the prosecutrix; and said,"Is that the poker?" - she said, "No" - I then went for the other, and saw it was gone - I turned round to the prisoner, and said, "What have you done with the other poker?" - she said, "What poker do you mean?" - I said,"There was another here" - she denied it; but I searched, and found it wrapped up in the bed-clothes - I asked her what she had been doing to strike her with that - she said she had not struck her - the prosecutrix was drunk, but knew what she was about - the prisoner was sober, and said they had been quarrelling.</p>

            . I am a soldier - I was at Snow's-rents on the 17th of August, and saw the prosecutrix there - I saw the prisoner strike her with something on the landing on the stairs, but I could not see what it was - she had asked Evans for an apron; and the prisoner said, "Wait, Ann, and I will fetch it for you," and went up stairs - the prosecutrix followed Evans up stairs - the prisoner met her on the stairs, and struck her with something black - I could not see what it was - she pushed the prosecutrix down stairs, and pushed her out of doors - I saw her strike her on the back part of the head - I believe it was two blows, but I am not certain.</p>

            . I remember Eccleston coming for her apron - I had been stopping with the prisoner a few days - I went up and told her the prosecutrix wanted her apron - I met the prisoner on the top of the stairs, and told her - I went forwards into the room - Eccleston had followed me up stairs - she was talking very loud, and was very tipsy - the prisoner met her on the stairs, but I did not see her do any thing, as I had passed her - I heard Eccleston call out something about her hitting her with a poker - I turned round, and saw her bleeding very much, and found a great deal of blood on the stairs afterwards - I had not seen a poker in the prisoner's hands - if she struck her with a poker, she must have had it in her hand when I met her, as she did not come back to fetch it - the prisoner was sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had not the prosecutrix been following me from ten to eleven o'clock? A. We were going along Broadway in the morning, and met Eccleston - she then spoke to the prisoner, and abused her in the street - she called her several names, and said something about her apron, but she was in liquor then: and this took place near three o'clock.</p>

            . I am a house-surgeon of Westminster Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought in there on Monday, the day after this happened - there was a wound on her temple about an inch long, separating the integuments in the pericranium from the bone - it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument - I did not perceive any wound at the back of the head - she complained of tenderness on the back of the head, but there was no wound - the skin was broken on the temple - it might be produced by the smaller end of this poker - I should think a blow from such an instrument was very likely to produce death - it depends on the force used - all wounds on the forehead are more dangerous than on the back of the head - the skull is very thin on the temple - a very violent blow with such an instrument on the head, would be likely to produce death - she exhibited symptoms of concussion on Monday - I ordered her head to be shaved, and a lotion applied, but she would not undergo the treatment, and left the hospital - she came again on Wednesday in very great danger, but that was in consequence of her neglect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was but one poker in my room - I ordered her out twice when I was washing up my dinner things - she went down again, and came up with the young woman, who went into the room - I met her, and shoved her outside the door - she fell against the corner of the balustrades of the stairs, and cut herself.</p>

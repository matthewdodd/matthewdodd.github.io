                  </hi>. I lived at 21, Tenison Street, Lambeth, and am a labourer—on 2nd November, at 9.15 p.m., I was in Duke Street, Adelphi, and saw a constable with two persons in custody—he asked me to assist him, and I laid hold of a young man about. 17—as I was holding him the prisoner came up and struck me on the left side—I did not know that I was stabbed at the moment, but I looked at him, and said "I know you, I will summons you for this"—I went on for three or four yards holding the man, and then</p>

               <p>felt something warm running down my side—I undid my trousers, and saw blood—I gave myself to a constable, and went to Charing Cross Hospital, and had my wounds dressed—I was an out-patient for a fortnight, and was not able to work for three weeks—I have had no work since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Ten or fifteen persons were present, but they were not within 6 yards of me—they stood round in a ring 6 yards away, but the prisoner came up to me—there were not half a dozen persons touching me, and trying to prevent me getting to the constable—I am sure I did not go 10 yards before I knew that I was stabbed—the persons were not trying to take the two men out of the hands of the policemen—the prisoner was not taken that night—I said before the Magistrate I did not get more than 10 yards before I felt something running down my side—the prisoner escaped but I did not see him again—it did not take more than an instant from beginning to end.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Hackney carriage driver of 10, Harper's Mews—on 2nd November at 9.15 I was with my cab in Duke Street, Adelphi, and saw a lot of lads pushing an old man about—I told them that they ought to be ashamed of themselves—the prisoner was one of them—he walked behind me, and struck me behind each ear—I was also struck across the eyes with a leather belt, and then across my neck, and knocked down—they kicked me all round—I have not got over it—I have a blister on my chest now—a policeman came up, and took two of them, Connor and Collins, and asked me to take one of them—George Tucker came up and assisted me—the prisoner came up and hit him in the side—I cannot say what it was—Tucker said "I will make you pay for this," or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner ran up by his side—no one was round him at that time, but there were 10 or 15 persons there when he first assisted me—I had never seen the prisoner before, but when he was sitting with others in the charge-room I picked him out—the police had told me that they had got him in custody—I did not see a constable standing by him—there might have been a dozen men and boys in the charge-rooms.</p>

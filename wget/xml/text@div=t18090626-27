               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 4th of June, of his desiring any thing with respect to moving your bed - A. Yes; he desired me to bring the bed up stairs; I had removed it down on account of the bugs, he desired me to bring it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 5th of June, did you take the bed up stairs - A. At ten o'clock in the evening he said there was no occasion unless I had a mind to it, nevertheless I said I would; we supped together in the bed room, the prisoner, his wife, and all the children; two boys besides the sucking child; we all supped together, and went to bed in the same room. About four o'clock the next morning I awoke, they were all asleep; I got up and looked out of the window, and as the prisoner had no sleep for a week past, I thought I would not disturb him.</p>
               <p>COURT. How do you know that he had no sleep - A. Because he was laying and talking all night long; I went to bed again and I went to sleep; when I awoke again, I think as nigh as I can recollect, it was about a quarter after six; I lifted up my eyes, I saw he stood up by the bed side, I do not know whether he was dressed or not; the first thing that I saw was the infant's head all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the infant that was in bed with his wife - A. Yes; then I looked and saw that his wife was bloody; in my fright I turned the two other children down stairs, and told them to call somebody; he told me to go out of the way, he did not want to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What age are the children - A. One is turned eleven, and the other about six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand - A. I believe the hatchet was in his hand; I had a struggle with him, and got the handle of the hatchet out of his hand, leaving the other part of the hatchet in his hand; then he pulled up his wife in bed, and said let me put this poor creature out of her misery; then directly upon that I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter then, when he pulled her up - A. Yes, I saw her then, but she had her head wounded before I awoke.</p>
               <p>COURT. That you cannot tell - A. I saw her blood on her head, I left the room, I saw she was bloody and wounded; I saw him give her one blow just before I took the hatchet out of his hand, I think with the head of the hatchet on the side of her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come into the room again - A. No, not till after she was dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did Davey say any thing after you came in again - A. He was taken away then.</p>
               <p>Q. For some time before this, in what state of mind had this man been in - A. Why sir, he has not been right since last May five year; he has been twice in St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been particularly low spirited or uneasy just about or before this time - A. Very low sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to observe that his insanity was returning upon him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your daughter make any observation of the same effect - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing particular in him about the month of June - A. He was always worse in that month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in general a kind and affectionate husband before - A. A very kind husband, and a very good father, ever since he has been out of St. Luke's this last time, he never offered to insult any of us.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say that he has not been in his right mind for near these five years last May - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to him then, had he any blow or accident - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ill at that time, five years ago - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his illness - A. I think it was rather a family disorder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any fever - A. No; he was apprenticed to the sea, when he came home he went to live with his sister, who is in the same way now; she lives in Kentish-town now, she has some property; she is in her own house, and she is taken care of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260025"></xptr>Q. You say he became in the same way five years ago - was he in confinement any time - A. It was five years ago the first time, then he was very bad, he was in confinement in St. Luke's; there is a paper that gives an account; as soon as we could get a letter to get him in; we got him in, there he was for four months; afterwards he came out of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue before he came bad again - A. He was never right after he was taken out the first time; he was always talking or singing, but did not do any mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. He followed his business and did no mischief - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he became ill again so as to occasion him to be confined again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long after that was - A. No; there is a certificate of that; he was twice in St. Luke's. It was four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke just now of a week that he could not rest - A. Yes; he was talking all night, and could not rest; he was complaining of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was no quarrel whatever between him and his wife - A. No.</p>

            . Q. You are a butcher in Skinner-street - A. Yes. On the morning of the 6th of June the two boys were crying about; my daughter came and told me. As I went up stairs Mrs. Blackburn bursted the door, and forced the door in the wrong way; I instantly ran up stairs; she kept the door from him hurting her; the door had a chair against it. As I went in the first thing I saw was Mrs. Davey sitting up in bed with her head and face all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when you looked in - A. Yes. I could not get into the room then. Instantly I put my head in, I saw him standing by the bed side, the bed was lying on the ground; I said Davey, Davey, what have you done; he had a lapstone in his hand, what he used in his trade; he said immediately, Mr. Davis, you go down stairs, or else I shall kill and murder you; I instantly pulled my head back, thinking he might throw the stone at me, or cause him to do his wife further mischief; there was a crack, I looked through; he hit his wife over the head; she cried, oh! down she fell immediately; as she fell down with her head on the side of the pillow, he hit her over the head with the stone; I could see the blood go all over the room; he instantly turned himself round by her head; by the bed side was a razor case; he took it up sharpish; he opened the case and took the razor out, looked at me, and put his head out; he took the razor and did so as though to cut his own throat; I ran down stairs and gave the alarm; he put the razor down.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not touch it - A. No, he did not touch it; it was within two or three inches of his throat. That is all I saw of the murder being committed; he was secured instantly; I got into the room, the infant lye as if it had been suckling; the mother was groaning; at the same time the brains came out of the hair of the child. The child, when I took it up, did just make one gasp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner before this - A. I had lived there very near sixteen months, I lived next door then. Instantly I laid the child on the pillow I put my arm under the wife, lifted her up, and asked a person to give me some water; she drank a little water down her throat; she made a terrible noise; I kept her so till the doctor came.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you had known the prisoner sixteen months - A. Yes. I have no doubt but he was out of his mind, but he was not mischevious; he gave incoherent answers; I never heard an angry word between him and his mother or his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was secured - A. Yes; I got into the room just at the time they secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance - A. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wife after she was dead - A. I did.</p>

            . Q. Were you called in on the the 6th of June to see Mrs. Davey - A. I was; it was near seven o'clock in the morning; the child was dead; I found the woman with a large wound extending from the near corner of the right eye to the back of the head, over the ear; I did what appeared necessary to be done at that time. It had penetrated the scull, I felt the brain, it was protruding at the back part of the head; there were two wounds in the back, between the shoulders, which apparently had been done by a knife, like stabs; I was not there at the time of her death; I was there a few minutes after her death.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt what was the cause of her death - A. No; the wound in her head was the cause of her death.</p>

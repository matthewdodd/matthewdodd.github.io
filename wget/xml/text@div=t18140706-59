               <p>Q. From what part of the house did you lose it - A. From the club-room. There are different people that sleep in that room that belongs to the club. They were left in my box. I belong to the club.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you any loser - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a lock-up box - A. Yes; I had the key of it. The 31st of May was on Tuesday; I was there on Tuesday evening again; the officer informed me. My box was still locked. I had not missed the property before Wilson, the officer, came in. I opened my box to see whether I missed anything; I missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any marks upon the notes to enable you to know them again - A. No; they were in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your pocket-book again - A. That same night, in Wilson, the officer's hands; and on the 4th of June I saw my umbrella, when the prisoner was committed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the pocket-book and the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the umbrella to be mine by the top being broken, and I know the pocket-book by a bit of the red leather being torn off. There is a draft of forty pound in it now; that is not in the indictment. I have received ten pound of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he slept at Mr. Franklin's one or two nights. I saw him there at the house.</p>
               <p>Wilson. On the 31st of May, the prisoner, in company with a man of the name of Harvey were passing by our office in Bow-street; I took them into custody. I got the pocket-book from the prisoner, and the umbrella, at the hour of eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the pocket-book at the time - A. Four one-pound notes, a check of forty pounds (ten of it has been received, and sundry other memorandums. He was coming from Long Acre, as if from Franklin's house; it appeared he was coming from Franklin's house by the direction he was going. I asked him where he got the umbrella from; he informed me, from his brother; he was going to pawn it to get his breakfast, as he had got no money. He said that before I took the pocket-book from him. I have had the pocket-book and its contents ever since, and the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Tothill-fields, in the evening, I picked the pocket-book up.</p>

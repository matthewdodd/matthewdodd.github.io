On Sunday the 5th of May, I left home at two o'clock in the afternoon, and went to Charles-street, Hatton-garden; then through the City to Whitechapel - I went into a public-house in Brick-lane, about eleven o'clock,

             was with me; I did not know her before that day - I was there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Yatton was there with six or seven more. I pulled out my watch to see the time, and left the house about half-past eleven o'clock, and went into the George and Dragon, public-house, Cartwright-street, kept by the prisoner Brown. Jones was still with me - I saw Yatton there again with other people; I rather think they were the same I saw with him at the public-house, as the people had followed me out of the house. I called for a glass of rum and water, and just as I got in, in came the prisoners with six or eight others, and began shoving me about, and knocked my glass over - one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"You have knocked the gentleman's liquor over," I said never mind the liquor if the glass is not broken - I called for another glass, and had scarcely got it before they all seized upon me - they cut my fob from my breeches, and bound me down quite tight, with my arms fast down to my side; I cried out</p>
               <p>"Landlord spare me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220012"></xptr>they are robbing me" - the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"Go it you ***," they nearly strangled me, and when I came to myself, I found both my pockets turned inside out, and my watch and seals taken away, and 5 s. and a half-crown piece. They then all went out; I can swear to Yatton and Brown - Yatton assisted in holding me down; Brown kept saying</p>
               <p>"Go it! Go it!" he stood behind me, and one hand held my head back, I cannot say it was his hand - I did not see him standing behind, but I could hear him; he was just behind the settle where I sat. When they were gone, I said to Brown,</p>
               <p>"They have robbed me;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Have they." I said I did not know what to do for my property, and declined leaving the house directly, and so he took me by the shoulder and shoved me out, saying I had better go. I wanted his assistance to get a watchman; I told him so - he opened the door and shoved me down the steps and so I went away. I cried out Murder! and robbery! I went to the watch-house, and they told me to come next morning to Worship-street; I have not found my property - I had seen Yatton before that night; I saw him again at Worship-street on the Tuesday. I was sober when I went to the George. It was about one mile and a half from my house. Two men shewed me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where did you meet Jones - A. At the Harp, public-house, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about two o'clock; two men were with her. I staid there drinking half an hour; I went with her to five or six other public-houses, and drank at all of them. I had been walking about the streets till eleven o'clock.</p>

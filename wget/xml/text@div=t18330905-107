            . I am servant at the public house - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor there; they appeared to come in together; he called for a pint of porter; I took it to him; he paid for it; and almost directly he fell asleep - he appeared to be sober - the prisoner was standing up at that time - I was called out to get a pot of porter; and when I went in again, the prisoner was jumping over the table - I saw the prosecutor's hat fall off, and the prisoner took a handkerchief out of it and put it to her mouth - she then sat down by his side - I was then called out, and before I returned she was gone.</p>

             (police-constable H 33). I went with my brother officer to take the prisoner; she made an excuse to stop - I went back to the spot and saw her pass something from one hand to the other, I took her hand, and found this duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor overtook me and invited me to have something to drink - I went and he gave me a piece of cold pork, out of a bason, and three cold potatoes; he then gave me the handkerchief to wipe my mouth - he dropped asleep - I staid about an hour talking to Gibson, and then went home.</p>

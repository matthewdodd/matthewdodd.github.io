                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Kennington Lane. On 3rd April I was coming along St. George's Read, about 2 o'clock in the morning—a woman accosted me—I could not get rid of her—she was very violent—I had been dining out, and was not perhaps <hi rend="italic">compos mentis</hi> as I am at present, but I wanted to get rid of her—two men came up, and said, "What are you doing with that woman?"—I then thought I had been robbed, and I went to seize the woman, and was tripped up, and fell down, and cut my face and hands—when I got up, the prisoner was within arm's length of me—I seized him, and kept him till a policeman came—I had missed my pone before I seized the prisoner—I said to him, "You are one of the parties who have attacked and been robbing me"—he said, "No, I am not"—I could not identify him, and I let him go—I was going with the constable to give information of the robbery, and we went back and took the prisoner—he is the same person that I caught hold of the first time—he said, "I saw yon in the Wagon and Horses, treating a lot of girls and that is where you lost your purse"—I was never in the Wagon and Horses in my life—I had not been in any other public house in the neighbourhood that night—my purse has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6 1/2, Lyon Street. On the morning in question I was in St. George's Road—I got to the corner, and saw the prosecutor having hold of a young girl by the arm or wrist—I heard him exclaim, "Police! I have been robbed!"—two men were standing at the corner, about four yards from him—the prisoner was one of them—I heard one of them exclaim, "Let the girl go;" and one of them went and parted the prosecutor from her, and the girl ran down St. George's Road, and the prosecutor after her—the other man ran behind the prosecutor, and tripped him up—the prisoner was close behind the man who tripped the prosecutor up—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men who were there, but I did not see him do anything—he was standing there.</p>

I have done nothing"—Mr. Evans said that he had been robbed—I asked him if he knew who robbed him—a policeman came up, and the prosecutor said, "This is a very nice thing, is it not, for a gentleman to walk along, and to be knocked down and robbed) I will go to the station, and let them know"—the policeman said, "I will go with you"—the prisoner said he had done nothing, and I heard him say at the station that he had been in the Wagon and Horses, and that the prosecutor was in there—he denied it.</p>

I left her a little before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner Giles or Smith - A. No; it was on the ground floor. I waited at the house when I came out for a watchman; none came by. About two o'clock on Sunday morning I heard the three prisoners now at the bar coming from Lefevre's room; they came out of the house together and I laid hold of Lefevre, she had robbed me of my watch; I charged her with the robbery; Smith took hold of me by the right side of my collar; I had Smith in my left hand, Giles was endeavouring to pull Lefevre away; Smith said, you b - r, let the woman go, it is my wife, meaning Lefevre was his wife; I told him I did not care whose wife it was, she had robbed me, and I was, determined to bring her to account for it. Smith made an assault upon my person, he laid hold of my coat, tore it, and put me in bodily fear. Giles said, bl - t his eyes, take his bloody handkerchief off his neck; Smith then directly untied my silk handkerchief and took it from my person; I cannot say what he did with it. In the scuffle I was knocked down, I believe by Smith; they left me on the ground covered all over with blood and went towards Osborne street; I saw no more of them that time. I am sure of their persons, I have seen them before at different times; this happened on Sunday July the 31st, and the women were apprehended on Monday. I saw Smith again the next morning we were both going to work; I saw him on the following days; he was apprehended on the Thursday; then he went out of the warehouse by a prohibited way; when he saw the constable was coming to take him into custody he resisted; he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT You say you saw the prisoner Smith in Whitechapel on the following Monday - A. I beg your lordship's pardon; I saw him in Whitechapel on the Tuesday, about ten minutes past seven in the morning; we were both going towards the West India dock; we walked about one hundred yards together. On Wednesday I saw him going towards the dock; one of our foremen was in company with him; I asked him if he knew that man, he said he did, he told me his name was Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had enquired for Smith on the Tuesday you might have found him - A. I dare say I might. I did not.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth street office. I apprehended Lefevre in company with Coombes (my fellow officer) in Wentworth street, on Monday about half past ten in the morning; going along Giles was pointed out to me: we took them both to Giles' room. Lefevre submitted to be searched; Giles throwed the plates and dishes at my head; I was forced to get assistance to take her. Smith was brought to the office on the third day by the constable of the docks; he said nothing, and nothing was found on them.</p>

               <p>Smith. When I came home from work on Monday night, as usual, I heard

               <p>Smith's Defence. I have worked at the dock almost ever since they have been made. On Saturday night, after I had taken my week's pay, I went to the public house and had a pint or two of beer; at half past nine o'clock I returned home, I had my supper and went to bed; I never got out of bed from that time till half past four o'clock in the morning; I have a witness that knows I was in bed and asleep when this man came up to the door and said his handkerchief was taken off his neck.</p>

After that he staid at the door a long while. When I came back to the door he still staid at the door; he said he would take me in custody. Smith and Giles got up about four o'clock in the morning; he laid hold of Giles, I told him to let her alone; he said he would not, he would have her in custody; then I pushed him away from me, and we all three went towards Osborn street. I really think Smith is innocent of meddling with him or taking the handkerchief from his neck; so is

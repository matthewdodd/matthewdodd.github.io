                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Slater—street, Bethnal-green, and am a fancy trimming maker. On 22nd Dee. I had a pony, a cart, and harness for sale, and on the 24th Harnwell came to my house about 9 o'clock in the morning—it rained very hard, and he had a waterproof coat on—he asked me if I would allow him to take my pony and cart and harness to show to a customer—I said if he would bring it back safe, but I asked a neighbour named Bolter to go with him to see that he safely returned it—Harnwell was to drive, but they were both in charge of it—I only knew Harnwell by having a card from the place where he worked—that was the reason I let him have it—I instructed them not to sell it or get rid of it in any way; but if it suited the party, I would sell it him if he came to my house—I was to have the determining of whether I would sell it or not—I gave them no authority to sell—on the same night, about dusk, Bolter came back, and brought me a sovereign, which I would not take, and he holds it now—in consequence of information, I went to the house where Day was represented to live; it is at a wharf in Agar Town—Day was not to be seen that night, but I saw him on Christmas morning, and said, "I have come for my pony and cart, I have information that they are here;"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020120"></xptr>
               <p>he called a man named May, who said, "There has been a tall man here this morning, and I am to give the pony to no one but him "—Day had said that it was not on the premises, but was in the country—I said, "Here is my name on my card, which will prove that it is mine, as my name is also on the cart;"May said, in Day's presence, that they were not to be given to me, as he had received directions—I said, "Well, if you will not give them to me, I will go with you to the station house—I showed him this bit of paper, and said, "Is this the piece of paper you sent to me by Bolter, last night?"—he said that it was, and I claimed to have them returned, but he would not—he said that he could not tell whether I was the right man, and he did not want to tell—when Day said that they were in the country, I said that I should go to the station house, and get advice—I did so, and returned with a policeman—we saw Day and May together—Day read this receipt to the policeman, and then said, "Now, if you don't go, I will kick you out"—I said, "I don't wish for that, I will go "—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Received of Mr. G.

I afterwards heard of a customer, and when I was at Mr. Stadden's shop I said, "You are going out this afternoon, you had better take a walk down and see what that pony and cart are worth, and whether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. can be made of it;" I went there, and asked Mr. Grout if it was for sale; he said, "Yes," and we went and looked at it; we then went to a public house and got a pint of beer; Stadden said, "Let it come down to my place to-morrow morning, because it wants a little alteration; the pony has got too much white, but he has got a goodish mouth, and by making a little alteration it will fetch a pound or two more;" he said that he would not take a halfpenny less than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; next morning I went; they put the pony in the cart; I jumped in, and Mr. Grout drove away from his own door himself; he afterwards dropped</p>

I said, "I do not know;" he went to a public house and asked Bolter whether that was the pony and cart which were for sale; he said, "Yes," and asked 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; Day said, "I will treat you for fetching me, but it is no use to me at that price;" we had a pint of half and half, and Bolter said, "What will you give?"

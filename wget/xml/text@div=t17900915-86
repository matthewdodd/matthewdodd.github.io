I lost all my money last Sunday four weeks, between nine and ten at night, at the sign of the Virginia Planter; I had been in there getting a little beer, and I gave her a part of a pint of beer, or two pints, I believe there was; I was at a chandler's shop, and the prisoner followed me to the Virginia Planter, and I gave her part of a pint or two of beer, and a quartern of gin; I paid for my beer, and pulled out my purse, and was going out, and put my purse into my coat pocket, my breeches pocket not being so handy; the prisoner looked at the purse in my hand, but I did not think she wanted to take it away from me; just as I opened the door I felt somebody at my pocket, and I saw my purse in her hand, and she set off; and she did run at such a rate, nothing could be like it, till she got among a gang of thieves, and the gang of thieves tumbled me about, and took a silk handkerchief out of my pocket, and all night long they were ranting and roaring at a terrible rate; I took her up the next day; I came to the

               <p>Court. How long had you been at the Virginia Planter that day? - I had been walking down the hackney road, and had got a little in liquor to be sure, a little matter.</p>
               <p>I suppose you do not give these sort of people beer and gin when sober? - I did not think any harm; sometimes when I have got a little drop of liquor I have given a man a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you cannot tell how much liquor you had had; you was pretty forward in liquor? - No, not vastly forward; I knew the purse directly; a nasty black canvas purse; there was nobody but her and me coming out at the door; there were several people in the house; I ran after back; and the further I ran, the further I was behind.</p>
               <p>Are there any of the people of the Virginia Planter here.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, the prosecutor came in with three girls; I was standing at the door; in about a quarter of an hour he came out with these three girls, and took them to the Virginia Planter; he went round the corner, and in about five minutes he was licking two of the girls: the man never spoke to me till Monday; he said, I had robbed him of fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

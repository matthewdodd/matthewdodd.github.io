                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Welch who keeps the Old Star and Crown in Broadway, Westminster. On 1st December, the prisoner came about half-past 9 o'clock at night, called for half-a-quartern of gin and offered me a bad shilling in payment—I made no remark, but said to my servant, "Tell your master I want him"—the prisoner heard me say that and he said, "No occasion for that, I will see all about it," and with that he rushed out of the door and ran away down Queen-square, and the policeman brought him back—I gave the shilling to the policeman and said, "That man has given me this bad shilling."</p>

I was a short distance from the Old Star and Crown—I saw the prisoner run out of the house and he passed me—I heard a cry of "Stop thief;" I pursued him and took him back to the house—he became very violent and I had to get assistance—I searched him and found in his left hand trousers pocket, four sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, and 12 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—he gave his address at 11, Union-court, Orchard-street, Westminster—I went there and he was denied.</p>

I went to assist the last officer, and took the prisoner to the station—when he got outside he was very violent, and I saw him put his hand in his right-hand trousers pocket—he took something out and threw it on the ground; it rattled like money—I could not find it—there were about two hundred persons there.</p>

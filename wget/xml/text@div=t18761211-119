                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On 9th October, I was instructed to write a letter to the prisoner, and I did so—I have given him notice to produce it—I kept a copy of it, this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the witness to the prisoner enclosing </hi>2<hi rend="italic">l. and requesting him to send some pictures similar to some which he had supplied to another person.</hi>) I enclosed in that letter—a stamped envelope—I received no reply, and on 12th October, I called at the prisoner's house, 34, Bridgewater Gardens—it is a printer's shop—I saw the prisoners' wife there, but not himself—I afterwards received this letter in the stamped envelope which I had sent. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the witness to meet the prisoner at Edgware Road Station.</hi>) On Saturday 14th, I went to the Edgware Road Station, according to the letter, and the prisoner came up to me and pushed me by the arm, and said "Well, George"—I said "How do you know my name is George?"—he said "Well, Corbett, what might your Dame be?"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Old friend Bill</hi>"—he asked me what I wanted, I said that I wanted some books, I did not want gems, I wanted something better, I had seen them and had got rid of them, and I wanted Sir Henry Lovell, or something like that—I had never seen one of those books—he said "I suppose you are all right"—I said "Oh, yes, I am all right"—he said "I know the police are after me, and if they get me I know I shall get two—years, some "of them got two years for it, a little while ago, and if I thought anyone was selling me I would rip' their guts out, and the police too if they came there; I am one of the oldest left now, and you will get a good hiding if you come there"—he then asked me for the money—I told him I could not afford to give him the money—he had not said how much it was, but afterwards he said "Will you give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No, I cannot afford that, I might not get it"—I afterwards gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not. arranged what books he was to <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, but. he was to get two—I was to see him again on Monday—I was dressed in knee breeches and gaiters as a coachman—I saw him on the Monday at his house, and he produced these two books "Fanny Hill," and "The f——Countess"—I have examined them; they are very obscene—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday, making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether—on 24th October, I went to his house again and asked for some cards—he showed me some; they were not finished, they required colouring and I would not have them—the price was half a crown each; I asked for a dozen and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—he showed me a picture of a woman; a very disgusting thing, and said that he was going to take some sketches of it—I saw him again before he finished the—cards, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—he afterwards brought these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to me at Burlington Mews, Westbourne Park, and I paid him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more for them, making in all 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 13th November, I gave him an order for a dozen cards, rather better than those—on 20th November, I obtained two warrants at Guild<lb></lb>hall, one for a search, and one for his arrest, and on 22nd November, I went to his shop—Sergeant Webb and another officer remained Outside—he produced the cards I have in my hand for which I had arranged to pay him 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he wanted 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at that point Sergeant Webb came in and read the warrant—I was with him when the search was made, and produce a list of the articles found, among them were these three manuscript books which are very disgusting, also "Injured Innocence, or the Rape of Sarah Wood-cock," that is printed, and it is very obscene—we also found this "Cata<lb></lb>logue of scarce books."</p>

               <p>myself in communication with the prisoner; I had never seen him before—I wrote two letters, which he answered, and then met him outside the Edg ware Road Station—I got nothing from him at that meeting, but I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance—on the Monday I obtained from him the two books I had asked for in the front part of his shop at the right hand side of the door as you go in—the door was pushed to—nobody else was there; his wife went upstairs—I am certain the doors were not locked—they were pushed to, but not fastened—he particularly asked me if I wanted one particular book, one which is so disgusting that I have not mentioned it—he told me that I could have some slides if I wanted them, and he brought them tome to the stable one evening—I called several times at the prisoner's house, but not always in the same costume—I bad a workman's dress on several occasions, a stable suit—no one else was present when he brought the slides to the stable—the stable door was closed—we afterwards had something to drink; I proposed it—I always like to keep friends with people—he had several glasses—he did not seem to feel the effects of it a great deal—I refused to have some slides because they were in black pencil and were not coloured—he said "I will colour them for you, and you shall have them to-morrow night—I wanted them for myself; I very likely said that I wanted them for somebody else, and possibly I used some name—I bought the cards in the prisoner's front shop, but there is a small room behind, where the printing machine is—I got the cards from the prisoner's hand, and said "How much have I to pay you for these extra"—he said "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have not been able to do them all, my hand has been bad, but here are eight; the others will be ready in a day or two"—Sergeant Webb then walked in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He asked me if I should like a book on—I said "No"—he was quite sober when I bought the books at his house and when he was taken in custody—he said "I will colour the cards, and you can have them to-morrow night"—when I made the search I found this box of colours and hair brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On 22nd November I went to the prisoner's shop in Bridgewater Gardens with Davis—I sent him on and followed—when I went in I saw the prisoner in the shop with Davis and a constable named Holt—"I said "Mr. Stirling, I am an officer, and hold a warrant for your apprehension for selling indecent and obscene books"—he said "All right, I am in it, and must get out of it in the best way I can; I admit I sold books to this man," pointing to Davis—a search was made by the constables, and I saw these books and other things found.</p>

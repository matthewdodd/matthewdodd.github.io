Lee pushed me down on the bed, and the other came and took my watch out of my pocket; then they ran down stairs with it. Anderson was in the street; I called to him out of the window to stop that girl, for she had my watch: he did not stop her: he thought I was only in jest. I went down after her, but she got off; I never got my watch again: when they were before the magistrate, they confessed they sold it for 18 s.</p>

               <p>Was that confession taken down in writing? - I believe it was.</p>

I had no suspicion that she had his watch: I did not stop her; I thought he was in joke. He came down, and said, Why did not you stop her? she has got my watch. I said, It serves you right: why did not you come down when I called you?</p>

               <p>(The prisoners in their defence said, that they were drinking in a public-house; the prosecutor drank with them, and afterwards went out with some other girls; and that they knew nothing of the watch.)</p>

On the 14th of October, about a quarter after seven o'clock, I took his chaise to him, and his two coats, which hung over the gig. I was placing the coats right when Mr. Evans came in - I observed the prisoner at the door of a public-house, two doors from Mr. Evans's, smoking his pipe. I got out of the chaise, and went to the horse's head, I then had my back to the great-coats; the horse's head was towards the public-house. The prisoner passed me, and in a moment after I turned my head, and saw the coats were gone. I rang the bell; Mr. Evans scolded me, gave me 6 d., and drove off. I then went round to York-street, which is only two doors from Mr. Evans's. As soon as I got into York-street, I saw the prisoner standing against the News-office, in Brydges-street. While he stood there, a man in a long coat, apparently a coachman, went up to him, and they talked together. At last Brown saw me, and they both went down Brydges-street together. I followed them down into the Strand, through several courts, towards Temple-bar - they came to a court, then the prisoner set off running - I ran after him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have stolen two of my master's coats." He immediately collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, what are you following me for?" and knocked me down in the middle of the road - he struck me on the ear. He set off running as hard as he could; I got up and ran after him, calling Stop thief! he ran down Swan-yard, and went into a house there. I lost him, came back, and a gentleman said he was in the house. I stationed a man at the door, while Racket went with me to Bow-street for an officer, and I gave him the 6 d. which Mr. Evans gave me. I got Holyland, who searched the house, but could not find him. I went for Mr. Corderoy, who went into the house, got a light, and went into the cellar. I saw one of the coats on the floor, at the bottom of the stairs. I went a little farther, found a little door in the cellar, opened it, and found the prisoner there, sitting on the privy, as if he was fast asleep - I found nothing more. As we went out of the house we were surrounded by about twenty girls, who endeavoured to rescue the prisoner from the constable. The prisoner hit the constable with all his force on the nose, and made it bleed. He did not get away.</p>

About three minutes after I got in, he knocked at the door, and said the coats were missed. I was obliged to go into the country, and sent him to look for the thief.</p>

            . I am in the Coldstream Guards, and live in Swan-yard. I saw the prisoner come into the yard about half-past seven o'clock, with a drab coat hanging over his arm. He knocked at the door, a young woman on the outside had a key and let him in; the door was shut immediately. In about a minute after, I saw White run past the house - I did not speak him to then. He returned, was crying, and said a young man had stolen his master's great-coats. I told him he was gone into that house. I accompanied him to Bow-street, and got a constable. I stood at the door, while they went to search the house. Nobody came in or went out until the prisoner was taken.</p>

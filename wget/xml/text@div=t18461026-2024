                  </hi>. I am a bookseller. I am trade assignee of the estate and effects of Messrs.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260030"></xptr>
               <p>when the sale was going on—I saw the Bible and Prayer-book which are the subject of this inquiry there—they were not for sale, but were on a shelf, in a little room—on the 8th of Aug. I received from the appraiser of the Court of Bankruptcy an inventory, which named this Bible and Prayer-book and those engravings—on Monday, the 21st of Sept., Mr. John Bryant called, and gave me information—he sent Mr. Mason to me, who brought me this Bible and Prayer-book, which I had seen at Messrs. Evans'—they are positively the same—I had not seen them after the bankruptcy, but they were the same that were inventoried to me—in consequence of information I received from Mr. Mason as to the means by which he became possessed of them, I went the next morning, about ten o'clock, opposite to Mr. Mason's premises—Mr. Bryant was with me—after waiting about an hour opposite Mr. Mason's shop I saw the prisoner Hudson enter it—he came out almost immediately—I knew him to have been in the employ of Messrs. Evans—I rather think he was their servant—I followed him about 100 yards in Carlile-street, to the corner of Frith-street, when I overtook him—I seized him by the arm, and said, "If you do not immediately give up the things you have got with you, I will give you in charge of the police"—he said, "O, Mr. Rodd, how do you do?"—I said, "You have got stolen property about you—books and prints belonging to Messrs. Evans; if you do not give them up I will give you in charge"—he said it was the first offence, and he had got a wife and family, and kept urging me for mercy—he said he had been a faithful servant many years—when I first charged him I said, "Give up those things in your pos<lb></lb>session"—he said, "What things?"—I said, "The books and prints"—he never denied that he had them—on the road to my house, to which I first took him, he kept asking for mercy and forgiveness—I said it was not in my power—he then used words, the purport of it was that he was not the only guilty person, that there was another person as bad as he—Mr. Bryant asked him who, and he said Attwell—he said Attwell was to be found at Leicester-place—we went on to my house in Newport-street—Mr. Charles Evans had appointed to meet me, but we did not find him—I gave Hudson to the officer and we went to Leicester-place—Attwell was not there, but in half a minute we saw him come down Lisle-street—the officer told him he had a charge against him—he said, "What for?"—the officer said for stealing books, and he must accompany him—he then begged to put a parcel in the house, and we went on—in going to the station I was a little in advance—Attwell stepped up to me, and asked if it could not be settled by his paying for the goods—I said it was impossible—we went to the station, and from there to the Magistrates—Mr. Hardwick investigated the matter—in the course of the inquiry Hudson produced this paper, but it has been very much torn since—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Charles Reason, broker, White Horse-yard, Drury-lane")—Hudson said, Att<lb></lb>well gave him this paper—I believe at the time Attwell said that paper was his writing—he denied any participation in this transaction—this is the Bible and Prayer-book—they are very old—the date is 1508—I would be glad to give 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I rather think the officer took these books from Hudson—I have constantly works submitted to me for my opinion.</p>

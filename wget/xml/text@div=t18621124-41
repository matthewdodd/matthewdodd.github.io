                  </hi>. I live at 113, Gray's-inn-lane—on Saturday evening, 8th November, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was coming through Fox-court with my daughter Emily Doyle, and saw two women and a man walking from Leather-lane towards me—I had never seen them before—I made as much haste as I could through Fox-court, and one of the women hit me behind and before, and nearly throttled me—they pulled my shawl off, and ran away—I cannot identify them, but my daughter can—I very nearly feinted, and was very much hurt—I went home, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have witnesses here to prove that I never went out of my own door that night; the policeman saw me at my door at 10 o'clock, and after<lb></lb>wards the city night-policeman spoke to me at my door. I was taken out of bed at five minutes to 6 o'clock. When she came into my room in the evening, she said that I was not the woman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I said that I could not identify you, but my daughter did—I was hurt on my chest, and I got a kick behind.</p>

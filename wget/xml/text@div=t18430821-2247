                  </hi>. I hawk things about for my father, Aaron Hart. On the 26th of July, between one and two o'clock, I was with my father in a bye lane at Wood-green Common, in the parish of Tottenham—White came up, and asked what I had to sell—I said "Knives"—I uncovered my basket to show them—he took up a knife and looked at it—Smith asked him for it, and took it out of his hand—I asked him for it, and so did my father, but he put it into his pocket, and both walked on towards Rhodes farm—Smith said, "If you follow me, I will give you something else," and my father would not go farther—I went about half a mile to Wood-green for a policeman—we went round about two miles to Wood-green—I found the prisoners in about an hour and a half lying asleep in a beer-shop—the policeman took them.</p>

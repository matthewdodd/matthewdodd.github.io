                  </hi>. I am the relieving overseer of the parish of St. Pancras, and have been so for some years. In consequence of complaints made to me, I think on 21st Sept. last, I inquired into the state of the lad James Frederick Weedon—he was one of five children belonging to the prisoner, at that time living in a house in Compton-street, Brunswick-square—I also found a woman living with the prisoner, a strong, stout woman—she was not the mother of the children, but a woman with whom he coha<lb></lb>bited—the deceased boy was twelve years of age, I think—he was a very small, decrepid looking child—I found him sitting on a stool by the side of his father, sewing round the toe of a shoe, with the usual leather apron on, and a strap upon his foot—he was in a very miserable, emaciated condition; he was covered with vermin, and was a mere shadow, skin and bone, nothing more—it was a fearful sight that all of them presented—I found some food in the cupboard, part of a neck of mutton, and there was a saucepan on the fire, with some vegetables, as they told me, and they had bread—the prisoner and the woman were looking very well and healthy—the whole of the chil<lb></lb>dren were in a wretched condition; I took them at once to the Clerkenwell police court—the prisoner said he believed a good deal had been said against him which was untrue, that there was a conspiracy against him, and he was very thankful I had come to make an inquiry—I asked him if he would accompany me to the police court, which he consented to do, and he went—he told me that he had corrected his children, the deceased, and a younger boy, for going through the streets, and picking up what he called <hi rend="italic">muck</hi> in the street, and they had promised him they would not do so again, and he believed they would not; but they were in the habit of doing so, notwithstanding what he gave them—before I went to the police court, I sent for Dr. Morris Davis to see the state in which the children were—from the police court I took the deceased to the workhouse, where he was imme<lb></lb>diately placed under the care of Mr. Waldegrave, the house surgeon—he got better for a time and seemed to have more flesh upon him, and then he rapidly sank, and died about three weeks ago—a girl also died, the others have improved very much—they look like children now, they looked more like ancient people before, than infants, they were ghastly creatures.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live at No. 2, Little Guildford-street I carry my milk about myself—I have seen the prisoner's children about the street—my attention was called to the deceased boy somewhere about July—it might have been about Aug. or Sept.—I knew him when they were living in the Colonnade, and in Compton-street, and before that—he was in a very bad state—my attention was first called to him as I was feeding my fowls out at the door—he was coming up the street, and he ran into the road and picked up some of the cold potatoes that I was throwing out to the fowls, and began to eat them ravenously, using both hands—I asked him where he lived, and he told me in the Colonnade—I have seen him pick up pieces in the street two or three times—he was very thin, and very dirty, and had several nasty bruises about him, and he looked regularly deplorable—he had a cap on—he came into my house, and I took off his cap, and fed him in my house, and I told him to come every day about 3 o'clock—I fed him I suppose for about a month; it might have been more—he improved under that treatment in a fortnight, he did not look like the same boy—I continued to feed him until his father moved out of the Colonnade, when he refused his coming to me any more; so the boy told me, and so did his father—he told me he would not allow his boy to come to me any more, because he was encroaching upon me, and the boy told him my wife looked cool upon him—I said my wife did no<lb></lb>thing of the sort—there was a great deal of altercation in front of his house, and a great mob assembled, and cried shame upon Weed on—it was several parties standing by, not me; I did not interfere, because I had my milk pails and was about my business—I did not see the boy again after that until a day or two before he was taken to the work-house—he was then in a very bad state—he came up to me in the street as I was coming along Old Compton-street, and said, "How do you do, sir? "—I put down my pails, and shook hands with him—he said he was hungry, and asked me for a halfpenny or a penny, which I gave him—I had been in the habit of giving him a halfpenny or a penny—he was in his shirt sleeves—I took up his shirt sleeves, and his little arms were very thin, and very dirty, you could have scratched the dirt off; and there were two very bad places on his head, nearly the size of a shilling, with the hair and skin cut right off—I asked how he came by them, and he said, "That is where father hit me"—some men took him down opposite his father's window, and they called him out to show him the child, and there was a mob round the door—the prisoner came out, and said to me, "Why did you not come to me like a man? "—there was an altercation, and they hooted and pelted him, and he ran in doors.</p>

I knew nothing about my boy going to his place until about a week or two before the noise and talk that there was, and then the boy told me of it, and said that this gentleman's good lady had told him he had better go home now, and I told him he had better not go any more, he would be troublesome; I wanted to bring my children up a credit to me and themselves; they were ill for years; as regards his head, he used to pick it with his nails as he sat reading or sewing, there were three or four places. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not know that my wife did tell the boy that he had better go home—I cannot say how the places on his head came, but</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer, and live at No. 7, Colonnade, Brunswick-square. I have known the prisoner since May, 1854—he took a room from me in May, 1854, and staid there till June, 1855, and then he moved to Old Compton-street—I lived in the same house—I had the shop—the prisoner lived there with his five children—the woman did not live with him at first—she was lodging in the house with a woman in the first floor front—she afterwards lived with the prisoner, and moved with him to Compton-street—for the first three months they were at my house, the children were kept complete prisoners indoors, and were not allowed to go out for anything; then by my persuasion he did let them come down for about half an hour at a time—an old lady and one or two neighbours cried shame on him for keeping them so confined—he did several jobs for me, and I had a chance then of going up into his room, and I have frequently seen the deceased lad—he was a cripple, and very much knock-kneed—I tried to persuade the prisoner to let him go the hospital, but he would not—I have frequently seen him, when the lad has been at work, and has not done something to suit him, hit him on the knees with a hammer, and several times with a last—they were rather harder blows than I should like to have had—I have seen him throw the last across the room at them—they were kept very dirty—I think they had but very little food, for they were always picking up anything they could see in the street, and the neighbours all round were giving them something to eat—they were, as you may say, walking ghosts—I considered them quite starved—I never examined the deceased boy to see whether he had any sores about him.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there were originally some taint in the lungs, would the treatment that you have heard described aggravate that disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably, and would probably present the appearances I found—it would accelerate the death of the child—in fact, the only treatment for such patients is to give them as large an amount of nutritious food as they can possibly take; and, of course, the withholding it from such a child would accelerate his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try better diet, after he came in, under your treat<lb></lb>ment for any length of time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was put on the most nutritious diet that he could take, port wine and mutton chops, and I gave him cod liver oil—for about a fortnight he seemed somewhat to improve under that treatment, and then he fell back again, and rapidly declined, in fact, he was in a hopeless condition when he came into the workhouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—there was extensive disease—in my judgment, from what I saw of the child, from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and from the evidence I have heard of the treatment the child received, the neglect contributed to its death, it accelerated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other disease of a fatal nature except that of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the disease was entirely confined to the lungs—it is very difficult to state positively of what standing that disease was, the child had been expectorating <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> for five or six weeks before he came into the workhouse; and it is possible that tubercles might have existed in the lungs for a considerable period before that, for twelve months, or for two years—during all that time the child would have a tendency to be very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260074"></xptr>
               <p>much emaciated; there is always defective nutrition when tubercles exist in the lungs—there is always a wasting of the body, more or less, but not of that extreme kind, until the tubercles soften down, and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> is expectorated; of course, to expose such a child to the treatment described would be to aggravate the symptoms in every possible way—the girl has since died—the other children have improved very much indeed, wonderfully—at this time they are robust, and in good health—that would assist me in coming to a conclusion as to the state in which they had been kept—I apprehend that they have since had a better diet than a poor man's children would have—they were all suffering from hopping cough, and were, therefore, put on better diet than a man in the prisoner's circumstances could give them—they have had mutton diet and porter—I see no reason why they should not grow up robust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Q.</hi> You say they were covered with vermin, it was only their heads, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Their bodies were also covered with bites from vermin—the deceased child was ricketty from its birth, and that would grow from weakness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, made a statement of some length, but in a very feeble and indistinct voice; it was to the effect that for upwards often years he had been struggling through severe poverty and illness to support himself, his wife and family; that after his wife's death his troubles became heavier; his elder children were afflicted and could render him little or no assistance, and being a poor mechanic himself he could only do work of an inferior description, and earn small wages, from</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, when able to work; and with the aid of the person who, subsequently, came to live with him and take care of his children, about</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that nearly the whole of last winter he was laid up with rheumatic gout, and unable to work, and but for the assistance of charitable persons they must all have starved; that the children always partook of what he had; and as to the strawberries and fruit alluded to, it was purchased with a penny, and a halfpenny given to the children, and was eaten by themselves</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a housekeeper, and live at No. 4, Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square—I have known the prisoner from fourteen to eighteen years, before he was married—at that time we kept a shoemaker's shop in Kingsgate-street, Holborn, and he worked for us, and has done so, on and off, up to the present time—he was always a very poor workman and not able to do good work, but repairing, and what we term tenpenny work—the children were always in a very poor, sickly state, born and bred in starvation—they were always in a dreadful state of poverty, I have relieved them over and over again when they lived in Bedford-court, with a small amount, such as 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time, and a few old clothes—his poor wife then was in the greatest distress—I never knew him do anything wrong in all his life, he was always sober and honest, he would not have a loaf of bread if he could not pay for it—I had no idea there was anything amiss between him and his children—they have been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my shop with little jobs of work—his son James was a cripple, he had knock knees—he was in my shop a fortnight previous to this occurrence, and he then had the hooping cough dreadfully; in fact, all the children had it—the boy coughed so badly while he was at my shop that he was obliged to go out and go to the kerb—for the last few months they were very badly off, and were quite objects—I believe the hooping cough began in May or June—the prisoner used to earn from 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week with us some years back, but latterly,</p>

               <p>sometimes 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and some weeks we have hardly been able to give him anything to do, as our work has been of a better sort than it used to be—we always gave him some little thing to do whenever we could—for the last four or five years I do not think he has taken more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from me—he used to work for Mr. Mitchelmore, of Drake-street, who was very kind to him and gave him work, as I did, more out of kindness than anything else—I do not know what he earned there—last winter he had a very bad illness, and a bad cough, and was not able to do any work for a long time—some charitable ladies gave him relief, or I do not know what he would have done—on the Tuesday that this affair happened, I went to his lodgings, No. 17, Compton-street, and there was a mob of people outside—I saw Mrs. Ward, his landlady—she went with me to the inquest, and would have come here to day to speak for him, but she is ill—the prisoner's wife was a good, kind mother to the children, and he was, to all appearance, a fond, affectionate father, I was surprised at the clamour raised against him—I have never been inside their room at Compton-street since this woman has been living with him—I have been to the house with work, but did not go in, on account of the hooping cough, having a little child with me—I have not seen how the children were treated since the woman came.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen anything of then for two years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, I have never lost sight of them for two years—I have never been in their room since he left Bedford-court, that is about two years ago—I have a husband and children—my husband is not here—I generally pay the workmen—I believe the prisoner has been working for Mr. Taylor, a boot maker, in Lamb's Conduit-street—that is a good shop—he has not been constantly working for Mr. Taylor, he is not able to do good work—Mr. Taylor is a first class boot maker—I would have given him work if he could have done it—I never paid him more than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and he was not earning anything else then—for the last four or five years, I do not believe he has taken more than it. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from me, on an average, and in his illness he earned nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. WARBOYS</hi>. I knew the prisoner while he lodged in the same house, No. 7, Colonnade, Brunswick-square. I considered him a good father, and that he did his duty as far as he was able in supporting his children—the person who went to live with him lodged with me—I have occasionally been to his room—I have seen the children at meals—I do not know that they were treated so bad—I have times seen them sitting at meals with the prisoner when I have taken in jobs for him to repair—I have seen them taking part of the family dinner, the same as my own chil<lb></lb>dren—in my opinion, he acted as well a 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. father could be expected to acts according to his circumstances—he lay very ill last winter, and they would have starved, had it not been for some benevolent ladies and the woman that lived with him—she did not live with him then—she lodged with me, but she went to them from 9 o'clock in the morning till 6 in the evening, and she went to the parish to get relief for them, and to the Soup Kitchen, and also got tickets for coals—she is a shoe binder, but she could not do anything then, for she poisoned two of her fingers by attending to a bad head of one of the little boys, not the one who is dead—that was at the time the prisoner was ill, and under Dr. Piddock, of the Bloomsbury Dispensary—she did not take their food—she lodged and slept with me then—I believe it was asthma that the prisoner had—he had a dreadful cough—after they moved to Compton-street the children came occasionally</p>

               <p>to a person on the first floor, to borrow a last or some material to work with, and I saw them then—that is since July—they went away with the hooping cough—my little boy was confined with it at the same time, and I was told they had the scarletina when they got to Compton-street—the deceased boy had the hooping cough as well as the others—they caught it of a lodger in the house—while he was ill a lady in Montague-place used to send him boiled rice every day or every other day—I saw the deceased boy about three weeks before the prisoner was taken up—he came to bring home a pair of lasts that he had borrowed of a person named Woodifeld—that was the last time I saw him—he was always a delicate looking boy—I could not see anything frightfully worse about him then than there was when he lived in the Colonnade—he did not complain of want of food—they all had bad heads in the summer—Dr. Piddock said it was from poorness of blood—the boy was ricketty and weakly—I have repeatedly told the prisoner that he was in a consumption—I have had three cousins die of consumption, and he brought up congealed pieces the same as they did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What condition did the children appear to you to be in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pale and delicate—they were always thin—the girl was a stout, fine girl, and so was the little boy, when they left our house—I have seen her since she has been in the workhouse, and she looks worse now than she did when she left our place—I have never seen the deceased boy pick up things in the street—I have heard of it—I never heard any sounds of crying or beating, I lived down stairs at the bottom of the house—I have seen the prisoner fetch the children up stairs—I never saw him ill treat them—I saw him beat Emma once with a leather strap that he worked with—I never saw the boy beaten—I believe the boy was not beaten so much as the girl, because the boy was a good boy—the girl was a bad girl—the prisoner was not hooted away from the house—there was no mob there—I have never said that I should like to see him taken up for his cruelty to his children—I never said so to a Mrs. Parsons, nor anything of the sort—I said if he had beaten his daughter Emma, and she did not deserve it, he justly deserved the month that he was committed for—that was what I said—he had a month for an assault upon his daughter—I did not say so when he left the Colonnade—I never said so to Mr. Jones—the woman that lived with the prisoner, has slept with me for the last three nights, having no home to go to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. STANLEY</hi>. I live in the Colonnade, in the same house as the prisoner lived. I know the prisoner—I do not know any harm of him—I never saw him ill use the boy—I have seen the children at meals with them—they all sat down together, and had just the same as he had—they had a share of the same food that he had—he was very ill last winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

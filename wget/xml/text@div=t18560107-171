                  </hi>. My husband keeps a chandler's shop, in Sloane-street, Chelsea. On Saturday, 29th Dec., the prisoner came, about 9 o'clock in the evening, for half an ounce of tobacco—he paid me with a half crown—I weighed it, and told him it was not a good one—he said he was not aware of it—I asked how he came by it—he said he took it in payment for his work—I called my brother in law down stain, and he said he would go with the prisoner to where he took it—the prisoner said it was over West<lb></lb>minster-bridge—I said he was paid a long way off—he said, I might think what I liked; it would be a great loss to him—I gave my brother in law the half crown, and he gave it me again—I asked the prisoner if he could pay me with any other money—he said he had no more about him—he left the half crown, and went away—I laid the half crown on the tobacco shelf, and afterwards gave it to the officer—I am sure it was the same.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 22d of May, a little before twelve o'clock, I was in Basinghall-street, near the Bankrupt Court, which is about one hundred yards from Mr. Price's - I saw the two prisoners walking together; I am quite sure of their persons, but I did not see them speak - it appeared to me that they were in company; I watched them - they went down Basinghall-street some distance, towards London-wall, and then returned together - I saw them together just by Church-passage, which is right opposite Mr. Price's; I then went and stood in a door-way for a minute or two, then looked out at the door, and only saw Pike, who was walking backwards and forwards, a short distance, opposite the prosecutors' door; I then got just into the doorway again, looked out immediately again, and saw Smith with this cloth on his shoulder, in the middle of the road, about three or four yards from Mr. Price's door; he went up Church-passage - I then walked up towards Pike, who was standing opposite Mr. Price's house, looking towards the door; I saw a person who I knew, and said, "Just lay hold of him;" he then ran away - he must have heard me tell the person to lay hold of him; I then went up Churchpassage and laid hold of Smith with the cloth on his shoulder - I saw Pike again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; the person I desired to take him, brought him to the Justice-room where I had taken Smith - I am certain he is the person I had seen walking up and down; Mr. Price was sent for, and claimed the cloth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PIKE. He said at the office, that he and Mr. White had been watching us all the morning.</p>
               <p>Witness. I had seen them for an hour, or an hour and a half together, but missed them part of the time.</p>
               <p>MR. PRICE. This is our cloth - this is the paper it was in when taken; I know it by my own writing on the end of the paper, and here is the manufacturer's mark on it - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRICE, JUN. I am not in partnership with my father - I attend to his business; the length of the piece is marked in my hand-writing, "Nineteen yards" - I have not the least doubt of its being my father's, and on the paper is the figure 3, in my writing.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence (written). - I now stand charged with an offence I am as innocent of as a child unborn. I will endeavour to state the particulars as clearly as possible. About eleven o'clock I got leave from my master to take a walk, having nothing to do - I was to be at home by dinner-time. I went out, and wishing to see the new London-bridge, I went; and as I returned I stopped to look at a picture-shop. I remained there about five minutes; a respectable youth came up, and asked which way I was going - I said towards Long-lane. He then asked me to carry the parcel in question: not suspecting any thing wrong, I agreed to carry it, and he was to give me 1s. when I got to the end of Smithfield with it. I went up Church-passage, and was alarmed by the officer laying hold of me - I immediately told him how I got it; he said the less I said about it the better - he took me to Guildhall, and sent for a person who swore to the property. I hope you will consider it is a very serious case, as it affects my life.</p>
               <p>PIKE's Defence. I was looking after a situation, and called at the prosecutors' to inquire for one; I came out, went as far as the pump to get some water, heard a cry of Stop thief, and ran with other people; the officer said lay hold of him, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY to HERDSFIELD. Q. At what time did you first see them together - was it some time before? A. I had seen them together before it happened, but I had left them for an hour; I saw them together about ten o'clock, coming up Wood-street, with a boy, and followed them into Cheapside, Watling-street, Friday-street, and down the back streets, in company with each other - I then lost them, and went to Guildhall, and as I came into Basinghall-street saw them go by the Bankrupt Court; I followed them below the White Bear public-house, and then they returned.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PRICE. Q. At what time did Pike come into the warehouse? A. Near twelve o'clock - it might be half-past eleven.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Smith a good character.</p>

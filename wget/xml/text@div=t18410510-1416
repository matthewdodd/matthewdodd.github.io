                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, opposite Mr. Montgomery's, On the 28th of April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I went to look through my window, and saw the prisoner trying to get up the palings of Mr. Montgomery's yard—I saw him get down again and cross the road—he returned again in a few minutes with a stool—he stood on the stool, and moved the timber—he then got down again, and crossed the road with the stool, then returned again, took the timber on his back, and crossed the road in the same direction—I knew him before as a neighbour—in a few minutes I saw a policeman, and told him—my mother was ill, and I was up attending to her.</p>

Between one and two o'clock in the morning I was on my beat at Old Brentford, and saw the prisoner dressed in a fustian coat—I first saw him between twelve and one o'clock at the door of the Cannon public-house, in a state of intoxication—he lives about three hundred yards from Montgomery's yard—it was not light enough to recognize his person then—he had a fustian coat on.</p>

I was on duty in Old Brent-ford on the morning of the 28th of April, about a quarter before two o'clock—Chandler threw up her window, and said, "Policeman, I wish you had been here a few minutes before, a man has been across the road, taken a piece of timber, and gone up Spring-gardens with it"—I asked what sort of a man—she said, a short man in a white coat and a hat, and he was only gone a few minutes—I did not stop to ask more, but went in the direction she said he was gone, but could not find him—I returned to her, and asked her further particulars, and in the morning about half-past eight, I called on her, and asked her about it, and whether it was the man that lived at the corner house—she said the timber did not go far, but she did not satisfy me to tell me the name—I could not get the name—in a short time afterwards I went to the prisoner's house, which is across the road, opposite the timber yard, but did not see him—shortly after I returned, I went into his garden, got a spade, and dug the timber up—the prisoner was standing close by—I said to him, "Here it is"—he said, "Yes it is, I do not know how it came there, I did not put it there"—I had not charged him with putting it there—I said he must go to the station to answer for it.</p>

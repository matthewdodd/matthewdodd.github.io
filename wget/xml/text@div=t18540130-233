                  </hi>. I carry on business as a British wine merchant, at No. 15, Lower Whitecross-street. The prisoners have been in my employ, the man about four years and a half, and the woman about three years and a half—the man had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and the woman 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross, for washing bottles—I have several thousand bottles pass through my hands every year—in consequence of missing bottles, I applied to the police—the male prisoner had the key of my bottle warehouse—these bottles are my property—this one I know by a lucifer match being in it—I saw the bottles taken from the woman—after the man was taken, I saw him in the officer's custody; he came in the counting house to me—the officer stated the charge on which he was taken, and told him he was an officer—the man repeatedly asked me to forgive him, and said he would do anything in the world for me—he said to his wife, "It was you that <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done it all;" he then said, "She <hi rend="italic">egged</hi> me on"—the woman said to me, "What are you going to do with me? you can't transport me; I suppose, if I pay you, it will be all right."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). In consequence of information from the prosecutor, I placed myself on his premises on 16th Jan., about half past 7 o'clock in the evening—when I had been there about a quarter of an hour, I saw the female prisoner leave the bottle warehouse, and walk across to a marine store shop, having something very bulky under her dress—she went into the marine store shop, and returned back to the warehouse—she left the warehouse again, and on her way to the marine store shop I stopped her with a bundle—I told her I was an officer, and she must go back with me to the warehouse of Mr. Waters—she refused to go, saying she was going to take the bottles to get them washed—I compelled her to go beck to the counting house, and took these bottles from her—one or two of them were in her pockets; the principal part were in the front of her person—I placed her by the side of her husband, and told them they were charged with stealing bottles—the man said to the woman, "It is all your fault; I did let you have a few to-night, but you <hi rend="italic">egged</hi> me on it"—I told him it was not the first time; they had been continually doing it, and taking them to a marine store shop—I think there was no reply to that—I afterwards took the woman to the marine store shop—I saw the man and woman belonging to the shop—I asked them to produce the bottles which the woman had brought just before—the man pointed to eight bottles which stood on the counter, and said they were brought by a female, but he could not say who—he said they had been left there about half an hour, but they had not been paid for—about half an hour had elapsed between the time of the woman first going to the shop and the time I took her there—I did not see what part of the prosecutor's premises she came from on the first occasion, but on the second occasion she came from the bottle warehouse, and the man was in the bottle warehouse at the time she came out.</p>

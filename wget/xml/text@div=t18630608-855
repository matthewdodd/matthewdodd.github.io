                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, L</hi>). On Saturday, 25th May, I went to the prisoner's house—he keeps a general-dealer's shop, containing ropes and old metal of different descriptions—his name was not over the door—I found him at a public-house close by, and asked him if he had sold any copper bolts to Israel, who was with me—he said he had—I asked him how he became possessed of them; he said he bought them of a man named Morgan—I asked him if he had any in his possession—he said that he had not—I took him to Redcross-street, where he described Morgan to live, and asked Morgan if he had sold Green any copper bolts; he said he had not—Green said, "You sold me some to-day, and some yesterday"—I said, "You told me previously that you had not any more"—he said, "They are now behind the counter, part of them"—I said, "You told me you had no bolts"—he said, "You asked me the question, but I made no answer to it"—I took him to the station, and then went and searched his house, and found 6¼ lbs. of copper bolts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked with the broad arrow, but the marks have been effaced from some of them—they were part behind the counter and part in an adjoining room—I searched the house, and found a room fas<lb></lb>tened with a padlock—I did not go into it, but returned to the station, and the prisoner was searched by Serjeant Hart in my presence, and a key was handed to me—I asked him if the back room with, the padlock on it was his room—he said, "Yes"—I asked him to show me which key opened that door, and he pointed out the key—Sergeant Hart then went to the house, and brought me some metal of the same description as this—what Hart found is all in this bag—I asked the prisoner if he kept a book; he said no, he did not consider it necessary, as he was not a marine-store dealer—I said, "You are dealing in copper bolts; what do you call those but marine-stores?"—he said he did not consider he had any right to keep a book—on the following Thursday I went to Messrs. Bowes, wholesale dealers in marine-stores, and rag merchants, in Newington—I received 29 lbs. of metal there, 24 lbs. of which was stated to have been sold by Green—I found 11 3/4 lbs. of it which is marked with the broad arrow—I should say that 3 1/2 lbs. out of the 17 lbs. found in East-street was marked—there is marked metal in the lot found behind the counter, and in the lot in the padlocked room, and the remainder of it is defaced.</p>

Bowes, rag and bottle merchant, of Newing<lb></lb>ton-causeway—the prisoner need to bring different kinds of old metal to us—he was at my master's place on a Saturday towards the end of last month—I did not see what he brought; I had only half a sight of some copper which was there, as I was very busy—he said nothing to me, but the weight of the copper, 24 lbs. at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb. was called out to me—I booked it, and paid the prisoner 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it half an hour afterwards—I have not the book here, one of the principals was there—the copper was put away by itself, I believe, and Green left the shop—the police came three or four days afterwards and look away the copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the store-keeper's depart<lb></lb>ment of Deptford Dockyard—these 6 lbs. of copper bolts, found at the prisoner's house, have the broad arrow on them, and are the property of the Queen, as are these also, which have the marks defaced—the defacing is at the same distances down the bolt as the mark of the arrow usually is—this one (<hi rend="italic">a larger one than the rest</hi>) does not appear to be to the Queen's—those which come from Bowes have the Queen's mark on them, and on the greater part of them I see symptoms of the mark being defaced—the value of them is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—copper bolts are never sold from the dockyard; when too old to be used, they are sent to Chatham to be melted down and remanufactured.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

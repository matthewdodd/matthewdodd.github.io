               <p>Q. Did they regularly pay their lodging during that time? - A. Pretty well: on the 1st of January I went into the room, and found the bed furniture gone; I had her apprehended on the 2d.</p>
               <p>Q. You had charged her with it as long ago as August last? - A. The things were pledged, I believe, at that time; I did not miss them till the 1st of January; I missed the furniture from the bed, a tea kettle; and other things; the sheets are lost, through being in pledge beyond the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things part of the things you left to her? - A. Yes; she was to have the use of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you charge either her or him with this? - A. I have nothing to charge against him.</p>

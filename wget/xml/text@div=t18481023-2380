                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of Windsor-terrace, City-road. I discounted this bill about 16th May—I put it into a drawer in a desk in my first-floor front room, where I usually place bills—the prisoner was in my employ about June—he had access to that drawer—when it became due, I went to the desk, and it was gone—I afterwards found it in a Mr. Vernon's possession—the prisoner had no right to take it—he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>

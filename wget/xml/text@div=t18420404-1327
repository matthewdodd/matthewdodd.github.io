                  </hi>. I am a seaman, lodging in Limehouse-hole. On Thursday night, the 1st of April, I met Young near the Highway—I had never seen her before—I went home with her to a house—I do not know the house—I had never been there before—I saw Neil there the same night—we had some bread and cheese and ale—Neil's mother brought it—after that I was left with Young—I had a watch, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a silk-handkerchief—the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were in my right waistcoat-pocket—my watch was lying on the table in the room, and my clothes were on a chair in the same room, by the side of the table—I went to bed with Young, and was there all night—she went to the door for the purpose of fastening it before we went to bed—I do not know whether she did fasten it—I put my watch tinder my pillow when I went to bed—about half-past eight I got out of bed and partook of what bread and cheese and ale there was left—I looked at my watch and it was half-past eight—I counted my money and it was all right—I went to sleep again for about half an hour—I then awoke and missed my watch, chain, and handkerchief, and money—Young was standing in the room in a state of intoxication—she was dressed—I asked her what she had done with my watch—she said she had pawned it—I asked her what she had done with the money out of my waistcoat-pocket—she made no answer—I said I should give her in charge—she said I might do my best, I might do as I liked—I got a policeman directly—I know nothing of Neil, only seeing her with her mother the night before—I do not think she had any hand in it—I gave Young in charge—this is my watch, and this is my handkerchief, which was in my pocket that night.</p>

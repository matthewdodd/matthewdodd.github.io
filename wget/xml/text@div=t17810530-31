He d - ned his eyes and limbs, and used very violent expressions, and swore, if I did not let him go, he would cut me down with a stick. There was a hackney coach standing by: there were three men and a woman with him. He said to them, D - n your bloody eyes! why don't you get into the coach? He got from me, and they all got into the coach, and they drove off: I got on my box, and drove home to my master's. I have known the prisoner these five or six years.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with him? - Never in my life. I have known him, he having been a coachman, a post-boy, and su ch like.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your watch again? - No: On the Sunday I heard he was taken up for something else, and I went up to the Office in Bow-street the next day: he said he knew nothing of the watch.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he took your watch? - Yes: I felt it go out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you, when he came up? - He came up, and asked me, How do you do? put his hand under mine, gave me a shove, and took my watch out.</p>

               <p>This young man went in to drink with me: as we came out, there was a coachman going up Holborn; we asked him to take us into the coach. The prosecutor said he had lost his watch, and laid hold of me. I said, You are a stronger man than me; do not use me ill: if you think I have your watch, take me into the public-house, and search me, or give charge of me: the watch is over the way.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who had known him many years, and gave him a very good character.)</p>

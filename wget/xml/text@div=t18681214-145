In substance it was as follows: that one Robert Dalton, a labourer in his employ, being entitled to a share in some property left by one Henry Trimmer, having repeatedly urged him to advocate his claims, he was induced to make inquiries into the matter, and ultimately found the will in question in the cover of an old book, called the "Contra Book" amongst a number of papers belonging to Henry Trimmer, and that his wife and two sons were present when he found it. He also described the finding in a box of other documents, referred to and described in the evidence</hi>.</p>

               <p>of paper—this box was kept in a bed room which belonged to Trimmer: it was a room that was always kept for his own use—it was down stairs that I was talking with the Dalton's—they were with me, it might be, about two hours, or from that to three hours, on that occasion—we had a very long talk over the whole family matters—I was interested in the family, of course, knowing them all—Mr. Spong came on the Tuesday with Mr. and Mrs. Dalton—they introduced him to me as a friend of theirs, Mr. Spong; that is all I recollect of it—I told Mr. Spong all I knew about Henry Trimmer; his habits, and so on, as well as I could recollect—the Dalton's talked it over about the will not being a genuine will—they wanted Henry Trimmer's signature and writing to got their property—they said there was a good deal of property, and it was kept back from them—they did not say anything at that interview, to my recollection, about going up to London to see Woods' will—my husband was present on these occasions; he is rather deaf—Henry Trimmer came over a day or two before Christmas Day; I think it was the day before, and he went away on Christmas Day, in the morning—I can't recollect how he came; I did not ask him—he used to get a lift with the market people—he left on Christmas morning, and said he would come back again—I saw the Dalton's at Mrs. Christmas's, at Liphook, when we went there to meet Mr. Spong—they had not been to our house in the mean time—it was in April, 1847, as near as I can guess, when John Trimmer came over to our house, bringing the key of the box with him—he went up into the room where the box was; it was there, lying open—he might be there two or three hours, not in the room but down stairs, because he had some refreshment—when we first broke open the box it was full of old news-papers and different papers, and there were some old buckles, and a variety of things—there was no money, or plate, pictures, or jewellery—the buckles were old brass ones, that Mr. Trimmer used to wear in his shoes—the things did not amount to 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I turned over the papers in the box—I read some of the letters; I did not read any of the other things—I pushed them all in again till I took the papers out afterwards, and made a clothes box of it—I did not see an old will of Mary Trimmer's—the box was not corded or fastened up again; there it would have been, open to anybody who came into the room—I was not absent from my home for a day, from Christmas to February—I might have been for an hour or two, but I don't think I was.</p>

               <p>fetched the box down stairs, and took it into the room where they were—when the Daltons came on the previous occasion, they had not seen the box or the papers, only No. 1, which gave us the authority—when the box was brought down where the Daltons and Mr. Spong were, it was set in the passage, as they sat in the room adjoining—then I took the bandbox in, and showed Mr. Spong, and he said, "Will you allow me to take it away?" and it was put in the box and corded up, just as it was—it was never meddled with—there was no opportunity for the Daltons to put anything in the and box—the box was never touched after it was corded—my hus<lb></lb>band corded it.</p>

I am a farmer, living at Thursley, near Godalming, and husband of the last witness—I remember Henry Trimmer living with us; he left in the year 1846, about Christmas—he only stayed with us one day and night on that visit—I believe he came on the 24th, and left on the 25th, in the morning—I asked him to stop and spend the Christmas, but he said he must get back, to see his doctor; we had no doctor nearer than Liphook and Haslemere—I did not see him alive after that; he was never at our house afterwards—he had been there in the summer before, from ten to twelve weeks, I don't justly know—he was not in very good health, he always complained and coughed, and was very particular in what he ate—I remember this large box; it was left at our house when he went away, and it was at our house when he died, and for years after; it had not been moved before his death, it was never interfered with, he had the room to himself—after he left us at Christmas, I heard of his death, and after that I opened the box; it was looked, I did not know where to find the key; it appears that his brother John brought it afterwards; Henry Trimmer had taken it away with him—the box was left looked at our place—it was some time after his death that I broke it open; he had left that little note with Mrs. James, we both saw him write it, on our table, she got the paper for him to write it, and I considered the box was my property, and I broke it open; there was nothing in it particular; there were a few papers, and one thing or other in the box, all the lot of it was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; all the property there was not worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, there was no plate or jewellery—he owed me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lodging—I never looked at any papers then, I turned them out, I saw there was nothing of any consequence, and so off I went, and I never looked into the box for twenty-two years, till it was in Court—I remember receiving this letter of 15th October, 1867—up to that time I had not heard that Henry Trimmer had made a will and made me executor; he had always said he would see me righted, that was all I heard; I heard him say so many a time—I had lent him many a shilling and half-crown, if he wanted to go anywhere, and he has said "I shall never pay you, but I will make you amends some day or other"—I was at home when the box was taken away; I corded it up, and Dalton, and Mr. Spong, and Dalton's wife, I believe, took it away; they put it in a cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of conversation with your father, at any time, do you ever recollect his saying anything to you about having witnessed a will of Henry Trimmer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, or saying anything about a will of Trimmer's—I have some slight recollection, I think, of hearing my mother speak of it; that must have been at the time he was ill—I cannot recollect what the conversation was—my mother's signature purports to be to this will—it is my belief that it is my mother's signature—I don't think anything was mentioned about a will, in the first place, when Mr. Spong called on me at Netley—the desk belonged to my father, my mother had access to it, of course—it was nearly full of papers—I did not make so careful a search the first time as I did the second—I merely looked over the papers in the first place—there were several tied up in bundles, small rolls; I just gave a cursory examination of them, that was all—it was a square writing desk, with two flaps, with receptacles for papers—I took the bill out of the largest compartment, I think, the lower one—there was no drawer underneath—it must have been the upper one, the part that opens towards you—we were sitting nearly side by side—I believe I did not say at the Probate Court that I thought it was I that found the paper—I recollect being cross<lb></lb>examined by Dr. Deane—I think he asked me who found it, and I said, "Mr. Spong"—I don't recollect saying, "I think it was me"—I might have said so, but I think not—I do not recollect Mr. Serjeant Ballantine asking me how I came to find it—I recollect saying, "We were searching, both of us"—I was asked if anybody had access to the desk except myself since my father's death, and I said, "I believe not," my sister had access to it after<lb></lb>wards, at least, she could have gone to it, I was away at the time—I see what purported to be my mother's signature on the back of this bill of ex<lb></lb>change—I believe it is hers—I see the words "Mine Curtis' money"—my mother was entitled to some money under Curtis' will—I think that is my mother's writing, as well as the signature—the word looks more like, "Mine" than anything else—my mother's maiden name was Curtis, her Christian name was Sophia—she had money through the will of her father.</p>

               <p>

(Looking through them</hi>) Well, there is a difference in the "b," the "b" is looped—they seem to me to be in the same handwriting—I don't see much difference—they are nearly alike—the "b" is not looped in that document—I don't see one with the "b" looped, except in the will and No. 2—I am a journeyman coachmaker—I see the signature, "Sophia Kimber," to No. 3—(No. 3 <hi rend="italic">was as follows</hi>: "1847, Feb. Mr. James, one of mine exetors, to have and keep all my own papers and books. Henry Trimmer. Witness Sophia Kimber. The mark of X Rachel Young.") I do not know whether that is my mother's writing, it looks too good for hers—the signature to the will does not look too good—I don't consider the signature on the will is so good as this—I still think the signature to the will is in my mother's handwriting, but not to No. 3, it seems rather too good—the "S. Kimber" on the back of the bill appears to me to be in the same handwriting as the "Sophia Kimber" to the will, with the exception of the "b;" there is a loop in the "b" in the will, there is</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Queen Street, Portsea, and am a saddler—my father was a saddler before me—he died in February, 1855—I am the only son and personal representative—the will of Henry Trimmer in favour of my father, dated May, 1844, was proved by the advice of Mr. Parnell—I was the defendant in the suit in the Probate Court, tried in April last—I was ex<lb></lb>amined as a witness—I was present during the trial—this indorsement of the bill of exchange,"1847, June. Received all the money that is due, by cash, from Mr. Kimber. George Woods," is not in my father's handwriting, it is nothing like it—I have here a number of bills signed by my father—occasionally my mother used to sign letters in my father's name—I have some of her writing here—the signature, "George Woods," on the back of the bill is not my mother's writing of my father's name—it is intended to imitate it—it is something like my mother's—these initials, "G. W.," are intended for my mother's, but they are not like it—there is a marked difference to me.</p>

I am a solicitor, at 13, South Square, Gray's Inn—I was formerly a member of the firm of Pritchard &amp; Sons, of Doctors' Commons—I have been solicitor for all the White family, and for all the Trimmer family—I was also solicitor acting for the two executors, Mr. Christmas and Mr. Edmund James, in the suit in the Probate Court last April, in propounding the will of December 1846—I was first consulted by the White family, in December, 1863, after the death of the tenant for life, John Harriot—Dalton and his wife came to me then—he is a journey<lb></lb>man brewer, or a brewer's man—he can sign his name, but I don't think he could do much more than that—his wife can neither read nor write—none of the White family can read or write—Mr. Christmas and Mr. Trussler can both write a little, sign their names, and write a little, but very imperfectly—Dalton was recommended to me by a client—I did not know the prisoner Spong at all when Dalton came first—I first became acquainted with him at the end of January, 1867—Dalton and his wife called and asked me if I would see a gentleman and explain to him what was being done in the various proceedings in Chancery that I had instituted—I said "Yes," and in consequence of that, Mr. Spong called upon me—he gave me his address—he said he was an agent in this country for Tooth, the brewers, in Australia, or he mentioned their names as having business with them—I did not know then that Dalton had been in his em<lb></lb>ployment; I know it now—I knew it from about the time Spong came to me—I explained to him the course I had taken in the Chancery proceed<lb></lb>ings which I had instituted and had the carriage of, and I also explained to him that I had been accustomed in all these proceedings to confer with Mr. Chalcraft, the defendant's brother, that now he was dead these parties had behaved in a way that I considered unjustifiable, and therefore I declined to communicate with them, and I told them they must find some gentleman with whom I could communicate, or else I should tell them nothing—after that I always communicated through Spong on the business of this property in the Chancery suits—I was dissatisfied with all the White family—they reside at the foot of Sir William Erle's property, at Liphook, and they went to him, and made representations to him about this will, which I was very much annoyed at, and after that I would not do anything for them—I heard of the will of 1844 being proved—when I filed my bill in 1844, I searched the Probate Court and I could find no proof of Henry Trimmer's will being proved, and I alleged that he had died intestate—I applied in April, 1866, for letters of administration to the legatees of Henry Trimmer, and then I found that the will of Henry Trimmer had been proved by Mr. Woods—I did not see the will itself, but I saw a copy of it—I saw it was attested by Mr. Parnell, and I saw him and Mr. Woods upon the subject—I afterwards saw the prisoner, but I saw the Whites first—I did not mention about that</p>

               <p>will to the prisoner until the April twelvemonth after—I told him that Mr. Parnell meant to insist upon the will, and I had given him the necessary information, in Chancery, for him to come in and prove—the citation in the Probate Court bears date, 5th November, 1867—that was the commencement of the suit—I did not employ Spong to make in<lb></lb>quiries in any way or in any manner; nor did I pay him—on 15th October I received this letter from the prisoner—it is the letter that informed me of the discovery of the will—a copy of the will was enclosed in it—I saw him on the 16th—he then brought the will itself—he told me he had found it in the book called the contra book—I received the contra book the next day—this is the letter I received from him (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Bradbourn Vale, Sevenoaks, 14th October, 1867.

I will see that you have a copy of the document to-morrow; and, if possible, I will run up and see you about I o'clock. Yours faithfully, John Spong.")—He came up the next day, and brought the will and the contra book—I received these documents, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, from the prisoner, on 5th December 1867—1, 2, and 3, were given in evidence at the Probate Court; number 4 was not—it was in my brief, and part of my case—this old book of Mr. Beales' was given in evidence—I received it on 10th December, from the prisoner—I received a copy of this bill of exchange on 11th April, 1868, and, on the 17th, the first day of the trial, I received the original from Mr. Spong, and that was given in evidence—I was conducting the suit for the plaintiff in the Probate Court—the plaintiffs case was finished, and witnesses were called for the defendant—after some of the witnesses for the defendant had been called, the counsel withdrew from the case—that was on the fourth day—the prisoner's wife was not examined, but she was in Court the third day, or the fourth day: I think it was the morning of the fourth day—Dalton was called—I told him to be in the way, but he purposely got out of the way, and we could not bring him into Court—his name was called out—he was sent for and found, but he would not come into Court—Mrs. Dalton was called and examined as a witness by our counsel—I saw Mr. Debenham, the solicitor—he was one of our witnesses—I sent for him and he came at my request on the second day—he brought the deeds and papers with him, containing Joseph Kimber's signature—Mr. Chabot attended as a witness for us—he was not called—he saw the deeds and papers brought up by Mr. Debenham—I requested him to do so; I did not look at them myself—I went down with Mr. Chabot to Hedley, to see the marriage register—that was on Tuesday, the 21st; after the second day's trial—with the exception of the will and the documents numbered 1, 2, and 3, no handwriting of Joseph and Sophia Kimber's was given in evidence in support of the plaintiff's case—the marriage register, which has been produced to-day, was not put in evidence by us: I did not think of it until after the trial had begun—I did not receive these papers from the prisoner—I received these from Mr. Curtis, of Hedley, the bill of exchange and this account—Mr. Curtis is the brother of Sophia Kimber—he is very ill indeed; bed-ridden—we could not think of bringing him up to the Probate Court—I did not speak to the prisoner about these—I gave them to Mr. Chabot—I received these on 15th January, 1868, and another document that was with it, the</p>

B. and W. M." in the left hand corner—finding the word "Exc.," it put me to inquire, and I went down to Farnham to see what trace I could find of it—that, in the ordinary mode in an office, is to show that it has been examined—I did not find any of the parties—I went to Hollis and Mason's, they took some trouble to find it out, but I did not get any evidence through them that I have to day that it was Avenall's handwriting—Mr. Spong suggested that I should advertise for the parties—my clerk was engaged for several weeks making inquiries—he has gone to Canada—he left some few months ago, or he would have been here—I did not make any inquiry with regard to the person who wrote the body of that will—my clerk did all that, and witnesses were examined to prove it—the will was shown to Mr. Restall and he at once said "That is my schoolfellow, John Avenall's handwriting."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographer, of 25, Southampton Row, Russell Square—I have for many years made handwriting a study, and have con<lb></lb>stantly been consulted by the Treasury, the War Office, the Post Office, in various public cases—I was consulted by Mr. Pritchard, the attorney for the plaintiffs in the action in the Probate Court—before the trial I examined the documents 1, 2, 3, and 4, and also the will of December, 1846—I attended in the Probate Court for the purpose of being called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiffs, but I knew they would not call me, from my report—I had examined and reported—I was not called—before the trial I had this book, containing various entries in Trimmer's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">The one produced by Mr. Beales</hi>)—I had it from Mr. Pritchard—I also saw some papers which purport to be written by Joseph and Sophia Kimber—there was considerable writing of Joseph Kimber's, but very little of Sophia's—I saw some parchment deeds at Westminster, produced by Mr. Debenham—I also saw this small book, and all the signatures in it—the book produced by Mr. Beales contains a great number of entries by Henry Trimmer—I can identify his handwriting a very great way through the book, down to October, 1842—they are trade entries—I do not believe the signature "Henry Trimmer' to document No. 2. is in Trimmer handwriting, that is my opinion—I can give my reasons—the body of No. 3, I do not believe is in Trimmer's writing—I say the same of No. 4, no part of it—the initials, "H. T.," I am quite certain are not his writing—they are particularly objectionable—I say that of the whole of No. 4—I have looked at the writing in the inside lining of the box, "In country book, my own will, H. T."—certain parts of that are certainly not in Trimmer's writing—I cannot speak of it all, but I have no belief that any of it is his—I have taken it all, and copied the short<lb></lb>hand as well—there are the words, "In country book, my own will, H. T."—I doubt the whole of that—I could not take a particular word—if I saw nothing but "My own," I could not tell, but judging from the words "Country book," and the initials "H. T.," and assuming it was all written by one person, I judge from those parts, that taking it as a whole, it is not in the handwriting of Trimmer—the signature of "Henry Trimmer" is a very easy signature to imitate; having got over the capital letters, the rest is very readily imitated, so as to pass, so as to deceive any ordinary person—any person acquainted with his writing would be deceived with it—in the lid of the box there is the word "key" or "keep," I think it is "key," and following that there is something which I cannot decipher; but the capital K in "key" is unlike the "K" that is made by Trimmer, but it corresponds with the notion of making the capital K as in the word "Kimber" in the signature of the attesting witness to the will, and in document No. 2—it is a capital "K"—in one essential particular it differs from Trimmer's "K," but it agrees with those two—so I say of the small "k" in the word "book," there is the same objection to be made—it is quite opposed to Trimmer's mode of making a "k," but it agrees with the "k" in two matters upon which I have not yet been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140089"></xptr>
               <p>examined, that is, it agrees with the "k" as found in Kimber's writing at the top of the bill of exchange, and with Sophia Kimber's at the bottom—neither of them make the "k" as it is made there—I mean in substance this: that the "k" on the lid of the box, and the "k" in Kimber's writing at the back of the bill, and the "k" in Sophia Kimber's writing at the bottom of the bill, might all be the production of one person, but the "K" in Kimber is different from the mode in which Sophia Kimber makes it, and the "K" in "Joseph Kimber" is different from the way in which he makes it, and they are different from each other—I say they are not made by the persons assigned to them, because each of them make theirs differently—there is some short-hand on the box, just underneath the words "J. Neale's will," that is, as I read it—I believe it to be only a make-believe short-hand—I don't believe it is short-hand at all—I don't believe anyone can decipher it—they are short-hand characters, but they have no meaning: for instance, there are three crosses following each other; I cannot conceive what meaning that can have; again, there art three per<lb></lb>pendicular strokes following each other; that cannot be consistent with any system of short-hand—I have studied short-hand writing myself—I cannot follow a speaker, but I write two different systems, and understand the principles of short-hand perfectly well—I have studied different systems—I have formed an opinion as to the signatures of Henry Trimmer to No. 2, No. 3, and to the will—I cannot speak with any degree of strength—I believe them not to be the same signature as the signature to the original will, but from so few signatures I cannot speak with any degree of strength—if I had nothing else to pass an opinion upon, I should decline giving an opinion, but being assisted by other matters I am just enabled to say that is my belief—I believe the signatures to the will of 1846 are not genuine signatures, but if I had those signatures given me independently of anything else I would not give an opinion about them—the signature of Joseph Kimber to the will and to document No. 2 are perfectly identical, and undoubtedly written by the same person—I have compared those with the deeds and papers produced by Mr. Debenham, and also with docu<lb></lb>ments K 1, K 2, and K 3, C., and several signatures in the memo<lb></lb>randum book, I dare say twenty or twenty-five genuine signatures altogether—all those produced as the genuine signature of Joseph Kimber appear to be identical; he writes his signature remarkably in one way; he seems to me only to know how to write it in one way, like indifferent writers; they commonly write it in one way—a good writer varies his writing a little more or less, according to the instrument he writes with—I have the strongest opinion that the Joseph Kimber on No. 2, and on the will, is not the handwriting of Joseph Kimber—I cannot express my opinion too strongly on that point; it was that signature which so shook my faith in the case for the plaintiffs in the Probate Court—I have also ex<lb></lb>amined the signature, "Sophia Kimber," to No. 3, and to the parchment will, and also the "S. Kimber" on the lower part of the back of the bill—I believe that was all written by the same person, all written by one hand—I have seen some of the genuine writing of Mrs. Kimber, and I have also seen her writing in two places in the marriage register as Sophia Curtis—I believe the writing to No. 3, the attestation to the will, and the writing at the bottom of the will, are not the genuine handwriting of Sophia Kimber—but there, again, if I were examined only upon those points, unassisted by other matters, I should hesitate to express an opinion; still, it is my belief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140090"></xptr>
               <p>that they are not; there are reasons upon which I found my belief—in my judgment the word "Curtis" on the back of the bill, and the signature "Sophia Curtis" in the register, are not written by the same person—I speak decidedly stronger on that point than the other matters; than the signatures; that is clear to my mind: I have no hesitation about that—the "Sophia Curtis" in the two places in the register are evidently written by the same person; they will bear the closest comparison—I was taken down to Hedley to see the register, while the trial was going on—I have looked at the back of this bill of exchange—the words, "George Woods" and the initials "G. W." are, undoubtedly, not in the genuine handwriting of George Woods—I have seen a number of documents produced by Mr. Woods' son, in his father's handwriting, quite sufficient to enable me to form an opinion; I speak confidently as to that—I have seen some of the writing of Mrs. Woods, her writing of her husband's name, "George Woods" and "G. W."—these words and initials on the back of this bill appear to be imitations of her writing.</p>

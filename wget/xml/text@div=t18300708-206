I lost a pair of shoes from there, which I had to keep - I saw them again about ten days ago at a pawnbroker's, and knew them by the make; I had seen them safe about March - they belonged to Mr. Warland; I have my shoes made by the same man - they came from Leek, in Staffordshire; the prisoner was in my service, at "boots" he left me about a month ago; I missed the shoes when he was gone, and a great many other things.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WARLAND. I left these shoes in the care of the prisoner in January last - these are mine; I went to a situation, and sometimes did not go there for a fortnight.</p>

               <p>CHARLES BATH. I am a pawnbroker. I took in these shoes from the prisoner on the 20th of March.</p>

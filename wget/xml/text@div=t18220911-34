On the 12th of August, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I told the landlord I would lie down a little while. The prisoner lodged in the same room. The sovereign was in my purse, with a sixpence; the purse was in my pocket when I lay down; the prisoner called me, saying it was a quarter past two; I put my waistcoat on, and found my purse gone. There are several lodgers in the house. I found the purse in the room, but not the sovereign. He had left the house, and did not return; he was taken a week afterwards; he had not said he was going to leave. I told him nobody else could have done it; he said he would give me two for it when he got a ship.</p>

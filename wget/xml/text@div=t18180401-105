On the 1st of April, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, it was daylight; Mr. Platt called me up and said, our larder had been robbed, and he had got one of the men; I found the prisoner at the watch-house; Mrs. Brown was in bed at the time; all the family were in the house. I lost 28lbs of mutton and beef, and a cheese, worth 8s.; I did not go to bed until twenty minutes after three that morning, as the family had been to the Opera; I was the last person up; the larder is attached to the dwelling-house-it is under the same roof, and part of the house. When I went to bed, I fastened all the doors - I bolted the larder door, the key was left in it. In the morning the cook missed the meat. They got over the area and dropped down, and then unlocked the door, and went in.</p>

When I came up to him, he said, a man gave him a piece of mutton to carry the bag; I took him to the watch-house with the bag, it contained beef, mutton, and cheese; he was running. I called the butler up.</p>

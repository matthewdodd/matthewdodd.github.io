                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Twickenham. On the 1st of August I went to Orleans-house, at Twickenham, to see Mr. Kinghorn—it is a gentleman's house—he paid me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land note, and afterwards went with me to the Rising Sun, near Sandcome-lane, about six o'clock in the evening—I had refreshment there, and remained till about nine—I paid for what I had by changing a sove<lb></lb>reign—I left my friend there—I had occasion to go out—I met the female prisoner near the house, and walked up Sandcome-lane with her, and * * * * * I had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the silver which I had received in change in my left-hand breeches' pocket—I was not on the ground—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "There is a policeman" and ran away—I lost sight of her—when I afterwards went to pay for something further at the public-house, I missed my silver, and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I gave information of my loss to the person I was with, and also to the police—I had noticed the name of Symonds on the note, and "1-7-42" written along the middle—I am sure the female prisoner is the woman I was with—she did not stay to make any demand for any thing.</p>

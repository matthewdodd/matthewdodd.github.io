                  </hi>. I am a gold-beater, and live in Woodbridgc-street, Clerken well. I have bad dealings with the prisoner some years, and occa<lb></lb>sionally took his own acceptance from him—I received this Bill of Exchange for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one of his workmen, with a message from his master—I gate the money for it to the prisoner himself, at his own door—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, President-street. I know the prisoner—the acceptance to this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—is not in my handwriting—I did not authorize the prisoner, or anybody, to accept the bill in any way what<lb></lb>ever.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From a boy—I believe him to be gaining his livelihood respectably—I always had a high opinion of him—he has unfortunately failed in business lately—I dare say that is the reason the bill has not been paid—our first transaction together was an application by me for a loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "I can get your bill discounted," and he drew one on me, and accepted it in my name—I met him by accident in the street—he said it would save the trouble of sending to my house, he would accept it for me, and he did—after that he accepted several other bills—I do not know the amount—they were all pre<lb></lb>sented at my bouse for payment, and all paid by him—I know they were accepted in my name after they were made payable at my house—I did not notice my name on any notice left at my house, but I found out that it was so—he might imagine that he had authority to accept in my name—I made a communication to him at one time not to accept any more in my name—he had no written communication about it till after this bill was accepted—I wrote to him some time before this, but the formal notice to him was given on the 3rd of Jan.—I sent him the notices of the bills in one or two instances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to a fruiterer, at Walworth. On 31st Jan. the prisoner came between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening to purchase two oranges; I served her, they came to a penny—she offered in payment a shilling; I called Mr. Witham, my master, I gave the shilling into his hand—I had tried it with my teeth, and considered it was bad.</p>

The last witness called me on the evening of the 31st Jan., he asked me to look at a shilling which he thought was bad; I looked, and said it was bad—the prisoner was there, she said she did not know it was bad; it was what she had been taking for work she had been taking home, and she was a dress-maker—I said I knew her face, she had been in my shop last week; and after she was gone I found she had given me a bad shilling—I sent for a constable, gave the shilling to him, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

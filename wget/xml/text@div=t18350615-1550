                  </hi>. I am a drummer in the artillery. On the 4th of June, I was at Woolwich, and had a knapsack, containing the articles stated in the indictment—I went to bed that evening, and had it safe then—the prisoner belongs to the same company as me—I did not see him that evening—I missed the knapsack next morning—these are ray articles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, of Woolwich. At half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 5th of June, I received information, and went into Pig's-alley—I found the prisoner with this knapsack—I charged him with stealing it—he was putting the knapsack to rights—I took him in charge—he made his escape from me, and ran away—I ran after him, and secured him, with the knapsack and these articles in it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I escaped from him, because he would not let me go to the barracks—I went into the barrack-room to fetch my own things—it was dark, and I took these by mistake—I left my own instead of them behind.</p>

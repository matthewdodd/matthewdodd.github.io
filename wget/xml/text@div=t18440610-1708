                  </hi>. I am librarian to the Horticultural Society of London—their office is in Regent-street—the prisoner was in their service for nearly fourteen years—he was authorized to receive subscriptions, and had done so frequently—he was either to account to me for the money, or, in my absence, to Mr. Davis, the accountant—we have exhibitions of botanical subjects, and have tickets for admission, which are issued to subscribers and fellows—the prisoner had received money for these tickets occasionally, and it was his duty to pay it at once to me or to Mr. Davis—Mr. Thomas Ansell, of Camden-town, was a subscriber of four guineas—there are prizes of various amounts given to the competitors for flowers,—there was a silver medal worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to Mr. Ansell—I had prepared twenty-four tickets for Mr. Ansell, in April—I understood they were to lay on the place appointed for them on my desk, till they were sent for—on the 10th of April the prisoner did not account for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as having been received from Mr. Ansell—Mr. Ansell being entitled to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that being deducted from his subscription, there would have been 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming, but no such sum has been received—on the 7th of May I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner, as having been received as part of the money for the twenty-four tickets—my attention was at first called to the absence of these twenty-four tickets about the 27th or 28th of May—I had missed them, and made inquiries of Mr. Ansell—(the prisoner had left our service on the 11th of May)—I sent for the prisoner—he came on the 29th—I told him twenty-four tickets belonging to Mr. Ansell were missing, and, to my surprise, on sending to Mr. Ansell, I found he had the tickets, that he had paid for them, and that he had paid the balance of his subscription also—I urged upon him the impropriety of his conduct, and asked what he had to say—he immediately said, "I have received it," or "I acknowledge I have received it," and expres<lb></lb>sed great sorrow—he said, "I have lost a portion of it; I have been very ill, otherwise I would have brought it to you"—I said he ought to have commu<lb></lb>nicated the circumstances to me—he said he did not like to come and tell me till he had made up the sum—having only his verbal communication, I re<lb></lb>quested him to put it down in writing, which he did—he acknowledged having received the money, and wrote it on this paper—I then said I would give him till five o'clock that afternoon to bring the money, or I must report him—he</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">gardener and nurseryman, Camden-town.</hi> I am a sub<lb></lb>scriber to the Horticultural Society, and have been so for years—on the 10th of April I saw the prisoner—my subscription was due—it was four guineas—I had been entitled to a medal—a deduction was made of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my medal, and I paid the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew that a show was coming on, and had some conversation with the prisoner about the tickets—I was entitled to twenty-four—I said that his brother had made application for six of the tickets, and I had consented to it—I called at the office in Regent-street, but did not get my tickets owing to some meeting being there—on the 4th of May the prisoner saw me at Covent-garden market—he had eighteen tickets in his pocket, which would come to three guineas—when I was about settling for these tickets, he said on looking over the book he found I was entitled to 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the medal instead of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was proposed to make me this allowance on this occasion, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards received a communica<lb></lb>tion from Scott.</p>

            . The sash over my drawers was broke; it had a hole big enough to admit a little boy to pass through; it had been broke ten days before, and had not been mended. The street door was shut when I went to bed; I found it open when I got up. I went to the watch house: there I found the prisoner in custody of the watchmen; he was taken to Bridewell: upon searching him, only eighteen pence was found upon him, and a knife.</p>

            . I was alarmed by Mr. Richardson. There was a box in Mr. Moser's house, that was brought there to go by the waggon, that had been, over night, put under the desk in the counting house. The desk where I had put my money was standing open; the money Mr. Moser speaks of was lost out of the other desks; it was there over night; and, in the morning, this box, which was under one of the desks in the counting house, was gone out of that place. I heard the man was in custody; I went back to the house, and staid till Mr. Moser came. The box that was lost out of the counting house, was found by somebody in the street, who gave it to me.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Mr. Richardson; I keep the Three Cups, opposite the prosecutor. I went to bed a little after twelve. I happened to look out of the window, and saw three or four men under it, and a little boy; they were swearing together: they crossed the street, and went to Mr. Moser's house: presently after that, I saw a light pass through the pane of glass over the door. I was alarmed; I went to my father, and called him; he got up, and opened his sash; then we saw this light: we went down stairs; I went along the street to see for a watchman, but found none: I came back again towards the house, and observed Mr. Moser's door was open. As I passed along, just as I came up to Mr. Moser's house back again, I saw three or four men and a woman run out of his house; one had that box in his hand which was afterwards picked up in the street; I ran after them, and caught the man that had the box: he dropped the box; we scuffled together; he, at last, wounded me in the back; I let him go, and he got away: my father caught the prisoner at the bar. When my father and I came down to the gate of the house, I saw three or four men, and a woman, go into the house, before I went to look for a watchman; and am very sure the prisoner was one of those that came out of the house when I came back. I was not gone above three minutes, in which time they got into the house, and rushed out again. As soon as I saw this man come out of the house, I gave the alarm to my father, and desired him to stop him; I ran after the man that had the box. As soon as that man that I engaged had got away, I saw my father engaged with the prisoner, and he had got him upon the ground. At the time this man ran out of the house, my father was not farther from Mr. Moser's door, than three or four houses.</p>
               <p>- Richardson. I live almost opposite; at the Three Cups. I got up at my son's alarm; I opened a window, and, looking at Mr. Moser's house, saw three or four people, with a woman among them, at Mr. Moser's door; I dressed myself, and opened the gate. In two or three minutes time, I saw Mr. Moser's door open, and two or three people rush out into the middle of the street: I pursued them about thirty or forty yards from the house, and overtook the prisoner. I am sure he is one of the men, for I had not my eye off him all the time, from his coming out of the house, till I laid hold of him. The constable came up; I gave him in charge, and they took him to the watch house.</p>

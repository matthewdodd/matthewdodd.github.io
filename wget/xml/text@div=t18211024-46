            . I am overseer of Christchurch. On the 6th of October the prisoner came to me respecting some clothes. I said I could give him none without an order from the churchwarden. He went away, and returned in about an hour, with a written order, as I supposed, from the churchwarden. I produce it. It was signed in Mr. Seward's name. I then gave him an order for a pair of shoes (looks at it), this is it. Since I gave it to him the figure 2 has been substituted. I merely said in it - pair; somebody has put in 2 - (read). Mills afterwards produced this order to me. I immediately sent for an officer, and had him apprehended.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and furnish the parish with shoes; I live in Newgate-street; the prisoner came on the 6th of October with this order from the parish, for two pair of shoes. I fitted him with them, but did not allow him to take them away, suspecting the order. I sent my boy to Claridge. I asked the prisoner where Mr. Claridge lived - he said at No. 16, Warwick-square. He offered to go with the boy to shew him, said the order was perfectly correct, and wanted to take them. He went out with the boy.</p>
               <p>MR. A. SEWARD. I live at No. 18, Warwick-lane. The order which bears my name is entirely false.</p>

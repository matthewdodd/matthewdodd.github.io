                  </hi>. I am pot-boy to Thomas Hayes, who keeps a beer<lb></lb>shop, at Sydenham, Kent. On the afternoon of the 20th of April, I was in a cow-shed at the back of master's house, and saw the prisoner go to a cellar and bring a bucket and bottle, take it to the pig-sty, and conceal it, then return to the brewhouse, take a pint pot, and return to the cellar again—there was about three pots of beer in the bucket altogether—he brought some beer out in a pint pot, and offered it to a man named Darby, who said, "I shan't have that," and he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it away against the coal-shed—I told master, and the prisoner was given into custody—I saw the bucket and the beer in the sty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked him if his name was William Wood—he said, "Yes "—I said, I apprehended him for stealing beer from Mr. Hayes—he said, "Arn't you going to take more of them from work?"—I said no, there was no more—he then said, "There was more concerned in it than me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not go into the cellar at all; I was drinking rum at the time it happened; Mrs. Hayes lent us the money to get the rum; I did not go into the cellar except when she sent me to draw beer, because she would not awake the baby; he swore at first he saw Darby go into the cellar; I was not given in charge till next day; they gave other men in charge that night, but he then said it was not me at all; there was only five pints, not three quarts; the boy could not see me go, because the pig<lb></lb>sty is not level with the cow-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 118). On Sunday, 11th April, I was on duty in Greenwich, about 7 o'clock in the evening, near the pier. I saw the prisoners with three others at the pay office, where people take steam boat tickets—they surrounded a gentleman at the pay box, and after hustling him about a little, left him—they all five went into the main road and talked together about five minutes; they then returned on to the floating pier—Beale and two others went towards the head, and Thompson and another towards the stern, bustling to and fro—one of them, not in custody, who was towards the stern, beckoned with his hand to the other three—I then saw the prosecutor, and they all five surrounded him, as he was endeavouring to go on board a steam boat—Thompson had a coat on his right arm—I saw his left arm drop, caught hold of it, and said to the prosecutor, "Have you lost your watch?"—I kept hold of Thompson's hand, he caught hold of me by the neck-handkerchief, but it gave way, and I threw him on the pier, on his back—I held his hand so tight that the glass of the watch, which was in his hand,</p>

               <p>broke, and cut his hand—it was taken from him—Beale was covering Thomp<lb></lb>son, and would have received the watch, if I had not been close behind him—I saw nothing attached to the watch, but taw part of a guard on the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's neck, and the rest of it in Thompson's right hand—I handed Thompson over to sergeant Carpenter, who handed him over to Taylor—I went on board the boat, and pointed out Beale, who had got on board—I could not clearly identify the others.</p>

On Sunday, 11th April, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was in Greenwich-park, and saw the prisoner and three or four others with them—I watched them, and missed them all in a moment—I went down the street to the pier—I saw Crouch on the floating pier with Thompson—he said, "This man has stolen a watch of this gentleman"—I spoke to the prosecutor, and got this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him—I examined Thompson's hand, it was bleeding—he said it had been kicked by Crouch—said, "That is impossible, as it is a very sharp cut"—it was such a cut as might be produced by broken glass, not by a kick—the glass of the watch was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Greenwich on Easter Sunday; I went to the pier to go on board, and missed my watch, which I had seen safe five minutes before—it was secured by this steel chain, which was as perfect then as ever it was—I afterwards saw part of it in Thompson's hands, and part was left round my neck—I saw the handle of my watch in Thomp<lb></lb>son's left hand—Crouch got him on the floor, and the glass was broken in the struggle—I saw my watch taken from his hand; it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the chain—I am sure Thompson is the man—I did not see the other men.</p>

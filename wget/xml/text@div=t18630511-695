                  </hi> I live at 8, Lower John-street, Limehouse—I was servant at 10, Dove-street, where the prisoner and his wife lived—about a week before Tuesday, 24th March, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, they were in bed—</p>

               <p>the prisoner asked the deceased to send for some more rum—she refused, and he <hi rend="italic">nudged</hi> her in the side with his elbow and said, "Come, send for it"—they were both in bed drunk, and had been all the morning—I said to him, laughing, "Mr. Stewart, you ought not to nudge Mrs. Stewart in the side like that"—he tried to get after me, but I got out of the room—he was very tipsy—I went out into the street and shut the street door after me—I stood at the door, and heard a noise as if somebody was choking—I then went in again, and pushed open the door—Mr. Stewart tried to get after me, and I ran away again and shut the door—about ten minutes afterwards I went back again—I then saw Mrs. Stewart in bed, and she complained of her side—the prisoner was present—I asked her what was the matter with her, and she said that Mr. Stewart had given her a very heavy blow in the side as he stood by the mantelpiece—he did not say anything on that—he was out of bed then—I said to him, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to hit Mrs. Stewart like that"—he said I ought not to talk to him like that, and he gave me a slap in the face—he then went into the next room, put on his things, and went out—Mrs. Stewart was very bad indeed after that, and I went for the doctor—the prisoner came back about three-quarters of an hour after the doctor had been—he sat on the bed, and I told him the doctor had been—he would not believe it at first—he said, "So help me God I would not mind hanging for you sooner than see you in this state"—next day he was very attentive to her, and he cried and said he was very sorry—he remained with her till her death.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon at Poplar—I first saw the deceased on Friday, 20th March—I was not the first person called in—I found her suffering great pain, produced by a fracture of two ribs on the left side—she stated in the prisoner's presence that the crying was produced by a blow from his fist on the previous Tuesday, but that he did it in a passion, and she did not think he meant to hurt her—I attended her on the Saturday and Sunday, and she died on the Tuesday—I made a pod mortem examina<lb></lb>tion on the Friday following—she died from inflammation, the result of the fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she not say that she had got between the pri<lb></lb>soner and another person, and so received the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she said it was because she would not send for more spirits—when I got there I did not think the case had been properly managed—the bones were not set—in consequence of that every time she breathed the fractured ends of the ribs caused inflammation—such a fracture would not necessarily cause inflamma<lb></lb>tion—I believe she had led a very dissipated life, which would make her a worse subject, and she had also disease of the right lung; that entailed a greater use on the left, and made the fracture worse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might the fracture have been caused by a blow from a man's fist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the deceased after the doctor had been—the prisoner was present—she said she was very bad—he said she should not drink so; it was causing him to drink as well—she said the doctor said her ribs were fractured—he said he was very glad of it, it served her right; she should not drink so—I was with her constantly—on the Sunday, five days after this, she said to him, "I do not blame you for it; you did not intend to do what was done"—at that time she appeared to be much better—it was not supposed she was in a desperate condition—Dr. Webb gave great hopes of her at one time—on one occasion she said she had received her death blow—she did not say how or from whom—all she said was that he had not done it intentionally, and he said he was very sorry for what had occurred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not she say that she had got between him and another person, and so had received the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said it was through an altercation with the girl Button, that she was saucy, and that caused a dispute—he said he had been commander of a ship, and he would not be spoken to by a girl like her, and he said to the deceased, "Ann, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to allow it"—she said it was through the girl she got the injury—I did not hear her say that she got between them—I did not see her side before the plaster was put on—I never saw any marks about her person—she died a week after she was taken ill—at the time he said it served her right he was very tipsy indeed; in fact, I don't think he knew what he was saying—I had known Mrs. Stewart about three years by doing needle-work for her on several occasions—the prisoner had only returned from abroad about three weeks before this—he then married her—I believe they had been married five weeks at the time of her death—I believe he married her directly he came ashore, but I don't know—I had not seen any<lb></lb>thing of her for more than a year and a half—it was not a house of good character—I heard they were constantly intoxicated from the time they were married.</p>

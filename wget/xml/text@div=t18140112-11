            . I lost an iron pot and a feather bed the latter end of July last. I lost them from a shed in my yard. I saw them the day before I missed them, and I saw them again last Saturday night in the possession of Smith the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lived near me. I can speak to the iron pot being my property. The prisoner took the pot, and left the lid at home. I know the pot by the lid fitting it. This bed I know by the stripe of the tick; it is large blue stripes.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I got this iron pot and feather bed out of Rochester's house on Saturday evening last. I found the feather bed enclosed in a blanket to make a pillow of; it was on the bed on which Rochester slept. I found the pot in the same house, but not in the same room; it was in Rochester's part of the house. I asked the prisoner where he got the feather bed; he said it was a bed that his wife's father gave him seven years ago. He said he found the pot in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the pot. My wife's father gave her the bed when he went in the workhouse. He has lost the use of his limbs; he cannot get across the place without being carried.</p>

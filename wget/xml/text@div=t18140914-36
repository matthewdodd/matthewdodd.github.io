He called again; these pieces of cloth were delivered to him by a relation of mine, of the name of Crosby, to take to Basinghall-street. He did not return any more that day; he should have come back to take three more; there were six to go. In consequence of that, we were alarmed, and made enquiry to know whether the goods were delivered; they were not delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods - A. They were never heard of; we never found the goods at Messrs. Dalby and Company's in Basinghall-street; he never delivered the goods. After waiting two or three days, we offered a reward, and three or four days after that he was taken, and after going before the Lord Mayor, he was fully committed.</p>

On the morning I received the goods, I met with a seafaring man; we had the share of five or six halfpints of ale, and some liquor, which took effect of me; whether I pitched them any where, or left them any where I cannot say. On the next morning, I found myself on Tower-hill, I was so bad as that.</p>

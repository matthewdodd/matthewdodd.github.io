                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—I am now principally engaged by the Mint authorities—on Saturday, 22nd January, in consequence of information I went to 63, Cranbrook-street, Victoria-park, about half-past 2 in the afternoon—I was accompanied by Inspec<lb></lb>tor Bryant and some other officers—I directed constable Elliott to go and knock at the door—it was opened by a little girl—I directed Elliott to run into the yard—I went to the back-parlour door, which was closed—I forced it open with a sledge hammer, and rushed into the room—I found the three prisoners there sitting at a table by the fire, which was a clear bright one—the other officers entered with me—Tiggell had a file in her right hand, which she flung down—the male prisoner had a plaster of Paris mould in his left hand—he came towards me and made a Kick at me—I pushed him into the corner with the sledge hammer—at that time Margaret Pike commenced stamping on the mould, which the male prisoner had thrown down—I pushed her away and she fell over a chair which was behind her, on her back on the floor—that was to prevent her stamping on the mould—before this I had seen Margaret Pike sweep a handful of shillings off the table, some of which she threw into the fire and I saw melt—some dropped on the floor in different parts of the place—that was on my entering, before she stamped on the mould; it was all instantaneous—I saw the coin which went into the fire, melt, it melted instantly, almost as quick as butter—after I pushed Margaret Pike and she fell, she lay on her back and kicked me with great force with both feet; she kicked in all manner of directions, and seized several of the fragments of the broken mould with her hand, and crushed them in her hand—I saw that—the prisoners were secured, and Serjeant Evans put into my hand this piece of mould of the obverse side of a shilling—before the prisoners were secured Tiggell stamped on the remaining part of the mould as much as she pos<lb></lb>sibly could—when the prisoners were secured they were taken to a distant part of the room, close to the door—I examined the fire—I found on it this tobacco pipe with white metal in it in a fused state—on the floor I found five counterfeit shillings, which I also produce—the half plaster of Paris mould was put into my hand by Serjeant Evans, it was quite hot—only one part of the mould was found perfect, the fragments of another</p>

               <p>part were found—I produce a band for holding the mould—that was also warm—on the mantelpiece I found a good shilling corresponding in date with the counterfeit, and I believe the one from which the impression was taken—in the cupboard I found a jug containing acid, some bottles, some metal spoons, and a deposit cup for a galvanic battery, and some brushes—the wires were attached to the battery—I saw Evans find them on the ledge under the window—in the cupboard I found some plaster of Paris in powder, and a composition called <hi rend="italic">slumming,</hi> in a saucer, that is used to give the coin a dull appearance after it is electro-plated—I also produce some spoons, and a file that was picked up off the floor by Inspector Bryant—I saw Tiggell throw it down—I took possession of the things—I said to the male prisoner, "Well, Dick, I come to pay you another visit" (the women were present)—he said, "Yes, work has been very bad, and we were obliged to do this for a living"—Margaret Pike then said, "Oh Dick, oh Dick, I told you months ago it would come to this; you had better have kept to your work"—she said, "Mr. Brannan, save my child"—I said, "I have nothing to say to you,
all the imprisonment you have had has had no effect upon you"—there was a little girl in the room, the one that opened the door—the prisoners were all taken to the station.</p>

I would have smashed it all to pieces, I would have stuck a knife in their hearts before I would have parted with it"—I afterwards found this file (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor—there was white metal in the teeth of it—on the mantelpiece I found this bottle containing acid.</p>

I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—this file is an instrument used in coining, it has been used for that purpose—it has a great deal of white metal in the teeth of it—it is used to make the mailing perfect—this half-mould is made of plaster of Paris, it is the obverse side of a shilling—this genuine shilling produced must have been the one used as a pattern for making the mould—the mould would be in two parts, and the metal would be poured in at this <hi rend="italic">get</hi>—these spoons are made of a metal which might be converted into counterfeit coin—if thrown into the fire it would melt immediately—this metal found on the hearth is the same kind of metal, except that a little tin has been added to it to make it harder—here are eight counterfeit shillings all produced from this mould—they are of the same metal as the spoons with the addition of a little tin—there is some metal contained in this tobacco-pipe—this is rather a clumsy way of ladling the metal out of the crucible, or whatever it was melted in, and pouring it into the mould—the metal in it is the same kind as that of which the shillings are composed—the acids produced are necessary for electro-plating coins, but these coins were not prepared for electro-plating—this composition called <hi rend="italic">slumming</hi> is used for the purpose of colouring the coins and making them look as if they had been used; they are then allowed to dry, and are generally wrapped up separately in paper.</p>

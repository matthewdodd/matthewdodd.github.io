                  </hi>. I live at 9, Garden Street, Stepney Green—I have a room on the first floor front; it is a four-roomed house—I know all the prisoners by sight, except Allen—they were all living together in the same house as me—Clayton lived there seven weeks last Saturday, and Duval about six weeks—Duval left about a fortnight before this affair—the last time I saw the women in the house was a week after Whitsun-Sunday.</p>

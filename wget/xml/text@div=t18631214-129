I am a merchant, at 56, St. Mary-axe—about half past 6 on the evening of 20th November, I was going to post a letter—there was a stoppage in Lombard-street from an omnibus and some carriages—the prisoner came up, took my watch, and broke it off from the chain—I saw him do it, but the omnibus prevented my getting hold of him</p>

               <p>—I saw it in his hand, and saw him twist it off—I said, "You have got my watch!"—ho ran away; I ran after him, and cried, "Stop thief!"—he was stopped about twenty yards off by a gentleman, but the watch was gone—I am sure he is the man; I never lost sight of him.</p>

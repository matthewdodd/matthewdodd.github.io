                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live at Royal Hill, Greenwich. On Wednesday, the 2nd of November, I was walking in the Park to find a few chestnuts—the prisoners came up to me, and Smaills said to me, "We must have your chestnuts"—they were all together—they began searching me—I said, "Let me take my money out of my pocket first"—Smaills searched me—the other two were with him at the time—I took my money out, and held it in my right hand—it was a sixpence and two penny-pieces—and then Smaills snatched at it—Philpot and White were with me—when Smaills snatched at it I put the money into my left hand—Heather then threw me down, and Smaills held me—Heather twisted my wrist round—Smaills then kicked my wrist, and they forced me to open my hand, and I dropped the money—Heather picked up the money and threw it a little way—Smaills then picked it up, and ran away with it—while I was down, Giles tried to take my comforter off, but he did not get it—they all ran away—Giles was standing by my feet when Heather threw me down, and Smaills took my money—my companions ran away from me a little way before I was down, and then came back again—I am quite sure the prisoners are the boys.</p>

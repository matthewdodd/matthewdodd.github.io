                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Salisbury-street, New North-road, Islington. On the 3rd of Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home—the prisoner overtook me in Bath-street, Old-street—he said, "It is a fine evening, Miss"—I made him no answer—he asked me to accompany him—he did not say where—I would have nothing to do with him—when I crossed the corner to North-street he said, "Will you take my arm?"—I said, "I will not"—he repeated the tame words, and then said, "Then loosen your shawl"—I said I would not—he immediately laid hold of it and pulled it off one shoulder—I held it on the other shoulder, and when he found he could not get it away he held it with one hand and struck me a violent blow in the mouth with the other, I having hold of the shawl at the time—it nearly knocked one of my teeth out—I have had it out since—it loosened several others, and cut my mouth very much inside—he then got the shawl, as I loosened it on his striking me—he ran down South-street with it—a policeman came up, and I followed with him—we found the prisoner standing against a hedge in South-street—I turned and said to the policeman, "That is the man, I can swear to him"—he said he had not seen me before, but I swear to him—he bad been in my company three quarters of an hour—I saw the shawl found.</p>

               <p>a cry of "Murder, and police!"—I went towards the cry, and on the road met the prisoner—I am certain he is the person—I asked what was the matter—he said I was wanted at the bottom—he was coming up the street towards me, and I was going down—after leaving him I found the prosecutrix standing at the corner hallooing at the place he described—she told me what had taken place—I turned back, as I had met nobody but the prisoner—John Jones followed me—we found the prisoner standing about 70 yards from the prosecutrix in South-street—she said that was the man, she was sure, and he had stolen her shawl, and struck her in the mouth—he said he had not seen her that night—I said, "You must have seen her, for you have just come from towards her"—he said he had come down the street—I told Jones if he had stolen the shawl it could not be far off—he had better look for it, and I saw him find it on the briar, in a garden, in South-street—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther the prisoner had passed that place—it was about twelve yards from where he was—it was between him and the other end of the street—it was on the opposite side to the prosecutrix—the street is not very long—I met him near where it was found—it was a little above where I met him.</p>

On the morning in question I heard cries of "Murder" and "police!" and saw the prisoner running before me, down South-street—I followed him, and after the police<lb></lb>man passed me he met the prisoner, who said, "Halloo, you are wanted at the corner"—the policeman went on—I stood still—the prisoner crossed the road by the side of a ditch, and stopped there—the instant he was at the ditch the policeman and prosecutrix came to him—she said he was the man—in consequence of the policeman saying, if she had lost her shawl it could not he far off, I looked for it, and found it on a bramble, in front of a garden, in the street, not above twenty or thirty yards from where the prisoner was—there are houses on one side of the street, and a ditch on the other—the pri<lb></lb>soner crossed the road to the ditch from the side where the houses are.</p>

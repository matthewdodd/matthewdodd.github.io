               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say when you took me that you was not sure whether it was me or another man without a coat - A. I said I was sure it was you, and I am sure that it is you; he had on a sort of a jacket with light sleeves; I thought he was without a coat, only a waistcoat on, but it proved the next day to be a jacket; I was very sure he was the man.</p>

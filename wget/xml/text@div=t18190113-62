            . I am servant to Mr. Burls. On the night of the 25th of October, I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I was the last up, and am certain all the house was fastened up, the stair case window, on the first floor was shut down. I came down about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and found the upper sash half way down, also footmarks on the window and in the house; there was a ladder outside, standing up against the window - anybody could then get in and out. I went into the front parlour, and found the shutter half-way open, so that they had been in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. The staircase window is twelve feet from the ground. It had been daylight sometime before I got up - I saw no appearance of a candle having been used.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURLS, Esq. I rent a house in Gloucester-place, in the parish of St. Marylebone. When I came down in the morning, I found my silver snuff-box gone, which I had left in the parlour the night before; also a pair of spectacles, and a brooch; a work-box was emptied, and the contents gone. I missed a lady's gold watch, and a green net purse, with a clasp, from my wife's dressing-room, which joins our bed-room on the second floor; there was about 18 s. in the purse - I had seen them there when I went to bed. The thieves must have passed through my bed-room, to get to the dressing-room. I then went into the drawing-room, on the first floor, missed some packs of cards, and all the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth considerably more than 40 s.; the brooch was found at a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood; I have also seen some of the silver, broken up - the robbery was committed on Saturday night, or Sunday morning.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Stafford-street, St Marylebone, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 29th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Chard came and offered a small gold brooch set with brilliants, in pledge for 5 s. I asked him whose it was? he said it was his own. I asked him where he got it? he said he bought it of a man at a public-house for 7 s., but he was informed that it was worth two or three times that money. I suspected him, and sent for a constable, who came; I showed him the brooch, which appeared to answer the description of one in a handbill which I had received before; I showed the constable the handbill, in the prisoner's presence, and went with him, and the prisoner to Mr. Burls; we produced the brooch, which he claimed; I left him in charge of the constable. I produce some silver, which appears to be part of the articles of a lady's work-box; here are two silver thimbles, and a silver purse-spring, with part of the purse. About an hour after I had stopped Chard, Jones came to sell them. I observed a green thread and tassel hanging to the purse-spring, which I pulled off; I weighed it, and gave her 2 s. for it. In the course of the day I got a fresh handbill, and thought they might be part of the property, and sent for Coates. I believe I sold Blanchard the pantaloons found at Jones's lodgings, about a week before the robbery - there is my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say a man named Clark sold him the brooch - A. He mentioned no name - he did not describe the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner Chard, and took him to Mr. Burls with Gideon - as we went along, I asked him where he got the brooch? he said he bought it of a young man, named Clark, who had been a gentleman's servant, and that he had known him some years. I asked him where he lived? he said he did not know; I told him that was very strange, as he had known him so long; he said if he was let go, he dare say he could find him himself; I told him that was impossible, took him to Mr. Burls, and produced the brooch. About seven o'clock in the evening, Gideon sent for me again, and produced some silver, which answered the description in the handbill; he told me who he bought it of, and went with me and Smith to Jones's lodgings, No, 28. Mitcham-street, and took her into custody there; I searched the place, and found two packs of cards in a drawer; as soon as she saw me take them out, she put a pair of scissars into my hand - I found nothing else there, except a pair of trowsers, and other clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not describe Clark - A. He said he was taller than himself, and I believe he said he wore a light coat; I went to two or three houses to find Clark, but could find no such person as he had described - Blanchard absconded, and was never heard of, until last Tuesday - I took him on Wednesday morning at Chelsea.</p>

I was with Coates, and took Chard at Mr. Gideon's, he has given a correct account; Chard said he was pledging the brooch for money to take him to the fight at Moulsey Hurst, and that he was to meet the young man who sold him the brooch, in the Edgware-road, to go to the fight together. I afterwards went with Gideon and Coates to Jones's lodgings, and found two packs of cards, a pair of scissars, and some wearing apparel. I produce two neck-handkerchiefs, two silk handkerchiefs, a sheet, a pair of new boots, a pair of pantaloons, and a waistcoat.</p>

            . I was taken up for this robbery on a Thursday - Chard had been taken up that morning. I know Blanchard - he used to come backwards and forwards frequently, from September, until I was taken. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130034"></xptr>had seen him on the Saturday evening that this robbery was committed - he left me about ten o'clock; I saw him on the Sunday afternoon, then on the Monday morning, and every day. I got the scissars from Blanchard, that I gave to Coates, either on the Sunday or Monday. I sold the silver to Gideon, and broke it up. Chard gave it to me on the Sunday or Monday. There was part of the clasp of a purse, which was either green or brown. After he had given them to me, he said that he wished me not to keep any of them, and so I broke them up and sold them; I showed them to him the morning that I sold them in the evening, in the same state they are in now. The clothes found at my lodgings are his; he had them sometime before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he wished you to sell them - A. On the evening before Chard was taken, I saw Blanchard with the brooch, he took it away, saying it was part which belonged to what I had got, and he did not wish me to keep the things he had given me, any more than he wished to keep the brooch himself; I destroyed every thing he gave me, except what is now produced - he gave no reason why I was to destroy them, only that there was something in the papers about them, that he did not like.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say that you suspected a man, who you saw with your servant the day before - A. No, when he said the brooch was given to him by a servant I asked him to describe him? he said he was a little man - I had occasionally seen a man in the Mews, but he was a large lusty man.</p>
               <p>BLANCHARD'S Defence. It is useless pretending that I am entirely ignorant of it, I will explain every thing. On the night of the robbery, I was coming from the play, and met Clark, went with him to Gloucester-place, and waited while he got over the wall, and returned with the things which were taken to my lodgings. In the morning he went away, took most of the things, and left those that were found at my lodgings. In a few days I met him, and he told me to keep out of the way, as a young man, who he gave the brooch to, was apprehended.</p>

On the Saturday before he was taken, he came home at half-past ten o'clock, and went to bed. I saw him come in - he sleeps in the next room to me. He did not go out until seven in the morning - if he had I must have known it, as he must pass through my room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I live about half a mile from the prosecutor. My wife sleeps in the same room with me, and knows this as well as myself - she is not here. I did not go before the magistrate to tell this, as I was not sent for. He was never out later than half-past ten o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi> K 276.) I went with the prisoner to the station—Watkins carried the copper and iron—I asked the prisoner if he was not mate of a ship—he said he had been, but was not then—he said he would tell the truth—he was mate of the ship <hi rend="italic">Glenburnie</hi>, and had bought the nails and bolts for the ship, and he had bought some brooms previously—that he former captain had authorized him to sell some old rope and rubbish, as he could not make up a petty bill for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Glenburnie</hi> since 16th Jan.—on 18th Jan. I brought the ship from the London Docks to fletcher's Dock to be repaired—she is there now—there were some bolts similar to these taken out of the ship, and put into the second mats's cabin on the deck—they are there to this day—there were also some metal nails kept in a bucket in the same cabin—I had given no authority to the prisoner to sell any of the old metal—he told me he had bought some brooms for the ship, as the old ones were worn out—he said nothing about paying for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not generally the business of the master to give orders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on whether the owners are in London at the time—there is an agree<lb></lb>ment between the master and the men while at sea—I have not signed that yet—all the men are under my control—it is my business to select seamen and mates—they are hired, not by the owner, but by the master—I believe the late master's name was Russell; I believe he has gone to Glasgow—I went before the Magistrate last Tuesday, and there has not been time to send to Glasgow to secure the late master's attendance, it would not be possible—I do not recollect whether the prisoner said whether he had paid for the brooms out of his own pocket—I will not say either way.</p>

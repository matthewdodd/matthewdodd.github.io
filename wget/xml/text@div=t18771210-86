                  </hi>. I am a bill broker, of 32, Nicolas Lane, Lombard Street—I have known the prisoner about two years—during that time I have constantly discounted bills for him—I usually charged him 5 per cent. per annum interest, with a commission of half per cent. on the amount—sometimes bills were running to the amount of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the time this happened there were more than that—about 17th May he brought me this bill of exchange, dated 10th May, with two others; the three amounted to 660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him how it was that Mr. McLaughlin, being a shirt-manufacturer, should give acceptances to him, another shirt-manufacturer—he explained that McLaughlin could do certain makes of shirts better than he could, and it answered his purpose to buy of him, and that he sent over shirts to McLaughlin, for which he (McLaughlin) gave him his acceptance—upon that I discounted the three bills, and gave him in payment these two cheques for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they have been returned by my bankers as paid. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was a four months' bill and purported to be accepted by P. McLaughlin, payable at the Omagh branch of the Belfast Bank</hi>.) On 28th August I received this bill for 154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner—the bill of 10th May became due on 13th September—it was sent over by my bank to be collected in Ireland, and within a day or two afterwards it came back marked as a forgery—in the interval I had received a telegram from Ireland—I received this letter from McLaughlin in reply to one I wrote to him asking for payment, of the bill—about 16th September I saw the prisoner and told him that I had heard that McLaughlin said the bill was a forgery—he said it was not so, that he Would tell McLaughlin to come over to England to assure me that he had not cause for saying it was a forgery—it was after that I received the letter from McLaughlin—the prisoner called on me again, a week or 10 days after that, and produced this letter, saying he had received it from McLaughlin. (<hi rend="italic">Head:</hi> "September 15, 1877. Sir,—I did not intend to say the bill was a forgery exactly, but I had no note of a bill of that date, but I find I was mistaken. I will explain to the bank how, and do anything you wish to set it right. I will get the money together in a week or 10 days, and send it to you or the holder of the bill, as you</p>

               <p>think right.—P. McLaughlin.") I believed that letter to be McLaughlin's writing—I have never had any money in respect of either of the bills—I know the prisoner's writing—I should think this letter is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This as dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to M'Laughlin, requesting him to write a letter to the effect of the one read, and stating that the bill would be provided for</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had a good many transactions with the prisoner, extending over two years—I have very likely discounted five or six bills for him with McLaughlin's name as acceptor, prior to this bill of 10th May—I am prepared to swear that the conversation about McLaughlin's acceptance took place this year—it might have taken place in connection with other bills as well—those bills were similar in amount—at the time the prisoner showed me the letter signed P. McLaughlin I had McLaughlin's genuine letter to myself in my posses<lb></lb>sion—he certainly did not say that he had prepared that letter as a copy for McLaughlin to write from—the prisoner took McLaughlin's letter to me away with him—I did not compare the writing of the two letters—I gave the prisoner into custody on or about 10th November.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Omagh, county Tyrone, and am a maker of shirts and cuffs—I have known the prisoner over 10 years—the acceptance to this bill of 10th May is not my writing—I first knew of it when it was presented to me at Omagh on 13th September by a clerk from the Provincial Bank, Omagh branch—there is no branch of the Belfast Bank there—when it was presented I at once telegraphed to the bank in London—I got letter this from the prisoner the evening following, asking me to cover it—I had not had any communication with reference to it from the prisoner until then—I had received this telegram from him about an hour alter the bill was presented, and I immediately wrote to him a letter before I received his letter—I did not communicate with Mr. Shoolbred until he demanded payment, that was some time after—I wrote him this letter of 21st September telling him the facts of the case—I did not write the letter of the 15th—I attended at the police-court, and gave evidence, and then I was shown this other acceptance—I had pre<lb></lb>viously seen it that morning at Mr. Miller's office—it is not my writing—I did not owe the prisoner any such sum as 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think my first business transaction with the prisoner was early in 1876—I had business transactions with him early in the present year—he supplied me with goods to make—I accepted three bills for him; two in August, 1876, and the third, I believe, in December, 1876—they were not in respect of goods supplied by him to me, they were simply accommodation bills—in December, 1876, there was a bill coming due—this letter is my writing to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—I dare say my hurried letter of yesterday has reached you in due time containing your bill; I have just five minutes to write and post it; it was a very close shave with the bill due, I had scarcely time to have the bank order cashed until it was presented for payment; the least hitch in remittance would have been extremely awkward. With regard to a banking account, how would it do for you to accept a bill for me for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or say for what amount of work you can give me to make, for four or five months? I merely want your opinion; in the meantime in that way it might be possible to open a banking account without your advancing money directly for that purpose; however, as you intend coming over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100011"></xptr>
               <p>perhaps it will be better to wait till then, which I presume will be this side Christmas.") The bill due in December was an accommodation bill—he asked me as an obligement to accept those bills for him—I know Charles McDaid, the prisoner's brother—I did not in his presence sanction the use of my name to acceptances by the prisoner, that I swear—I know William Haggerty—I was over here in the early part of August, 1876—I did not on that occasion say to the prisoner "You can use my name to bills"—I was over here in August this year—I remember meeting Charles McDaid and Haggerty—I did not on that occasion say that I did not mind my name being used, so long as the bills were met—what occurred was this, in what I said I referred to Charles McDaid—Haggerty was not present—I said <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Those bills that I ac<lb></lb>cepted for McDaid he did not accept as he intended to do—he promised to send me the money to meet those bills, and he had not done so—this one was presented before the money was forwarded, I could have seen my way to accommodate him, but when things turned out like that I could not see my way further to have any connection in that way"—that was simply referring to what was past, to those three accommodation bills—one of them, I believe, was a three months' bill, and the other two four months—two were accepted in August, 1876, one at three and the other at four months—they have been met, the prisoner provided the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> With regard to those three acceptances, I wrote them in my own proper hand writing—I never, under any circumstances, authorized the prisoner to write my name; I never thought of such a thing—those three bills were written by me; two of them I have in my possession, the third I have not got, he wrote saying it was all right, and I heard no more about it—in August, 1877, my complaint was that he had not sent the money to meet this bill, and in consequence of that I would not accept for him any further—he never mentioned anything then about a bill dated 10th May, to which he had written my name, and left with Mr. Shoolbred—this was at the latter end of August; I left about the 24th, and was here up to the 29th or 30th—neither he or his brother told me that they had signed my name to the bill of 10th August—I never gave them authority to sign my name to that bill—I never gave any authority to any one to write my name—these acceptances are not an imitation of my writing—as to the bill marked A. the drawing and acceptance seem to be in the same writing, except the signature—I have no idea whose writing the August bill is.</p>

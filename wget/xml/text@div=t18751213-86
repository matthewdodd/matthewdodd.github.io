                  </hi>. On 9th August Joseph Pilgrim was received into Guy's Hospital, but I was not on duty—I first saw him about 20th August, and saw bruises on his legs which were wearing away, and swellings which were disappearing; they were chiefly in his right leg—it was difficult to tell in what state the bones were, as the swellings had not subsided; but I have examined them since, and found a great deal of thickening, and I believe his right leg to have been broken—he was six weeks in the hospital—the surgeon who received him is in the country; his term of office has expired—I sent the patient to the convalescent hospital, and I know that he went because his signature was given—he re-appeared a month afterwards—I examined him a few days since, and ha still walks somewhat lame—it will be three or four months from the injury before he walks well—a fall on the ground would not be likely to cause all the injuries I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The small bones might have been broken by a fall, and the other injuries done by external violence—the injuries were almost all over his right leg below his knee—I believe his leg was broken on account of the thickening of the bone, but I did not see him early enough to say that it was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The bruises on his legs were attributable to violence from without—the breaking of the legs may have been due to violence or to a fall—I could not form a judgment, as his leg was so swollen, but it is my opinion that it was broken—I saw several bruises which were attributable to some blunt instrument, such as a stone or a stick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of Blackheath Hill—early on the morning of 8th August, about 12.15, I was with my wife, opposite Trinity Church, Blackheath Hill; she stopped to speak to a female friend—I moved about 8 yards away and waited for her, and three young gentlemen came up the hill, singing hymns—two constables, the prisoners, were fol<lb></lb>lowing them pretty closely, and they were kicking one of them—I turned to my wife and said "Did you see that, <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>?"—I had hardly got the words out of my mouth when Basket came up and said "Move on," pushing me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187512130033"></xptr>
               <p>by the neck, and continually shoving me, and he knocked me down and kicked me; I fell five or six times—Thomas also followed me up close, con<lb></lb>stantly shoving me—I saw him kick me once, and I said "Will you allow me to go home?" but they kept shoving me the reverse way, though I told them I lived at the back of the church—when they got me into the dark they kicked me five or six times; I had several bruises—I used no abusive or improper language, I was doing nothing to cause a breach of the peace, I was standing by myself—I said "Now you have broken my <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> "what do you mean to do?" and they walked away and left me lying on the ground—my wife said "Don't you think you have done enough to my husband?"—I was in such agony that I hardly knew where I was—assistance came to help me home—I went to the hospital on the following Monday, and re<lb></lb>mained there sis weeks; I then went home for a week, and was then sent to the Convalescent Home at Bognor for four weeks—I also had bruises about my body—after I had been home three weeks I made a complaint to the authorities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assault took place I think quite half a mile from the police-station—I will not swear that it is more than 200 yards—I told the Magistrate at Greenwich that I never had any misunderstanding with the police before—I have been sentenced to two months' imprison<lb></lb>ment for an assault upon my wife—I have not turned her out of the house at night—she has not been wandering about Blackheath when I have been at home—she has not been shut out; she has always had the house to walk into—I have not been at home in the middle of the night when she has been out—I recollect being at 1, King Street, Blackheath Hill, in. April, 1873—I saw two constables there, who insulted my wife—I don't know their names—there was no noise whatever—I saw those two men outside my own door, but I do not live in King Street—my wife's brother lives at 1, King Street—the police did not go into my brother-in-law's house, where my wife and I were on that night—Basket is not like one of the men; he was stouter built and had long whiskers and was fair—I was not there to hear what complaint my wife made to the police—I made none—I did not tell her not to take a summons out—she did not go through with it—I did not see her insulted—I was in my own house and do not know what she did—I saw the police in the street when. I went out—they told me to go home, and I did so—there was no disturbance at my brother-in-law's house; the poor woman was dying—I obeyed the police and went home, and in the meantime my wife had been insulted by the police and gone to the station—I could not walk home on the night I was assaulted; they partly carried me home—this was just after closing hour—the police stopped the singing—I did not say that they need not interfere, nor did I interfere—I did not tell the policeman that he was to mind his own business, nothing of the kind—I saw one of the prisoners in the act of kicking a young man—neither of the young men are here—I should like to find them—by kicking I mean lifting up his <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—it was also near 12 o'clock at night when my wife was insulted in 1873.</p>

                  </hi>. On 8th August I was coming home from Mr. Wooder's, about 12.30, and stopped to speak to a female acquaintance on Blackheath Hill, while my husband stood a little distance off—three young</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187512130034"></xptr>
               <p>men came up the hill singing, and two policemen, the prisoners, followed them—my husband said to me "Did you say that, <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>?" and immediately afterwards Basket took him by the neck and told him to move on—the push he received made him fall, and as he tried to get up the pushing continued and Basket kicked him several times and Thomas kicked him once—he called out that his leg was broken and I took Thomas by the shoulders and prevented him giving a second kick—he was pushed down four or five times—I asked Thomas if he had not done enough—the prisoners went away and I followed them for their numbers; Basket dared me to look him in the face and he placed his hand on his number—Thomas stood behind him all the time—I saw their faces; these are the men—I returned to my husband and I and a young man named Houghton assisted him home, and we had quite a job to get him upstairs; he went to the hospital on the Monday following, and I complained to the Magistrate on the same day, who told me to stop till my husband was better—my husband used no improper language to the police—they did not give him any chance to go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They asked him to move on—I made a complaint against the police in 1873, and was referred to the Magistrate—my husband has been convicted of assaulting me once, the best of men may do that; he has only done it once to that degree—I have never had to stay out all night unless I was at work at a gentleman's house—my husband has never been so violent to me that I was obliged to leave the house; I may have been seen on Blackheath Hill at midnight if I have been to a party to wait—I was threatened to be locked up, but they did not do it—one of the men was bigger and older than either of these prisoners—I cannot recollect whether he was or was not either of those men; he was a big man—one was a fair man, with a fair beard and whiskers—my sister-in-law was dying at 1, King Street, in 1873, and there was a disturbance afterwards—I do not know that the two policemen I complained of came up to quell the disturbance—I was at the station-house—the two constables I charged were, I believe, on that beat—I was not outside the Horse and Groom on that night in 1873; it was close to the Horse and Groom—I believe the people were outside the Horse and Groom, where the singing was going on.</p>
               <p>

               <p>directly I saw a chance I did interfere—I asked Basket why they were push<lb></lb>ing the man about—he said that it was no business of mine—I told him he was exceeding his duty—he told me if I was not careful he would serve me the same—I saw him kicked, but cannot say which constable's foot it was that was raised to him—I assisted him home with difficulty—I did not hear him use any improper language, or see any improper conduct—when he was kicked he was in a position between sitting and lying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have every reason to believe that it was Basket's foot that I saw up to kick him—I was rather excited—I should think there might have been eight or ten persons present—when the young men were coming up the hill I heard a voice say "Let the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> alone"—this seemed to me to be an interference with the police, but I did not see it—I did not see whether the police were trying to stop the young men singing—I was in the Horse and Groom yard, but 1 had not been in the house—it was twenty-five minutes or half an hour from the beginning of it to my seeing the man home—I may have heard the police say "Move on," and I may not, but they did not give him a chance—I cannot say how near this was to the nearest police-station—I did not go to the station that night—it was very late, and I was just getting home—I did not see the man twist him-self from the police who were trying to get him along—I will not swear that he did not—the wife was there—she was not very noisy, but I believe she was very excited—I heard some persons singing, but I should not have thought that it was an annoyance to the neighbourhood—Pilgrim walked home, but the best part of his weight was upon me—I did not notice whether he put one foot before the. other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 29, King Street, Blackheath—on the morning of 8th August, a little after 12 o'clock, I was by the Horse and Groom talking to Mr. Houghton; I heard a disturbance, went to see what it was, and saw Pilgrim and his wife having a little bit of a disturbance with the police—I saw the constables push him down violently two or three times, and the last time I saw the elder one make an attempt to kick at him I decidedly saw him raise his foot—I cannot say whether he did kick him, but the man immediately cried out that he was kicked and that his leg was broken—I saw him pushed down about four or five times.</p>

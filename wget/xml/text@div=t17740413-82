            's for a check of Nicklin and Wells for 81 l. my servant brought me a 50 l. note, a 30 l. note, and one pound in cash; this was on Friday evening about six o'clock; I put them in my bureau in the compting house, and locked the bureau: the notes were my private property. We have a shop facing the street, and a shop backward; the compting house is between them; the bureau was in the compting house. I have learned since, my apprentice who brought the notes wrote on the back of them. I missed the notes on the Tuesday following, which was the 22 d; I had not been at the bureau from Friday; I put my hand on it, and found it open; then I put the key in, and found the lock so damaged the key would not turn; I looked in the drawer where I put the bank notes, and they were gone; I called my other servants, and asked if they knew any thing of the bureau being open. On the evening<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130037"></xptr> before, my apprentice informed me he was afraid the prisoner was going to leave me, for he said he was going to Newcastle; he was then lighting the candles; I went to him and said I heard he was going to Newcastle; he said he had met Dr. Pringle, and he told him he must go immediately to Newcastle, to give evidence on a trial at the assizes; I asked him if he had a subpoena; he said no; I said I could not consent to his going without his producing a subpoena, or my seeing Dr. Pringle; about nine o'clock the same evening I was informed he was set-off. On missing my notes the next day I suspected the prisoner; I went to the George and Blue Boar, in Holborn, and found a person answering the description of the prisoner had taken a place in the stage to Newcastle; that he was very much in liquor, and had taken a woman of the town with him to Highgate or Barnet; I got the number of the notes and took a post chaise, and pursued him; when I got to Grantham I found he had left the coach and taken a post chaise; when I came to Doncaster I found a person of the description of the prisoner was gone in a post chaise, and had changed a 50 l; note with one Mr. Giles; I told Mr. Giles if he had my note it was dated Dec. 12, 1772; he produced a note of that date; then I went forward and found at Borough-bridge that I had overshot the prisoner, and missed him; I pursued him to Newbrivest, where his parents live, and found him at a publick house; I put him in the chaise and brought him back to the Hoop and Lion, a public house at Northallerton; we had no conversation till we came there; only the prisoner said London had been the ruin of him, and confessed the fact at Northallerton; I took him before the Justice; the Justice asked what money he had in his pocket; he took out thirty-three guineas and a half, and said to me, Sir, this is your property, I beg you will take it, and said it is what is left out of a bank note I have changed at Doncaster; he took a watch out of his pocket, and said he had bought it with my money, and desired me to take it; I have it here; he said he had changed the 50 l. note with Mr. Gill of Doncaster; he said he changed the 30 l. note at London, at a publick house in Hosier-lane, Snow-hill; he said the landlord had only 20 l. that he left word for one Soaper to receive the 10 l. for him against he came back. He said that he broke open the bureau on Sunday evening; that he did it by the instigation of some bad women. His confession was taken in writing, before Mr. Peacock, the clergyman, who committed him to York Castle; when I returned to London I found my people had traced out the 30 l. note; it was in the hands of one Dennis in Chiswell-street.</p>

            . I live in Charlotte-street, Rathbone-place; I saw the prisoner twice before the night he brought the note to my cousin's in Smithfield; I was there on Monday the 21st of March; he came in and said he was going to Newcastle, and wanted a pound of tea to take with him to his mother; when it was weighed he said he had not money to pay her without she could change a 30 l. note; she said she could not change it, and did not know where to get it changed; then my cousin desired me to go to Mr. Ivers to get it changed as he knew me. I went and the prisoner with me; I told Mr. Ivers the gentleman wanted to go out of town that night; Mr. Ivers said he had 20 l. he asked him if it would not be the same if he left the 10 l. as he talked of returning so shortly; he said it would be the same; he gave the note to Mr. Ivers himself.</p>
               <p>Ivers. I paid the note to Mr. Sanckster; (the notes both read).</p>

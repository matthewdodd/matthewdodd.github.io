               <p>RICHARD JOHN COX WHITE. On the 10th of May, I carried on business in Addle-street, Cheapside - the prisoner was my <rs id="t18340904-12-deflabel73" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18340904-12-defend186 t18340904-12-deflabel73"></join>, and slept in Addle-street - I went to Croydon on the 10th of May - he knew I was going, as I sent him to inquire about the coach - I did not direct him to go to my house in Spencer-street; but I told him to go over the water, into Surrey, to see a workman, and to come to my house on the following morning, (Sunday,) in <placeName id="t18340904-12-crimeloc74">Spencer-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did you lose your money? A. I missed it on the Saturday following - it was there the Friday night before you absconded - it was my money - I never said it was my mother's money - I rent the house in Spencer-street - my mother lived there, but I rent it - nobody slept in the house besides myself and mother - my grandmother, Mrs. Stevens, might sleep there occasionally - I cannot say whether she slept there from the time you left till I found out my loss - when I removed out of Holborn I lost the keys of the drawers and my cash-box - I lost them in Holborn - I was the last person in the house in Holborn - Mrs. Stevens swept that house out - she and I were together when we found the pocket-book - she saw it fall in removing the bedstead, and took it up, and gave it to me, saying, "Here is a pocket-book" - I saw her pick it up - I was removing from Addle-street at the time - she was nearer the pocket-book than I was - she has cleaned out the house for forty years - she was an occasional servant - I never saw my keys after I left Holborn - I had no doubt about the prisoner's character before - I moved the bedstead in Addle-street in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The bedstead was not in the house at nine o'clock in the morning? A. That may be, for I will not be certain whether it was Friday or Saturday, but I know it was found under the bedstead the last day that I moved away, and to the best of my knowledge, it was the 17th - Mrs. Stevens saw the pocket-book first - there was not the twinkling of an eye - she might see it first - she and I were together - I had received 26l. from Mr. Stewart, in Ratcliff-highway - the pocket-book looked as if it had been flung underneath the bedstead - it was rather dirty - it was a little dusty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I never say I would leave your service? A. Yes; and afterwards asked me to let you stop again - I have no recollection of your telling me you would not stop - I swear I told him to come on Sunday.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What keys did you miss in Holborn? A. The keys of the drawers the property was in, but my mother had a key which would open it, and I did not pay much attention to it.</p>

            , who is a porter. I occasionally work for Mr. White - I was at his house on the 10th of May, the day he went to Croydon - after he was gone, I let the prisoner into the house in Spencer-street - he told Mr. White's mother he had come to clean the windows by Mr. White's orders - I let him go up to the bed-room for that purpose - he was up there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he then went down to clean the back parlour window, but said he could not clean it because the sun was on it - he went away directly - I suppose he was in the house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I was present on the Saturday following in Addle-street, and picked up the pocket-book - I never saw it before, to my knowledge - I had not been at Addle-street the whole of that week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I go into the room the money was in? A. You went up stairs - I won't take my oath you went into that room - I did not take my oath of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which room did he go into? A. I cannot say - there are two rooms up stairs, and they were both open - I could not swear which room he went into - I am certain he went up stairs, and was up there a quarter of an hour - it was after tea that I moved the bedstead in Addle-street - I saw the pocket-book first - Mr. White was standing by the bedstead at the time - I picked it up, and gave it to him - I cleaned out the bed-room where the money was on the Saturday before the prisoner went up - I did not sleep at White's on the Saturday night - I did not say so at the office - I dare say I slept there in the course of that week, as I slept there very often, but I cannot call to my recollection - the pocket-book was lying under the bedstead - I pulled the bedstead out, picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor - he said, "It is my book, I wonder how it came here" - it was dusty - the prisoner did not clean the bedroom windows - he came down and said he could not, as the sun was on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who cleaned out the house that Mr. White ran away from in Holborn? A. I do not know what you mean by running away - I cleaned the house before Mr. White left it - I swept part of it out - I did not find the keys there - I swear you told Mrs. White that Mr. White had sent you to clean the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I say I had nothing else to do, and had come to do them, as it was the last time I should do it? A. No.</p>

            . I am a police serjeant. The prisoner came with a policeman to the station-house about one o'clock on the morning of the 18th of June - he said he had come to give himself up for stealing several sums of money, but he was perfectly innocent - I booked the charge against him, and in the morning, when he was brought to go to Worship-street, he said he meant to retract what he had said about his innocence yesterday, and to plead guilty - I said I could not hear that, but if he said he was guilty, he might as well tell me where the property was - he said he had thrown the duplicates down a privy in Addle-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I say it was for stealing money? A. Yes, you did, and said I should find it in the Hue and Cry. I went, by the order of the magistrate, and examined the privy in Addle-street, but the soil was so thin, any thing would perish - there were two privies communicating with one vault, at least seven feet deep - it was impossible to find any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITE. I lost some pawnbroker's duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of February, I went to live with the prosecutor, who then lived in Holborn - about March, he told me he was going to run away - he asked me to assist him - I said I would, if it would not get me into disgrace - he said it would not - I removed his goods to No. 46, Spencer-street, and his stock to Addle-street - after that, he asked if I had any objection to going about the streets to sell them at different shops, and he would allow me something - I did so, and sold some - I went to Mr. Saunders, in Ratcliff-highway, and got rid of the whole stock for 25l. - he received the money himself, after which, he was thrown into prison - I went every where to seek to get him bail, and on the Wednesday or Thursday he was liberated, and went into the country till the 7th or 8th of May - while he was away, I quarrelled with his mother - I told her I meant to leave, as she called me names - he seemed sorry, and when White came home he quarrelled with his mother about it - I told him I should leave on Saturday, and on Saturday I did leave accordingly - I met a person that I knew, who said he was going into the country to sell some goods - he asked me to go with him - I said I could not leave that night, as I must shut up the place - he said, "Does your master owe you any thing?" - I said, "Yes," - he said, "Never mind, leave the key in the house, and so as you take nothing away, nothing will be hurt." - I went with him to Canterbury, and quarrelled with him because he would not pay what my master owed me. I returned to London, heard this charge was against me, and I immediately gave myself to the policeman - the policeman said nothing, at the examination, about my pleading guilty - I assure you, I am perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHERD. I am the prisoner's sister. Mr. White called on me three times about the money - the first time, I was not there; the second time, he called where I was employed, and a City policeman with him - he said my brother had robbed him - the policeman said it was 25l. in money, and 5l. in value - he said the money was his mother's - that he went to ask his mother for 5l., and his mother went for the money, and it was gone - the policeman was a dark man - he is not here.</p>

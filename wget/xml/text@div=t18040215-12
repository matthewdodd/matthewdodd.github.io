               <p>Q. On their coming, did you search your house? - A. I did, it was the front garret; the key was removed from the outside to the inside, and double-locked on the inside; Mr. Middleton broke it open; we found the room in great confusion; the locks were torn off the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - A. The bed-quilt was taken away; there were the marks of naked feet and toes on the floor, as though somebody had been there without shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the window of that garret? - A. It seemed to be pulled to, it was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you been in that garret before? - A. I am not sure; the morning after that I went to the watch-house, and there I saw two parcels; they were tied up and sealed.</p>

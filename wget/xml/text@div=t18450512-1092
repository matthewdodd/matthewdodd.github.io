On the 9th of May, about half-past one o'clock, I was in St. Paul's-churchyard—I saw the prisoners following a gentleman, and jones took this handkerchief out of his pocket—they ran off—I and Foay ran and caught them—I found this handker-chief on Jones—I had seen the colour of the handkerchief he took from the gentleman—it was this red one—I also found this blue handkerchief at the bottom of his trowsers—I do not know the name of the gentleman, for as we followed them he went away—when Jones took the handkerchief, Hester was close beside him—we had been watching the prisoners for four or five minutes—I could not say that they were talking together, but they were close together, and they ran away together.</p>

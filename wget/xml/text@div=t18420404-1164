                  </hi>. On Christmas-day last I lodged at the Stag public-house, Castle-lane, Westminster, and was in the tap-room that evening—the prisoner was there—I knew Thomas Quin, who is dead, he was there—there was drinking going on, and there was a fight between the prisoner and a man named Charles—Quin said to the prisoner, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, for fighting an old man so forward in liquor"—the prisoner was not forward in liquor—he immediately turned round, and struck Quin on the cheek-bone, under the right eye, with his fist, I be<lb></lb>lieve—the deceased fell on the floor from the blow—no other blow was struck by the prisoner—the deceased was helped up by the company, and complained of being in great pain in his ankle—he was put on the settle and sat down—he had been drinking, but not to excess, I believe—he seemed to have had sufficient—the fighting went on a little after, and then the room got quiet—the deceased did not fight at all—nobody touched him after that—I went away, leaving him there, and never saw him again.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of December I was at the Stag public-house—I went after ten o'clock—there was no fighting going on then—it was all quiet—I saw Quin sitting in one corner of the room on the settle—the prisoner was not there then—I remained there till after eleven, and carried Quin the principal part of the way home—he walked part of the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, York-terrace, York-street, Westminster. I knew Quin—he was brought home at eleven o'clock at night, and at eight next morning I took him up some tea—I found him lying on the bed not undressed—I was not in the habit of taking his tea up, but I went to see how his leg was, as it was so swollen the night before, and he could not pull stocking down—I saw him try to get it off, but he could not—I took him his breakfast—he drank a little tea, but he said he could eat nothing—he came down to my room about ten that morning (Sunday)—he had to get down stairs by his hands—he came shuffling down every step—he pulled his stocking off, and his leg was bathed in vinegar—it was very much swollen and very red—he seemed in a great deal of pain—he went to the hospital next morning on two brooms for crutches—I went with him and left him in the ward—I took him something in the afternoon, and saw him in bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-surgeon at Westminster-hospital I remember Quin being at the hospital—he was under my care four days after he was admitted, but not at first—he had a dislocation of the right ancle—the small bone of the leg was broken—that would be very likely to occur in being knocked down or falling by accident, or by a knock or push—he died in the hospital on the 6th of March—I attribute his death to a constitutional disturbance (being of a bad constitution) which the character of the accident would produce—the dislocation was produced two days before he was admitted to the hospital—if attended to earlier, his death might not have happened.</p>

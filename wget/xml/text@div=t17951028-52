               <p>Q. When had you seen it last before it was stolen? But a few days; I had seen it the Sunday before. I went out to work near a week, and left the care of the house to a little boy.</p>
               <p>Q. And was the prisoner at your house? - Yes, she lodged in my house, had a room, she and a custom house officer, whom I supposed to be her husband.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you produce the cloak? - Yes; the prisoner brought it to my master's house and pawned it for eighteen-pence, the 4th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. What day was it that you missed it? - I cannot tell particularly, because I was out, I went out on Monday, and I missed it when I can't home on Thursday; it was there on Monday.(Produced and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The bundle with the curtain and white cloak were both in a pocket handkerchief, and the other in another handkerchief. This gentlewoman knows as well as I do, very well, she was out a washing, and this waterman came to see me when I was at home, and this Mr. Liddle's chamber door was wide open, and he went in and threw himself on Mr. Liddle's bed, and two days afterwards he called on me and gave me a cloak to pawn, and I went and pawned them; and about a week afterwards he brought the curtains, and I pawned them.</p>
               <p>prosecutrix. My child told me that she had done an imprudent thing, in bringing a strange man into my apartment, and likewise laying on a bed she had no business with; I told her she had no business to let a strange man into my apartment.</p>

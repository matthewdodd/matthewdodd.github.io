(<hi rend="italic">These letters were translated by Mons. Albert; they were dated from 11, Meard's Court, Soho Square, signed "Guerin," and asserted that in consequence of services rendered to the late Emperor of the French he was entitled to 90,000 francs, and stated, "If you refuse me, sir, your refusal will cause your death and mine; understand I will kill you, and if I am killed at the same time as you, the proceedings in the lawsuit will nevertheless take their course. My frankness will prove to you that I do not fear any thing, not prisons, nor proceedings, nor execution."</hi>) I have received other letters signed "Guerin."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of the Criminal Investi<lb></lb>gation Department, Scotland Yard—on Saturday, 2nd August, I went to 11, Meard's Court, and saw the prisoner there—I told him, in French, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150067"></xptr>
               <p>I had a warrant for his arrest for writing threatening letters, threatening to kill M. Pietri—he made no reply, but became rather violent, and we had some difficulty in getting him aloog at first—after a time he became quiet, and we took him to the station—the charge was there read over to him—he said he would reserve what he had to say till he was before a Magistrate—I had seen him before, on 30th July, at Meard's Court—he opened the door to me, and asked me to come in—I refused—I said, "I come to warn you not to write any further threatening letters to M. Pietri"—he became very excited and shook his fist in my face, and said, "I am not afraid of the police or anybody else, and I will repeat to you what I have written to M. Pietri; I fear neither hanging, transportation, or imprisonment, and if M. Pietri will not give me the sum of money I ask for, I will be revenged, become an assassin, and kill him"—he then went on to say that for services he had rendered during the Empire, in giving information as to a plot against the life of the Emperor, a sum of 80,000 or 90,000 francs was promised him, and he expected that 80,000 or 90,000 francs from M. Pietri—he said if M. Pietri would give him even 50,000 francs he would return to France and not annoy him again, otherwise he would follow him about and annoy him, and he would write the whole history of the case to the Queen, to Lord Sydney, and others—he afterand said to me, "If you can induce M. Pietri to give me the sum I ask for, I will make you a handsome reward"—I then left him—I saw him write at the police station, and to the best of my belief those letters are his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not tell you that I was aware of the debt which the Emperor owed you, I never mentioned it—I did not say that M. Pietri told me that in order to be paid he would have to come to Paris and get the money—I did not tell you M. Pietri could have you convicted on the letters, and that you might, get 10 years' penal servitude—I said if you continued to annoy him by writing letters proceedings would be taken against you—I cautioned you not to write any more letters, nor go to Chiselhurst any more—I am not employed by the Imperial family or M. Pietri—I was at Chiselhurst on police duty during the life of the Emperor, not as an ageut—I never had a farthing from M. Pietri—it was after the statement you made to me on 30th July that I obtained the warrant—I am quite sure that you repeated the threats verbally to me as I have stated.</p>

Pietri, it being a debt due from the funds of the Empire; for that reason I addressed myself to him to complete the pay ment which M. Pietri and Count Clery had commenced. I had received the sum of 2.000 francs, which is not a sum given away in charity. Later on a sum of 20 I was paid to me by M, Pietri, which sum I did not accept as charity. As to the letter, I did not wish M. Pietri any harm, and beg it may be considered as null and void; all I want is to go back to France. The threats I used were used, by me only for the purpose of drawing M. Pietri's attention towards me."</p>

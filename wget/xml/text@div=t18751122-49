                  </hi>. I am a labourer at iron works and live at 3, Orchard Street, Blackheath—on 29th October, about 6.30 a.m., I saw the prisoner walking very fast in Davis Place, where he lives—he was calling out "Good bye, wife and child"—his wife was running after him in her night<lb></lb>dress, calling him back and asking him what he had done—he said "I have done it; I have cut my child's throat"—he said that he was going to give himself into the hands of the police—Simmonds asked him what he had done—he said "I have cut my child's throat go to my wife's assistance"—I followed the prisoner—he went towards the Blackheath Road, towards the station-house—I met Alter—I told him, and he took the prisoner—he was quiet going to the station.</p>

On 21st October Alter brought the prisoner to the station at Blackheath Road, Greenwich—Savage stated in the prisoner's hearing what he has to-day, but he said nothing then—I afterwards went to 2, Davis Place, Greenwich, and saw a child named Kate Charlotte Gower on a bed attended by Mr. Brock—another daughter of the prisoner gave me this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced)—I</hi> saw no marks on it, but it ap<lb></lb>peared</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and assistant to Mr. Roper, of 5, Lewis<lb></lb>ham Road, Greenwish—on 29th October, at 6.30,1 went to the prisoner's house and saw Kate Charlotte Gower, a girl 8 years of age, suffering from a long wound going from under her ear to her chin—there was a considerable amount of venous hemorrhage, but no artery was cut—it gradually got deeper and was deepest in the center—I dressed it temporarily, stopped the marriage, and sent her to Guy's Hospital—this razor—would inflict the wound—she is progressing favourably, but is not fit to come out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The nature of the paroxysms "would be such that he would not know what he was doing, and he would not be responsible—I cannot say whether a person suffering from such paroxysms would know the difference between right and wrong—it would be consistent with fact that when the paroxysms passed away he would know the effect of his actions, though he did not know he was doing wrong at the time—I think he would recollect the minute details—I think he would become suddenly aware of the nature of the act—I saw him before the Magistrate four hours afterwards—I should expect that sleeplessness, the product of bronchitis and consumption, would exhibit traces after it had produced a paroxysm of insanity, but I did not notice them in the prisoner when I saw him about 11 o'clock or 11.30—he looked careworn and depressed, but I cannot say whether he appeared as if he had suffered from a paroxysm—I have said "I cannot say that he exhibited any signs of a paroxysm"—he looked very worn, tired, and fatigued—I did not examine him for bronchitis or consumption.</p>

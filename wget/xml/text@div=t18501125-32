                  </hi>. I am the accountant of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway Company. I produce the cash-book of the Company—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I have looked through the cash-book—it was usually kept by the prisoner, I should say solely, from the time I took up the books of the Company—I find here an entry, in his hand<lb></lb>writing, of 17th Jan., 1848, of a payment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to a shareholder of the name of John Duncaft—I find by the examination of the books that Duncaft was entitled to interest at that time—interest warrants are first arranged alphabetically, according to the persons entitled to them; they are subsequently numbered consecutively, but the numbers never appear in the cash-book—this entry indicates that an interest warrant has been issued to a party who was entitled to it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is Duncaft's interest warrant, paid by the bankers—it is No. 29—there is an entry in the cash-book, on 12th Feb., of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to John Duncaft—this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), issued to Wingate, is the warrant applicable to that payment, paid by the bankers, and cancelled by them—(<hi rend="italic">this was numbered "113," and was for the payment of 4l. 9s. 10d. interest on the deposits on calls from 1st July, 1847, to 1st Dec.; the receipt was, "12th Feb., 1848.

I find an entry in the cash-book, in the prisoner's handwriting, of another sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid to Wingate; that is for interest upon calls from 1st July, 1847, to 1st Dec, in the first year; and it would be payable at the beginning of the following year—there could not have been two dividends payable to Wingate between 1st June and 1st Dec, 1847; nor could there have been two interest warrants issued to Duncaft or Wingate for the same time—the entry in the cash-book of the first warrant to Duncaft corresponds with the warrant—the entry of the second, on 12th Feb., applies to Wingate, and is entered in the cash-book to Duncaft—the cash-book is made up from the pass-book, it should be a fac-simile of the pass-book—the pass-book would pass through the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the pass-book</hi>)I find here an entry, on 17th Jan., 1848, of the payment by the bankers of Mr. Duncaft's interest—the entry is, "Jan. 17th, Duncaft, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—on 12th Feb. there is an entry of "No. 113, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—on 16th there is an entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as paid to Geo.

Wingate—when the bankers' pass-book is made up, the warrants are returned to the office, and would be in the hands of the clerks in the office when making up the cash-book—it is their business to do it from what is called cancelled vouchers, and the cash-book is checked by those cancelled vouchers—in the many pass-books that have come into my hands, I have found it almost invariably the case that they add up the amounts from time to time—(<hi rend="italic">it was stated that the pass-book was balanced up to 20th Feb</hi>).—I should say that the warrant for Duncaft's interest for 17th Jan. is signed by Mr. Meyer, the secretary, as far as I am able to judge from having seen a great deal of his writing—from the character of the writing, I should say it was filled up by the prisoner—the name "John Duncaft," and the "No. 29," and also the figures—the body of the receipt, I should say from the general character of the writing, is made up by John Duncaft, the person to whom the warrant is payable—that is what I understood to be the practice at that time—I do not know Duncaft—it is not the prisoner's writing—I believe the body of the receipt of 12th Feb. to be in the prisoner's handwriting—that purports to be signed by Meyer—I should say the date "12th Feb." is in the prisoner's writing—the word "five" is very much like his, and the "8" in 1848—part of this is printed, and part is written—I have my doubts about the signature, I cannot speak positively about it, from its general character, I should say it was his; I should be sorry to swear positively it was his—I have no doubt as to my opinion—my opinion is that it is the prisoner's signature—I believe the body of the warrant of the 18th Feb. to be in the prisoner's writing—it purports to be signed by Meyer, the secretary—the written part of the body of the receipt I believe to be the prisoner's writing: I speak more positively of that than the other, from the general character of his writing which 1 have met with—I think the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is his, and the signature also.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see him write, and see what he had written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did on the occasion I have spoken to, at the latter end of June, when he was making out this interest calculation—I saw what he had written at that time—I cannot cull to mind any other time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you formed your judgment on what you saw on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And from what I have seen him sign—I have seen his name signed in a letter-book</p>

               <p>—I have not seen him sign it—I have formed my judgment of his writing from comparison—I have gathered that that which I have com<lb></lb>pared, was his writing from knowing that he used to make up the cash-book—I understood from Mr. Meyer that it was the prisoner's duty to make up the cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay such attention at the rime you once saw him write, so as to form in your own mind a notion of his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did; it was a list of names that I then saw him write—it was under the letter "D," I think.</p>

               <p>him, nor did any one in my presence, that the solicitor for the prisoner had been there every day for the last week with a subpoena—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner's solicitor called once, yesterday morning, about twelve—he called with a subpoena to produce a letter I believe—I did not read it; I was told so—that might have been communicated to Mr. William Roy—I do not know that the solicitor or his clerk had been there for five or six days previously with a subpoena—we have about seventeen clerks in the office—I am repeatedly at the office of the Whitehaven Company about actions against shareholders—there is a good deal of that work, to make them pay up; it is rather difficult with some—that is what I have gene<lb></lb>rally been there about—I have been there on other business, to see Mr. Meyer the Secretary, and Mr. William Roy on various matters—I have then seen the prisoner there—I often saw him write—I saw him write repeatedly in the books, and write letters and documents, and write out an extract from a book for the purpose of obtaining information relative to the shareholders—Mr William Roy lives in Westbourne-terrace—there was a trial in Edinburgh some time ago—I had no quarrel with the prisoner on that occasion that I know of—I do not know what passed between Mr. William Roy and the prisoner—I do not know that there was an exact quarrel between them—I merely know that one or two words might have passed—I do not know that any words did pass; I did not hear any—it was necessary for the purposes of that trial that the minute-book should be taken to Edinburgh—I heard Mr. Roy direct the prisoner to take the book to the residence of Mr. Meyer the secretary—there was some memorandum or some writing to be put into the minute-book—Meyer was ill at home I believe, and it was taken to him to do it—I presume it was necessary that the minute should be in the secretary's handwriting, or it would not have been sent—the minutes of a day's proceedings are signed by the chairman at a subsequent meeting, or sometimes perhaps signed at the time, I do not know—Lord Lonsdale is the chairman—I believe the writing was put in—I do not recollect looking at it afterwards—Mr. Roy was not present when it was put in, nor was I—the prisoner received in<lb></lb>structions to take the book to the secretary's house and he did—what he did there I do not know—the instructions were given by Mr. Roy—I believe he told him what was to be done—I was in the room.</p>

               <p>it was not his province to do so—I was aware the man was very ill—I have no recollection of the prisoner saying to Mr. Roy that it would be attended with danger to his life if I took him—he mentioned casually to me that the man was very ill, and he thought it was a long journey for him—he died the day after he arrived at Edinburgh, before he could be examined—I never heard the prisoner tell Mr. Roy that he would charge him with having killed him, or anything of the kind—I know nothing of any directions given by Mr. Roy with reference to the income-tax—I do not know whether the income-tax is deducted in the interest warrants—I have not heard any conversation between the prisoner and Mr. Roy on the subject of the income-tax—I do not know that the prisoner charged Mr. Roy with having made false entries in the books, and appropriated considerable sums of money to own purposes—I'never heard that he made such a charge formally to Lord Lonsdale—I have never heard that from Mr. Roy, or anything of the kind—the prisoner told me that he had written a letter to Lord Lonsdale—what the exact statement was, I cannot say—it was not about the appropriation of moneys or the falsifica<lb></lb>tion of books; it was complaining of his being discharged—there was something said about the reasons for that, but not about falsification—there was something about the income-tax—the prisoner left I think in July, which was about three months after writing the letter—I did not see the letter—the prisoner produced a copy to me, and said he had written it to Lord Lonsdale—I do not know that an inquiry was instituted into Mr. Roy's conduct—when the prisoner was told by Mr. Roy to take the book to the secretary, I have no recollection of his saying, "O, then that is the reason why there is always a blank between the name of the chair<lb></lb>man and the last minute"—I believe he was perfectly aware of the reason for its being put in, and everything about it, as well as Mr. Roy—he made no remark to that effect, to my knowledge—he might, I do not recollect it—I did not hear him demur to going with the book—he took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am on the Stock Exchange, with my uncle. I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years—he has always borne a most excellent character—I was at school with him—I have known his handwriting—he was very intimate with my family—I have seen these documents at Mr. Roy's office, and examined them very closely—I do not believe the signatures to either of these receipts to be the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what respect does it differ from his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He writes a very stiff bold hand—the upper part of the warrants look more like his writing—I do not think one looks so much like as the other, but this of the 12th Feb. I should say distinctly is—it looks like it—it is his style of handwriting, decidedly; the top part is, but the bottom is certainly not, to the best of my knowledge—the top part of the warrant of 18th Feb. is like his writing—I could not exactly swear it, hut I should say it looks decidedly his style of writing—to the best of my belief, the bottom part is not the signature—I do not see that the filling-up of the receipt resembles his—it is a little stiffer than the other—it is decidedly not his style of writing, but the signature I should say decidedly was not his writing—I speak with confidence to the filling up of the receipt not being his—I do not speak so confidently to that as to the signature, because there is a little more firmness in the handwriting; that is the only difference—the signature is clearly not his writing; I say that from knowing his writing, by corresponding with him, and so on—I had had a letter from him perhaps about twelve months before this—I used to go now and then to see him at the Whitehaven and Furness Railway Company's, while he was clerk there, and I have frequently stood over him while he was writing—I cannot say whether the writing to these receipts appears feigned or not; that is rather difficult to say—I have been to see the prisoner while he lodged at Naylor's—I did not come here with Naylor to-day—I do not think the capital "H" in this signature to the receipt is like his writing—it is unlike it; it is not his style; his "H" is a stiffer one—I do not see any similarity between that "H" and his—this cash-book I should say decidedly is his writing, and you see there is the difference of the stiffness and style of writing—this entry of Duncaft's on 17th Jan. looks like his; it is the same style of writing—I think the entry of 12th Feb. is like his—I do not see any peculiarity in the figure 5 there—the figures 5 in the warrants I should say are not the same as that—I see several 5's in this page of the cash-book where the top part is not exactly touching—the figures 5 in the corner of the warrants are entirely different, one being so carefully written, and the other in so different a style.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness. I was at school with the prisoner—I have known him twelve or fourteen years—I believe I am familiar with his handwriting—I have frequently had cor<lb></lb>respondence with him—I went to Mr. Roy's office to see these two docu<lb></lb>ments—I do not believe the signature to this warrant of 12th Feb. to be in the prisoner's writing, nor the signature to this of the 18th—as to his character, I always considered it, as regards honesty, spotless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a Foreign Exchange broker. I have frequently met him within the last twelve months, and I have seen writing of his within the last twelve months, something between six and twelve times—to the best of my belief, the body of the receipt of 18th Feb. is not in the prisoner's writing—I should say it is not at all like his writing—the 5 is not as he makes his 5—according to my knowledge of his writing, the signature "Geo. H. Wingate" is not his—he does not make his "H" in that way—I have not paid particular attention to the formation of his letters, but certainly this does not appear to me like his writing—the upper part is the prisoner's writing—the "H" in "Geo. H. Wingate" there is as he usually writes, but not the other—if he wrote a letter to me, it would be written in the style of the upper part—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper handed to him by Mr. Parnell, folded down</hi>) to the best of my belief, this is not his writing—(<hi rend="italic">opening it</hi>) I should still say it is not his, neither the filling up nor the signature—the body of the receipt of 12th Feb. is decidedly not his writing—it appears to be the same handwriting as the body of the warrant—I should say the receipts to both warrants appear to be in a feigned hand—there is a distinction between the handwriting on that of the 18th and that of the 12th—one appears to me not written in the same hand as the other—if there is any likeness at all to his, it is in that of the 18th, but I do not consider there is any at all.</p>

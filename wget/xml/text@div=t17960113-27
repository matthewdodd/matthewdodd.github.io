               <p>Mr. Raine. May it please your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury; you have already collected, from my learned friend, the nature of the charge which this indictment imputes to the two prisoners at the bar; namely, that of a burglary committed in the dwelling-house of Miss Merriel Neville and

            . Gentlemen, you cannot but be well aware that this is a capital offence; and I state this to you in the outset by way of requesting your most serious attention to a charge of such magnitude; involving, as you very well know, the lives of the two men at the bar; the interests of the persons for whom I have the honour to be concerned; and, what is still more, the interests of the public.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances of the case are briefly these: the two persons, for whom I appear before you, in the conduct of this prosecution, are Miss Merriel Neville and Miss Ann Neville, two maiden ladies, jointly occupying a house, situated in <placeName id="t17960113-27-crimeloc153">Portugal-street, Grosvener-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17960113-27-crimeloc153" type="placeName" value="Portugal-street, Grosvener-square"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t17960113-27-crimeloc153" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960113-27-off149 t17960113-27-crimeloc153"></join>: these two ladies went, according to their usual custom, out of town, for the summer, after securing, as far as locks could secure, the house, and the property contained in that house; they left their keys also, according to their usual custom, in the possession of a neighbour, who was good enough, in their absence, to take care of the house, a Mr. Slack, a hatter, in South Audley-street, which is in the same neighbourhood. On the 19th of November, the day after a storm, which you, Gentlemen, may remember, raged most seriously in and about this metropolis, Mr. Slack thought it necessary to go to the house in question, imagining that it might have sustained some damage from the violence of the hurricane; this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; upon going into the house, he found that one of the locks, by which the outer door was secured, had been forced; namely, the patent lock, the other had been opened by means of a master key, a picklock, or some such instrument; the key had been left in his possession; he let himself into the house, and found every thing in great confusion; the locks broke, and many things packed up: this alarmed him considerably; and, after securing the outer door, he went to Bow-street, for instructions how to act; he was advised to watch the house, for that, in all probability, those persons who had packed up the articles in question, ready to be taken off, would come in the course of the evening, to take them away; he accordingly was upon the watch, assisted by several of his friends; on the evening of that day, at six o'clock, he discovered a light in one of the rooms; in consequence of this, he went to the door, found it still locked by the single lock, he opened it with the key which he had in his possession, let himself and friends in, and discovered a light in the passage; a tinder-box, and other articles, which will be mentioned to you by the witnesses; upon his advancing to the stairs, he heard a cry of persons from above, saying "shoot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130045"></xptr>"them, damn them, shoot them." Mr. Slack, in company with his son, and some other persons, immediately went up stairs, and pursued the persons who had raised this cry into the back drawing-room, from thence into the front drawing-room, and there a scuffle ensued; after considerable resistance, however, they secured the two men who now stand at the bar; and there is reason to believe there was a third; who contrived to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, you will be told by the learned Judge, that if I make out in evidence, what I have just now stated to you, that all the essentials, that constitute what is in law called a burglary, will be satisfied, as laid in this indictment; for you see, Gentlemen, that what was done was done in the night time, after darkness had set in; the door; after having been secured by a lock, was opened, and several articles removed from the place where they had been found, that very day, by Mr. Slack, with a view to be taken off; and that the learned Judge will tell you is sufficient to satisfy the allegations of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is proper that I should apprize you of the defence which these men have already set up; but I apprize my learned friends, that I shall most satisfactorily negative such defence; they pretended to say, that they were let in at the same time that Mr. Slack and his friends were let in to the house, with a view to apprehend the plunderers. Now Mr. Slack will tell you, and so will his son, and all those whom I shall call; that it was utterly impossible for the men at the bar, who were secured in the house, and I will remind you, that it was after resistance that they were secured; it was impossible for them to have got, up stairs before Mr. Slack and his friends, for he was the first person that went up stairs; and he will swear most positively, that it was utterly impossible for these men to have got into the house at the time he unlocked the door. If I prove these facts to your satisfaction, you can have no manner of doubt about the guilt of the prisoners at the bar; and a burglary itself, abstractedly considered from the circumstances that attend this case, is an offence of so alarming a nature, that I am sure you will think it deserves your most serious attention; and when you consider the immense quantity of property, of which those ladies have been plundered, and property of considerable value, of which they were meant also to be plundered.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend reminds me, and very properly, I thank him for it, that I should not endeavour to make any undue impressions upon your mind; it is far from my intention to do so; I only wish to excite your serious attention to a cause of such magnitude; and when it involves the interests of the public, and of those for whom I am concerned; but I wish you only to attend to the evidence; I desire of you to efface from your recollection all that I have stated to you that is not supported by evidence; I will call the witnesses, and you will dispose of it as you think proper.(The witnesses were examined apart.)</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH GIBBS sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. Are you not the house-keeper of Miss Neville? - A. I am her cook and house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with her on the 19th of July last? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you and the family leave town? - A. The ladies, the two Miss Nevilles, left the house on Friday the 17th of July last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house? - A. In Portugal-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you leave town? - A. I left it on Monday the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did the Miss Nevilles leave in the house? - A. Me and my fellow servant, the house-maid.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last person that went out of, town? - A. I was the last person out of the door; I left every fastening fast, that could be fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. All the inner doors of the house were locked? - A. They were, and the keys all put on a string, and given to Mr. Slack, in Mount-street, which is just by our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many door locks, or nearly, you locked that day? - A. I cannot recollect, there might be ten, I dare say, or more, I have not reckoned up the number of doors, but they were all locked, except the middle drawing-room door, and the two pair of stairs middle door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself fasten the outer door? - A. Yes; I did it myself, there are two locks on it, a patent lock and a common lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten both those locks? - A. Yes; I double locked them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the common lock in the way you did the patent? - A. I locked the patent lock first, I double locked it and tried it with the common lock after: I sprung the common lock back to be sure that the patent lock was secure.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then with the common lock? - A. I double locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular manner in which you fastened the patent lock? - A. There is a pipe that turns round; after I had locked it, I put the keys on the string with the others, and gave them to Mr. Slack, in Mount-street, at the same time with the others; I left the house about eleven in the morning; the house-maid stood and held the other keys while I locked the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house is this house? - A. It is the house of Miss Merriel and

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. I live in South Audley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near Portugal-street, Grosvenor-square? - A. It makes one side of Portugal-street; they join each other, in short.</p>
               <p>Q. They are both in one parish? - A. Yes: St. George's, Hanover-square.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the habit of taking care of the house of the Miss Nevilles during their absence in the country? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the Miss Nevilles left London last summer? - A. I cannot say exactly; the keys were delivered to me by the last witness, Mrs. Gibbs, the day they went out of town; but I don't know exactly when; I believe it was in July.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you these keys in your own possession during the whole of the summer? - A. I had them locked up in my own drawers, previous to the 19th of November last; there had been a high wind, and I was apprehensive there might have been some tiles blown off the house; and I went to the house upon the 19th, about three o'clock in the afternoon; and when we came to the door, we found it only on a single lock; my youngest son, William Slack, was with me, who is a witness here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many locks were there to the door? - A. Two: one a patent lock, which had been spoiled; it was forced open, and the box where the lock goes into, was forced out; the door was only secured by the other lock, and that was only upon the single lock. The first thing we saw in the house, was a feather-bed, a bolster, and two blankets, I believe they were, but they were tied up in one, the four corners were tied together; they were brought down into the passage, what we call the hall; we looked into the parlour, and that was all in distress, every paper in every drawer was thrown about, so I would go no further till I had called in some neighbours; the parlour doors were both open; in the fore parlour, there was an harpsichord, and upon that, several empty bottles, and six glasses; there was a looking-glass taken out of a paper-machee frame, and laid upon the table; I cannot speak to any more in that parlour, but in the back parlour, that door was forced open, and the cheek of the door split; every drawer had been opened, and every paper thrown about the room; you could not set a foot but you must tread upon papers; and the library was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any further? - A. We went all over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nobody in the house? - A. There was nobody in the house, upon my honour; the back drawing-room door had been forced to; I had the key of that, and every room; I saw nothing particular in that room, there being no drawers, or things of that sort. We went then into the front drawing-room, I did not observe any force there; that door went out of one room into the other, there was no drawers to open there neither. I found an ornament glass, that was over the chimney-piece broke, the paper was stripped off some large pier glasses; we then went to the two pair of stairs front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a bed-room? - A. Yes; the door of that, room had been forced open; at least, it was open; I am not certain it was forced, every thing had been opened, every drawer, and every little box with curiosities thrown under their feet; there was a bureau, and every drawer in it had been opened, and the lock spoiled; and if there was a little cabinet-box with curiosities, or any thing of that sort, it was thrown under their feet; the back room we found in the same confusion, and every drawer opened; I do not recollect whether the door of that was forced or not. We then went into the garrets, and found every thing in the same confusion; every box opened; I believe not a servant's box, or any thing, but what had been opened; the beds were in confusion, and every thing in the same state as every other room; I should have told you, that, by the door of the second floor is a closet, where the linen was: the door was open, and the chest containing the linen was broke open, and every thing in it taken out; we saw that before we went into the garrets.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know, of your knowledge, that there had been any linen in that chest? - A. I do not know; all the garrets were in the same confusion. We went into the kitchen, and from there into the housekeeper's room below stairs; I don't know whether it is a pantry, or what they call it, that was in the same state of confusion as the rest. Underneath the kitchen stairs, we found an iron chest, which was turned on one side; we went to the back wine-cellar, and found the door open; I don't know whether it was picked or not, there were several empty bottles, but not one with any thing in; we fastened the doors of such rooms as were not broke below stairs; I left every thing in the state I found it; I did not move a paper, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any property in any part of the house, exclusive of this bed and blankets that you described? - A. I don't recollect any other cir<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130047"></xptr>cumstance: the beds were all gone up stairs; we searched every part of the house, and there was not a creature in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before you came away, take particular notice of the situation in which you left every thing? - A. I believe what I have told you is as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house, what did you do? - A. We secured the outer door by the single lock: it is a spring lock, so that it was double locked.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it you quitted the house? - A. Past three o'clock; but I cannot say how much. When I was going to Justice Addington, by St. James's church, it was just four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go immediately from this house to Justice Addington's? - A. I might stop at my own house ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some advice you received from Mr. Addington, did you, or not, watch the house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to, and who went with you? - A. Nobody went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to watch the house, where did you go to? - A. To the next door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might elapse between your going to Mr. Addington's and returning to this door? - A. I went home as quick as I could; I cannot say how long I might stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home before you went to the house? - A. Yes; I went to the next door to this house, and staid there till five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was you within the house at the next door? - A. I was both within it, and at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you make any particular observation at that time upon the house of the Miss Nevilles? - A. No; I saw nothing stir then; I came home then, and finished a letter to the Miss Nevilles; that is, I directed my son to do it; I staid at home to finish the letter; my wife sent the maid to the house first.</p>
               <p>You must not tell us that. - A. I returned to the house about six o'clock; I had several neighbours with me; and we observed a light in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing like a light in the parlour when you was there before at five o'clock? - A. I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the window fast where the shutters shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you see it through the shutters? - A. I cannot say I did myself, my eyes are not very good; when we observed the light, we got some assistance: I myself went to one public house, and my sons went to some others, till we had got, I suppose, a dozen people together; but I carried them as hush as I could, as if we meant to rob the house ourselves. We got lights; and I kneeled down to the key-hole all this time that the people were assembling, to see if I could see any thing stir; I saw the glimmering of a light come out at the parlour door, but saw nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - A. I asked the people at the door if they were ready to go in with me; I had not tried the lock at that time; they said they were, and I immediately opened the door with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn the lock once, or twice? - A. Only once; I found it was only pushed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure it was turned twice when you left it? - A. Yes; I went in myself first, all along the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light with you then? - A. Yes; I saw two lights burning in the parlour upon the harpsichord; I did not go into the parlour, my son brought one of the lights out of the room, I stood at the bottom of the stairs; I looked in the back parlour, and there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in the passage? - A. Nothing but the bed and blankets, that we left in the passage, remained in the same place. Just as we proceeded to go up stairs, there were some voice called out,"Shoot them, damn them," and stamped repeatedly.</p>

            Where did those voices come from? - A. From the second landing-place at the drawing-room door, they repeated it over and over a great many times, and stamping with the feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You are confident these noises proceeded from above? - A. Yes; I am very certain. I made answer to that, "Oh damn you, I will shoot you."</p>
               <p>Q. Who went up stairs first? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light with you? - A. Yes; plenty: I had a candle in one hand, and a cutlas in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Any lanthron? - A. There was one in company, but I had it not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to slate, positively, you were the first person that went up stairs? - A. Yes; I went up two or three stairs, I did not get up stairs first; but I went up two or three stairs before any body else of my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to state, that when you first proceeded to go up stairs, none of your party could have passed you? - A. I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. No person whatever could have gone up without your knowing it? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. State to us, distinctly, what you did in going up stairs? - A. They met us near the first landing-place; when I said, "Damn you, I'll shoot you," they retreated.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see them retreat? - A. I cannot say, it being candle-light, and I am be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130048"></xptr>tween fifty and sixty; I cannot say that I saw them till we got into the back drawing-room; we ran as hard as we could run up stairs</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And met no person upon the stairs? - A. No, not till we got there; my son being very active, got up before me; and another of the witnesses got up before me, I forget his name, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that you was third then? - A. I was third up stairs; the prisoners made into the back drawing-room, and from thence into the front drawing-room; I saw them there very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any light with them? - A. No; I saw them making out of one room into the other, for we came up very near them then: the; door opens from one room into the other, they pushed to the door that goes into the front drawing-room, the other witness got his foot in, and my son his arm in, so that they could not get it to; the first light that was carried up was knocked out, the prisoner Abbot knocked it out before he got into the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the light in his hand? - A. I am not sure whether it was either my son or the other witness; his name is Harvey.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear that it was Abbot? - A. I believe it was; I am sure it was one of the two, but I believe it was Abbot, I never saw him before that time; when they found they could not get the door shut, they got to arms: there was a kind of flower-bench, like steps, that the Ladies had been used to put flowers upon, that stood in the middle of the room; I believe it was the tall one (Vandercom), but I am not sure, got this flower-stand for steps, to get the bar of the window down; and the other had got a table, or a chair, to make some resistance with.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him lay hold of the iron bar? - A. Yes, I did; I attacked the man with the iron bar; he was cut on his arm, and he dropped the iron bar, and I immediately picked it up.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you cut him? - A. No, I did not; I don't know who it was that did.</p>
               <p>Q. And was that man secured? - A. He was secured almost immediately; he ran to help the other, and I think they sought with a table and a chair; but they were soon overpowered, for one of them was cut down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both secured? - A. Yes; in a little time.</p>
               <p>Court. Which was the man that had the iron bar? - A. I am not certain, but, I think, it was Vandercom; they were both cut across the arm, while they were fighting: this knife was found under them, by my eldest son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Then you must say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoners were secured, did you take notice of any of the property? - A. Between the time I was there in the afternoon, and that time, the carpet in the back room had been began to be taken up; that was all that I observed; it covered the room; it was nailed down to the floor; when I saw it again it was out across the door, and the nails left in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other alteration in this carpet? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe besides, about any other part of the property? - A. I believe, no more than what I told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any curtains? - A. Yes; the curtains were found packed up in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were those curtains the first time you went down? - A. I did not observe them then; they were found in that situation by another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any curtains upon any bed? - A. I am very certain I saw none; and I took; notice that the beds were gone; and there was nothing remained but the bedsteads.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any other part of the property? - A. No, I don't recollect any thing but what I have told you already.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to us of a chest, in a closet under the stairs? - A. The iron chest had not been opened, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it when you first went to the house? - A. Yes; I looked particularly, expecting that might have been done something to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it the second time? - A. Yes; and it was in the same situation that I left it in, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. All this took place upon the 19th of November? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the house it was about six o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did the darkness set in that night? - A. It was almost dark when I came from the door at five o'clock, and the candles were lighted in my shop when I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you went, who was with you? - A. My youngest son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go all over the house with you? - A. He did; and my eldest son, and some other neighbours besides.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here? - A. No; I would not go in alone; I thought my character might be injured; I went alone, first; but, upon finding the room in confusion, I would not go any further; I took some neighbours in with me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130049"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe, from the time the keys were delivered to you, by the housekeeper, down to the 19th of November, you had never gone into this house? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. About five o'clock you quitted your watch upon this door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, you say, it was not dark? - A. I said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at five o'clock, when you quitted the door? - A. It was so dark that the candles were lighting.</p>
               <p>Q. But you know we light candles when there is a good deal of light out of doors? - A. We don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have seen the face of your son, if he had been there, outside the door? - A. I might possibly, I don't doubt that I could, if it was ever so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is this, whether, by the remainder of day light that then existed, could you have distinguished the features of any man? - A. Yes; I dare say you might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this house appear to you to be entered by the door? - A. I am very sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. By means of some key? - A. I told you it must have been forced.</p>

            But after you had left it? - A. Yes; or a pick, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, the lock was opened without doors? - A. I don't doubt but it was; they could not get in without a key, or a pick, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. So that that is almost an instantaneous operation; you may do it in a minute as well as in an hour? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if any body was upon the watch, they could have entered in a minute? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. As to this instantaneous operation, did I understand you right, when you said, you left it double-locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found it single locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us exactly at what time the sun let that night? - A. I cannot exactly to a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. The sun set at fifty-two minutes before five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Supposing there had been no lamps, do you think you could have distinguished, at this time, the features of a man? - A. I suppose I could, but I had no idea of taking such particular notice.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. We wish to know, if he must not be very near a person, to distinguish his features at that time?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what distance do you apprehend? - A. I suppose so; but not making any observation of the sort, I did not think of it.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck Q. Do you recollect, on the 19th of November last, going to the house of Misses Neville? - A. Yes; I went with my father, to see if any damage had been done to the house by the high wind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon any other property in the house? - A. Yes; I took notice that in the back garret there were some red curtains tied up in a black bag; they were lying upon a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. On a bed, or on the bedstead? - A. On the bed, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observation upon any property about the house? - A. A looking glass taken out of a frame in the front parlour; the frame was left up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave all the things in the house in the situation in which you found them? - A. I did; not moving any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did you know they were red curtains, if they were tied up in a bag? - A. I undrawed it, to see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any further observation upon any property? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the house with your father? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your father secure the door? - A. I secured it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it secured? - A. I left it the same way as I found it; I think it was me that locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. I am pretty sure of it; as I brought the key home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time that afternoon did you return to the house? - A. We were in till almost four, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your father, or you, that went out first? - A. I think I did, to fetch my brother, for I left my father in the house; I ran home immediately, to tell my brother of it, and our man.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went out of the door first? - A. That was before I searched the house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130050"></xptr>Q. When you went away, after searching the house, who went out of the door first? - A. There were several neighbours; but, I believe, I was the last in the house; I think I locked the door.</p>

               <p>Q. When you opened the door, was it single locked, or double? - A. Single locked, when I went the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a spring lock? - A. I only turned it once round.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing, at four o'clock, when you left the house, you had not put the key into the door, and shut the door, would it have shut? - A. It would.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was so pulled to, did you turn the key once after it was shut with the spring lock? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you return to that house? - A. Nearly six o'clock; it was after I had had my tea.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned to the house, who was in company with you? - A. A young man of the name of Burch; he is not here; my father was with me; I had had my tea; the maid came for me, and I went to my father, in Portugal-street, nearly fronting the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body else pass your father, at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the parlour, what did you perceive? - A. There were two candles alight upon the harpsichord; I took hold of one of them; and when I came out of the parlour, I heard some voices above, and stamping of feet, as if they were coming down stairs, to meet us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it a wooden stair-case, or stone one? - A. A stone one; I then heard somebody holloa out, "Damn them, shoot them," two or three times: it appeared to come from the second landing-place.</p>

               <p>Q. By that second landing-place, do you mean the landing-place of the drawing-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you come out of the parlour with the candle, where was your father? - A. He stood at the bottom of the stair-case; he might be up one or two of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person pass your father, when he was at the bottom of the stairs, or upon one of the stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person go up stairs? - A. Yes; Harvey and me immediately pushed by my father, and ran up stairs; I then had a glimpse of one or two men, turning back to the front drawing-room door, I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harvey follow them likewise? - A. Yes; and my father immediately after him; just as they got into the back drawing-room door, they knocked out the candle, which I had in my hand, they then opened the door that leads into the front drawing-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then it was a door between the two drawing-rooms that they had got into, when they knocked out the candle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who knocked it out of your hand? - A. I cannot say, positively, which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what sized man it was? - A. I did not take that notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them into the front drawing-room? - A. Yes; they then shut to the door, and held it against us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they entirely shut the door? - A. They shut it against Harvey's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else but Harvey's arm prevent their shutting the door? - A. Our pushing against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you push the door open? - A. We waited about half a minute, till the others came up; we pushed against the door, and they pushed against us; and then they ran away from the door, and we got into the front drawing-room; the first that I saw was the prisoner, Abbot.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Abbot? - A. It was the least of those two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen between you and Abbot? - A. No; I then saw Vandercom, which is the big one, coming from the window; he came round Abbot, took up a pembroke table, and struck me in the face with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lights? - A. Yes, several; there was a young man had a lanthorn, close behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about this being Van<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130051"></xptr>dercom that struck you? - A. No, I will swear to that; I cut him over the arm, and he dropped the table; I struck him again, he staggered, and I collared him; I believe I cut the other, for I struck at them both; Vandercom tried to strike at me several times with his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assisted you? - A. Bagley and Lawless, Harvey had got hold of Abbot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both secured? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were secured, did you make any observation upon any property? - A. No; I saw my brother take up a knife from under his feet; I sat up in the parlour all the night afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, after they were secured, did you make any observation upon any property in the house? - A. I took notice of the harpsichord, which was broke, the lid of it was broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned, that in the morning you saw some red curtains? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the curtains that night, after the men were secured? - A. No; I saw them the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them the next morning? - A. In the same place I saw them in before, upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Having made your observation in the morning, as to the situation of the property, did you observe any alteration in the property in the evening? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation at all, during the course of the night that you sat up, where any of the property lay? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now endeavour to recollect and tell me, whether you made any observation upon any property in the house, during the course of that evening? - A. I did not, any further than the piece of music that I mentioned; there were several small things thrown out, which were put upon different places, that I should imagine did not belong to those places.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that the red curtains were in something in the morning? - A. In a black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that black bag when you came in the evening? - A. No; I saw it the next morning in the same place where it was left.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told my learned friend, that the first time you went to this house was near three; there is no difficulty in ascertaining that it was light then? - A. Yes, it was light then.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the house at nearly four? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not dark then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed no alteration in the property, between the time you saw it first, and the time you left it? - A. None.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. You went to the house of Misses Neville, with Mr. Slack and some others, on the 19th of November? - A. Yes; between five and six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then dark? - A. It was dusk, the lamps were lighting, Mr. Slack opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. The old Mr. Slack? - A. Old Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>Q. He went in first? - A. Yes; and I and the rest of the people followed him directly; young Mr. Slack went into the parlour where the lights were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was old Mr. Slack? - A. He went along the passage to the stairs; I don't know who was first at the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing? - A. Yes; a noise of stamping with the feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that stamping? - A. Up stairs, and I heard somebody cry out, "shoot, shoot the rascals."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lights with you at this time? - A. Yes; we made a stop about three steps up the stairs; I immediately took a cutlass in my hand from some other person, and I followed the voices up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see first? - A. The two gentlemen, the thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and see if you can see them? - A. That big gentleman, that stands there (Vandercom) and that little gentleman (Abbot) were in the room, the first door as you turn in upon the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the front or back drawing-room? - A. The back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to any of the lights? - A. No; I went to go into the other room, and they held the door; I got my arm in and it was bruised very much; we at last overpowered them; and they left the door and went into the room, and then there was a hat pulled off, and a candle knocked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hat was it? - A. I believe it was that little gentleman (Abbot's.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one of the men? - A. It was one; I then called for another light to come up, and held the door in my hand; when I got into the room, I saw him taking a bar down from the window, he let it fall, and took hold of a pair of steps, and struck me; I immediately struck him with a cutlass; they fought very much, they were at last secured.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to abandon the burglary?</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. A. My Lord, I feel that we cannot establish it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130052"></xptr>Mr. Trebeck. I trust, that if we can produce evidence, that any piece of property was removed, and the Jury believe that it was removed by those persons who were found in the house, it being left in a state of security, that is evidence to go the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, the party must not be surprized, by the charge he is now called upon to answer; the prisoners at the bar are called upon to answer a burglary, and a larceny connected with circumstances, which may, or may not deprive them of their benefit of clergy, My Lord, it appears to me that they are now about to point out a perfectly distinct felony to that which they before called upon the prisoners to answer.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. It seems to me to be a perfectly distinct felony.</p>

            . After the house was entered by these men, nothing was actually taken away, even in the construction of law; you lay a charge of breaking the house, and stealing the goods; most unquestionably that may be modified, by shewing that the goods were stolen, though the house was not broke; but it must be connected with the breaking; you are now connecting the prisoner with a prior and antecedent felony, committed before three o' clock; after having tried to convict them of the burglary, and stealing the goods, now, you say, for the purpose of going for the other, that they neither broke the house, nor stole the goods then, but that at another time they stole the goods; and that this is evidence of it, that they were found in the house; this is surely a distinct thing, it is as distinct as any thing can be; any felony, committed by these people, in this house, seven years ago, might as well now be gone into; your indictment has decided it. If you had proved the removal, which you have not been able to do, of those curtains which are proved to have been lying upon the bed in a black bag, and of which he saw enough to identify them; if instead of the bed, those curtains had been found in the passage, that would have been a sufficient removal; after breaking the house, you would then have made out a case, and the only question would have been as to the burglary.</p>

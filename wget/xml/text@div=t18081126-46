I told the boy never to take any thing out without my knowledge.

The boy told me that he was going to carry this bundle to No. 29 in the alley. Afterwards, as I was going to lodge her in the counter, she told me that she was going to be married, and that the property she had stole was for her own use that she had defrauded her mistress of; she told me it was her own apron, and begged me to give her the apron. After I went to her lodgings I was informed she was going to be married to some man, and that she had a husband at sea.</p>

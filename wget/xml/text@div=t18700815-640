               <p>showed me a half-crown, and said "This person has just given me this bad half-crown"—the prisoner took it out of her hand, and said "I will take it back where I got it from"—she left the shop, and I followed her to 125, Alexandra Road, which was about 300 yards—she did not go into any place before she got there—she spoke to a woman there, and went into the home—it was a doctor's house—Darvell came to the door while the prisoner was in, and I spoke to her—the prisoner came out shortly after, and I said I was a policeman, and I should take her in custody for trying to pass a bad half-crown—I was in plain clothes—she said "Very well," and at the same time I took the bad half-crown out of her hand—she said "Come and bad a drop of something to drink, and let me go"—I gave her into the custody of 62<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the bad half-crown, and we all three went back to the shop.</p>

I saw my sow safe on the 6th of December, while I was cleaning the sty, about twelve o'clock; I turned her into the yard; she cost me 5l. before she pigged: when I had done the sty I could not find her; and about ten o'clock at night I received information, and found her next day, at Blakeway's, a hog-keeper, at Shadwell; she never strayed - she is worth more than 3l.</p>

            . I am a wine-cooper. Between four and five o'clock on the 6th of December, I saw the prisoners driving this sow in Tower-street - I knew it to be the prosecutor's; I went up and asked Baron if it was for sale - he said it was, and asked 2l. 10s. for it: Crudgington was close by, and must have heard this; I offered 2l. - he hesitated, and then said I should have her, and asked where I lived; I said, in the Hackney-road - that I could not take her home then, but would call for her that evening or in the morning, and asked where I should find her; he said at Blakeway's, a pig-dealer, at Ratcliff-highway. I lodge with the prosecutor, and when I went home I told him; he and I went to Blakeway's next morning, and found it; we then went to the prisoners' premises, and they were not there - we left word that we had come to pay for the sow, and in a few minutes they came running down to Blakeway's, for the money, and were taken.</p>

I live with my uncle Ebenezer Jewsbury - I was in his shop on the 24th of February - I heard a fowl scream - I ran out, and saw Joseph Habberfield with a fowl in his hand, which he said belonged to his mother - I ran after him, and took him - he threw the fowl down, and some men persuaded me to let him go, which I did - the fowl was my uncle's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Have you a sister? A. Yes - the fowl was not hers, but my uncle's - there was no person with Joseph Habberfield when I saw him.</p>

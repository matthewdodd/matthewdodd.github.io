                  </hi>. I carry on business as a jeweller and dealer in plate, in Finsbury-circus—on July 24th, about 10 o'clock in the morning the two prisoners came into my shop—it has a counter in it—I was behind the counter when they came in—I knew Sideman—I had seen him before—he came in for some particular kind of watch—I showed him some, and he said they were not the kind that he wanted—he spoke in English—at that time I had a parcel on my counter, containing about thirty pairs of ear<lb></lb>rings, wrapped up in paper—there was nobody else in the shop besides me and the two prisoners—when they said that the watches would not do, I turned to the shelf, a little way off, to get some more—they looked at them, and they both said they were not the kind they wanted—I showed them other watches, and they picked out one—I think Sideman asked the price—it was handled by Sideman, and Pollack took it in his hand too—I said the price was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Sideman said he did not know whether it would suit; he would leave me a sovereign and take it on approbation—he offered me a sovereign, and I said I only sold watches—when they could not get the watch of me they left the shop—I immediately looked for the parcel of ear-rings on the counter, and missed it—there had been nobody in my shop while they were there, from the time I saw the parcel to the time I missed it.</p>

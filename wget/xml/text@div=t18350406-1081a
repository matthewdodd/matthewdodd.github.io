                  </hi> I am a policeman. I went with Banister and Ford, on the 3rd of April, to a house in St. John's-buildings—I put my head into the front parlour, and saw the prisoner sitting on her heels, before the fire, rubbing something in her hand, and there was some sand on the hearth—she saw me in about a minute, and seemed to be frightened—I asked her where Pantling was—(that is a man she had been living with)—she said she did not know—she rose up and put something into her mouth—I seized her, and after a great struggle, she threw some counterfeit money out of her mouth—she then rose up and dropped another piece from her right hand—I said, "Where did you get this bad money?"—she said, "I got them from Oliver, and he has done me"—Banister and Ford flew to Oliver's house, but he was gone out.</p>

Bosley had had some of us before. I told them we had none at present, but should have some in a few days. I then desired Bosley to go to our back shop and fetch a little charcoal, as the fire was getting low; in the mean time, a lady came in and asked to look at some articles - she staid a long time looking at them, and said she was about taking a lodging in the neighbourhood, and wanted to buy some stoves, iron saucepans, and other things - the prisoner Molineaux was in the shop all the while. I at length said to the lady, "I will thank you to be as quick as you can as my fire is going out." The lady went into the passage where there were some stoves, and at length went away, and took a saucepan with her which came to 8 d., but she had but 7 d. - I said it was of no consequence; when I returned to the shop, I heard Molineaux say to the other prisoner - "Come, Betsy, let us go, you know where we have to go." They then went away, and in a short time Bosley came back to my shop, and putting her hands together said, "Oh Lord! oh Lord! that girl has robbed you." I said, it cannot be - she said, she has indeed. I then ran into the room and took a canister in which we keep some money - I thought there was the same money in it as before - Bosley then said, "Come to me at the Black Horse public-house, for that girl has four sovereigns" - it then struck me that we had been looking over our money on the Sunday, and had put away four sovereigns and some silver which made up 7 l. 19 s. 6 d., which we had been collecting towards a bill - I then went to a drawer where the money had been deposited, and found it opened very easily - I cannot swear that it had been locked - I looked in the drawer, and found that the money and the box that contained it, were gone - I then proceeded with Bosley to the Black Horse public-house in York-street, where we found Molineaux with a bundle - the landlady said, "Master, if you will look in that bundle you'll find some property of yours" - I looked in and found the four sovereigns and the box, but the little plated mug, where we keep the silver, I found in the room; but Mr. Rose was there, and he said, "You had better fetch her back." I did so, and then went to Mr. Friend; the other articles in the bundle were mine - there is some solder which I believed to be mine, but cannot swear to it. The money had been in the second drawer, in the nest of drawers in the bed room near the shop - we had seen it safe on the Sunday evening, and this was on the Tuesday. Molineaux was in the shop, but I cannot swear that she was there all the time Bosley had been sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020070"></xptr>to get some charcoal, but she came back and they were both in the shop for five or six minutes. I had known Bosley by visiting my shop, and knowing her parents I trusted her.</p>

            . I live at the Black Horse public-house, in York-street. About half past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of November, I was in the yard, and heard two girls disputing in the privy, as if they were quarrelling about dividing some money - I got upon some things to try to see them, but could not - I thought there might be a man there, and broke open the door - I found the two prisoners with something tied up in a silk handkerchief, and blue apron - I said, "Where did you get those things." Molineaux said, "They are things I got out of pawn for my mother;" there was a shilling lay there, I said, "Whose is that?" she said, "It is my mother's." I then found two promissory notes. I let Bosley go, and detained Molineaux - I ran up to Bosley again, and said, "Where did you find these bills?" she said, "In the Broadway." I let her go - a person said I had better fetch her back, which I did, and then went to Mr. Beverstock's, but he had by that time got to the Black Horse public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable - I went to the Black Horse public-house, on the 16th of November, between four and five o'clock; the prosecutor and the two prisoners were there; he charged them with robbing him - I said, "Of what?" he said, "Of this money here." he then put it in this box, and delivered it to my custody - the moment the girls saw me they knew me, and one accused the other of the robbery; when I got them to the watch-house, Molineaux said to me, "Bosley took the money out of the drawer, and she will tell you so." Bosley then said, "Yes, Mr. Timbrell I took it." I said, "My good girl you must not say any thing to me." the prisoners were then both together, I don't know whether they were both together at the time the money was taken.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BEVERSTOCK. Here is an apron and handkerchief this bundle which are mine.</p>
               <p>MOLINEUX'S Defence. Bosley asked me to go to Beverstock's house, and ask if he made cast iron tea kettles, and to see if there was a woman there. I went in and told her No; she then went in and came out again, and took me to the end of the street, and told me to wait there - she then went back and I followed her. A man then came round with some beer. Mr. Beverstock then took us into the room, and gave us some beer, and wanted to take liberties with us; he then gave us 2 d., and told us to come again in half an hour. He then told us if any body came we were to call him uncle. The lady then came; we were in the room, and the drawer was open; Elizabeth Bosley took the box and put it in her pocket.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BEVERSTOCK re-examined. Q. You have heard what the prisoner has stated. Did you ever attempt any thing of the kind? A. I never did - I never gave them 2 d., upon my oath - I never attempted to take liberties with either of them; they were not more than once at my house on that day to my knowledge. Molineaux might have come there in the morning, but I did not see her, my wife was at home, but I was out.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN TIMBRELL re-examined. Q. When Molineaux was taken up did she say any thing on this subject to you? A. No, she said nothing about it that day, but the next morning she mentioned something of the kind.</p>

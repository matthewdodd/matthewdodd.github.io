            . I am a watch finisher, I live at No. 3, Chequer alley, Bunhill row; I work below; the prisoner came in and said he had bought a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that - A. On the Tuesday week, about twelve o'clock; he said he knew me some years back; when he came in the shop, he said Mr. Goddard, I should be glad if you would tell me the value of this watch; he said he had given two guineas and a half for it; I told him he was not hurted, I thought it was worth more; he said as the watch was worth more, he would wish to wear it; he asked me if he could have his own name put upon it; I said yes. I took it to pieces and took it to the gilder's Mr. Dando sent to me, to enquire if I had such a watch; I said yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The prisoner did not desire you to conceal this - this transaction was all open and fair - A. Yes. I took it to pieces before his face and put it in the window.</p>

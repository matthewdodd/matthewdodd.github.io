                  </hi>. I am a barrister. On the 15th Dec. I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper which I have here—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi> "Horse for sale.—A gentleman will dispose of a very superior bay gelding—colour, a rich bay, with short black legs; flowing mane and tail; extremely handsome; unexceptionable with hounds; has been broke to harness; stands 15 hands and 1/2 high; warranted in every respect. A liberal trial given. Apply for the Groom at 29 1/2 New-street, Covent-garden; Scott's Arms Yard, Bedfordbury, where the horse is.") I went to the yard the next day, or the next day but one—I first saw the prisoner Shaw—I asked him about the horse—he knocked at the stable door I found the horse and a mare, and the prisoner Goddard in the stable—Shaw said it was his horse, and directed the groom Goddard to produce it—it was brought out and led up and down the yard—I looked at it, and noticed a bare place on the back—it answered the description, except that it seemed rather shorter—I do not think it was more than 15 hands high—the groom after<lb></lb>wards said so—Shaw said I might have a week's trial of the horse, if I would leave a deposit of a few pounds with him or the groom—he said the price of the horse was forty guineas—I said nothing about the price—I objected to try the horse then as the weather was frosty—I said I would call when the weather was open—I asked him if he had hunted the horse—he said no, he had only bought it that summer—I went away, and on the following Saturday, the 19th, as the weather was open, I went to the stable—I knocked at the door and saw Goddard—Shaw was not there—I asked Goddard what the owner of the horse was, he said he was a surveyor, and lived at No. 14, Floodyer-street, whitehall—while I was there Shaw came—he repeated his offer, he said I might have the horse on trial if I would leave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him or the groom—(Goddard was present)—he said the price was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (he had altered the price to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I said nothing about the price, I never made any bargain—I said I should like to try the horse, and wished to have it that afternoon—after enquiring what the use of the deposit was—he said as a guarantee that the horse was not returned with broken knees—I said I would take the horse on trial that afternoon, and requested that it might be sent to my chambers in Chancery-lane, at five o'clock—Shaw promised it should be sent, and the groom undertook to bring it—I then, in the presence of Goddard, paid to Shaw 4 sovereigns, which was all the gold I had, as a deposit for the return of the</p>

               <p>horse in security—I then went away—the horse was not sent to my chambers, and at seven o'clock the same day I went to the stable—I there found the groom and another man, whom I had not seen before, and I do not think I have seen him since—the horse was there which I had seen in the morning, and like wise a mare—I asked Goddard why he had not brought the horse—he said his master bad been there till five o'clock, and he supposed I would not come—I said, "Can I have the horse now, it has put me to great inconve<lb></lb>nience"—he said he supposed not, that a friend of his, who lived in the Isle of Wight, had written and offered 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for it—he then said Shaw had given him a letter for me—he gave it me, and I read it out to him—this is it—(read "Sir,—I agree to sell you a bay gelding, price 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., warranted sound; quiet to ride and in double and single harness, on the following conditions—namely, should you not approve of it in three days, you shall be at liberty to return him on Tuesday next, and receive back the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I further acknowledge to have received this day 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part thereof") I had never purchased the horse, nor even offered money for it—I held the letter open in my hand to Goddard, and demanded the horse—I said, "Either under the agreement you made this morning, or upon this letter, I am to have the horse"—he said he could not give it me—I said, "You have no excuse for not giving it to me"—he refused to give it to me, and said I might see Mr. Shaw at Floodyer-street—I did not at all intimate to the groom that I agreed to these terms—I went to No. 14, Floodyer-street immediately afterwards—a women opened the door, and said Mr. Shaw had gone to Reading, and would be home on Monday—I went to Floodyer-street again on the Monday—another person opened the door, and said Mr. Shaw had not been home, and they did not know when he would be home—I went to the stable that Monday, and no one was there—I was directed by a person in the yard to a public-house—I went there, and en<lb></lb>quired for Mr. Shaw's groom, and Goddard appeared—he told me he had heard I had been to Floodyer-street, that he had not seen his master, and did not know what was to be done—I went away—I think I went again on the next day, the 22nd—I could not find either Shaw or Goddard either there or at Floodyer-street—on that day, 22nd, I saw an advertisement in the Times re<lb></lb>ferring to the same stable—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi> "Two horses for sale. The proprietor having only use for one, will dispose of either; the one a powerful brown muzzled mare, the other a handsome bay gelding, full tail and mane, 14 hands and 1/2 high; hunted the whole of last season; regularly broke to double and single, harness; both young, safe, and temperate. Apply at the stable, No. 1, Scott's arms Yard") I went to the stable on the 24th—I did not see any one at the stable, it was locked—I saw Goddard at the public-house opposite—I asked what was to be done about the horse, whether I was to have it—he said he did not know what master intended to do—he was keeping the horse for me—I said, "Can't you give it me then"—he said "No, I have no orders—I believe he wants a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I repeated the question, "Is he keeping the horse for me"—he said, "Yes—I do not know what he means to do"—I said, "Then what does this advertisement which is in the Times this morning mean"—read that (reads) "To be sold 2 horses, one a bay gelding, stands 15 hands 2 inches high, very handsome; short black legs; a good saddle horse—and broken in to single and double harness"—my horse was a black legged horse—this was quite the description of it—I said, "What is this advertisement"—he said "It is not the horse, it is the mare"—I said, "The advertisement says a horse"—he said, "That must be a mistake"—on the 30th Dec. I went again and demanded possession of the horse, or the alternative, the return of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said he could not tell what was to be done—he did not know what master meant to do—he believed master was keeping the horse for me—I said, "I must proceed against your</p>

               <p>master—I shall want you as a witness—what is your name"—he refused to tell me—I have neither got the horse nor the money—on the 29th Dec. I saw an advertisement in the paper—I have taken a note of them, they have appeared 12 times—I spoke to Mr. Nicoll.</p>

               <p>street, but not then, as he was just gone in the City, but Mr. Shaw was in the City every day, and he would give me a call in the City if I chose—he said Mr. Shaw had had this gelding about eighteen months, and he described it as a most excel<lb></lb>lent house; that it had been used for a Brougham, and had been hunted, and if I had only seen it going by the Horse-guards I should have been charmed with its action—I said I did not want the horse for myself, but for 3 friend, that I should not dream of having the horse without a trial, and I said the advertisement mentioned a trial would be given—he said, "Yes, you may have it a week on trail"—he said, "Will you have it now, will you buy it at once?"—I said, "I don't know that I can buy it now, I had better see Mr. Shaw about it"—I then left the stable, and I immediately afterwards returned and said to him, "Is there anybody else after the horse?"—he said nobody, except he believed his master had a letter from the Isle of Wight, but he did not think anything would come of that—I said, "If there is anybody else about it I shall not think anything more about it"—on the 24th Mr. Shaw called on me—he stated that he came in consequence of my having called about a horse—he gave me this card, "Mr. William Shaw, 14, Floodyer-street"—he said, "That is my town address, my country residence is at Reading"—he said his servant had taken an unwarrantable liberty—(I Should have said that Goddard told me the price of the horse was forty guineas, but he believed pounds would be taken)—Shaw said his servant had taken an unwarrantable liberty in saying pounds, that he had asked 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but would take forty guineas, but as his servant had said pounds of course he must abide by it—I said, "I cannot take it without trial"—he said I might have it on trial when I wished—I said, "I cannot take it now, I am engaged on Saturday, I will bring my friend to look at it on Monday, and I will say whether I will take it on trial or not"—Shaw said, "Well then I will keep the horse for you till Monday, of course you will have not objection to give me a deposit"—I said, "Is that usual?"—he said, "That is my way of doing business"—I said, "I don't know that I shall buy the horse, I don't think I can give you any deposit now"—he said, "You cannot except me to keep the horse for you"—I said, "I don't require you to keep it if you meet with a purchaser"—he told me he would let me know if he met with pur<lb></lb>chaser between then and Monday, and he said he should be in the way from ten till two o'clock on Monday if I would call—I went to the stable on the Monday between those hours and took two friends with me—Goddard was there—I asked him if Mr. Shaw was there—he said no he was out, but there was a friend of his who would do—I saw the horse that Monday—I had seen it before, but it had not had its cloths✗ off before—on that Monday I saw it without its cloths—it was a short black legged bay gelding, with a flowing mane and tail—it had a piece robbed off its back, where it had been sore apparently, and the hairs were not grown—I do not think there was anything said then about my having it on trial and paying a deposit—on the following Thursday Shaw called on me again—he apologized for not meeting me at the stable—he said he had been there on the previous Saturday, thinking that was the day he was to have met me—he said I might have the horse on trial whenever I liked—I said I could not take it during the frosty weather—he said, "Well if you will give me a deposit I will order the groom to take it where you like when the frost is over"—I said, "What deposit do you require?"—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., just whatever I thought proper—I did not give him any—the last time I saw him was on the last day of Dec.</p>

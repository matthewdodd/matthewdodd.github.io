I went on board a steamer coming from Greenwich, on 27th Aug., at the Tunnel-pier—I had a watch with me; the boat was very much crowded—I put my hand on my watch for a long time, but the boat gave a roll, and I staggered back, and threw out my arms—the moment afterwards I felt, and my watch was gone—I had a ribbon-guard to it—I have not that guard, but I have the ring that was attached to it—this is it—I saw nothing of the prisoners till they were in custody—a person who came on board with me was watching the prisoners to see who took them, and she said to me, "Your watch is in the water"—it was a small silver watch—after I came closer to the prisoners, Harpur said, "Will you take the value of your watch, and do nothing further in it?"—I said, "I will"—he said, "What will satisfy you?"—I said, "Three pounds ten"—he said, "You shall have it," and he gave me the money—I did not hear Smith say anything—I went to the station, and made the charge.</p>

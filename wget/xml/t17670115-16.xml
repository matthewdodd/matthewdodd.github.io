            . I am a watchman; the man at the White Swan came and said, Biddy King and Wall had robbed a young fellow of his silver buckles; they were soon taken after that: Wall said the man was in liquor, and he gave King the buckles to take care of them; I went along with her, and she delivered them; the prisoners would have given the man his buckles and handkerchief again, and he would not have them; (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I said, Yes, if you will pay me. He said, If I have not money, I have money's worth; I went home with him: he said he would leave his buckles and handkerchief till he got money to pay the damages, and gave me a bit of a note to go down to Wapping, to his landlord, and said, take care of them till morning: this young woman (meaning Wall) was in the house, and another woman big with child: I said to Wall, will you take care of these buckle, till morning; he was agreeable; just as I was going into bed, he said he was a dry; I put on one petticoat and my gown, without a pin in it, and went with his handkerchief, as he ordered me, for half a gallon of beer to the public-house; going to the public-house, before I got to the door, he was after me, and the watchman; the watchman said, Come here: I said, What do you want? The prosecutor said, You have taken my buckles and handkerchief; I said, If he does not like to stay, he may have them again: Wall went and got his buckles directly.</p>

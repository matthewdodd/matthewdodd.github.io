            . I live in Lower Ormond-street, St. George's in the East, and am a cooper. On the 26th of November I was going to a tailor's, and saw the prisoner and a lad, less than him, stop at a baker's shop - I watched, and followed them down Bluegate-fields, and when they came to Mr. Page's shop in Ratcliff-highway, the prisoner took a pile of plates, which were standing by the door-post; I collared him as he was giving them to his companion; I said "I have got you young man - it won't do;" I kept him till the officer came - the other got away.</p>

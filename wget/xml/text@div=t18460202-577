I am a butcher, and live in Drury-lane—I looked at the two quarters of mutton produced by the officer—they were what I bought—they were cut in a particular way, and I knew them—I picked them out of fourteen or sixteen pairs—they were two that I had given to White to carry—they were taken out of my cart in Paternoster-row—the mutton has been eaten, but I could swear to it, and it weighed exactly the right weight, 24lbs.—it was Scotch mutton—I bought it because it was lean.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you ask the way back, when you came from Chelsea? - I told him where I was going, he said he was going to the next house to see his father who was ill, and he would direct me to the place, I asked him to take a draught of beer, he shewed me two ways, and told me one was shorter than the other; he brought me through a field, and pulled out a knife, and held it up to my throat, and said he would have my life or my money; that he would cut my throat, if I did not deliver my money; I desired him not to cut me, but take what I had; he searched all my pockets, and took what was in them, a guinea and half, and my watch was the last he took, and he could not get it out fast enough out of my trowsers; here are the trowsers, and he put the knife across it when he was going away, after taking the watch he returned back with the knife, and swore by his heavenly Father, if I returned a yard back after him, he would rip me open; I went to the next house and alarmed the man of the house, and we pursued him; we were in the view of him part of the time, there were a parcel of workmen, I met two young men, and described the prisoner, and one said, he met such a man; and they said it was better to take a pair of constables, and take him; I saw him in Bridewell the same day, between one and two, I do not know what time it was properly, and I shall not tell a lie; these constables that took him, told me he was there.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Taylor.) Can you swear to that property? - A. I should not have sworn to the property if he had not confessed it at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour?- A. None at all; he said he had taken it from our manufactory, but it was given him by a man that worked with him,

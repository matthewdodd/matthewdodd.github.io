                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of High Street, Dorking—in July last I had a watch, value 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I wished to dispose of, and advertised it in he "Exchange, Bazaar, and Mart"—I afterwards received this letter, signed "A. Hodges," and a card was enclosed "A. W. Hodges, wine and spirit merchant, St. George's Stores, Newington Causeway"—I wrote an answer to that letter asking him to send a cheque fur the amount, and stating that I would hold it over till he had an opportunity of approving of the watch—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090141"></xptr>
               <p>I afterwards received this letter "Sir,—Kindly say per return if we can do business"—I wrote another letter to the same effect as the first and received a reply and this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), upon which I sent the watch by registered post—I paid the cheque into my bankers a few days afterwards and it was returned endorsed "Signature irregular"—on September 6th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the watch was not worth more than 71., and that the signature to the cheque sent was not that of Mr. Collins, as it would never do to commit forgery, and that the man who gave the writer the blank cheque had decamped with the watch, and instructions had been given to the police, it expressed a hope that within a few days the watch or money would be forth coming</hi>.) I came up to town on 8th August, went to the place described on the card, and saw the prisoner—I said "I have called about the cheque"—he said "Another has been sent"—I said "I have been away for a few days and it may be at home"—I went home, but found no cheque or letter—on 3rd September I came to town again, went to the police-station, and then went with Sergeant Bell to the prisoner's place—I stated "I have called about the watch and cheque"—he said "I have not had it; Lamb had it and he will see to it and send the money—I allowed him to use my name and address"—I had never heard the name of Lamb before—he said "I gave Lamb the watch at the police-station"—next day I applied for a warrant against Hodges at the police-court, which was granted—he was admitted to bail for a week, and on the next occasion did not appear—I have never received the watch, cheque, or money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). On 3rd September I went with Marsh to St. George's Stores, Newington Causeway, and saw Hodges behind the bar—I told him we had come in reference to a watch which had been obtained from Barking by means of a cheque, which had been returned—he said "A man named Lamb wrote for the watch and asked me to allow him to use the sign of our house and the name, and I gave him consent to do so, I am very sorry I did; I knew Lamb would not send the amount and that the cheque was wrong; I afterwards received a parcel by post and opened it in the presence of the postman, and saw that it was a gold watch; I kept it and Lamb called for it once or twice, but I would not give it to him; I then took it across to the police-station, and the inspector gave it up to Lamb"—I mentioned about the cheque being returned and asked him where it was—he said he had given it to his master—I asked him who his master was—he said "Mr. Thompson, a coachman, of 5, Prince's Square"—I went there and saw Mr. Thompson and he gave me a cheque—I then went before the Magistrate, who issued a warrant—at the second hearing Palmer was a witness—he was afterwards tried with Lamb, and Lamb pleaded guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said to Marsh "You will have the money, I have seen the person, and no doubt he will send you the money, probably to-night or to-morrow; it was very silly perhaps of me, it was rather a curious affair, as he was not in possession of any money and could not give a cheque; that is the reason I would not give him up the watch"—I went to Mr. Thompson and received the cheque from him, and the letter. The prisoner was behind the bar managing the public-house for the landlord"—he used to pay so much a week to Mr. Thompson—I have known him as a publican before—he used to keep the Peacock—Palmer was tried for conspiracy—he was convicted on another charge, and they did not proceed</p>

                  </hi>. I am in custody under a sentence of three months' imprisonment. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 496). I went to Hodges' place in July and saw him—I had a copy of the "Bazaar, Exchange, and Mart," and my attention was called to Mr. Marsh's advertisement—I said to Hodges "There is a watch here advertised; you were speaking about one the other day"—he took the paper from me and read the advertisement and said "Write and get the particulars"—I then wrote the letter produced and enclosed this card from Hodges—on the 11th of July I wrote this other letter with Hodges' knowledge and authority, because the first letter came to him—I wrote them both in his presence, and I wrote other letters—he afterwards showed me a letter from Mr. Marsh, upon which it was proposed that a cheque should be sent—he said that he had not got a cheque-book—I thought I could get one from Palmer, the butcher—I went to see Palmer and explain the matter to him—I went back and told Hodges that Palmer would agree to get me a cheque; he had not got one of his own, but would get one from Clements, the milkman, of Vauxhall—Palmer said "Well, I suppose Hodges will stand 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the trouble?"—I said "I will ask him"—I asked the prisoner, and he said "I will give it"—it was arranged that when the watch came it should be pawned and the money handed back to Palmer, the butcher; and if it did not realise 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was to be given to him, so as to meet the cheque on the Monday morning, and Palmer was to take the money to the bank and get the cheque—Hodges was to make up the difference—I afterwards went to Palmer's and from there to Clements', the milkman, who was not at home—I then called on Collins, a butcher, in Wands-worth Road—Palmer went in and got two blank cheques—I did not see who gave them to him, as I did not go in, but he came out with the cheques, and we went to his house, where be put them on the table—I went to Hodges the same day; I filled the cheque in in Hodges' presence, and signed it "J. Collins," and sent it—I had no authority to do so, but Collins would not have known anything about it if the cheque had been taken up at the time—I had seen Collins before—I was at Hodges' when the watch came, we examined it; he put it in his pocket—we went into the bar parlour and spoke to Mr. Thompson—he stayed some time—I called him out and said "Am I to take the watch to realise, and see what it is worth?"—he said "No"—Mr. Thompson then said said something in the bar about retaining it—I said "If you are going to do that how about the cheque; I shall get into trouble about it?'—Thompson said "Do not give it up"—I said "Then we will go the police-station," which we did, Hodges taking the watch—we saw Inspector Page; I said very little, but Hodges made a speech—Hodges afterwards took the watch to a pawnbroker in the Blackfriars Road—I did not go in, but he told me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered for it, which he declined to take—I then went to another pawnbroker and pawned it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I took the money to Hodges—he said "I shall not meet the cheque, as you can only get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it"—I said "Very well, it will make a very bad job for me; you owe me a certain amount of money; there is the balance; I shall stop it—I handed him over 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think, but I am not certain; it was over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards saw in the paper that Hodges was in custody, and I wrote a letter to Inspector Page—I was taken in custody, committed for trial—I pleaded guilty.</p>

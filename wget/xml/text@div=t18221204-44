On Saturday morning, the 2d of November, these dresses were inside the shop door, on a string. I did not see them taken, or see the prisoner near the shop. I was informed they were gone - went out, and saw the prisoner about five hundred yards off, in a back street, towards Duke's-place; he was secured, and denied the charge, the property was not found - it was worth 40 s.</p>

            . I am a scale-maker, and live in Golden-lane. On the 2d of November, I was at work for Mr. Shurey, of Hounsditch, nearly opposite Smith's, and saw the prisoner and two young men talking together, at the corner of Castle-street, within two or three yards of the shop. I was working at the door, and watched them with my master - the prisoner left their company and looked into a pastry-cook-shop, within two doors of Mr. Smith's, then one of the others went in and came out, then he joined company again. I saw the prisoner leave them and look in at the pastry cook's window again - the other two went up to Smith's door and took the clothes; the prisoner immediately followed them, and went off with them. His face was towards them when they took the dresses - he must have seen them. I saw him beckon to them, and they directly went up and took them; and he followed them up Castle-street. I went and told Mr. Smith, and when I came out I saw them again, but when they came to another corner I missed them - he turned the same corner and was laid hold of; he said he lived at a cheese-monger's in Mile End-road, and denied it.</p>

I lived with the broker five months ago, I was coming up Houndsditch and saw two lads by this shop - they came up to me - one of them asked the way to James-street; I said I did not know, he left me, and I saw him standing by the shop door - whether he took any thing or not I don't know, but there was a cry of</p>

Watts had a bed there on the 29th - there were three beds in the room - the prisoner slept in one of them - the other was unoccupied - I and the servant made up Watts' bed after the prisoner was in bed; he had slept there for a month or five weeks; he got up about six o'clock and went away; he knocked at my door and called me and the servant up; he never returned but was apprehended about two o'clock that day. Watts complained of losing his money, and when the prisoner was taken a silk handkerchief of mine was found in his pocket - I believe I had left it in the bar a few days before - nobody could have been in the room without our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the street-door open or shut when I got up? A. Shut; the servant was down stairs before me; I made the bed about half-past twelve o'clock - I think it might be as late as that.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had information of this robbery, and apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Barclay's, No. 381, Strand, at work; I said I must search him, and asked if he had any money; he said "No, only a few halfpence;" I searched him and found no money, but he had no coat or waistcoat on; I asked him where his halfpence were - he said in his waistcoat pocket; he went to a cupboard and gave me his waistcoat, in which I found some halfpence; he was then fumbling about his coat pocket, in the cupboard, with his back turned towards me, and putting something into his trousers' pocket; he then gave me his coat - I found nothing in it; I said"What have you got inside your shirt?" and I there found this handkerchief, in which was a purse with three sovereigns; I said I thought he had no money - he made no answer; I took the money, and he said "Ar'n't you going to give me the money?" I said No; he said "I will soon make you return it;" I took him out - he knocked me down and ran away - I followed him to the corner of Bow-street, where a patrol stopped him. The King's Head is in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields.</p>

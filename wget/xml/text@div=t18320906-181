On the morning of the 21st of July I saw the prisoner and two others there; they asked for a pot of ale, and were served with it - while they were drinking it, I fell asleep; when I awoke, I saw the prisoner at my elbow, inside the bar, taking some copper off the side board with one hand, and with the other he was putting some into his pocket - I looked at him, and he said, "There is a big Irishman run across the road with some halfpence, run after him;" I said,"No, you are the Irishman," and I took hold of him; he tried to get away - my fellow-servant got up, and he was secured; I found on him the same money which as missing.</p>

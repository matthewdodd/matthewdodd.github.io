                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my father, at No. 26, Cumberland Street On 3rd April, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Cumberland Street, near King's Head Court, and saw Mr. Jackson there, and the prisoner, and another young man, with a white jacket on, holding him up—he was very nearly on the ground, he was drunk—I saw the prisoner take a purse out of his hand, and the other one took a watch out of his pocket—they then stood him up against the wall, and searched his pockets—the prisoner went away—the other one stopped with him for a little time, and then he went away in the same direction, about three minutes afterwards, and I followed him to several beer shops; but before that he went to an apple stall, and bought some apples and oranges—I saw him counting the money, up Eyre Street—they were then both together.</p>

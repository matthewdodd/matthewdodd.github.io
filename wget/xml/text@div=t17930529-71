               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take the table? - No, the property was stole the 12th of May, Monday, between the hours of one and two; I missed this table from the door, a neighbour of mine that lives opposite, sent his little boy over to me; I was up stairs at dinner, and informed me of it; I ran down stairs, and run round the corner, ran up Brooks's-street, and I saw the prisoner in Brooks's street; as I ran along I called out stop them men, they have got my table; there was two of them, one of them ran away, I collared the other, the prisoner is the man; my table stood on the ground on its feet; this man stood by the side of the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man run? - No, I collared him, and brought him to my house; after that I carried him to the justice's in Hatton-garden; he told me that he was going along, and some man asked him to carry the table for him.</p>

Yes; I immediately went in and looked at the bar; the first thing I missed from the bar was a breast of veal, and next my till, containing half-pence, penny-pieces and farthings; I suppose there might be pounds worth in it; I then missed two kegs of liquor, marked Booth, (meaning Mr. Booth of Cowcross) branded upon the keg, and my name in chalk; they contained three gallons of anniseed and three gallons of peppermint, and I missed a case bottle of rum; I saw the kegs and the case bottle at Shadwell-office; here is one of the screws that fastened the shutter, which I found in the morning broke.

               <p>Q. Robus did not go up stairs with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But having transacted up stairs what they thought sit, they came down, and he went away with them? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with my brother and sister to Bow-fair; we got home about three in the morning, and found that a case bottle had been left for us; it contained rum, I had a glass of it, when we had been at home about an hour and were in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mellish one of the persons that came up into your room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall not ask you who the other person was; what had you for dinner the next day? - A. A piece of veal that Mr. Mellish put upon the table;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110080"></xptr>he staid in the room about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that case bottle? - A. I cannot justly say; I had two, and I lent my brother one of them to fetch his beer from the club; I saw a bottle afterwards at the Justice's, but I cannot say that it was the same; it was such another bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. You have known Mellish formerly, and known his character? - A. I have known him ever since he was a baby; we were children at play together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his way of life was? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he has been tried here for a felony? - A. No; he was taken up, I know.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever heard him make any declaration with respect to the prisoner Robertson? - A.Robertson is the father of my child. The witness had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever heard Mellish say what he would do to Robertson? - A. I have known him to owe him a spite and a malice; I have heard him say, that he would do any thing to him almost that he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Have you any reason to believe that your sister or your brother bore him any spite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>BARBARA STAR sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Robertson? - A. I know the person that came with Mellish.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the Court, and see it you can see him? - A.(Points to him.) That is him, I had seen Mellish five or six times before. Some time about the middle of May, at the end of the week, Mellish came in, and Robertson very soon after him; in about three or four minutes, he said he had some cordial to dispose of, and wanted to know if I would have it for my own use; Robertson was then present; it was in two small kegs, the one contained anniseed, and the other peppermint; each of the kegs was about half full; Mellish had passed himself upon me for a cloathsman; I bought an apron of him, and some other things. Some Police officers came to my house, and I delivered to them one of the same kegs; I believe the other had sell to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of George Pauling? - A. Yes; he is here; he was present at the time; he lives in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Robus upon that occasion? - A. I did not see any other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What sort of a shop do you keep? - A. A sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Cloaths are the only articles, I take it for granted, that you deal in? - A.In respect to wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q.Spirituous liquors are rather out of your line? - A. Yes, but knowing the man, I did not scruple to buy them; I had known him six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him, when he was convicted here? - A. No, I never heard of it in all my life; I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Woon). Q.What was the state of the kegs when you lost them? - A.They were both full.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. I know the tall one, Robertson, and I know Mellish; they both came to Mrs. Star's house on the Sunday, the day after Bow-fair; they had got some anniseed and peppermint to dispose of, in two small kegs, marked Booth; I was there when the officers came; I had one of the kegs at my house at Hoxton, and I took it down to the office, according to their desire, the next day; I don't know what became of the other; when they asked me about it, at first, I did not recollect the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Recollect, that the life of one or both of these prisoners may depend upon the positiveness with which you speak? - A. I am sure it is my bottle; I know it by the dent at the bottom, and another mark near the top; and it has such a remarkable small neck, that a phial cork sits it, which you will seldom find in a case bottle; I had had it eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, have you any doubt that this is your bottle? - A. I have not; I have many a time cursed the bottle when I have been mixing liquor, that it did not run fast enough, the neck was so small; I cannot swear to the keg; they had both of them the same mark that this has.(Mr. Fitzpatrick produced the file of the Sessions of February, 1797).</p>

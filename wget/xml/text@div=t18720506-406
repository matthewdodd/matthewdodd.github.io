                  </hi>. I am foreman to Thomas Hewitson and another, upholsterers, Tottenham Court Road—on Monday morning, 21st April, I was in bed—I was rung up, went down to the door and found a policeman there—I went with him to the warehouse, 4, North Crescent, and found the prisoners in the area—I asked them what they were doing there—Jones said that the wind had blown his hat into the area, and that Walker had followed him there—they were sober, but they pretended to be drunk—I examined the window in the area and found two bars wrenched out, and the shutters forced and thrown down—there were footmarks on the door, as if they had been trying to force it, but they had not effected an entrance.</p>

            . I live in Edgeware-road. I let a furnished house to Mrs. Greig, No. 3, Hereford-street, Park-lane, on the 24th of July last. When she left, if a hill of 20 l. had been paid, she would have owed me 18 d. The prisoner was a friend of hers, and had been to my house several times about it. I wrote him a letter, and did not see him after that till the 24th of January, when I went to No. 19, Upper Berkley-street, and saw him. They had left my house - he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Chalmers, you wrote me a very scurrilous letter;" and that, among other things, I had charged him as a deserter, but I had acted very handsomely by giving up my authority. He said,</p>
               <p>"Deserter, indeed - I am no deserter. If you will go to Cox and Greenwood's, you will hear of me. I am

            , a lieutenant on half-pay, of the 58th regiment of foot." I said I was very sorry if I had written any thing improper, but I had given my authority. We talked about a settlement of the rent, and my getting possession. Mrs. Greig and he said they could not pay the money then, but were ready to give security. I asked them if the 20 l. bill, due on Thursday, was paid - and both assured me that it was. I said if that was the case I would accommodate them, and take a bill or any thing. He said he would accept a bill. It was agreed that I was to have 8 l. on Tuesday, and take a bill for 10 l. A stamp was sent for, and a bill drawn, which he offered to accept. I thought it better to have a housekeeper's acceptance, and so he

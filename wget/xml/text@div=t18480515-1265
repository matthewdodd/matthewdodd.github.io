                  </hi> I live at 1, Great St. Ann's-lane, Peter-street, West<lb></lb>minster. I have been married to the prisoner thirty-five years, and have nine children—he is a pensioner of 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, in the 37th regiment—on 2nd May he received a month's money—between seven and eight o' clock in the evening, I received some information, went to a house, and saw him sitting on a chair, with a woman on his knee, and a jug of beer at his feet—there was another man lying across the bed in the same room, and another woman, rolling about—I said nothing, but shut the door, and went out—I was then between asleep and awake—he locked the door, went to the fire-place took the poker, and struck me with it on the right side of my head—it bled a good deal—he also hit me all about the body, but I do not feel it much now—he did not say anything while he was doing it—he was very drunk—it was not much of a wound on my head—I was not sober—I had had ale and gin with him in the early part of the evening, and he brought me home in a cab, and I went to bed—I was a good deal intoxicated, and slept it off—I went out afterwards, and saw him as I have described—I remained in bed after receiving the blow—I was not capable of getting up—he had locked the door, and I did not know where he put the key—he got up at five o'clock, and I got up and followed him, and gave him into custody—I went to the hospital.</p>

               <p>on the evening of 2nd May, I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix together, quar<lb></lb>reling, and both very tipsy, at the street door—it began about the prisoner's sitting on a young woman's Knee—they stopped there till between one and two—Mr. Murphy was then sitting on the stairs, very tipsy—they went up stairs, and between two and three I heard Mrs. Murphy moaning—at five the prisoner came and knocked at the door, with Mrs. Murphy all in gore of blood.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon at Westminster Hospital. On 3rd May I saw the prosecutrix—her face was very much discoloured with blood, and the whole of her hair—there was a large wound on the fore-part of her head at the right side—it penetrated to the bone, and uncovered it—it was a severe wound—it was not then bleeding much, but it had been—it would very probably be produced by this poker—I found some bruises on the left arm and side.</p>

On the night of 25th October I was in the Waterloo-road, in plain clothes, off duty—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running in the direction of Herbert's-buildings—I ran after him—there were other constables running—the prisoner ran to No. 6, Herbert's-buildings—I closed with him on the steps, and he turned round and struck me a violent blow on the left temple with some instrument he had in his hand, which felled me to the ground—I was insensible at once—I was assisted to the station, and my wound dressed by the doctor—I was bleeding—I was off duty eight days, and was then recom<lb></lb>mended by the doctor to take light duty—I am all right now—I know the place where this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found—it is a fitter's shop opposite to 6, Herbert's-buildings, about 30 feet from there—this could be thrown easily from the road, or from No. 6, on to the fitter's shop—it is a low roof—on Wednesday, 8th November, at 4 o'clock in the morning, I assisted in taking the prisoner into custody—he was at 6, Herbert-build<lb></lb>ings in bed—when we went in, he directly sat up in bed, and said, "I am not the man"—not a word had been said before that—I am quite sure he is the man—it was a short instrument he struck me with—I said afterwards I believed it was a life-preserver—I had been on the look-out for the prisoner before I took him, and was not able to find him till the 8th—I knew his name at that time, and where he lived.</p>

I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Coningsby, an engineer, of Herbert's-buildings—on 8th November I found this instrument on the roof of Mr. Coningsby's fitting shop—that is opposite to No. 6, Herbert's-buildings—I had occasion to go to fix a skylight there, and I found this life-preserver accidentally—there is a stain on it now, which was there when I found it.</p>

I am a surgeon of Kennington-park-road—on Wednesday evening, 25th October, I saw Phelan about 10 in the evening—he was very pallid, as if he had recovered from fainting—there had been considerable loss of blood—I examined the head, and found a lacerated wound on the left front part, near the temple, three fourths of an inch to an inch long, cutting right down to the bone; it was also contused—in my judgment that wound was inflicted by some heavy instrument, most pro bably by a life-preserver, from the length of it—an instrument of this sort would produce such a blow—the man was eight days under my care—he is now convalescent.</p>

I live at Chapel, Street Mary Fair—on April 6th, about 12.30 p.m., I was walking with my wife in Piccadilly—the prisoner and another man passed us several times, and near Berkeley Street the prisoner snatched my watch chain which broke it—he ran away, my wife called police and ran after him—a policeman ran after him and I saw him taken—I did not lose sight of him—he only got away about 20 yards—this is the chain produced—the value is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner pulled out a watch and chain when he was in custody and said to me "Is that yours"—I said "No"—a policeman showed me my chain on Monday the 9th, at Marylebone police station.</p>

I was with my husband—the prisoner and another young man passed us three, times—when we came to Berkeley Street, we passed on a few steps I going on one side, and my husband on the other side of the prisoner, who was sitting down—as soon as we passed, the prisoner rushed between me and my husband, and snatched my husband's chain—I turned round and called "Police" and the prisoner ran into Berkeley, Street, and slipped and fell—I tried to get hold of him—he was too quick, he crossed the road and I and my niece followed him and saw him taken—I never lost sight of him.</p>

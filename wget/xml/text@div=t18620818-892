I live at Frederick-place, Walham-green, and am a labourer—on the night of Saturday, 5th July, I was coming home from, my work, and I went into the Peterborough public-house, in King's-road, and called for a pot of beer for myself and a woman who was with me—the prisoner came in about 8 o'clock, and called for a pint of beer—I called for a half-quartern of rum, and asked the prisoner if he would take some—he said, "No," and I then called for another pint of beer, but did not drink it all; I left part—I had all my money with me, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wrapped up in a little bag, which I put in my trousers pocket in the public-house—it had been in the same pocket before I paid—I took some pence out before I put the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in—the prisoner left about three or four or five minutes before me—I could not exactly tell—I then went out and along the road—he came up to me and put his hand at the back of my neck—it was about 300 yards from the house that he first met me; I do not know whether it was more or less—I went across Eelbrook Common—he put both his hands to my throat and then put one hand in my pocket and took the money—I told him I would sue him for it—he went away, and I hallooed out, "Police, police," but there was none there—I went back to the public-house, and told the landlord something, and after leaving there I went to Parsons-green, and inquired where the prisoner lived—I was shown the house, and went up to the door, and made inquiries for the prisoner there, but did not see him—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the police afterwards.</p>

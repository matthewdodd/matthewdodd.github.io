                  </hi>. I am a constable, in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, stationed at the goods department, Brick-lane. There is a receiving house of the company at Blossom's Inn, Lawrence-lane, from where the goods are taken in the company's vans to the goods station—on 13th Feb., in consequence of what had occurred, I was desired to place myself under the tarpaulin of one of the vans, and did so about 6 o'clock—I could not be seen in the van, but I had a good view—Warner and Watson were directed to follow the van—I saw the prisoners in Church-street, just by Spitalfields Church, with another person—Bellinger walked close to the side of the van, took hold of a box and pulled it, but could not get it—he still followed to Brick-lane, where he pulled the box out, and gave it to Bramlin, who walked away with it, and Bellinger attempted to get another box out of the van, but I got out from under the tarpaulin as quick as I could, the van being going at the time, and Bellinger ran the contrary way to where the box was gone, and called out, "Stop thief!"—I ran after him, but finding that the property was not gone that way, I re<lb></lb>turned—I got the box—Bellinger came back to see if we had secured it or not, and I took him into custody—I am positive that he is the man, and Bramlin is the man who received it—I had a good view of both.</p>

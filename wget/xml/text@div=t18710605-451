I am a baker, of 53, Pennyfields, Poplar—about 9 o'clock, on 24th May, I was in a street in Bromley, with my wife—I saw the prisoner there—he said "What are you doing here?"—I said "Nothing at all"—he asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for a pint of beer—I said I hadn't got any money—he said "I know what you are up to there," and my wife said "We are up to nothing here," and she said "Never mind; give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer"—I looked in my pocket; I had some halfcrowns and shillings, but only 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—my wife said "I have got a halfpenny," and I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he called out "John," and went away, and two men came over the rails; one of them caught me by the throat, and the other took my watch and chain, and money—they ran away—I went after them—I caught one of them; the other came and threw me in the water, and I afterwards went back—I saw my wife with a lot of people, and a police<lb></lb>man—he said "Do you see the man you gave the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer, to?"—I said "That's the man," and gave the prisoner in custody—he was waiting there when I went back—my wife said "There if the man you gave the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to," and I caught him directly.</p>

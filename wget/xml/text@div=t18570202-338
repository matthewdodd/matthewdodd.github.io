On 19th Jan., about 9.30 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a 1/4 lb. of cheese and some bread—they came to 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he tendered me a counterfeit 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I detected it directly, and said, "This is a bad one"—I put it into the detector, and broke a piece clean out of it—he said that he was not aware of it; he sold some mats in the morning, and gave change for it in good money—I put it into my pocket, and he left, I telling him he might be thankful he had got himself off so easily this time—I heard him in conver<lb></lb>sation with another party, whom I could not see, and heard them go away together towards Stratford—I shut up my shop, and I and a friend followed them—I went into a public house to see if they were there, and gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the police coming back—I gave the crown to a policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

On 19th Jan., about 10 minutes or a quarter past 10 o'clock, the prisoner came for a twopenny loaf—he gave me a crown piece—I directly detected that it was bad, and told him so—he said that he thought it was not—I told him I must have some further explanation, and I could not allow him to leave the place—he attempted to go to the door, but I directed Mrs. Clowes to shut it, and went round the counter and secured him—I asked him if he had any more of them—he said, "No"—I asked him where he got it—he said that he had sold a mat at Inglestone, and had given good silver in change for it—I do not know the distance from my house to Inglestone—I went to the station, and, while I was there, he was brought there by a policeman, to whom I gave the crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mortlake. On the evening of the 9th of Dec, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted some blankets for Sir Charles Ogle, and, that he had directions to look at some for him—I showed him some—he said he also wanted forty yards of stout calico at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, and a piece of Irish linen for gentlemen's shirts, not to exceed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, which he was to take with him, and four dozen buttons—he said the carriage had gone out, and the coachman had unfortunately taken the order with him, that he would call as soon as the carriage returned to East Sheen, and bring the order—he called again in about an hour and a half, and brought an order wafered—he said, "I have got the order at last, I am as tired as a dog, I have been waiting about all the evening for him"—I did not let him have anything—when he first came, he said he believed it was through the house<lb></lb>maid that I had received the order from Sir Charles, from her recommending me—I said it was very probable, for I had supplied the housemaid with goods, and was extremely obliged to her for recommending me—he said the carriage would stop at Mr. Blanchard's, at the Hare and Hounds—he said he was ser<lb></lb>vant to Sir Charles Ogle—I looked out the Irish linen—I did not furnish him with any goods, but told him as he was a perfect stranger, unless he could in<lb></lb>troduce me to a tradesman in the neighbourhood who knew him to be in Sir Charles's employ, I would send them up in the morning—he said he knew nobody in the neighbourhood, but Mr. Blanchard who knew him in Sir Charles's service—I said, "Very well, I will take the goods there with you, and if they know you, you can have them"—he objected, and said, "Never mind, send them all up to-morrow morning; I dare say it is necessary for tradesmen to be cautious, and I approve of your caution"—he said the paper was an order from the housekeeper for the goods.</p>

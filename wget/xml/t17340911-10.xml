            , Do you know him? And he answered, Yes; he lives at Paddington. When we came to the End of the Field, the same Man started out upon West, from behind a Hedge, and said, Damn your Blood! your Money! He took 3 s. 6 d. from West, then he robb'd me, and my Daughter, and Mrs. With. He took my Hat and Cap, a muslin Hood, an Apron, two Handkerchiefs, and 18 d. and after that he went again to West, and made him pull out his Buckles. It was then between 9 and 10, but nearer 10 than 9 I think the Prisoner is the Man, for I took pretty good notice of him; he had a light Wig on, and he was new shaved. He was taken next Morning, and I believe he had on the same white Frock that he has now, and had when he robb'd us.</p>

            , had been at the Fair, and were going home to Kilburn. We had had more Company, but they parted from us at a Cross-path. A Man came by us, and said, Good Night, Ladies; Good Night, Neighbour. As soon as he was gone, some of us said to West, Who is that, John? and he said, I believe I know him; but I can't call to mind his Name. When we came to the End of the Field, which was within two Fields of our own home; the same Man bolted out from a Bush; Lord bless me! says my Mother. The Man came up to John, and said, Damn your Blood, your Money. Then he robb'd John, and afterwards robb'd us. He took from me a Leghorn Hat, a Cap and Topknot, a muslin Apron, and two Handkerchiefs. It was between 9 and 10 at Night, but nearer 10 than 9. He was in a white fustian Frock, with metal Buttons, and a white Wig; and to the best of my Knowledge the Prisoner is the same Man. We found him the next Morning a Mowing at Paddington, and he had then on a white Frock and metal Buttons; but I am not sure it is the same, for I thought it look'd cleaner.</p>

            . On the 2d of August, between 9 and 10 at Night, but nearer 10 than 9, as we were going over the Fields, betwixt Kilburn and West-End, a Man in a white fustian Frock with metal Buttons overtook us, and said, Good Night, Neighbours; and so he went forward, and I said to West, Do you know him, John? Yes; says he, but I can't remember his Name. He robb'd John first, clapping a Pistol to his Breast, and then me, and the other two Women. He took from me a Hat, a Cap, two Handkerchiefs, an Apron, a Callimanco-Gown, and 3 s. 6 d. and afterwards he went to John again, and made him pull out his Buckles. When he got what he could, he bid us go on, and said he would leave our Clothes in the Field. Next Day, when the Prisoner was taken, he had on, as I believe, the same Frock, and I believe he is the same Man that robb'd us.</p>
               <p>William Sands. I live at Paddington; I went out on Saturday Morning to take a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110009"></xptr> Walk as usual, and coming home, the Landlord of the Green-man said to me, Lord, Sir! there is a Man at our House charged with a Robbery, and we have no Warrant nor Constable to take him up. Phoo, says I, any one may take a Felon without a Warrant. So I went in and said to these Witnesses, 'Tis a sad thing to swear away a Man's Life; and therefore I'd have you be very cautious - Are you sure that this is the Man? And they all said they were positive.</p>

            , a Headborough of St. Giles's Parish. On the 2d of August, about Noon, I went to see the Men stand in the Pillory, in Broad-street by Carnaby-Market, after which I staid with some Friends in Carnaby-street, till between 8 and 9; and then I went by the Prisoner's House, in Bell-Lane, in Mary-bone Parish, and he was at the Door; it was then within a few Minutes of 9 a Clock, and his House is two Miles from Kilburn. He's a labouring Man, and his Character has been pretty good latterly, but about a Year ago he was Servant to one Smith, a Horse-Courser, who run away.</p>
               <p>Court. On what Occasion?</p>
               <p>Deverel. To bilk every Body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sands again. Was not that Smith accused of Horse stealing?</p>
               <p>Deverel. I have heard such things - I think it was in the News.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sands. You were at the Green-Man when the Prisoner was taken?</p>
               <p>Deverel. Yes; I was.</p>
               <p>Court. And did you take any notice there, that you had seen the Prisoner at home at 9 a Clock?</p>
               <p>Deverel. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How so?</p>
               <p>Deverel. The Women could not agree about the time, they were in different Stories; some said they were robb'd about 9, and some before 9; besides I did not stay there two Minutes, because I was going to make my Dough, for I am a Baker.</p>
               <p>Court. And yet you staid long enough to hear them tell different Stories.</p>

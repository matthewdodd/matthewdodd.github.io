               <p>Q. Did you live in Somers-town on the <rs id="t18100919-104-cd594" type="crimeDate">13th of August</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18100919-104-off592 t18100919-104-cd594"></join> last - A. Yes; I went to Barnet with my wife and friend that day; I returned at night between twelve and one, in a returned post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that returned post-chaise take you to - A. It took me to the Bull's Head, I went there to get lodgings, I could not get them; my wife was with me at the time. We went from the Bull's Head to the Barley Mow, Long-lane, for the same purpose. The postboy left me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply there for a bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get one - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him - A. I know him perfectly well; I took the right cuff off his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there - A. Yes; I treated him with some drink; he said he would get me a bed; we were in company there a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you change any piece of money there - A. A seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see that - A. He did; I paid for the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had been there a quarter of an hour did you go out together - A. Yes; my wife and he went with me, we went down the lane a good piece, he said, there is a house I can get lodgings; he said to my wife, stand there, of that side, if I do not get lodgings in that house, I will get lodgings in another. I went with him, and he walked close by my side; my wife staid behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was that - A. I could not tell then. When he got me outside he got hold of me by the throat; he put his hand into my trowsers pocket, and took all my money out of my pocket, some of it fell on the ground. Upon this I catched hold of the right hand cuff of his coat; it tore off, I threw it away, I never saw it any more. I tried to lay hold of him the second time, and had like to have fell on him; if I could have held him I would not have let him go until I had beat him all over blue. I had nineteen shillings odd, a five-shilling piece, two halfcrowns, and two sixpences, all the rest in shillings. I attempted to pursue after the man, I sung out; there were two others with him; I called the watchman, he run after him, but he knew the way well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pocket from which he took the money the pocket in which you had put the change of the seven-shilling piece into at the public-house - A. Yes, and it being a wet morning, the patrol challenged my wife what she had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated your loss - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the patrol go with you any where - A. The patrol went with me to the Barley Mow, when I returned there I saw the prisoner drinking at the bar with a woman.</p>
               <p>Did you know him - A. Directly I knew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190051"></xptr>Q. Did you observe his coat - A. Immediately, in one moment.</p>
               <p>Q.Was his coat deprived of its cuff - A. It was quite fresh torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with the robbery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. Nothing; how could he say any thing for himself, he remained silent; the patrol took him to the watchhouse, I saw him searched, and one of the shillings I knew in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was found upon him - A. There was half-a-crown, and two or three shillings, there was one that I got from my wife, I had it in my hand playing with it like a child, it had an A upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the place where you had been robbed - A. Yes, with a lanthorn, I found nothing; I was creditably informed, that there had been a lanthorn there before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned back to the spot where you had been robbed - A. About a quarter of an hour; it could not be more.</p>
               <p>Q. When he seized you by the throat were you disabled - A. Yes, I could scarce speak at the time.</p>

He came up Chicklane, he said, there is the house; he told me to stop there on the other side; I saw him lay hold of my husband by the throat, he tore the shirt and the pocket too; I called out a robbery, I thought I should be killed as well as he.</p>
               <p>Q. After he got away from your husband did you see him with any thing in his hand - A. No, I was on one side, and he on the other; he told me he chucked the cuff away; the patrol came up, I told him what had happened, then he went with me; I knew the man directly I saw him.</p>

I was; on the 30th of August, about half past one o'clock, I was going by the Bull's head, Smithfield, I saw this man and woman telling the watchman that they had been robbed; I directly took them to the Barley-mow. I asked him if he should know the man if he saw him; he said, yes, from all the world, he said he was dressed in a light coloured coat, like a coachman, and part of his right cuff sleeve was gone away, by his seizing him by the cuff, he had pulled it off himself. I said, come along with me, we will try if we can find him. We went to the Barley-mow, and there was the prisoner and a woman standing at the bar, directly they saw him, they said that is the man, I will give you charge of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the sleeve of his coat - A. Yes, it was gone off, it appeared quite fresh, I found it was the right arm; I asked him particular; he said, the right arm, so I found it. I searched him at the watchhouse, I found on him a half crown, two shillings, and three or four halfpence; before I shewed the prosecutor the money, I asked him if he should know any of the money; he said, there is but one shilling I can swear to, it was marked with the letter A. I shewed him the half-crown, he said he could not swear to it; I shewed him a shilling, a remarkable one, he said he could not swear to it; I shewed him the other, he said he could swear to that, it was marked with a letter A upon it.</p>

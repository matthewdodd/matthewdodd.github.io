            . I live with Mr. Cane. The prisoner and another woman, named Allen, were at our house last Thursday night between 11 and 12 at night, and had a pint of purl. I drawed it in a silver pint mug, as all our pots were out: the other woman delivered the mug to the prisoner; I heard her say, I'll take care of it: she bid the other woman go out, and while my back was turned, I missed the mug and prisoner. I went and asked my young mistress in the bar, if she had received the silver mug, she said, no. I opened the door, and there was the prisoner standing over the way. I asked her for the mug; she slapped my face. I laid hold of her; the mug was under her apron. I ran back and called some people that were in the house: she went one way and we another; then I went in about my business, and they went after her.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Cane's house. I went out to look for the prisoner to several places, but could not find her. Coming back, Mrs. Cane had found her: they were coming down the market: I went and saw the mug lying upon a dung-hill across the way, about 30 yards from Mrs. Cane's house.</p>

            . The prisoner's husband had turned her out of the house. I live in the same house. She called me down, and desired me to get her husband to let her in; then she wanted me to go and drink part of a pint of purl. The lad brought it in a silver mug. I went away, and did not see it afterwards.</p>

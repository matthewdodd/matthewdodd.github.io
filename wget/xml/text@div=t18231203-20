            . I live in Crown-street, nearly opposite Pitt's shop. On the 15th of November, about half past five o'clock in the evening, I heard somebody say, "that man is after stealing the carpet." I went up to my first-floor window, and saw three men loitering about Pitt's shop, and presently saw a man in a light coat cross towards the shop; he walked about for a few minutes; one of the others went into the shop, and came out without anything; the prisoner then went in, and brought out a roll of carpet. I ran down, and out at the door, but before I could get round the corner, he turned into Wilson-street. A man said he had got the carpet; being dark I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030012"></xptr>could not see the man, though I heard his voice, and saw the shadow of a man run round; he was brought back in a moment; the other man is not here. The prisoner is the person who took it - he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. It was quite dark? - A. Yes - he crossed towards my shop. I have no doubt of him. He crossed towards my shop, and back again, before he took it. The gas threw a good light upon him. I had a full view of his person and face. I lost sight of him in the pursuit, and fell down. There was scarcely any one in the street.</p>

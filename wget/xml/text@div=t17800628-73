               <p>Was you in Bunhill row on the 6th of June? - The 7th the riot was; in the morning I was informed of it at the watch-house, about two o'clock. I ran up to Bunhill-row; I saw it was at the house of Mr. Lyons. The fire was kindled and a great number of people were throwing Mr. Lyon's furniture into the fire. I saw the prisoner, I knew him very well before; he was receiving the things as they were thrown out at the window and conveying them to the flames. There was some bedding lay on the ground, which was cut open so that we were up to our knees in feathers. I saw the prisoner take some fire in his right hand and set it on fire. The mob were throwing the furniture out at Mr. Lyon's windows at the time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how the doors and windows were at that time? - I did not, I was on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>How long was the prisoner acting in this manner? -

               <p>Did you see them break in? - Yes; they broke the top part of the door where there was a window, and so got in; then they opened the windows and let the rest in. I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after they broke in. They then threw the things out of the house and Randall took them and put them on a heap, and they were burnt.</p>
               <p>What things? - Chairs, tables and furniture.</p>
               <p>How long did you see the prisoner there? - He might be there an hour for what I know.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person? - Yes, I knew him before by sight, I did not know his name; he went round the fire two or three times with a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>He walked round it two or three times? - Yes, it might be twenty times for what I know.</p>

               <p>What number of people did you see there? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner Randall there? - Yes; I was very sorry to see it; he was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280170"></xptr> active; he had a bludgeon in his hand, and was about the fire. I was behind the mob, I could not see particulars.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect any thing in particular that he did? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know he was active? - Because he was amongst the riotous mob; he was covered all over with feathers; he came round the engine to the place where I was.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were the mob doing to the house at the time you saw him there? - They were burning the things; I did not see them doing any thing to the house.</p>

               <p>What time was the attack made upon your house? - At about half after ten o'clock at night, on Tuesday the 6th of June, by 1 suppose a hundred and more of them; they first attacked the front of the house; I put a prop to the door to keep them out but they broke the window and got in. I sent my wife and daughter out at the back door; and I took my account books in my hand; a man entered the house and fetched me a knock on the side of the ear and knocked me up against the wall. I recovered myself; then another man, a shorter one than he, took my books out of my hand, and gave me a knock on the back and shoved me out at the back door.</p>

               <p>In what state did the mob leave the doors and wainscoting? - I cannot tell; I left the house at a little more than half after ten o'clock, when they shoved me out at the back door. I returned the next day; they were then demolishing the house. I went into the back yard to see if I could see any thing of the books; some of them damned me and said, if I did not get away they would make a fire of me. I saw them throwing the wainscoting and partitions out; I saw the people at work in the two and three-pair-of-stairs rooms.</p>
               <p>Was the house in perfect repair when they came? - It was; it had not been built many years.</p>

               <p>I am a tailor and salesman. I live about five doors from Mr. Lynch's; his house was attacked on the 6th of June, at about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there, and at what time? - Yes. I saw him carrying goods away, but the time I cannot justly tell; it might be twelve or one o'clock. I saw him in Golden-lane carrying the things from Mr. Lynch's house to Old-street to burn; I believe I saw him five or six times.</p>
               <p>What were the people doing in the house at that time? - Breaking down and throwing the things into the street; the rest of them were carrying them away to burn.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, five or six years.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Are you the person who informed against the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>When was it you first gave information that the prisoner was there? - He laid an information against another person, a butcher, I went to appear for that other person to give bail.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The next day about twelve or one o'clock.</p>
               <p>What is the butcher's name? - Webber; I went to the Artillery Ground to be bail for him; he lived next door to me. I told the justice I knew that young man Webber, he was at home all night; I said, I remember now seeing Randall carrying the goods away; a captain put that down, and made me be an evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Should you not have thought of informing against him if he had not informed against the butcher? - I did not want to make any disturbance.</p>
               <p>Court. What were they throwing out at the windows? - Boards, wainscoting, windows, and every thing belonging to the house.</p>

               <p>That night Mr. Lynch's house was pulled down, I did not see Mr. Randall stir from the door. I was looking out of a one pair of stairs window when the mob came. I heard them knock at the door first; they had no entrance, they broke it open. I do not think Mr. Randall was there, for he was at the door all the time. He lives in the same house with me; he has the two-pair-of-stairs room. I have the one-pair opposite Mr. Lynch. I stood at the door from the time of its being begun to be pulled down till almost three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you observe Randall do any thing? - No; he was at the door all the time. Mr. Randall was very much in liquor; they had a pot of beer and went up to bed.</p>
               <p>What time might that be? - About two o'clock; Mrs. Randall was a little in liquor, and I believe he was very much so.</p>

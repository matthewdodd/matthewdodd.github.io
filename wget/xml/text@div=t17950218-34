               <p>Q. Did you lose any linen the 6th of last month? - Yes, these things were all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180074"></xptr>away between the hours of seven and eight, a table cloth, three aprons, a gown, and a half handkerchief with my name on it, and a pocket handkerchief, and a cap with double borders.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where these things were on the 6th of January? - They were put in a clothes basket to be washed, by my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she put the articles in the clothes basket? - I know because she always, on Tuesday morning put the clothes in the clothes basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not she come here? Is she not well? - She is well, but has a large family. I see the things again at the police office, Westminster, after the prisoner was taken up at her lodgings. The prisoner was a servant to me, she lived in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Because you speak of her being taken up at her lodging? - She took a lodging after she left me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave you? - On the 6th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she with you in the forenoon? - She was, till between six and eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. She left your house that night? - She did, about twenty minutes before eight, I went out and I left her in the house, going backward to the wash-house with some dishes to wash up; I went out to go on my duty, as I belong to the patrol of St. Bride's parish; I went out to go to the watch-house, then my wife called her in.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell me what your wife said, I thought you knew better. - I know no further. My wife sent for me home about two or three minutes, before the clock struck eight, and I came home.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came home was the prisoner there? - No; mor I did not see the prisoner from that night till the Saturday following, this was Tuesday, and on the Saturday following I see her and apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you did see here? - In the Broad way, very near the police office; I see her, and I stepped up to her, and said, Mary, what made you run away, and take away so much of my property? she made me no answer; I took her home to see if she would confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any information that you would forgive her if she would confess? - I am very sensible that I did not; I took her home, she would not speak to me, and she went into the back parlour to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what she told your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. She said nothing to you? - No, but to my wife; then I took her from my apartment to the police office, and in taking her I see my half handkerchief tied about her head, with my name on it.</p>
               <p>

            How long before this had you seen this handkerchief of your's? - I had seen it almost every day, but being cold weather I did not wear it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the Tuesday that she went away? - I suppose two days, I will not say exactly, I suppose it might be about Monday that I put it off my neck, and throwed it among the dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else? - The constable was sent with me to the lodging, and found the rest of the things in her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were her lodgings? - At the top of Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were her lodgings? - The woman that she lodged with was with her, and she says, what is the matter you have taken up this girl?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180075"></xptr>I said, she was a thief, I have taken her up for thieving my property; says she, she has come to lodge with me, and I will not go home to my house till you get an officer to come and search the lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear her tell you that she had come to lodge with her? - Certainly she did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in her hearing that you said the woman should come and search her lodgings? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here? - No, she is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to search the lodging? - An officer, he is not here, I went with him and the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did she lodge in? - The one pair of stairs front room. The officer searched the room, and found the different articles that are mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present? - Yes; two aprons were found in the room, and the cap was sent out to be washed, and the gown cut into a bed gown, and the handkerchief and the table cloth; the prisoner was not by when the room was searched, she was confined in Tothillfields, directly after we went to Tothillfields, we went back to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that were found? - Here they are.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were they delivered? - They were in the hands of the officer, and as he is bad a bed, and cannot be moved, he begged of me to take them; I am able to swear that they are my things that we found, and that they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable go before the grand jury? - Yes, he is bound over, that was the session before this, she was sick the last session, and could not be tried.(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. You had no expectations that she would go away at that time? - No. This is the apron, I can swear that this is my wife's property; I know the check, I know her to wear them a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to them as well as your wife? - Yes, I can. Here is a gown I bought five years ago; she cut it up into a bed gown, but I can speak to its being the same gown, though it is cut up; I know it by the colour; I can swear to it that it is my wife's; there is no mark on it except the print. This is the double bordered cap, I know it is one of her caps, it is rather the worse for wear. This is an apron that I can swear to, it has got a slit in it, there is no mark on it. This is the half handkerchief with my own name on it; this is what the constable took from her head at the office, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it the name at full length? - No, only two letters, S. C. I can safely swear to its being my property. Here is the table cloth; the constable found it between the bed and bed tick, this large table cloth; I see my wife go out to buy it about a fortnight before it was taken, it has no mark, but I know it, I put it on the large table in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you keep a eating house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen any of these things except the neck handkerchief? - I had seen the table cloth on the table that very afternoon that she absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mistress took me into the room and promised me if I would tell every thing she would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You saw the prisoner in the Broadway, in company with the woman that she lodged with; was it after that you took the prisoner to your own house? - I took the woman and prisoner both at once to my house, and the woman told then where she lodged.</p>

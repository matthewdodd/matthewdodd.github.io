                  </hi>. I am foreman of the London Docks. On the morning of 6th Nov. I went to No. 6 warehouse—I found the wrapper of a case of arrow-root, partly cut, and partly torn off—I am certain it was perfect the day before—I then looked in the gangway leading to the other entrance, and saw the prisoner making his way out—he represented himself as a lighterman—lightermen do come to that place—he said he came for a bag of pepper; he thought he had seen his mate come in there, and he came in after him—I asked what lighter he belonged to—he said, "Mr. Gunner's"—I asked where the lighter lay—he said, "At the West Quay"—I remained with him till Mr. Dix came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. I went to the spice warehouse on 6th Nov.—I found the prisoner detained by Madge in the gangway—I asked what he was—he said he was a lighterman, and he was come to look for his mate, and they were come for some pepper—I told him lightermen had no business there, and he, knew it—he said he came to look for his mate—I took him in the constables' room and searched him—I found some pepper in his left-hand jacket pocket, and some was inside his shirt—I asked him where he got it, and he told me it was the sweeping of a barge—I told him he was in custody, and I asked him what barge—he said one of Mr. Gunner's—I asked him where she was; he said at the West Quay—I asked him to go and show me the barge—he said it was no use, he did not know where she was—I then went into the warehouse, and saw a bag of black pepper cut, and good part of it had run out—I took a sample of it, and it corresponded exactly with what I found on the prisoner—the bag appeared to have been fresh cut—I then went in the</p>

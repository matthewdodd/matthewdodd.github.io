               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Upon your oath, did not you take upon yourself to forgive him? A. No: Sir Henry William Martin is in Berkshire - I wrote to him by the first night's post; I did not give the prisoner into custody, because I did not know whether I had acted right; I had a communication from Sir Henry to go to Mr. Roe, the Magistrate, with a note, which I did - I knew it was my duty to apprehend the prisoner, but I did not know whether Sir Henry would have him taken up or not: I said I would not acquaint his master of it, if he told me where he had taken the lead to - it was the property of Sir Henry Martin; I had the prisoner apprehended, I think about three weeks afterwards - I had not told him he was to be taken up.</p>

               <p>JAMES GANTREY re-examined. Q. What day was it that you traced the prisoner to the house? A. On Wednesday the 10th of September, about twenty minutes after five o'clock - I put it into one of the rooms, and looked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You said you would not tell the prisoner's master, if he told you where he took the lead? A. That did not allude to this lead.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LUCAS. On the evening when they both came back together, the prisoner had a piece of lead, and it was thrown down with some old lead in the laundry - I said "I will take care that no lead shall go away, for I will take it away;" that piece was not kept by the witness.</p>

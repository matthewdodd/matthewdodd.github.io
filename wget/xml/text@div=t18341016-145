The prisoner hired a first-floor back room of me for 3s. a week, two years and a half ago - he stopped four or five months - he left me in August, 1832 - he was single, and had plenty of work - he left a guinea unpaid when he left - I found there was no one in the room - I went in, and missed the bed, blanket, and sheet, and other things - I gave information, and searched every pawnbroker's shop, but have not found the property - the prisoner is a tailor - I found him on the 29th of August last - I met him in Old-street, close by where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Did he keep the key of his room? A. Yes; I went in two or three days after he was gone - there were three or four other lodgers in the house - there is a private door the lodgers went in and out at - it is kept locked in the day time - it cannot be opened unless I open it myself inside - the prisoner's room door was locked - I opened it with a key of my own - I kept a bunch of keys - it was not a key made for that lock- it is usual with those who let furnished lodgings, to have keys that will open the lodgers' doors - I do not know whether that same key would open the other lodgers' doors- when I met the prisoner, I was riding in my chaise - I believe my horse touched his shoulder, and he looked up - I spoke with him for about ten minutes, but not about the rent- he could have gone off when he saw me, but I should very soon have gone after him - I do not know that he was in the habit of frequenting an eating-house in my neighbourhood - I saw nothing of him till I met him in Old-street - I know a man named Sweet - I have seen him in the prisoner's room, and in the street - I have been with him in a house, but I never drank with him - he came to my house, and said he knew where the property was, and dragged me about day after day, and wanted to extort half-a-sovereign from me - I said if he produced the property would give him half-a-sovereign.</p>

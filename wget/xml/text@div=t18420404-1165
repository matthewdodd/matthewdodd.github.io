                  </hi>. I am foreman in the service of the East and West Indian Dock Company. In consequence of suspicion which I entertained the prisoner was watched on the 4th of march last—he held the situation of cheque clerk, unconnected with the warehouse with which I was connected—his duties were performed in the office, not in the warehouse-about half-past twelve o'clock, when the men go to dinner I saw him by himself, on the floor of the warehouse, No. 2, where sampling was going on, of Bengal bags of sugar—I observed him making up a sample of sugar—he had not the slightest right to make up samples—when he had made it up he put it into his pocket—it was necessary for him to pass me in leaving the ware-house, and I entered into conversation with him, which gave me a full opportunity of observing his pocket, and it was very bulky—next morn<lb></lb>ing Dixon showed me a sample of sugar—it was exactly the same descrip<lb></lb>tion of sugar as that in the warehouse—they sample it by putting it into tubs—I am familiar with the quality of sugar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You state I had no duty to perform in the warehouse, and was utterly unconnected with it; on what grounds do you make that assertion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know of your duties in the general office uncon<lb></lb>nected with the warehouse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some papers produced by the pri<lb></lb>soner</hi>)—admitting these to be genuine, they have not the slightest reference to your coming to where the sampling was going on, for a moment—I am aware of the duties you have to perform as complier of the abstracts, but you have nothing to do with the floor of the warehouse, where the samplers were—these documents have nothing to do with the sampling—the dock foreman has not the slightest reference to that duty—it was not we pro<lb></lb>vince of the sampler to give you information, you should go to the office attached to the warehouse if you wanted information, and on this occasion you had no documents at all—the marks and numbers on bags of East India sugar generally vary from the manifest—you have to insert the marks in your abstract, to send to the dock-house—you have to go to the office, and not to the dock foreman for information—I have not seen clerks or labourers take handfuls of sugar out of the sampling tub to eat with their lunch, if so I should take notice of it—it might happen that some would be eaten, but it would be prevented—I have seen labourers eat sugar—I do not know of their potting it into their hot beer in winter time, or I should take no<lb></lb>tice of it—I was foreman in the East India Dock previous to the union of the two docks, and previous to that I was in the London Dock, but held no official situation there—I left there to go to the East India Dock—I was not dismissed—I entered the London Dock in the name of Owen Reardon,</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief of the police in the East and West India Dock. The prisoner was cheque-clerk—he had no right to go into the sampling warehouse in the performance of his duty—there is a general office and seventeen departments, to which there is a principal and ware-house keeper, and a cheque-clerk would have no communication with a fore<lb></lb>man or sampler, that I am aware of—<hi rend="italic">on</hi> the 4th of March, I received in<lb></lb>formation from Reading, I went to the lobby of the office between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I said, "Mr. Williams, I am quite aware of what has been going on at No. 2 warehouse, I do not want to make an exposure before all the clerks, but I want that sugar which you brought from the warehouse this morning"—he considered for a few seconds and then said, "Very well, I will give it you"—I went with him to his desk, and he handed me from his desk this parcel of sugar, which I pro<lb></lb>duce—he took it from the back of the desk, behind some books—it is East India sugar, and there are 2lbs. of it—I took him into the superintendant's private office—I searched him, and when he gave me the sugar I said, "You can give any account of this sugar you please, but if you do it will be repeated against you hereafter"—at that moment he gave me no answer, but when I had searched him he said, "Nobody gave me the sugar, I took it myself out of the sample tub"—I was before the Magistrate, and afterwards the examination was concluded, the prisoner was asked if he had any thing to say—I believe what he said was taken down by the clerk—I afterwards heard it read over to him—I believe his salary was a guinea and a half-a-week.</p>

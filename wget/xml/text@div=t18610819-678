On 27th July, at a little before 3 o'clock in the day, I apprehended a letter-carrier named Wright—I watched him as he was delivering letters on his walk<lb></lb>stopped him in the Old Kent-road as he was going home, and took him to the South Eastern office—I afterwards went to his lodgings, 6, Charlotte-place, Bermondsey—his mother keeps a shop on the ground-floor, behind which there is a parlour—I got to the shop about half-past 3, and saw the prisoner in the back room in his official coat, blue, with a red collar—he suddenly left as I went into the shop, and I followed him up-stairs to his bed room on the first-floor front, and found him in the act of pulling off his coat—he put it on the bed—there was only one bed in the room—I had made no charge against the prisoner at that time—while I was searching the room, the prisoner got towards the door, by the stairs, and I saw that he was about leaving the room in his shirt sleeves—I told him not to go away—he said that he was just going down stairs, he would return in a moment—he went down but did not return—I remained in the bed room nearly half an hour, and then went down to the lower part of the house and made inquiries for the prisoner, but could not find him—I had not then searched his coat—I gave instructions to Smee, another constable, to search it, left the house, and went to the South Eastern office—the prisoner had not been back there—I then returned to the lodging with Smee, who examined the coat, and I saw this letter found in the pocket with some others which Smee has got.</p>

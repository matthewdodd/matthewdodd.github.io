               <p>Q. Upon your detecting it not to be Mr. Ramsey's hand-writing did you shew it to Mr. Hume - A. I did; I gave it to Mr. Hume, and he took the other steps. There was no other person near the bill when I took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hume. Was that bill shewn you by Mr. Downes as he has represented - A. This bill was given me by Mr. Downes, I have been familiar with Mr. Ramsey's hand-writing about five years, I think it is not his hand-writing, it does not resemble it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the bill was shewn you by Mr. Downes did you send to Bow-street for two officers - A. I went for them myself, and went with Parker and them to the London-road. In my way I gave Parker two ten pound notes, I desired him to give the notes to the gentleman who had delivered him the bill. When we got near there I left Parker and the officers at the Circus; I staid behind, they went before me, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after them did you enter the coffee-house - A. I should think about seven or eight minutes, at that time the prisoner was with the officers in the back room, and Parker was there also, and the bill was in the room, either in my possession or in the officers. When I went in the room one of the officers was asking him from whom he got that bill, he said immediately that he had got it yesterday, from colonel Ramsey himself at the British coffee-house, he made that assertion more than once while in that room; I asked him whether he had ever been an officer in the 2d regiment, the Queen's, of which colonel Ramsey is major, he said he had. Then he was brought away to Bow-street.</p>

No, he seemed confused, and said he had received it of major or colonel Ramsey at a coffee-house in Cockspur-street, and he said he had been an ensign in the regiment that major or colonel Ramsey belonged to, but at that time he was in a West India regiment; these are the bank notes I took from him.</p>

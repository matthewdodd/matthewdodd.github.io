                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman,</hi> 225 <hi rend="italic">B</hi>). I heard a noise in York-street, Westminster, at a quarter past 11 o'clock at night on 27th July—I ran to the spot, and saw a soldier lying on the pavement bleeding very much from the head—some of the mob cried out, "That is him that did it," pointing to a man who was making away from the crowd in company with the prisoner and another person—he was attempting to go under the arch leading to Blue Anchor-yard—I followed, and took that man, <hi rend="italic">Mike,</hi> into custody—I saw a soldier's belt under his coat—I tried to get it from him—he dropped it, and it was taken up and given to me—I took Mike along to where the soldier was lying—Hemmings was with me, and he assisted in taking the man into custody—having taken him, I went back to where the soldier was—he was in the act of getting up—I asked him if that was the man—he said, "Yes," and I took him in custody—I then heard some words about a knife, but I could not say that it was the prisoner that said them—the prisoner came round directly after the words were used, and I received two or three very hard blows on the chest from the prisoner, which hurt me very much, and caused me to let go the other man, and I took the prisoner—a woman clawed at me in front at the same time, and some other man caught hold of me behind, and threw me on the ground with the prisoner on the top of me—I was kicked several times by others who were round—the prisoner was in the act of getting from me, and I struck him on the head with the truncheon—he then got away, and I believe he ran through Blue Anchor-yard, but I am not certain—I saw him afterwards in the Broadway—I followed him to the door of the Emigration Office—he ran and hid himself behind the door—I went in and took him—when I was at the station I found that I was wounded.</p>

On the night of 27th July, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I went to where I found the last witness with a man in custody—the man had a soldier's belt under his coat, and they were endeavouring to get it away from him—it dropped down, and some persons picked it up and gave it to my brother constable—the soldiers said, "That was the man that struck him;" and my brother officer said we would take him to the sta<lb></lb>tion—we were then surrounded; and the prisoner, who stood close by my left side, said, "Out with your knives and down with the b——rs," and directly I received a blow on the lower part of my hand and went to Pawley—I had four or five on me, and we all went down together—I had four or five kick<lb></lb>ing and <hi rend="italic">punching</hi> me—the prisoner went down Blue Anchor-yard, and we followed him.</p>

I live at No. 10, York-street, and am a light porter—I found this knife lying on the ground in York-street, Westminster, near the Blue Anchor, on 28th July, about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning—it was ten or twenty yards from the public-house—I afterwards found some blood on my clothes.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live in Eaton-street, Westminster—on 28th July the policeman was brought to my house—he had a wound on the chest three-quarters of an inch in length; it penetrated to the bone—his clothes were cut—the knife had passed through the double fold of his coat, and his under clothing was saturated with blood—the wound was a serious one; such an instrument as this knife might have done it—it must have been with great force to have gone through the clothes—if it had passed half-an-inch on one side it must have penetrated the heart—there was only one wound.</p>

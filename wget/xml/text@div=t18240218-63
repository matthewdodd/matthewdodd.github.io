On the 30th of January, I got up about four o'clock in the morning, leaving him in bed; I took my handkerchief, waistcoat, and hat off of this box, and went to work, leaving the box locked, and the key in my pocket. A person came, about half-past eight o'clock, and gave me information; I went home about ten, and missed my box, and could not find the prisoner. I returned home at one, and at half-past two he came in. I asked him where my box was - he said at first that he had not seen it, but after asking him some time, his brother said,</p>
               <p>"If you get your box you won't hurt him" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I want my clothes and my box, and nothing more" - meaning that I would not punish him if I got them. The officer went to Moorfields, where the prisoner said he had taken it to, and found it there. I gave the officer the key, unlocked it, and found everything there as I had left it in the morning; it was taken to the office. Edward Thomas is landlord of the house we lodged in - it is in the parish of St. James's, Westminster.</p>

            . On Friday, the 30th of January, I understood that the prosecutor had lost his box. I met the prisoner coming in doors about two o'clock, and followed him up stairs; and on entering the second floor room, occupied by one Tyler, I accused the prisoner of having stolen this box. He said, how could I think of accusing him of it - he had seen no such thing. I asked him how he could look me in the face and say he had not taken it, when I had seen him, between eight and nine o'clock, take it out myself (this was not true), and I must send for an officer. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't do that - I will take you to where it is, if you will go with me." I sent the landlord for a constable, and in the mean time he cried a great deal, wished us to go with him, and kept asking for forgiveness. When the constable came he insisted on his telling where the box was, that he might fetch it; he said he had taken it to No. 25, Little Moorfields, to Mrs. Jones, and that it was exactly as he had taken it away, for he merely went straight there and back. We asked him about a watch which had hung in the room - he said he had sold that for 5 s. to a person in the street, and he believed, on Ludgate-hill, but not being acquainted with town he did not know the street; 3 s. was found on him, which, he said, was part of what he had sold the watch for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 20, Cropley-street, Hoxton, in the parish of Shoreditch. On 16th Oct. I and my family retired just after 11 o'clock—I believe I was the last person up—I saw to the fastenings of the front door, and I believe other members of the family had secured the rest—between 2 and 3 o'clock I was called up by a policeman, and found the front door wide open, and a quantity of cloth tied up in a bundle by the shop door; the back parlour window was right up, and a ladder reared against it—my place appeared to be ransacked; the things were removed from the shelves of the shop—there was about 270 yards of fine cloth, and 10 or 12 yards of silk removed, which were worth 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a silver watch was taken out of the stand in the back parlour, which I had seen on the Sunday evening, at 11 o'clock—two boxes were taken from the sideboard in the back parlour to another part of the room—these goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all belong to me, and were safe on the night of the 16th—I found two chisels on the shop counter, which are not mine, nor were they there the night before—it was my ladder which was against the window—it was at the back part of the yard when I went to bed.</p>

On 17th Nov., a little after 2 o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Wenlock-street and Cropley-street—I had a view of Mr. Kenworthy's door from that point—I looked up and down the street, and saw the prisoner and another man emerge from the prosecutor's doorway—they stood apparently talking together for about half a minute, and I crossed over to them—there was not a soul else in the street, I had looked up and down before—seeing me they came towards me, and met me at the corner of Cavendish-street, which runs into Temple-street, between where I was standing and the prosecutor's shop—it was a beautiful moonlight night, one of the lightest nights I ever was out in—the prisoner was on the outside of the pavement, and as he passed by me I had a full view of his countenance, but the other I could not see so well, as he hung his head down—the prisoner wore a coat similar to what he has on now, and a plaid scarf, and a hat—I suspected that it was not all right, and found the door of the prosecutor's shop about a foot open—I then saw the prisoner and the other man running down Cavendish-street—I drew this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the streets, and know it to be correct—I ran to the corner of Cavendish-street and saw them running—I sprung my rattle, and called "Stop thief!" pursuing them across the New North-road to Minton-street, where I lost sight of them—I went back to the prosecutor's shop, and found three immense bundles of cloth tied up in the doorway, and the shop ransacked; the parlour window was open, and a ladder reared up against it—Mr. Kenworthy took a couple of chisels from the counter—I tried one of them to the marks in the window, and found that it fitted—the back parlour window had been forced—I found a box of matches there—I returned to the station and reported the robbery to the inspector, and on looking up I saw the prisoner, and said, "That is one of them that I chased"—he made no answer—the inspector went to the shop, brought the property down, and told the prisoner he would be charged with breaking into the tailor's shop—he said he could prove he was not there.</p>

On 17th Oct., about a quarter or ten minutes to 3 o'clock, I was on duty at Robert-street police station, and the prisoner was brought there by Alsworth on suspicion of entering the enclosed premises in the Wigmore-road, with intent to commit a felony—I asked him what his business was there; he said the fact was, he had been lodging at a house for a week, but had left there that morning, and the parties with whom he was lodging were to get him another lodging in the same road at the house of a person named Howard, or Coward, and he was looking for the house when he went into those places, he mentioned a number, but I forget it—as I thought there might be some truth in that statement, I directed a constable to go back and inquire whether he had really a lodging there or not—before the constable went, I said, How do you account for being out at this hour of the morning?—he said, I can explain that; I have been over in Long-acre to spend the evening with my brother, producing a card—I believe this to be the card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if it was his card; he said, No, it is the card of my brother—I sent a constable to the place where he said he had been lodging to ascertain the truth of his statement, and directed the prisoner to go and sit down—in a few minutes sergeant Busain entered, and said that there had been a burglary at a tailor's shop in Cropley-street—casting his eyes across the station to the prisoner, he said, That is one of them—I asked him for an explanation, because the prisoner had been brought from a distance—he explained the circumstances, and the prisoner made no reply whatever—I went down and examined the prosecutor's premises, and on my return the prisoner was sitting there still—I said, Well, sir, it is my duty to inform you that a much greater charge will be made against you; you will be charged with being concerned in this burglary—he merely said, I can prove I was not there—after the remand, I directed Alsworth to make inquiries at his brother's.</p>

                  </hi>. My brother keeps the Camden coffee house, No. 28, Old-street, St. Luke's, near the church, on the opposite side of the way—I live there. I heard on 18th Oct. of the prisoner being taken into custody—on Sunday night, or rather Monday morning, the 17th, he came about a quarter to 1 o'clock, and remained till about a quarter past 2—he had some refreshment, and then fell asleep—I awoke him—we keep open all night—there is no objection to that by the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—his falling asleep drew my attention to him—that is not an unusual thing at our house—I had no reason to notice the time he came in—I cannot say it was a quarter to 1 o'clock precisely—it may have been ten minutes later—it was not near 12 o'clock—I noticed the clock when I awoke him, and he went away—it was a quarter past 2 o'clock, that was about the time—I have been in that house about eleven weeks, but had not seen the prisoner before—I knew he was taken into custody, because his brother came to me at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a gold beater; we live at No. 12, Whitmore-road, Hoxton. The prisoner lodged close handy to us up to a week before this transaction—he left that place on the Sunday evening, about a week before this happened, and my husband let him lodge in our house—I undertook to find him another lodging, and found him one at No. 12, Whitmore-street, nearly opposite where we live, which is Whitmore-road—I have known him fourteen or fifteen years, and always considered</p>

               <p>him to be an upright, honest young man—on this Sunday I went out to a funeral, and left him at home—I did not see him again till about half past 2 o'clock in the night—I saw the people at the lodging I had found for him, and they engaged to sit up for him—about half past 2 o'clock I was asleep, and he knocked at the door—I sent him to the lodging, not knowing it was so late, or I would not have sent him, because they are very early people—an inquiry was afterwards made by the policeman, and I gave him an answer.</p>

Q.</hi> Has your house any garden in front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all the houses have, on each side down the road—the house in which I had taken him a lodging had not a garden in front, but he made a mistake, and went there instead of to the street opposite—I had told him where it was, but he thought it was No. 12 opposite, instead of which it was in the street opposite, twelve doors down—I recollect that H was Sunday, 16th Oct., because I went to a funeral, and returned home at half past 8 o'clock in the evening—I did not see the prisoner, but I heard him at the street door—I know what time it was, because he said to me, Do you think they will let me in, Mrs. Grimsley? and I said, They are sitting up for you, not knowing it was so late; but after he was gone I took a candle, and looked at the clock—I did not tell the policeman that I had left the prisoner at the Pewter Platter—I never saw him, nor did I say that he said he was going to his brother's.</p>

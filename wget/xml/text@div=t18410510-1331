                  </hi>. I drive a broom cart. On the 24th of April, I went to the Magpie public-house and drank—I had then two sovereigns and three shillings in my bag—I went out, and the prisoner got up into the cart to ride—after a little time she said, "I have lost some of my books, you bald-headed old b——you have got them"—I said, "I have not, search me all over," and I pulled up my frock—I felt her hand go hard down by my right side, near where I had my money, in my right-hand pocket—she then got out and went off—I went on a few rods, and I then missed my money—I pulled up and went to the Magpie, and asked where the woman was—two men said she was gone off towards Colnbrook.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I was in the West India Docks, and Slater said, 'I have an order for two pounds of meat; will you get it for me?' I said, 'Why do not you get it yourself?' He said, 'I had two pounds of meat there yesterday, and am ashamed to get more there to-day.' He said Mr. Thompson sometimes gave him an order, and 'If the butcher asks if Mr. Thompson gave it to you, say yes.' I was to ask for the meat first and give the order afterwards, or I should get inferior meat. He stopped at the corner, and Mr. Shephard gave it me; he said it would not do. Mr. Slater has been to Dr. Thompson's house, his wife has been lately confined."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went down to the West India Docks on 20th September. I got there at twenty minutes past seven, and saw Slater; he said, "I have got an order for two pounds of meat; will you go and get it?" I asked him the reason he could not get it; he said, "I had two pounds yesterday, and am ashamed." I did not at first consent, I had to get work, and it would not be any benefit to me, but he wished me so that I consented. I walked up the Commercial Road, up Jubilee Street, and went into Mr. Shephard's shop and asked for the meat before I gave him the order, because Slater had told me if I did not ask for the meat first I should get inferior meat. When I gave him the order he said, "Did Mr. Thompson give you this?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "N shall I take you to Mr. Thompson, or will you go about your business?" I said, "Not without the meat." I thought it was a genuine order, and if I went about my business he would have the money and no one would have the meat. He took me to Mr. Thompson, who gave me in charge. This Slater, in his evidence before Mr. Woolrych, said that I said when he showed me the order, "It is strange that he should give you an order like that; any<lb></lb>body could make one, "and that he said, "No, I suppose there is a mark about it somewhere, "trying to make out, because I said that, that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220119"></xptr>
               <p>forged the order, but anybody can discuss upon the probability of making a bank note without the least intention of doing so, and I would not do such a thing. Mr. Woolrych said, "Had you got a genuine order about you?" He said "No," but if he had not, what was I alluding to when I said it would be easy to make one like that." Therefore it must have been the forgery, and if he did not give me the order I must have gone home and written it. Now I had not been home since I left home in the morning, I had no paper about me, and if the constable had searched me effectually he would have seen that I had no blue paper. That is not my writing, I should not have been able to write it; there ought to have been some of this person's writing produced to see whose writing it corresponds with. Slater has been under six masters in the docks, and industrious persons do not change about like that; he is associated with a prostitute and a thief, his wife told me so, and that she had no longer any faith in him. He told me that he should never buy sugar while he was in the docks. It may suggest itself to your minds that if he is such a bad person I ought not to asso<lb></lb>ciate with him, but I did not know him to be a forger or perjurer, and in the docks you cannot speak to whom you please. I thought the order was genuine, and therefore I took it; he told me a dozen times that if Mr. Shephard asked me if Mr. Thompson gave it to me I was to say "Yes," and I did tell him so once, but I meant all the time if there was any bother about it to say who gave it to me, and I did so. I should not have run the penalty attaching to forgery if I had not believed Slater, nor should I have gone to Mr. Thompson and to the police-court. This lawyer makes up a case against me, but it is like the fog that comes over London, a few words of the wind of truth will blow it all away. If I am convicted I shall add another to the names of those who have unjustly suffered.<hi rend="smallCaps">

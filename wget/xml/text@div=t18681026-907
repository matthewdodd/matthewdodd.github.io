I am a baker, of 127, Queen's Road, Whitechapel—on 24th September, about 12.40 a.m., I was in Osborn Street, and saw the prisoner—I was going to ask what he wanted, but my arms were twisted, my legs tripped up, and the prisoner took my watch and money, and an 10 U for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my brother—he did not hurt me, it was the others who twisted my arms and kicked my legs from under me—there were from four to six of them—my chain was broken off—one of them put his knee on my kidneys, and pulled me down—they ran away, and when I came-to I was robbed—I saw the prisoner next day at the Police Court with about even more, and knew him the moment I saw him.</p>

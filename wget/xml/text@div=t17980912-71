             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. I am a surveyor of the Marine Police-office. On Thursday night, the 30th of August, about eleven o'clock, as I was going down the river, on the north side, in the course of my duty, just below Ratcliff-cross, I observed a boat coming towards me with two people rowing, and one sitting a-stern; I was then close in shore, under the shadow of the house; as the boat came nearer to me, I sheered off from the shore to intercept her; upon my coming out from under the shadow, they discovered me, and immediately sheered off towards the South side; another of our boats was following directly after me, and we both pulled towards them as fast as we could; the boat in which Mr. Wright was went on the south side of a ship then riding in the middle of the stream, a ship or brig I am not positive as to that; our other boat followed her, and I went the north side of the ship, athwart her bow, and by the waving of the water under her bow, which I could see by the light of the moon, I conceived that something was thrown overboard, I rowed immediately to the place, and took in a bag of coffee from out of the water, where I perceived the waving; at this time the two boats were in sight, but had turned to go down the stream; I mean Mr. Wright's boat and our other boat; it detained me the space of a minute to get this bag in; in that time they had got a considerable distance, so much so, that I could not distinguish one boat from the other; I perceived there were two; I soon after perceived one rowing close in upon the south shore, and the other following; I then rowed in for the shore, shaping my course a little a-head of her, that I might keep her off, and rowed up along-side of her, one of the watermen hooked her with his boat-hook, and held her; I desired Mr. Wright to come out of that boat, and come into mine, that he must go with me to the Marine Police-office, there to give an account of his conduct, upon which he refused to come; I told him I was in the execution of my office, and it was my business to take him; he would not come into my boat; I told him it was of very little consequence, and I got into his, and took one of my men to row; I sat down in her stern, but he would not let my man row; he said, he would take one oar, and his man should row us where we pleased; I told him that would not do, if he would not go into my boat, or let my man row, I must take him by force; I then took hold of him by the collar, and by the assistance of my men, I took him by force into my boat, and we took him to the Marine Police-office, just by Wapping New-stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Mr. Wright one of the prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the river was it? - A.The Middlesex side.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the coffee which you picked up in the river came from the boat in which Mr. Wright was? - A. Certainly, I have no doubt at all; I suffered him to depart that night, in consequence of the man at the office saying he was a man of property and respectability, and he would answer for his returning in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120075"></xptr>Q. What became of the man and boy? - A. The boy I left in charge of the office-keeper, and the man I put in Wapping watch-house till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. You are a surveyor of the Marine Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to say, you are one of the officers employed by the Justices? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Wright before? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mr. Wright's boat seeing you, they tried to evade you? - A. As it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been surveyor of the Marine Police-office? - A. Two months, or something better.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employment before? - A. I had been a wine-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever employed by the Customs or Excise? - A. Yes, by the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been employed by the Excise? - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thames? - A. No, on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Wright was taken at last, and the boat was stopped, you let him go, upon his promise to return in the morning? - A. Yes; I understood he was a <rs id="t17980912-71-deflabel419" type="occupation">coal-merchant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17980912-71-defend730 t17980912-71-deflabel419"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. He did come the next morning? - A. Yes, he came between eleven and twelve o'clock to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you his address that night? - A. He did; he left a card with me.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning he came to his appointment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The card was a true representation of his address? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have been in the employment of the Excise, I dare say you can tell us this coffee, wherever it came from, was in the berry, was it not? - A. Yes, it was raw coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course being found in that situation, it was liable to be condemned, you know? - A. It was undoubtedly, as contraband goods.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you know too, that the person upon whom that species of property is found, is liable to a penalty of treble the value of the goods, and his boat liable to forfeiture? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that part of the river Thames, I take it no smuggling ever goes on? - A. It would be absurd in me to suppose it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that as one of the officers of the Police, and having been in the service of the Excise, you should feel it your duty to stop smuggling, as well as any thing else? - A. No, at present I have no authority to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no authority, perhaps, to put in force the Bum-boat Act? - A. I think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Wright came the next day to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And offered himself to the Magistrate as the person that had been taken the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am one of the surveyors of the Marine Police-office: I was on duty on the 30th of August; we were dropping down the river upon the watch with Mr. Gottey.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the hours assigned you that night? - A.From ten at night till five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as describe what took place? - A. A little after eleven, as near as I can guess, we were lying under the shade of the house, when we saw a boat coming up, and as soon as he perceived us, he rowed directly towards the south side.</p>
               <p>Q. She was coming to westward at first, and then changed her course to the south? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to do that to avoid you? - A. They certainly did; I made my people pull as hard as they possibly could pull up the river; they turned upon me very quick, and turned down the river; I pulled as hard as I could, and then she turned again; I found it impossible to catch her, and Mr. Gottey, my brother officer, got sight of them passing a ship, and cut her off short, and I continued in full pursuit of her at the same time; in a very short time he cut them off, and ran them on shore; in one or two minutes after I came up, and we took possession of Mr. Wright; he made some resistance, by laying hold of my coat; Mr. Gottey wanted to put him into our boat, and he would not go; then we forced him into our boat; I was perfectly well armed, and I thought of giving him a cut or two, but I thought it would have been cowardly if I had; I took possession of his boat.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the Three Sisters lay at this time? - A. At Limehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation at any time with Hewlings, respecting any part of the cargo? - A. Yes, eight or ten days before the 30th of August; having in my mind no evil design, I was speaking of my small income; on being accosted by Hewlings one evening, on deck, he told me, I might as well have a few shillings as not, because he said, it was a customary rule for officers and mates, in such cases; and that he would find a customer for a few beans, meaning coffee, and a little sand, meaning sugar, which he expressed three or four times over; he likewise told me, he had been mentioning it to the steward, and that he was agreeable to it; I told him, it was a dangerous circumstance, and I did not wish to be concerned in it; he told me, there was no fear, for he would find one who would take it away without discovery; upon saying so, and feeling a pressure upon me from the wants of my family, I was so foolish as to consent to it; the Custom-house and Excise-officers were to have a small quantity of coffee out of a number of bags, to prevent a discovery, that it might not be missed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ship loaded with? - A.Coffee and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea how many bags you had on board at that time? - A. I suppose there were about seven hundred and fourteen or sixteen bags at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the bags? - A.Different sizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the officers that were to take these small quantities out of the bags? - A.Hewlings and Bearblock, and one Dowling, a man who has absconded; Oliver was not on board at that time; and in a day or two after, they set to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it set to work? - A. I saw all the Custom-house officers and the steward on deck, and Dowling, an officer of an adjoining ship.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Mr. Wright on board? - A. One evening I saw Mr. Wright on deck, speaking to Hewlings, and in consequence of that, Mr. Wright told me, if I had any private venture, he would take it safe on shore for me, and send it safe to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Thursday, the 30th? - A. I think it was the Monday night or Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in answer to him? - A. I made him very little reply, because I did not know the man; I said, I had nothing at present. I saw him several times afterwards, speaking with Hewlings and Oliver, but I did not know what passed between them. It was agreed between me and Hewlings, and Oliver and Dowling, that I should walk the quarter-deck while they were in the hold. A few days before, Hewlings told me, there was a mate wanted thirty pounds of coffee, but I had no share of that, nor the steward.</p>
               <p>Q. State any thing that passed between you and them respecting the transaction of Thursday, the 30th of August? - A.There was no conversation passed more than that; there were four or five bags filled with coffee, and carried away, I did not see them filled; I was on deck while Oliver, Dowling, and the steward, were in the hold; I saw four or five bags brought out of the hold, Hewlings assisted Dowling in hauling them up, and Oliver handed them up; then they were handed into Mr. Wright's boat, Mr. Wright received them; I handed one of them in myself, and Oliver and Dowling assisted; Bearblock was on the quarter-deck, that he might give notice of any Revenue-boats coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Could Bearblock be on deck without seeing these bags lowered over? - A. No, I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received them from the ship's side? - A. Mr. Wright; I saw him hand them along the lighter into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Mr. Wright, the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bags did you see slung over the ship, and received by Mr. Wright? - A. Either four or five, I am not certain which; I am sure of four, I saw the skiff put off with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the boat besides Mr. Wright? - A. There were two others, but I could not see who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time received, from either of the prisoners, any money on account of the transaction of the 30th? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation respecting any money for that transaction? - A. No. Oliver told me that Mr. Wright was pursued by the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120078"></xptr>police-boats, and taken; but that he was set at liberty, and his two people kept in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bearblock near enough to hear that conversation? - A. No. I told him, I should not permit any more such practices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You were mate of this ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the cargo of this ship been delivered? - A. I understand it has; I was not from on board till it was all delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the hill of lading, what quantity was shipped on board? - A. I know what account I took myself of the taking of it in, there were seven hundred and fourteen or sixteen bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it come to your knowledge what quantity has been delivered to the owners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the custom of the captain of this ship to lie on shore, when the ship was in the river? - A. Sometimes he did, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not constantly on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was out of the ship, of course, the care of that ship remained with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You, as the commanding officer, had the custody of the cargo, and the care of the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several transactions, before your morality gave way, upon these occasions, and you had parted with some of this coffee before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had some money before, though none on the 30th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were upon the deck, the night of the 30th - the steward did not come out of the hold, did he? - A. He was upon deck, I believe, I am certain he was out of the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself carried one of the bags, and lowered it into the lighter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The steward and you were both upon deck, helping to carry these bags? - A. I do not know that he helped, he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You both took a part in this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no conversation with the people in the boat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wright did not speak to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the people with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wright was in the lighter, and whatever was handed over the side, was received by him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wright it was that asked you if you had any private venture to dispose of? - A. Yes, before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Dowling had a good deal to do with it? - A. Yes; he was the principal man that introduced Mr. Wright first.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you perceive any thing going on that respected the 30th of August? - A. Dowling went away that night, after Mr. Wright was gone on shore with the coffee.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not hear any more of him? - A. No. Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. You never had but one conversation with Mr. Wright? - A. Yes, twice.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, if you had any private adventure, he would take care of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when he talked of a private adventure, was he not using the common language that is used, when men talk of smuggling transactions on the river Thames? - A. Yes; but I had nothing to smuggle.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the West-India trade? - A. Fifteen or sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you always a mate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have risen to be mate from lower situations? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never any thing higher than a mate? - A. Yes, I have been master of the Granby.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to cease to be master? - A. She had been sold out of the trade; I had been mate of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say, that that is the only reason why you ceased to be master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never had any dispute about your accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the mate of that ship? - A. The mate and I had some dispute, and he entered on board a man of war, at Limerick.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he was pressed? - A. He entered.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a charge of 3001. for slaves employed in the West-Indies? - A. Not 300l. I believe there was 150l. of Jamaica currency.</p>
               <p>Q. It was more than that you charged for forty slaves, you know? - A. I think it was 150l.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that not to be paid you by the owners? - A. I cannot say; the mate and I had some dispute, and he thought that I had put down more persons than were employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that that man was not pressed before he entered? - A. Yes; at least he told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was he not taken by a pressgang, before he entered? - A. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his going ashore at Limerick? - A. He went on shore, and left the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire for him before you left Limerick? - A. I saw him in Limerick, upon the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had entered? - A. Yes; he told me he had entered.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he was pressed? - A. He was not pressed that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Your owners did not allow that 150l.? - A. I do not know how much they allowed, it was left to arbitration.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120079"></xptr>Q. How much was allowed you for that? - A. I am not certain, I have not got the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not 30l.? - A. It was more than that.</p>

               <p>Q. And in consequence of that, were you not dismissed from the ship? - A. I never was told that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no idea that you were discharged from being master of that ship, because your accounts were incorrect? - A.Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send any private adventure on shore with Mr. Wright? - A. Yes; he took a bag of coffee on shore for me on Tuesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, whose writing is that? - A. It is mine; I gave it him with that bag.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, as you had no evil design, of course, this is the only transaction of the sort that you have had, this trip? - A. Nor ever any other trip.</p>
               <p>Q. You never offered any coffee to sell, as your own, to any body else? - A. Not to sell, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you ever offered coffee to any body else to sell, as your own? - A. There was a gentleman, one Mr. Taylor, who was on board of the ship one evening; when he came in, I told him, perhaps, before the ship was out, I might be able to give him a little for sea stock, which I meant to get out of the cabin, that was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the only person, was it? - A. I do not recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Cooke? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his coming on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. At Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any of these people were on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember asking him how things went on in London? - A.  I told him, I had a little rum of my own, which I had got from the captain, and that, perhaps, as I had heard that it was customary for the mates to have the sweepings, I might have a little coffee for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him what price? - A. Yes. He told me, he did not know, but he would find a customer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him it was to be stolen coffee? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mean it was to be smuggled coffee? - A. I considered it as my perquisite.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much sweepings of coffee there was on board this ship? - A. No, I cannot say, because I was not on board when she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. The sweepings of the hold can never be ascertained till the cargo is delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And those sweepings, you told Cooke, you should have as a perquisite? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. I believe the mates on board these ships, give a bond, that no loss shall happen by smuggling? - A. The owners give it, I suppose, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever read your ship's articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not one of the conditions, that you shall forfeit your wages, in case of your smuggling, or any other of the officers? - A. Yes, in some cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in all cases, upon your oath? - A. I cannot be certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different articles have you signed in the course of your life? - A. I cannot say; I have been a great many voyages.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been mate? - A. Five or six voyages.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been master? - A. Only one voyage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. This disputed article of 300l. with your former owner, I think you have stated at 150l. Jamaica, how much sterling is that? - A. About 100l. I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you received money at different times? - A. Yes; I received from Hewlings, 3l.; from Oliver, 4l. 19s.; from Dowling, 2l.; and from Hewlings, another time, 2l.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon what account? - A. For eighty pounds of raw coffee, taken out of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is frequent for the petty-officers to have some small adventure of their own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that kept? - A. We had very little private adventure in our ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cargo of your ship put in the hold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any private adventure mixed with it at all? - A. There was none that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. And it is your business to know that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Upon what account did Oliver say that he paid you the money? - A. For the second delivery to Mr. Wright, including a hundred weight carried on board the adjoining ship by Dowling.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday night, what was your answer to Mr. Wright, who offered to take on shore your private adventure? - A. I said, I was not certain whether I should, but I did send it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mate? - A. Yes, in the cabin; the mate asked the price of coffee in London; I told him I did not know, as it was a thing I never had dealt in; he said, cannot you help me to a customer; I said, it was so notorious that I could not; I asked him how much he had got; and he said, seven or eight hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he told you he had seven or eight hundred weight of his own coffee? - A. Yes; and he said he had got some rum, but he did not offer me that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was as far back as the 17th of August? - A. Yes, or thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it eleven or twelve at night? - A. No, in the forenoon.</p>

On the 31st of March I was in Charlton-street and saw the two prisoners together in company—they passed me, and Jenkins said to the other, "I will go into the green-grocer's shop"—the other said "It is no use going into that shop, it is a stale game there"—Jenkins went in, and Perry waited close by my side till Jenkins came out, and went away—Perry waited some time by me, then followed him returned, and came and stood by me—Jenkins went down a passage—went into Osbaldeston's shop immediately after the prisoners had left me and gave a description of them to a policeman instantly.</p>

The prisoner Jenkins came to my shop for some on one and then asked me to let him have twopenny-worth of turnip-tops—he gave me a half-crown—I did not look at it particularly—I took up my apron to give him change—he said, "I think I have got halfpence"—he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had not enough, he must give me a half-crown—he then took four or five half-crowns out of his pocket and gave me one—Hamilton came in soon after, and asked if it was a good one, and I then found it was not—I gave it to the officer.</p>

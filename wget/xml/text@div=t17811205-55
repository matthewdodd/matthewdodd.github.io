               <p>Letter read. Dear Miss, I received your letter of the 28th inst. wherein you suggest an inclination to be concerned in some genteel line of business in London, particularly a grocer is agreeable to your request; with infinite pleasure I enquired for a person in that line; I have found a very agreeable person, and shall have an answer next week: If it proves favourable, it is in a very respectable family in your own knowledge, the stock in trade that will be wanted, will be 100 l. or less, agreeable to your wish. In consequence of which, I would earnestly recommend to you to come to town, as there is not a doubt of meeting with something in that line; in fact I am astonished, so fine a young woman as you certainly are, should kill time among such unsocial people, so uncultivated in politeness. I have not the idea of your not meeting with success, your conduct entitles you to my highest opinion; if you will inform me what day the coach will come by, I will meet you. I beg you will write on return of the post, stating how matters shall be conducted. Rely upon secresy, and I remain your sincere friend,</p>

             several days, it was not concluded upon till Saturday, but the Tuesday preceding, I went to Croydon. Upon my return upon the Wednesday, I found my trunk open, I returned about eleven in the morning, I had the key in my pocket; I am very clear that I locked it when I went out, and I considered some time, and set down and looked all the things over, and found it as I had left it, every thing safe, my bank bills were not in the trunk, then my fears subsided immediately; Mr. Turner in the mean time, asked me if I had locked up my property, if not, there were drawers of his wife's at my service.</p>
               <p>Did you express your fears at your trunk being open? - No; I never mentioned any thing to the family. Upon the Thursday Turner asked me if I had locked up my property, the first part of the time I laid up stairs with the old lady's daughter. On the Friday I lay in the back parlour where the trunk was, Mr. Turner's wife laid with me. Upon Friday morning, going down Hatton-garden, I made observation to Mr. Turner, it was unsafe to wear pocket hoops, it being easy to have ones pockets picked; Mr. Turner asked me, if I had got my pocket-book in my pocket, I told him yes, I had before told him I had two bank bills, a 50 l. and a 20 l. and a note of hand for 20 l. he requested me to lock them up, and said it was not safe to carry them about, this was between nine and ten Friday morning; when I came home, which was not till late in the evening, I promised him I would.</p>

               <p>Did you lock it up on the Friday? - No, not till the Saturday; I lay that night with Mrs. Turner, and upon the Saturday morning, after breakfast, he asked me if I had locked up my things, I told him I would do it before I went out; upon the Saturday I went out for all day, I put the key in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050083"></xptr> pocket, returned about five in the evening, being much indisposed I had my tea in the fore parlour, with Turner and his wife, this was on the 6th of October, nothing happened while I was drinking tea.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - At seven o'clock the same evening, I went and locked up my purse in the trunk.</p>
               <p>What money was in it? - Eight guineas and a half, and a crown piece; I looked at the pocket-book and the bank bills, and they were all safe; Mr. Turner was then at home; sometime afterwards, he told me he was going out to raffle for a gun, and he went out; a little after eight, he returned home again, and called his wife out of the fore parlour backwards.</p>
               <p>What communication is there between them, is there a door that goes out of the back parlour into the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does the back parlour communicate with the fore parlour? - No; there is a staircase between them; his wife returned in ten minutes, but he did not. In about a quarter of an hour after, the lodger's daughter came in, Miss

               <p>The door being a-jar, was you placed so as to be able to see into the entry? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you sitting down? - I was; during our being there there was a great noise heard on the stair-case in the passage.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Turner was with you all this time? - Yes; I asked the reason of Miss Dickson, of this noise, the answer I received was, that it was her mother's company going home.</p>
               <p>What sort of noise was it? - It was a noise as if three or four people were pushing one another, getting something out of the house.</p>
               <p>What might be the weight of the trunk? - Upon my word I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Could you have taken it in both your hands and lifted it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it about forty pounds? - It might weigh that.</p>
               <p>Then it did not require two or three people to carry it out? - No; when this noise had subsided a little, this young woman left us and went up stairs, a little after nine o'clock Mr. Turner returned home again, he then called his wife out a second time, they had some conversation together.</p>
               <p>You had not supped? - No.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - It was proposed what they should have for dinner on Sunday, as I had not dined in the house since I came to London, having many friends in town besides them, the wife then went to market, they were to have a leg of pork for dinner; then he requested to know, what I would have for supper, and he proposed oysters; I eat what supper I thought proper, a toast and nothing else, afterwards we set down, and talked together, till between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>So from the time you had been in your room at seven o'clock, you never went in it 'till this time? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven; I went into the room first, and Mrs. Turner followed; as soon as I came into the room I missed my trunk; as soon as I had missed the trunk, I told Mrs. Turner somebody had taken away the trunk, and we looked round the room.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Turner say? - She said it could not be gone, if it was, it must be by somebody in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you call the rest of the family? - I went into the fore parlour to Mr. Turner, I told him I was robbed, and my trunk was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time suspect Mr. Turner at all? - Not at that time, he came into the room and said, if it was gone, he was confident it must be his lodgers up stairs; then he called his lodgers down; Mrs. Dickson, the old lady, he challenged with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners lodged in the house? -

            ; she denied it, and said he was more likely to rob me than her; a great quarrel ensued; I then desired Mr. Turner, to try to get me a warrant, that I might take those people up; he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050084"></xptr> it was so late no warrant could be granted at that hour; he thought the most advisable way, was to offer to those creatures, as he called them, up stairs, twenty guineas, as they lived in London he had no doubt I should receive my property again; I was surprised at this account, because he had said before, Mrs. Dickson was a woman of fortune.</p>

               <p>This was Sunday? - Yes; he told me there could be no such thing till next day; I was very desirous to go that day; then I wished to have some hand-bills printed, and I set down and gave a description as well as I could.</p>
               <p>(The hand-bill was produced and read by her; she was asked, if all those things were in her trunk, to which she said, yes.)</p>
               <p>Where did you go on the Sunday besides? - I went to my friends in Fleet-street, and got those hand-bills printed upon the Sunday. I lost all my wearing apparel in this trunk, except my gowns, which were not in the trunk, and some of my linen.</p>
               <p>Were they in the room? - No; in another room, in the fore parlour. I went up in the afternoon to Mr. Clark in Bow-street, and I did not see Mr. Turner afterwards till the evening, he came to my friends to seek me; I did not lay at Turner's that night; I had taken my gowns away that evening, and I went to Mr. Clarke, and informed him of this robbery, about three in the afternoon on the Sunday. Turner did not go with me; on Sunday evening, I had one of Mr. Triquet's clerks came to pay me a visit, and wished me to come up to their office; he was an Oxford man, one Fletcher; he desired I would come the next morning and breakfast; when I was there, he related to Mr. Triquet what had happened, and Mr. Triquet asked me whether I would chuse to have those people taken up.</p>

               <p>Then you did not desire Mr. Turner to be taken up? - No; they were brought before Mr. Triquet, and went through an examination.</p>
               <p>How came Mrs. Brewer to be taken up? She lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>How came Mrs. Moore to be taken up? - She was on a visit; they were all in the house together; as to Mrs. Dickson, and her daughter Fell, after they were taken up, nothing was found upon them, and they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Turner attend there? - Mr. Turner attended, and said they were a parcel of thieves, and got their bread by shoplifting; he gave them a very bad character, and said Mrs. Fell was under recognizance for taking her trial at Westminster, for shoplifting, that was old Mrs. Dickson's daughter, the young lady that came to see me; they were all discharged. After this I returned to my friends in Fleet-street, and remained silent for a few days.</p>
               <p>There was an end of your engaging with the grocer? - Yes; a few days after I was sent for to Mr. Clark's office, about the Wednesday or Thursday following: Mr. Clark informed me, he had found out the man who had opened my trunk, and who had locked it, and unlocked the trunk, and fastened it down again. This very much surprised me; he told me Mr. Turner had procuted it to be done, upon this I went to the office in Bow-street, and requested a warrant to take him up, he was taken up as I requested a warrant to take him up. - Mr. Justice Wright examined him, and he was ordered to Clerkenwell prison upon suspicion: when he was examined, he gave an account what sort of people his lodgers were, and what money his wife had to go to market; she contradicted him, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050085"></xptr> he had given her four or five shillings, she said it was half a guinea; nothing passed about the box a considerable time, and after that I told Justice Addington, that when I came home, upon the Wednesday, it was opened. Mr. Addington asked him, how that happened; he said his little girl was in the room, and threw it down.</p>
               <p>Was it a sort of trunk for a little girl to throw down? - No, my Lord, it was not; the little girl was about four years old, and the trunk stood upon a large box; he said, by the force of its falling, the lock sprung open, the things were not tumbled, the things were all very straight as I had left it.</p>
               <p>Was the lock pushed back or forced open? - I thought it had been forced open, I believe, to the best of my knowledge, the lock was shoved back. Mr. Addington then said, how came he to apply to a blacksmith to fasten the lock again; his answer was, he did it, because I should have no mistrust of any thing that had happened, because he did not wish to have any words about his little girl.</p>
               <p>When was it the smith was employed? - I heard the Friday, I had locked it after I found it open upon the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know of yourself of its being opened any oftener than that Wednesday? - No; I did not know it; I constantly locked it from the Wednesday morning, and I always found it locked after: after this examination he was ordered back to prison, bail was granted him afterwards; I had a search warrant to search the house of

            , and another to search the house of a Mrs. Watty, where Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Brewer were; one of them had removed their lodgings; we attended early in the morning upon Saturday the 3d of November; I went with the warrant where the two prisoners were; the first apartment we searched was a back room, occupied by Mrs. Brewer, I found there a ghenting half handkerchief, which I delivered to the constable M'Manus, telling him that was part of my property.</p>
               <p>What value might that be of? - One shilling; there was my own mark upon it: then we went into the fore room which belonged to Mrs. Moore.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Brewer by at the time you found the handkerchief? - Yes; she said when I challenged her with it, she had bought it at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was in your trunk when you locked it? - Yes; then I went into the room which belonged to Mrs. Moore, and there we found in the drawers a muslin flounced apron, which is here; I told Mr. M'Manus that was my property, but they had made a great alteration, which I would tell the justice of; we found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found in Mr. Turner's house? - No; we all went to the magistrates; when we came there, Mrs. Brewer said the handkerchief was her property, that she bought it at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Moore say about the apron? - She said it was her apron, and she could call Miss Ainsworth to prove she had got it up several times; a day was appointed for it; this was Friday, and they were brought up the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Were they committed? - They were; Miss Ainsworth did not appear, but she brought another woman to prove the getting up this apron: this woman said she had got it up several times, that there was one place she had tore it in the middle in getting it up, but she had neatly darned it; I don't know her name; the Justice requested to look at it, but there was no such thing found in it; she said the flounce consisted of three pieces on one side, and two on the other.</p>
               <p>Is it so? - No; there is four on one side, and two on the other.</p>
               <p>Had you before them mentioned any thing about this joining? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon her Cross-Examination, Miss Hayes deposed, that her first suspicion rested upon Turner, from Mr. Clarke's information, and the smith's affidavit; that Turner did all he could to aggravate her suspicions respecting the other people in the house, and urged her on to apprehend them; that she did not chuse to accept of the offer of his wife's drawers to put her things in, as every thing was secure; that Mr. Turner went out after eight, and soon after she heard the noise.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination, upon the part of Brewer and Moore.</p>
               <p>Did not you express some doubt respecting the property, that the handkerchief was not your's? - Not to the handkerchief; I expressed a doubt with respect to the apron, it was made up wrong; I said this is my apron, it was made one way, but they have altered it; I said I had every reason to think it was mine.</p>
               <p>What did you think with reference to the handkerchief? - I expressed no doubt whatever to the handkerchief, but only to the apron; of my own voluntary motion I swore to the handkerchief, it was not from any suggestion from any body.

               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - Yes; I signed it; I did not know it was an information; Turner applied to me before the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What day? - That was the part of the evidence I supposed I might vary in, I will tell you why; there were three or four women in the house drinking tea, when Turner came in, and after I had been before a magistrate, I went and asked them severally concerning the day; one says, I believe it was on Tuesday, another said she believed it was Wednesday, another on Thursday, and another said she did not know what day it was; but my lad and I comparing notes, we agreed it was on the Friday; I think it was that day, rather than any other, I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>What did Turner apply to you for? - To put the bolt of a lock in its place, which he had put back with a knife; if I could put it in its place, so that the person that belonged to it could not know it, he said it was his sister's box, he did not altogether care much whether she knew it or not, but he should not like her to know it, he said the box was going to be sent into the country to her; I told him I was very little accustomed to do such jobs, but I had a young man that worked with me, could do such jobs, and he should go with him; I believe this was about four o'clock in the evening, he said he was going a little farther, and he would call for him; in about half an hour afterwards he called, and the young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050087"></xptr> went with him, his name is

               <p>You went with Miss Hayes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you find in Brewer's room? - This handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was Brewer's room? - She was in the room when we went into it; she was in the front room, and went into the back room.</p>
               <p>What did you find in Moore's room? - This apron and piece of cambrick.</p>
               <p>(Producing the handkerchief, apron, and piece of cambrick.)</p>
               <p>To Miss Hayes. Look at the handkerchief, and tell the jury whether you know it, and how you know it to be your property? - I know it from the hemming, that I swear to, the beginning not being properly hemmed; I cut it out and made it myself.</p>

               <p>You are sure it was in your box? - I am; one of the corners is not even hemmed.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that is your apron? - I am; and the handkerchief is mine; I made this apron myself, I know it by the hemming all round; I can tell it by my own work; it was a round apron before, but now they have made it square.</p>
               <p>Did you put in those pieces at the side? - I did; I whipt the hemming, and I know my work; there is a bit of muslin different from the other in it, because I preserved a little bit by me for another use; this has four joinings on one side, and two upon the other, and they said there was five on one side; as to the piece of muslin, I will not swear to that, I had a piece of muslin like it in my box; I have no doubt of the apron being my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>About the apron you mentioned one number before the justice, and now you mention another? - I am confident before the justice they swore to a wrong number, and I was right.</p>

               <p>What should induce you to think the corner was altered? - The corners were turned up, and left round, and now it is turned down, and made square.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner Moore. Ask Miss Hayes if ever she got up the apron; if she can answer in a particular thing that is in the muslin alone, not in the workmanship of any woman, but in the muslin itself?</p>
               <p>Miss Hayes. I never washed it myself, our servants washed it for me; I took the flounce off.</p>
               <p>You pretend to know it from the number of pieces? - Not that only, but from my work.</p>
               <p>(The Counsel desired to cross-examine Mr. M'Manus.)</p>
               <p>When you went with Miss Hayes to search the lodgings, did she express no doubt as to the identity of the things? - She said she had some doubt about the apron, on account of its being altered; so she called me aside, and told me; says I if you have any doubt don't take it; it is of very dangerous consequence to the people; she went across the room, and said, well I think still it is my apron, and I said, if you desire me to take it I will, I did not take it then; in going in the coach to Bow-street, she said, I am sure it is my apron; though I left it behind, says I, if you think so I will go back and take it.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - No; she told the justice of it, and they called me in and her, and I went back to fetch it; when she saw it again, she said, she was positive of it; she expressed no doubt as to the handkerchief to my knowledge; when she went back she opened the apron, and examined it more than four or five minutes; she swore to it after that before the justice.</p>

How came you not to go and meet her at Croydon? - I went to get a chaise, but could not; the box either came open by the fall, or is was left open by Miss Hayes, and if my spouse was to go with me to Croydon, I thought there would be nobody left in the house, but the lodgers, and it would not be safe to leave the trunk open, and it would be prudent to have it fastened, I said so to Mr. Williams who was then present.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Mr. Williams? - He is a school master, a person the prosecutrix knows very well; he went with me to Uxbridge, when I met Miss Hayes; as I went out to look for a chaise, I told him I would go down to Mr. Armfield, and desire him to step down, and fasten it; this was on the Tuesday, I called at Armfield's house, and desired him to step and fasten the trunk; he told me he was very busy, but would send a person with me; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050089"></xptr> if I could fasten it with a knife, he did not think I could; not meeting with a chaise, I agreed to take my wife to the play. I called again upon Armfield, and he sent a young man with me that locked it again, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court to Lowndes. You are sure you locked the box again? - Yes; I am sure I locked it.</p>
               <p>Turner. He said it was very easy, and probably it might be unlocked by a fall, I did not go to Croydon fair, upon account I could not get a chaise; upon Saturday evening about six o'clock, I drank tea with the prosecutrix, at my own house; I read over then, the articles of a draught of partnership; she was going into partnership with Mr. Hurst; she said it would do very well; I took it down to Mr. Bourne, who I am clerk to, in Clifford's Inn; from there I went to a broker's in Soho-square, to desire him to attend on Monday, to appraise the fixtures of the shop; from thence I called at Newport-market, and drank at a public-house with a person, came home about eight, and acquainted Miss Hayes I was going to raffle for a gun, and asked her in a joking way, if she would be one; I then went to a public-house across the way, and there I staid till I came home, about half past nine, and I asked Miss Hayes if she would dine with me the next day, I asked her what she would like for dinner, it was referred to my spouse, she mentioned a leg of pork, she said it was agreeable; then I took my wife into the other room, not being willing to comunicate every thing to Miss Hayes; I ran short of cash and I gave her a few shillings, I understand it is said, I gave her half a guinea; I sent her out for a few oysters for supper, Miss Hayes had a pint of twopenny and a toast, this was between eleven and twelve, but she says between ten and eleven; she and my spouse went into the back room to go to bed; I sat with my head upon the back of a chair, she came back and said her trunk was missing; I told her I was very much astonished at that, to my surprise the trunk was gone, and the jacket and coat which lay upon it removed; she said she had had occasion to go there for a night-cap, or she should not have known it; I asked her when she saw it last, she said about seven o'clock in the evening; I said was your property safe, I went out about eight o'clock, she said there was a noise about half past eight, for Mrs. Dickson's daughter came down and asked how she did, and watched the parlour; that there were three women on the stairs, Mrs. Moore, one Mrs. Brewer, one Mrs. Fell, and Mrs. Dixon, were at the door; she said I asked the daughter what it was, the daughter said it was the visitors taking leave of the mother; says Miss Hayes, it seems very odd, that they should be taking leave of her mother when she was at the door; it then struck me, the three women were taking every advantage of this trunk, I desired her to call down Mrs.

               <p>Court. Did you tell Armfield about the opening of this trunk, when Miss Hayes was by?</p>
               <p>Turner. Miss Hayes was at a distance.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live in Ray-street; I have known Mr. Turner twelve or fourteen years; I went to his house upon Tuesday, the 2d of October; Miss Hayes came in and another young lady, to change her dress, and said she was going to Croydon; they went out together; Turner and I went to see to get a chaise, but could not get one, we came home and dined there; I lodge in Southamton buildings; we told Mrs. Turner we would go after dinner and see for one; Mrs. Turner makes answer, we must not go till we make the box fast; the child has been playing upon the box, by jumping up and down, or other means, that the box is either burst open, or Miss Hayes has left it open, and said, do you think I can make it fast with a knife; no, says I, I would not have you do that, left you should damage the lock.</p>
               <p>You understood it was Miss Hayes's trunk that was broke open? - That was all that I heard then, he and I went in search after a horse and chaise; I left him in Kirby-street, and went to the stable yard, he went to the man that was to do the lock; I came back to Turner's, and was in the front room, and Mr. Turner and the blacksmith's boy came in together; on Saturday when the robbery was committed, about six in the evening, he came to my lodgings, I was drinking tea, and asked me if I would go with him to raffle for a gun, in my neighbourhood; I said with all my heart; first we went down to Messrs. Bourn and Bower, Clifford's Inn, where I believe he delivered in a paper, I came back with him about eight, or a little after eight.</p>
               <p>Then you separated from him, and about eight came to him? - I never left him from the time he and I drank tea, till near half past nine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you go home from Clifford's Inn to Turner's house? - No; he and I went to Soho square, to a broker's.</p>
               <p>You never was absent from him from the time you drank tea? - Never; I was with him at the raffle till after nine.</p>

               <p>You drank tea together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From six to past nine he never went home? - No; I remember he went out upon the green, in order to get another member, and returned in seven or eight minutes, and I believe he did not go home at all.</p>
               <p>He was not out of your company above five or six minutes? - It might be nine or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>He could not go home to drink tea? - No.</p>
               <p>He had not time to go home from your house in Southampton buildings, and come back again? - He never left me, if you don't misunderstand me, till the time of the raffle, not till after we had been at the raffle.</p>
               <p>Had he time during that ten minutes he was out, to go to his own house? - Yes; I believe he had, his house was within a hundred yards of the place where we raffled.</p>

               <p>(The apron produced.) Look at that apron, does that belong to Moore? - Give me leave to look, and I will tell; I really cannot think this is the apron that was before the Justice, there were three or four joinings upon the one side, and two upon the other, if it is her apron, I have washed an apron of the same kind, I believe that apron to be Mrs. Moore's, as one apron may be like another.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the hole in the middle, and your mending it up? - I put a few stitches; I cannot swear to a few stitches, it was a seam tore in the middle, it is a whipt seam, if it is Mrs. Moore's apron.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you shew us where it is? - I cannot shew exactly where it is.</p>
               <p>Upon her Cross-Examination she said, she could not swear to the apron, but she believed it was Mrs. Moore's; that she took no oath in Bow-street, and said if it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050093"></xptr> Mrs. Moore's, it had three or four joinings on one side, and two on the other.</p>
               <p>To Miss Hayes. Was you present? - Yes; she said it was tore in the middle by some accident, and she took a fine needle and sewed it up.</p>
               <p>Court to Tomkinson. Will you swear you made up that apron, or only washed it? - Only washed it three or four times.</p>

               <p>Look at that apron, tell us whether that is not the property of Mrs. Moore? - I think to the best of my knowledge, it is Mrs. Moore's apron; I remember remarking it being a square-corner'd apron, and in general they make these aprons round.</p>
               <p>Is that all the reason? - Yes; I will not swear to it; it was upon Friday the 29th of August, she came to drink tea with me, I was ironing, made me take notice she had not rounded it off.</p>

               <p>JOHN MASON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a shoemaker on Fish-street hill: On a Saturday morning, I cannot say the day of the month, a person of the name of Bedson came to my house, I was out; he waited till I came home, and while I was talking with him, Bryce came in; Bedson had brought me some leather, as a sample, which I was looking at; it was dressed leather; I told them it was leather that was stolen out of Leadenhalf-market, that had come from Bristol; Bedson told me that Bryce had shewn him a letter which had come from a person of the name of Higgs, and that it was honestly come by - that Mr. Higgs had advanced money upon it; I said, I was sure it came in such a channel, that it was stolen, and that if I bought it, I ought to be hanged that moment, for I had transported one of my men the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. In January Sessions, on a Friday; I advised Bedson to have nothing to do with it, but to return the sample to Bryce, whom he said he had it of; I said, if it was ever so honestly come by, it would not suit me to purchase it, because it came to a considerable sum; Bryce said, I might pay twenty pounds in money, and the rest in bills; Bryce then said to Bedson, I will take it back again to where I had it; I have known Bedson some years, he is a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never understood from Bryce that this was his own leather? - A. I understood he had it from another person to sell for him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a bricklayer; I have known Mr. Bryce six or seven years: On the 16th of January, Mr. Bryce came to the Blue Anchor in East Smithfield, opposite to where I live; he called me out of the kitchen into the tap-room, where we were by ourselves; he told me he had got a quantity of leather to sell, and as I knew Mr. Mason, if I would go and ask him if he would buy it; Mr. Bryce represented to me that he had it from Mr.

            , whom I knew very well; Mr. Bryce said, he having been in the leather business before, Mr. Mason would not like to buy it of him, if it was ever so honestly come by - he had been taken up for some leather in the Borough, that was stolen sometime ago; I went to his house, and he took four skins out of a drawer in the counter, tied up in a handkerchief; I then went to Mr. Mason's with the skins; I waited till Mr. Mason came in, and he would not have any thing to do with them, and he advised me to have nothing to do with them; Mr. Bryce then came in; Mr. Mason told him he would not have any thing to do with them; and Mr. Bryce said he would not have any thing to do with them; the same evening, I saw Mr. Bryce standing at his door smoking his pipe; he called me over, and asked me if I know any body else; I mentioned Mr. Rowe to him, and he proposed my going to him; I went to Mr. Rowe on Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, without the sample; Mr. Bryce gave me the letter.(Mr. Knapp produced the letter, which was read, as follows;)</p>

               <p>15th Jan. 1801. J. HIGGS.</p>
               <p>Addressed Mr. W. Bryce, East Smithfield."</p>
               <p>Bedson. Mr. Bryce afterwards told me he had seen Mr. Rowe, and that he said he would buy it; I did not see him again till after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You delivered the sample to Bryce, and he said he would not have any thing more to do with it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mr. Higgs before? - A. Yes; and always considered him a very respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not on account of the respectability of the Higgs's that you went both to Mason and Rowe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.After you knew it had been stolen, you offered it to Rowe? - A. I knew if it was stolen, Mr. Rowe, being a currier, would know it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you knew Bryce's character? - A. I understood from him, that Mr. Higgs had lent money upon this leather, and that the time was out; I knew him to be a pawnbroker about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Griffiths.) Q. How much leather did you find at Higgs's? A. Three hundred and fourteen pounds weight. (Produces a part of it.)</p>
               <p>Groom. These two skins of leather are of my own manufacture, and are Mr. Crawley's property.(Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendants, Higgs's, and called six witnesses, who gave them an excellent character.)</p>

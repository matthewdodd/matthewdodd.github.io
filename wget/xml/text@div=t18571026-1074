                  </hi>. I am a laundress, living at No. 33, Hoxton Square. On 27th Sept., I was standing near the London Apprentice public house, at a quarter past 11 o'clock at night—I had a pocket handkerchief in my hand, and there was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. tied up in one comer—I was waiting for my sister-in-law—I saw the prisoner pass by two or three times—I am sure he is the person—he rushed at me, struck me in the face, knocked me down, took the money out of my hands, and kicked me at the back of the head when I was down—there were two or three girls with him—when he took the handkerchief out of my hands he passed it to one of the girls—he knocked me down again, and then set the two girls upon me—I did not see him again until five minutes afterwards, when he was brought back—I was not at all intoxicated; I had just left my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was near the London Apprentice on the night of 27th Sept. I saw the prosecutrix there—I saw a mob, and then I ran across to see what it was—I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutrix; she went reeling into the road; two or three girls then took off their bonnets, which they gave to the prisoner to hold, and fought her—they knocked her down, and while she was down, two of the girls got upon her—I pulled one of the girls off, and another man pulled the other off—I then ran after the prisoner, who had run into the Vinegar Ground—I lost sight of him, but I caught him, and, a policeman coming up, I gave him into custody—I am sure he is the person; I was close to him.</p>

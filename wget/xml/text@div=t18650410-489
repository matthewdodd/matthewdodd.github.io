                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 3, Albert-place, Hercules-build<lb></lb>ings—on the night of 9th April, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came up to me in the Brixton-road, and said, "I will see you home"—I was a little elevated, but quite sensible, and capable of taking care of myself—I had had three half-pints of porter in five hours—I said, "You are a stranger to me, I want none of your company"—he kept pressing himself upon me, and when I got up to Wallcot-square he put his arm through mine, and threw me into the middle of the highway with great violence—I fell on my left side, bruised my eye by the fall, and became insensible—while I was lying on my side he wrenched my watch, which was in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, from my gold guard chain, and ran away—he was shortly afterwards brought back by a policeman—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the guard.</p>

I live at 12, Richmond-street, Kennington-road—I was standing at the corner of Walcot-place, and saw Todd on the ground, and the prisoner lying over him—the prisoner left him, and Todd called out, "My watch"—the prisoner ran by me towards Walcot-square, I followed close to his heels—he ran by the "Ship "into the Kennington-road again, and then he walked and smoked a pipe—I have no doubt he is the man—I faced him before he was given in custody—I then left him, went</p>

Taylor spoke to me, in consequence of which I overtook the prisoner on Kennington-green, and asked Taylor, in his presence, if he was the man who took the watch from the man who was knocked down in Wallcot-square—he said, "Yes"—I put my hand on the prisoner, and asked him for the watch, or to tell me what he had done with it—he said, "It is all right"—I said, "All right will not do for me, and said that he must tell me where it was, or give it to me"—he put his hand in his waistcoat-pocket, and gave me this watch—he was charged at the station, and said that he never intended to keep it, but the man asked him to take care of it, and he could not get it off, so was obliged to break the chain—I asked him if be knew Mr. Todd; he said, "No"—I asked him if he knew where he lived; he said, "At 3, Albert-place, Hercules-buildings, and that he was going to return the watch to him to-morrow."</p>

When we got to Kennington-road he wanted me to leave him, but I said I would see him further; he said, "Take care of my watch, I live at 3, Hercules-buildings;" he tried to give me the watch, but we both fell together, and then it was broken from the chain; I put it into my pocket, intending to return it the next day.</p>

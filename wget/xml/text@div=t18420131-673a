                  </hi>. The prisoner married my mother, they lived separate—I went to the Wheatsheaf coffee-house, Brick-lane, yesterday about twelve o'clock to get my dinner—the prisoner was there when I went in—he said a few words to me and wished to be friends with me again, and told the people I would not tell him where my mother was—I said my reason was, he had used her in such a bad manner, she had begged of me for God's sake to help her away, as she was in bodily danger—I told him it was not my in<lb></lb>tent, nor would I ever tell him—in a few minutes after 1 ordered my dinner, which was brought, and I sat down to it—he ordered a cup of coffee, and sat opposite me at the table—I said, "I wish you would be a sober man, and then perhaps every thing would go right and well for you"—he made no answer, but in an instant, I had not time to look round before I found he had plunged a mortice chisel into my chest, with intent to murder me—it was on the fifth rib next my heart—the chisel produced is the instrument I am certain, I had seen it before—the wound was about half an inch deep and bled very freely—I told him this was what I expected, and that he was a vagabond—I cannot exactly say what he said—he remained in the house till a policeman who was sent for came—before that, I asked why he did this?—he made no reply, only that he had done me good—I showed the wound to a surgeon who is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Wheatsheaf coffee-house. On Saturday the prisoner and a friend of his came in together, and in about ten minutes. the prosecutor came in—there was high words on both sides directly—I do not know who spoke first—the prisoner said he wished he knew where his wife was—the prosecutor said he should not tell him—they began to talk of threatening language which had been used by the prisoner at dif<lb></lb>ferent times, saying, he would be his death and spilling his heart's blood—the prosecutor asked him why he should use such threatening language against him—he denied having used such words, and said he would neither hurt him nor his mother, and wished his hand might rot from his body if he ever said such a thing—he wished to be friendly with him and to see his wife—I begged them to sit down and be friendly, and if he had such wishes as those it was very wrong—he said he had not, and wished to shake hands with the prosecutor, who said he had deceived him so many times, and he understood he intended murdering him—I brought the prosecutor's dinner</p>

               <p>—the prisoner went and sat opposite him at a narrow table—I had scarcely turned round before I heard a call out "Oh"—I said, "What is the mat<lb></lb>ter?"—the prosecutor said he was murdered, he had stabbed him—I seized the prisoner's hand when he appeared in the act of giving a second blow—I wrenched the chisel out of his hand, called him a villain, and asked how he could think of doing so—he said he thought it his duty, and seemed to wish he had done more—I sent for a surgeon and a policeman—the surgeon did not come directly—the prosecutor got rather better, and walked to a surgeon's—the policeman took the prisoner—I saw the wound, and stopped the blood with a handkerchief—this is the chisel I wrenched out of his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to this house, and found the prisoner sitting in the corner of a settle—the prosecutor was sit<lb></lb>ting there bleeding—I asked the prisoner what made him do such an act—he said he was a broken-hearted man, and had been at several station-houses to get redress—I asked why he sought such redress as that—he made no reply—on the way to the station he said he did not care how soon he was dead, he was a broken-hearted man—I believe he is a carpenter, and this is a tool he would use—he had no other tool about him—he was quite calm about my taking him, and also before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had not the slightest intent of doing any thing; but was in that desponding state of mind I scarcely knew what I did. My wife was taken from me. I have been a fortnight seeking about for her. In my absence my chest and clothes, value 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a silver watch, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other property was taken, and next day they came and took a flat iron, telling me they would have all my things out of my place. Whether he has got my things or sold them, or whether my wife has them, I do not know. My wife did not want to go away. She said, "No, Joseph, don't do it." She had shaken hands with me half-an-hour before, and promised she would not leave; but when I came home my chest and things were gone. I have been in such a desponding state ever since. I may have said I did not care if I was dead. When he came from the doctor's he said the wound was a quarter of an inch deep; now he says half an inch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 13 Brick-lane, Whitechapel—on Sunday night I was on my way home—I met a woman who owed me an account—I stopped and spoke to her; she was violent and a mob collected—I saw the prisoner in the mob and Hurley, a man who has been convicted (See page 310)—I went towards home, and the mob followed me about one hundred yards—the prisoner walked by me for a few minutes and said, "I know who has got your hat and glasses"—I took no notice but walked on—he still kept up to me, and I heard Hurley say, "I will have his life or the watch at the corner"—I crossed over and saw the only house which was I open on the other side of the way, a coffee house—I made for it; rushed into the room and they still followed me—Hurley struck me a violent blow on the face, and the prisoner was pulling at my coat, at the same time my watch was taken by one or other of them—I am quite sure the prisoner was one—they kicked me and I was bruised all over—I had a scuffle with Hurley and fell; he struck me on the face, and I struck him with my umbrella—the prisoner and two more came up at the same time and I pushed them away—I thought they were going to see justice done, but I found they tried to get at my waistcoat—Hurley used the most violence—the prisoner did not kick me; he was pulling at my coat and clothes—I have had a rupture since from the violence I received—mine was a silver watch worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it had a gold guard to it.</p>

               <p>Wednesday, as this occurred on Sunday—I do not know whether it was in Hurley's mother's house—I did not see her there—I saw the prisoner in the same house—I gave Hurley in custody, but not the prisoner—I was quite sure of him, but it is a great deal of trouble for me to be prosecuting every day in these Courts—I know that if I had given the prisoner in custody then he would have been tried at the same time as Hurley.</p>

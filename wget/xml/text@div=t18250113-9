The landlord told him in my presence that some money was lost from the pot-boy's room, and asked what business he had there; his master was called down, and examined him. I was talking to his master, and saw two boys in the street, beckoning - his master made him throw up the window and beckon to them; they returned it, but he said he did not know them. I opened the door to go to them, but they ran off. I took one, and asked him in the prisoner's presence what he wanted - he said to buy a ship of the prisoner; who said he was making one, but not for sale - he denied having the money, but on a constable being sent for, he said,</p>

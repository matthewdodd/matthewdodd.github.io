               <p>the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pennyworth of cheese—it was about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I served him—he laid down half a crown on the counter—I took it up and said to him, "Young man, this is a very bad one; I don't intend to give you this up again"—"You don't," he said, and he walked out of the shop—I ran, and caught him in the road—I said, "I mean to take you to a policeman; I think you are a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>"—he struggled—I led him towards the house of a policeman—I found the policeman after a short time; but during that time the prisoner had dropped another half crown—he endeavoured to pick it up, but I pre<lb></lb>vented him, and my niece took it up and gave it to the officer, and I gave my half crown to him.</p>

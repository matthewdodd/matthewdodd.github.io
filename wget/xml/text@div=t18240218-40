On the 5th of February, about a quarter to six o'clock, I had just come home, and was stooping to pick my handkerchief up; a neighbour came in, and alarmed me. I missed a piece of calico, which hung inside the door a minute before; I ran out, and met the witness, who directed me towards Clerkenwell-green, where I saw the prisoner standing with his brother, who kept a stall there; I asked if they had seen any one with the calico - the brother said No. Somebody said,</p>
               <p>"That is him;" the prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"I shall go home." I followed and asked if he had seen any one with the calico; he said No. Gray said,</p>
               <p>"That man stole it," and I secured him - a child came up, and said he had put it under his brother's stall. We found it there in a bag.</p>

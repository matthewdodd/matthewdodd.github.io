               <p>Q. Did you lose any money there - A. Yes, eight pounds; six one pound Portsmouth notes, and two one pound bank of England notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you saw them - A. When I was sitting on my bedside, going to bed, about half past eleven; I put my pantaloons under my pillow; the notes were in the pantaloons pocket; I missed them in the morning when the coachman came to tell me the coach was ready. That might be a quarter after five.</p>

            . On the 18th of August last, about half past six in the morning, I was sent for into St. Martin's lane, at the Northumberland's Head; in consequence of information I went and searched the prisoner, he was a lodger there, he had been there about fortnight; I went in the room with the landlord, I told the prisoner a gentleman had lost some notes in the course of the night; I asked him if he knew any thing of the notes; he said no; I told him suspicion fell upon him; I searched his nankeen pantaloons, and as he came off the bed he kept his shirt sideway; I saw him keep his shirt in his hand, up against his groin; I pulled his drawers off, I said, now you shall stand up; he stood up, and there was a bundle of papers fell from his privates, the landlord picked them up. The notes are here, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That note was mine, it was marked 308 on the back, it is a one pound Portsmouth note. The six one pound Portsmouth notes, and the two one pound bank notes, are all here, they are the exact quantity that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was sitting in the room drinking with me, he had his papers out, and I had my money out at the time he was sitting in the room, and as to his money, I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I came into the room where he was, and spoke to a gentleman, and left him there; I was not in his company.</p>

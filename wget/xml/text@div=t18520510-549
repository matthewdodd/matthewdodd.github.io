                  </hi>. I manage the business of Mr. Otto Alexander Berens and another, in St. Paul's Churchyard. Their stock is very extensive—the prisoner was in their employ as a salesman, in the glass department—that would not properly give him anything to do with the clocks, unless he were sent there—on 30th April, I stopped the prisoner as he was leaving—I asked what he had got about him—it turned out that there was nothing in his pockets—a coat of his was discovered on the following morning, and I saw it on my return; a clock was found in it—it was one of the stock—as the prisoner went out of the house, I asked him if he had another coat, he said he had not—I went with him the evening before to where he lived, in Shrub-land-row, Dalston—I there found a clock, two groups of alabaster figures, shades, and stands—a bronze group, three or four pair of glass vases, five glass candlesticks, a china box, a cigar ash tray, one pair of lava vases, three paste pots, and two pair of glass toilet bottles—this is the clock that I found—I examined all the things at his house on the Friday night—they are all part of the stock of his employers—I believe the value of this clock is 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again on the following evening, he handed me this paper, and said it contained a full account of all he had taken—it is in his writing—he had been about eighteen months in the employ—some of these things were large—I asked him about the vases—he told me they had been presented to him by a friend; but afterwards, on the Saturday night, he admitted that he stole them—I asked him how he got them away from the house—he told me he had forged a ticket in the name of a person, which was a guarantee for their being packed.</p>

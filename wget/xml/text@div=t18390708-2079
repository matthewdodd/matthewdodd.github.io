                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner was my errand-boy—he left me about a month ago, and after that I found him concealed in the house at night, with a knife in his sleeve</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183907080050"></xptr>
               <p>I gave him in charge—he was sent to Clerkenwell, and I forgave him; but since then I found this boa at his father's, behind the door—his mother claimed it, and said a Mrs. Cole gave it her—the father said it was all untrue what the mother stated, and that the boy had brought it from my house one day, about a month after he had been in my employ, stating that I had given it him in exchange for a brush—the prisoner made no reply to that.</p>

The prisoner is my son—he brought the boa home, and said it was made a present to him by his master—there was something said about a brush, but I did not hear what—I thought it was probable his master might make him a present of it, as he was kept very late at night—he said it was of no service to his master, and he had made him a present of it.</p>

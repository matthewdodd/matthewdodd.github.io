In consequence of having paper burnt, I had occasion lately to take stock; I missed a great number of volumes - I never gave the prisoner permission to take these volumes, and sell them for waste-paper; they are all saleable works - the Rev. Mr. Aspland's hymn forms a part of them, which is a work now on sale.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever give him authority to sell waste-paper? A. Not on his own account; he had sold some for me, but certainly he had no authority to sell this - this is not waste-paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. Had you given him permission to sell any other volumes? A.None for himself, he has on my account; I took stock in October last - my business is not very extensive; I have about twelve workmen now - they could go to my warehouse, but the greater part of them had no right to go; no other person has ever sold paper for me.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. About the 4th of November, 1830, I was returning from Stamford-hill, and saw the prisoner in the high road, going to London, with master's cart; I got up in the cart - there were two bundles of paper in it - he went to Old-street-road, and left the paper at Riley's house; the prisoner gave me 6d. - he had before that spoken to me respecting some paper which I saw him take; he held up his finger, and said, "Never you say a word, or you will ruin me and my family;" that was one day when we took some paper - that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A word about what? A. About some paper that was in the cart, I suppose; he took some six or seven times - I do not know when he said that; it was some time before, when we were taking paper there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in your master's service? A.Three years next May; I do not know where this paper came from - the first time I saw it was at the top of my master's lane; I had before been with him when he took paper - I did not mention this to my master till after the prisoner was in trouble.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Old-street. Shortly before Christmas, 1830, the prisoner brought some printed paper to me, in Mr. Smallfield's cart, which I bought of him; it was, I think, between 30 lbs. and 40 lbs. - I sold that paper, with others, to Faulkner, Mr. Wilson's man; the prisoner did not make any representation to me - it was in two bundles, and I paid him 3d. per 1b. for it; I sold some of the best at 4 1/2d. per 1b., and used the inferior part at my own place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour of the day was this? A. He generally came between ten and one o'clock- I saw his master's name on the cart, and he brought it openly into the shop.</p>

             - he lives in Upper Thames-street, and deals in waste-paper. I bought some paper of Mr. Riley the latter end of March, or the beginning of April; I took it home to my master's - I remember Mr. Smallfield coming and seeing the same paper which I got from Riley - this is it; I am sure it is part of what I bought of Mr. Riley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is your master? A. A rag and waste-paper dealer; we buy a great deal from various quarters - we frequently buy volumes of booksellers; I took this home, and it remained there six or seven weeks; I took other paper with this, but of a different size - this is of a particular size; I think this paper remained at my master's from March to October; there is another man who weighs the paper, and stows it away in piles.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure this is some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010106"></xptr>the paper you got from Mr. Riley's? A. I am quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>MR. SMALLFIELD. I have no hesitation in saying that this is the property of the Rev. Mr. Aspland, intrusted to my care - I never authorized the prisoner to sell it; it is gathered into volumes - these are half volumes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Can you possibly identify this paper as coming out of your possession? A.Certainly; I have the work in this state for sale, and send it in this state to different booksellers, when I have orders for it - there is a running account between me and the prisoner - I cannot state the balance, but there was never any running of the paper sold by him; he always brought me the money for that; the account was only 1s. a we he requested me to keep for him against his - I do not often send out copies of books which are out of point, not oftener than once in two or three years; I have not taken stock of some of my articles for three or four years, but I think I have of this work.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever give him permission to sell Mr. Aspland's hymns? A. No, never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever give him liberty to take paper and sell it without showing it to you? A. Never- this had not been considered as waste-paper; this had been in my possession ever since the prisoner has been with me; it is not much in demand, as there are two cheaper editons - this had lain by, and I was less likely to have my attention called to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman and contractor at Highgate Road—my wife gave me this writ, but I can't fix the day—up to that Time I had never seen Jacobs to my knowledge, and I did not owe him a farthing—I owed Mr. Diermissen a small balance, but he never made any applica<lb></lb>tion to me for it—after I received the writ I employed a solicitor, and I after<lb></lb>wards received a declaration from him which he had received and after that the sheriff came in one evening about 7 o'clock—I employed Mr. William Hicks as my solicitor—he entered an appearance and it was pleaded to—the 8th day after I received the writ the sheriff came in—I afterwards went to Judge's Chambers and saw the prisoner there with Diermissen, but I did not not know anything of the real circumstances until just before the 7th</p>

               <p>August—I had seen Jacobs with Diermissen several times when I was at Judge's Chambers with reference to the levy on my goods—on 7th August I was in such a position that I could hear what was said by Priestly to Jacobs and the answers he made—I heard Priestly ask him what he wanted—he said he wanted 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Priestly asked him what it was for, and he said it was to get the money out of Court—Priestly said "Who has paid the money in?"—he said "Pritchard, and if you have 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I can take the money out, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and additional costs"—Priestly said he had only a sovereign—I went into the room and said it was a lie—I had a bad hand and Jacobs shoved me—I caught hold of him, and Mr. Diermissen locked him up—I never paid any money into Court and never owed Jacobs anything.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">examined by the Prisoner</hi>). I am an attorney at 10, Clifford's Inn—you brought an action, Jacobs and Diermissen, against Pritchard—there was a writ of that kind—I was not instructed by Pritchard to appear in that action—I pleaded it for him, but I did not appear—I have the pleas here—they were the ordinary and usual pleas in action—I did not attend to sign judgment in that action—I attended a summons before Master Dodgson, to set aside the judgment, and it was set aside with costs to be paid by you—you applied to Baron Cleasby, and he dismissed the action with costs—he did not order the summons against you at the Clerkenwell police-court, to be struck out—Mr. Diermissen in<lb></lb>structed me to prosecute you, but not in the first instance—I did not come into the case until after you had been given into custody, and a summons had been taken out at Clerkenwell—Diermissen has paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not prosecute you because you have got an action against me in the Mayor's Court—you have brought an action against me for retaining the writ of fi fa, and also against the Sheriff, in the Mayor's Court, and in the Superior Court—I shall continue to keep the writ, here is the rule setting the execution aside and exempting me from giving up the writ, and you are condemned to pay the costs—Diermissen instructed me to appear in the Mayor's Court for him, and I pleaded the ordinary plea to such a declara<lb></lb>tion—I pleaded payment before action—I have pleaded nothing as to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—you brought an action against me in the Mayor's Court—I don't know what for—you delivered a declaration charging all sorts of things, but I can't see what right you have to bring an action against me—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is certainly not the original record.</p>

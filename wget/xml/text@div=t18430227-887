                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at Carlton-cham<lb></lb>bers, Regent-street; the prisoner was my clerk—I parted with him in Jan. last—he had been with me upwards of two years—there was no imputation on his honesty when he left me—I was to receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. quarterly on account of a Mr. Thornton, a client of mine—the prisoner never gave me the money Darned in this receipt, nor brought it to my account in any way whatever—I never had any conversation with him about it—I addressed a letter on the subject, which I delivered in the clerk's office—I do not know what be<lb></lb>came of the letter—in Dec. last I was indebted to the actuary of the Guardian office, originally four guineas—I gave the prisoner a cheque to pay that—I have the cheque here returned to me as paid—it is for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since had to pay that four guineas over again—the prisoner never stated that he had kept back the four guineas, and he had no reason for doing so—I have since paid the money to Mr. Davies.</p>

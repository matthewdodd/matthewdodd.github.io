I think it was the Sign of the Cock; and there we drank Beer and Brandy, and eat some Fish. I staid till 6, and then call'd for the Reckoning, and when I Paid it, this Jade saw my Bag of Money. I had 10 Pounds 5 s. in it. And so I stood up to light my Pipe, and come away; and while I was lighting my Pipe, she whipt the Bag out of my Pocket, and ran to the Door. I called out to Harvey to stop her. Harvey went to the Door, and took the Bag from her, but the Jade got away, and Harvey came back to me, and said, Here, Countryman, here's your Bag: But when I look'd in it, there was nothing but Five-pence Halfpenny, and this naughty Piece of Money. [A Leaden Medal the Size of a Half-Crown.]</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Harvey take any thing out of the Bag?</p>
               <p>Parker. No. I saw Wentland give the Bag to Harvey as she stood upon the Steps, and Harvey brought it directly to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain as to the Time?</p>
               <p>Parker. Yes: For I was in Smithfield with my Sheep at 3 o'Clock, and I thought to get to Uxbridge that Night. I am a Sales-man; I live at Ailsbury, and come to Smith-field Mondays and Fridays. I have returned Thousands of Pounds in Smithfield. I never was pick'd up by such Cattle in my Life. I am sure it happen'd a bad Accident Thing for me; for I work hard, and have a great Family.</p>
               <p>Wentland. I never saw this Man in my Life, till he and 3 more Men with him, charged me with the Fact; and then he offer'd to make it up for 5 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Parker. They Arrested me in a false Action for 30 l. to hinder my coming to Prosecute, as this Man knows.</p>

I asked him, where? And he said, he could not tell, but he believed it was at the Barley-Mow. Mr. Burkitt and I went over the Way with him to the Unicorn Brew-House, and there he saw a Woman with a Pail of Beer in her Hand, and he said, he believed it was she that had got his Money. From thence he crossed the Way again to the Barley-Mow, near the End of Red Lion-Street, and asked, if he had not been there over Night? Yes, says the Man of the House, I believe you was, and that you came afterwards, and made a great Noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Moses Moses, in Upper East Smith field. On the evening of the 17th of January, a little after six o'clock, I was coming from the parlour into the shop, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter, taking the coat and jackets off a shelf behind the counter—I called out—my brother ran into the shop, and the prisoner dropped them on the counter—my brother said, "You have robbed us"—he called my father out to detain him while he fetched a policeman—while he was gone, the prisoner said he thought my father acted very fool<lb></lb>ishly in detaining him, as he had not taken the things, and that he had come in to buy a waistcoat—I had seen these things on the shelf about a quarter of an hour before—he had no business to take them off the shelf.</p>

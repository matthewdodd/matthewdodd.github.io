            . I am a constable. In October last I was desired to apprehend the prisoner; I found her in the street at Putney; I took her to the watch-house; I found a shawl and a pair of boots on her. The shawl was on her back, and the boots on her feet. She told me, of her own accord, that they were her mistress's. She gave them to me, and said, she was sorry for what she had done. I put her in the cage; I went the next morning, and the door was broken open, and she was gone. I had locked her in with four locks; the padlock was gone, and the other locks broken.</p>

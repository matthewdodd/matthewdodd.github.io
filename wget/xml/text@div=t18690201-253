I am the wife of Edward Browning—I live in Tor<lb></lb>rington Street, Russell Square, and am a lodging-house keeper—on 25th December last, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I had gone up stairs—about three minutes after, I came down again and saw a light in the dining-room—I made a communication to the servant, and she knocked at the door of the room—the door was pushed from the inside, and two persons rushed out—I am positive that Gibbons is one, and I believe May was the other—Gibbons struck me a severe blow in the chest; the other man did not strike me—they both got into the street, and got away—I sent for a constable, and accompanied him to the dining-room—I found a hat-box and a cruet<lb></lb>stand, and other things on the floor, and I missed a salt spoon—previous to going up stairs, I had left them in the cupboard—I had been into the room about ten minutes before—on the 2nd January, I was taken to the police-station, to see if I could identify anyone—I identified some person instead of Gibbons—he was disguised at the time—when he was in the house, he had long whiskers, and he had none when I saw him again—as I was going out of the room, Gibbons made a remark, and I knew his voice—I asked to be allowed to go in again, and I went to where the voice came from—I recognized his voice directly I heard him speak, and pointed him out—I</p>

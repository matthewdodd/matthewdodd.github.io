I saw the woman on Battersea bridge, very ill, she said that she had had nothing to eat or drink since the day previous, and that her husband had left her that morning. We went and had some dinner, and then to the Elephant and Castle where she stooped down, and I missed her. She did not tell me what she picked up. Going home I met her again.

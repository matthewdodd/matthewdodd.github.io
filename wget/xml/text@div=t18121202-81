            . I am a labouring man. On Wednesday morning, about a month ago, Parrott and I went down to Blackwall to get some work, and coming along back by the canal, Parrott said, he would go on board a ship to see Swanson. He went on board the Fame. The Fame was in the canal. Parrott went on board, and I stepped on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what he was going on board for - A. No, I did not. He called me on board. Swanson was on the half deck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Swanson belong to the Fame - A. He was ship-keeper. Parrott told me that he had got some old rope. He asked me to lend him a hand to get it on shore. I went with him, and Swanson went under the half deck at the same time.</p>
               <p>

            Did Swanson see this - A. Yes. We both went on shore with the rope.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18121202-81-person910">Q. </persName>
            How much rope was there - A. I do not know. It weighed more than a quarter of a hundred. Some of the rope had been worn, and some of it had not been worn much, and as we were going along Mr. Walker stopped us in Poplar. He took us both to the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER. I am a Thames police officer. On Wednesday, the 11th of November, I saw Parrott; I stopped them both. It was between eight and nine in the morning. I asked where they came from with the rope. They said, from a ship in the canal. I took Trott down with me, and he pointed out the ship. This is the rope; it is very useful rope. When I got to the Fame, Swanson said, he was ship-keeper. I asked him, if he had sent any rope along with these men. He said, yes; he found it is the fore peak among with some wood.</p>

            . I command the Fame. Swanson was ship-keeper. The ship was for sale. I never gave Swanson leave to have any old rope.</p>
               <p>Swanson's Defence. I was left in charge of the ship. When I came to the police office, Trott told the magistrate I give him this rope, and when Parrott was put to the bar, he said, I gave them both the rope. He committed us both for trial.</p>
               <p>Parrott said nothing in his defence.</p>

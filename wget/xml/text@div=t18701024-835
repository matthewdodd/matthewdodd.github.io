                  </hi>. I am a tailor, residing at 51, Alma Street, Hoxton—about 11 o'clock, on the night of the 10th August, I heard a noise in my bed room, on the ground floor—I went and caught hold of Willis there—we wrestled together in the passage—I called for help and he threw me down—I got up, and the door being open he pitched me out into the street—I again caught him by the tail of his coat, which he slipped off and ran away—I followed, but gave up the chase and returned to my house—I found articles of dress in the room where I had seized him first—a watch also, which I value at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I identified as my own—a jemmy dropped out of his coat—the back garden door was open that night, and I was sitting in the back kitchen having my supper—no chain was on it—if they had come in that way I must have heard them.</p>

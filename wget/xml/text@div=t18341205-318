                  </hi>. I am a ship-carpenter. I came on shore on the 15th of December—I met with a woman of the town—I went with her to the Crooked Billet, and then went home with her—she pawned my jacket, and it was released again—I gave her a £5 note to get it—she brought it to the place I was at—I put the jacket on the chest, and my shoes by the side, when I went to bed—I slept by myself, and the next morning I missed the shoes and jacket, and the woman was gone—I went out, and found her and the prisoner at the Coach and Horses—I asked her for my jacket—she said some one had taken it, but there was no fear but it would be returned before night—I went home and made a fire—the policeman gave me information afterwards.</p>

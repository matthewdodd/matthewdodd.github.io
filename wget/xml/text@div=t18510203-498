                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Webster, who keeps the Masons' Arms beer-shop, Bow Common-lane. On 1st Feb., abouta quarter to six o'clock, the prisoner came and called for a pint of porter; I served him, and he gave me a half-crown—I gave him the change, and put the half-crown into a bowl in the till—I rang it, and as far as I knew it was a good one—shortly after that he came again, and asked for a pint of porter; he tendered me a half-sovereign in payment—I took it up, put it to my teeth, and bent it nearly double—I told him it was bad, and I believe he said he had taken it from the Commissioners of Sewers—I called a policeman, but did not give him into custody—shortly afterwards I went to the till, examined the half-crown, found it to be bad, and instructed the policeman to apprehend him if he could find him—I gave the half-crown and half-sovereign to the policeman—there was no other half-crown in the till—there is a mark on the side of it, which I saw when it was first given me.</p>

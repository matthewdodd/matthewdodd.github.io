                  </hi>. I am the acting staff paymaster at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—the cuttings from the cartridge papers are sold at the arsenal—when cuttings are ready, I give notice to the contractor to remove them, upon the report of McCubrey being sent to the office that there is an accumulation to take away—I knew Jones as acting for Mr. Phipps the contractor, of 176, Upper Thames Street, and I believe he was in the habit of coming to remove the cuttings, in every case, since last December—the course of business was this: upon McCubrey's report that there was a certain quantity for Mr. Phipps, ready for delivery, I wrote a letter to Mr. Phipps, stating generally what quantity there was to remove, and within a few days Jones came, and paid me for the paper cuttings reported; he brought no document; he paid me for the quantity mentioned in my letter—I then handed to him a memorandum receipt to take to the head of the issue department, speci<lb></lb>fying the amount paid, and the quantity to be delivered—from that he would get an order on the store-holder, to deliver the paper paid for—McCubrey was the store-holder—Jones would take the order to McCubrey and get the goods—McCubrey would load the goods in the railway vans—they should have been weighed, generally by Wright, as McCubrey's assis<lb></lb>tant; he was there for that purpose—the cuttings are packed in bags, and loaded into the railway trucks—McCubrey would send a memorandum of the quantity of goods loaded in the vans, to the issuing branch of the Military Store Office, and get a police pass to pass the goods through the gate—it was then McCubrey's, or Wright's, duty to accompany them to the gate, and to see the trucks leave the arsenal, and countersign the pass before the police, in proof that the proper quantity has been delivered—the pass would be given up to the police at the gate—that is the authority to pass the goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who brings the railway trucks into the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The railway company, by order of the purchaser—formerly we gave the order ourselves—each bag would hold about 1 cwt. 1 qr., I fancy, but they vary very much—on 4th February, 1869, I received a report from the head of the issuing department—on the 9th February, James paid me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 30 cwt, of paper cuttings, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the memorandum receipt which I gave him on that occasion; it is my writing—it is directed to Mr. Sparrow, the head of the department (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> "9th February 1869. Mr. Sparrow, Mr. Phipps has paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this day for 30 cwt of paper, J.D. Harry.")—I could not undertake to say that I gave that document to Jones; I gave it to the agent of Mr. Phipps, whoever he may be, on his paying me the money—I had advised Mr. Phippe of the 30 cwt—I do not see that advice here (<hi rend="italic">it not afterwards handed in</hi>)—I think I know McCubrey's writing—I believe this to be his signature to this pass (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, 9th February, 1869. Pass the under mentioned for service to Mr. Phipps London, 30 cwt paper cutting signature of the person accompanying the stores to the gate of the arsenal, W. McCubrey, R. Reardon.")—Mr. Reardon is an officer, he signs the pass before the goods leave the arsenal and before McCubrey signs, he merely countersigns it; it it filled up by one of the clerks in the office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the delivery order for those goods—it is signed by Mr. Sparrow of the issuing department, and it has McCubrey's initials; it is an order to the principle foreman, and it is delivered to him—I had nothing to do with any trans<lb></lb>action on 24th February—the next which I had anything to do with was on 28th April—I believe Jones came to me on that day, as the agent for Mr. Phipps, and paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the person who paid the for acknowledgment order; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that would go to the issue department in the way I have explained—this is the police pass—I don't know Wright's writing, I never saw him write. [<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY CHARLES</hi>. I know Wright's handwriting; this is his.] (<hi rend="italic">This was a pass, dated 28th April for</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">cwt. of paper cuttings, signed Thomas Wright</hi>)—This (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in the kind of report which McCubrey would make to the office of the gone ready to be delivered; it bears his signature; you must understand I do not speak positively to this document—I never saw it before, but it is the kind of report that he should give—it would go in on the 21st (the 28th is a mistake), and I should communicate with Mr. Phipps immediately—this is the delivery order—it has McCubrey's initials—the next transaction was on 3rd June—here are two reports relating to that—one on 20th May and one on 25th—here are also two orders of 3rd June, one for 32 cwt, and the other for 25 cwt.—I received a payment in respect of those on 3rd June from Mr. Phipps' agent—I could not swear that it was Jones, but I do not recollect any other person paying me from the commencement of this contract—Jones must have paid me; don't recollect any other, one I have so many persons pay me in the course of a day that I can't recollect every one—to the best of my belief Jones payed me—the sum of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 56 cwt.—this is the acknowledgment of it, the memorandum of pay<lb></lb>ment—this is the pass—it has McCubrey's signature—this delivery order is signed by Challis—the next transaction was on 11th June—here is the report signed by McCubrey, dated 8th June, stating 35 cwt. to be ready</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200084"></xptr>
               <p>—the agent paid me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th, and I gave him this memo<lb></lb>randum, and this is the delivery order relating to the transaction, signed by McCubrey—the next transaction was on 30th July—here are two reports relating to that, one of the 2nd for 30 cwt., and one of the 21st for 40 cwt.—I received 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th July—this is my acknowledgment—this is the delivery order, initialed by McCubrey, and this is the police pass for the 70 cwt.—the next was on 12th August—here are two reports refering to it, one of the 4th for 40 cwt, and one of the 7th for 20 cwt.—this is McCubrey's signature—on 12th August Jones attended—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave him this memorandum—I speak positively to Jones as paying me on that day—these are McCubrey's initials to both these delivery orders, and to this pass for the 60 cwt.—I speak expressly to Jones on that occasion—I believe I cannot speak to him on any other occasion, but I believe he paid me in every case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe McCubrey is the store-holder in what is called the sale yard for unserviceable stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is—he has occupied that post for eight or ten years—it was partly upon my recommendation that he was appointed to it—the sale yard is the receptacle for all broken up stores that come from all the various departments in the world, with the exception of broken up shot and shells—such things would come there as mattresses, soldiers belts and buckles, gun carriages, blankets, and various articles—when gun carriages come in they have to be broken up, for the wood and metal—the blankets and sheets are torn up into strip and go under the head of old rags—it would be McCubrey's duty to see to the breaking up of these various things—if gun carriages came from Malta a delivery note should come with them—a receipt for them would be given to the captain of the vessel who brought them to England—many months would sometimes be occupied in breaking up those gun carriages—when the wood and iron has been separated it would be McCubrey's duty to report the quantity of each, and they would then be brought on charge—he would bring on the carriages first, and then weigh it off and bring it back in material—with respect to soldiers' belts, he might sell the buckles as buckles, not as brass; but if broken he would sell them as brass, and they would have to be brought on charge under the head of brass—McCubrey superintends the whole of the breaking up and division of these returned stores—the breaking up ground extends over more than three or four acres, I should think—he had Wright under him, and I think twenty labourers; when lie was extremely busy we should give him a good many more—the business has been, I should say, more than doubled by the giving up of the store-keeping at the Tower, the Herbert Hospital, and the clothing establishment—it has all come into McCubrey's department, and lately his work was been doubled—we have no contracts for the sale of leather—we have sales of various things by public auction—we have no other contract for unserviceable stores besides that with Mr. Phipps, that I am aware of, except metal, which I do not call unserviceable—we have had sales by auction, of unserviceable stores every three weeks since the Tower amalgamation—we have all w goods properly catalogued—McCubrey would assort the goods, and get them ready for sale; the labourers assist him in making up the lots—I take the produce of the sales—our sales formerly used to run about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sale—since the amalgamation it would be considerably more; I should say 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a sale—a value is put upon the goods, an upshot price at which they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200085"></xptr>
               <p>are to go—McCubrey assists, with the auctioneer, in valuing the goods—it is not exactly a reserved price, but we endeavour to get the lots as high as we can, of course—McCubrey always attends those periodical sales—he is not there to regulate the price at which the goods stall be sold—he is not allowed to speak at the sale—he goes round with the auc<lb></lb>tioneer a few days before, and they value the lots—McCubrey does not receive the deposits paid by the vendees; he would hand them to my clerk, or myself—it takes weeks, sometimes, to prepare the goods for these sales—there are many articles in detail—there was formerly a military storekeeper; he is now the comptroller—there is a storekeeper's office—it would be McCubrey's duty to attend there once a day, and he would, as a rule, attend me once a day—to do that, he would have to go a circuit of about three-quarters of a mile from his office—it would be his duty to prepare the vouchers for bringing on charge the result of the breaking up of the old materials, and enter them on his ledger—he would prepare the rough documents for the clerk to enter; he would do all, except the mechanical work—it would be his duty occasionally to meet the store-holders of other departments; stores come to him through them—he never receives anything direct from the stations; he has to receive it through some other store-bolder, and nothing should come into his department, except by being brought on charge, charged to him—we look to him as the responsible party for sending in the documents to which reference has been made, for the purpose of passing goods out at the gate—properly speaking, nothing ought to leave without his signature, unless he is absent, then Wright would do it, and after him, Challis—by reason of the change which has taken place in the rifle, an enormous quantity of cartridges have been brought home from the various depart<lb></lb>ments to be broken up, many millions—Mr. Phipps' contract is for paper cuttings from the laboratory—the paper resulting from the breaking up of the cartridges would puss to Mr. Phipps under that contract—there is only one description for paper in the accounts of this department, that is, "Condemned paper;" that is the title under which all paper would appear—we should not describe it as "white," or "brown," it would be all described as "paper, old"—nothing but what is condemned and unservice<lb></lb>able would be in McCubrey's department, unless he had stores sent to him for what is called "expense"—he might have paper sent to him to use up for packing purposes—a great portion of the stores would consist of things that had never been used, but had become obsolete, and were not required at the stations where they were—we might have as much as four or five millions of cartridges come by one vessel under one voucher—the result of the breaking up of that consignment would not come on charge until the whole was broken up—a large parcel of cartridges would sometimes take months to break up—when they are in the shape of cart<lb></lb>ridges they are not under McCubrey's control; they are in the hands of the laboratory, in the manufacturing department, until they are broken up—cartridges are not broken up in his yard; carriages are—the paper does not come into the store-yard until the cartridges are broken up—cartridges are exceptional, because of the danger—McCubrey is obliged to balance his books at the end of each quarter—there are quarterly ledgers returned to the War Office—he might have a large quantity of paper in his yard, at the end of a quarter, not charged to him—he would bring it on charge when the voucher comes down from the laboratory—having sent out some of the produce, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200086"></xptr>
               <p>would balance his book by anticipating it, by certificate—that would be simply for the purpose of balancing his book at the quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, he can send paper out that is not charged to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he must keep a memorandum of the quantity issued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had sold some of this paper not charged to him, before the end of the quarter, would he put that sale into that quarter's ledger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he would put at iu the new ledger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he would bring it on simply to balance the quar<lb></lb>ter, irrespective of what he had in store? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the rule—I have known McCubrey ever since he has been in the service, twenty seven or twenty-eight years—he entered the yard as a labourer, and was gradually pre<lb></lb>moted to his present position—there is no man in the service that I had more confidence in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the paper in question here, come from these cartridges mainly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good deal of it—some are cuttings—in making the forms of paper for cartridges, there ia a remnant; that is in manufacturing them in the first instance; before they are sent out to the military stations—the millions of cartridges that come back to us to be broken up, are cartridge that have been sent out from this county, and not used; they have become obsolete in the service, or else they have been abroad too long, and they come back and are sold as waste paper—that pro<lb></lb>ceeding is going on every day—Wright was foreman under McCubrey—he was given to him to assist him in his duties; not in all; in the inferior portion, the weighing up such things as paper, or refuse kind of things—he was under McCubrey's directions—he would weigh other things besides paper—he would not be weighing all day—that would not be his principal duty—he had other duties; he had to attend to the men breaking up—some of the bags of paper weigh 1 1/4 cwt.—I don't believe you would find two bags alike—by being packed tight they would contain 1 1/2 cwt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose he had to deliver out sixty bags, might he, as a matter of fact (I don't ask what his duty was), weigh six or seven bags, and than take it for granted that the weight of the others were about the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am afraid there has been a good deal of that done—it would not be right; he would have been dismissed years ago, if it was known—I was not aware that an allow<lb></lb>ance of fourteen pounds was made for the weight of each bag—that is too much—that would be very improper indeed—I should say it was double the weight that ought to have been allowed; if he had appealed to me, I should have told him so—I should allow seven pounds, I think that is a fair average—I have only known Wright seven or eight years, but he has been there longer than that, under McCubrey—I believe he has been there; ten or twelve years—he has always borne a good character—we choose what are considered the best men to put in that place, because there are many tempta<lb></lb>tions—he must have borne a good character, or he would not have been kept in the employ, particularly there—I understand there are two descriptions of bag, but as an average, as I said before, I would not allow more than seven pounds—I should allow some more than others, but I would give the average of seven pounds all round—some are heavier than others, very trifling, not a pound's difference, I should think.</p>

Phipps—I send to them when I receive notice of accumulated stores—I always do that myself—I have not been present when the paper has been weighed, but I was In the stores branch twenty-five years—formerly, a police-officer attended the auctions, to see the stores delivered, but not to weigh them—I believe they do not at present—the police-officer to whom the pass is given takes the weight for granted; he has no opportunity of weighing it—the pass is a mere matter of form, that no stores shall leave the arsenal without a pass.</p>

That was signed by Jones, in the name of his employer's firm—upon that the forty-two bags were sent to Dover—we do not know at the arsenal station the weight of the bogs; we have no means of weighing there, the truck is weighed at Dover—we sent a memorandum instructing Dover to weigh, and advise us of the weight—I have here the way-bill that was sent with those forty-two bags—we afterwards received back the weight—Jones does not give us any weight, he only gives us the number of the bags—he also gave instructions that same day to send twelve bags to Wildman—this is the</p>

I am an inspector of the detective police, Scotland Yard—in consequence of instructions I went down to Woolwich on 12th August, about 4.30, I saw four railway trucks there, in front of Plumstead Railway Station, outside the arsenal—the prisoner Jones was with there—Mr. Carnelly, the chief inspector of the arsenal police, was with me—in consequence of my directions the trucks were taken back into the arsenl—previous to their being shunted back into the arsenal Jones said, "What is the meaning of this?"—I told him that it was my intention to have the contents of those trucks weighed—he said, "I only saw seven or eight bags weighed, and I don't know the weight of the rest"—the order was for 60 cwt. on that day—I said, "I suppose you know the quantity that you have a right to take from the arsenal"—he said, "I wish to go to London to see my employer, as he expects me home by 5 o'clock"—I said, "You had better come and see the goods weighed for your own satisfaction"—We then went into the arsenal together; I sent for McCubrey, and told him that it was my intention to have the contents of the trucks weighed—at the same time Wright came up—I said, "Whose duty is it to weigh the goods?"—McCubrey said, "We only weighed a few, but it was Wright's duty to see them all weighed"—I then gave directions for the scales to be brought from the shed—they were brought, and the goods weighed—as each bag was weighed McCubrey took down the weight on a piece of paper as Mr. Carnelly called it out—Jones stood on Mr. Carnelly's right hand, so as to check the weight with him, and Wright was walking to and fro—I found the weight of the bags was 86 cwt. 2 qrs., and some few pounds—there were 58 bags—I asked McCubrey how he accounted for such a quantity over weight—he replied, "We always allow 14 lbs. for each bag"—I said, "if you reckon that up you will only find that between 7 and 8 cwt."—that is so—he said, "I can't account for the other part"—finding that several of the bags that were removed from the third truck were very heavy to what the others were, I gave directions for one of them to be cut open, and in it I found a quantity of new brown paper, or unused brown paper—I asked McCubrey how he accounted for that paper being in the bag—he said, "It is a quantity of old paper that I have had in store for some time, and I gave the men directions to put it in the bags;"—this is some of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were about nine half reams, or eight and three quarter—this is a half ream—it is labelled, "Messrs.

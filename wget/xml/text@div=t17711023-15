               <p>- Wilkins. I am a shoemaker in Leaden-hall-street, On Saturday the 6th of July the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of boots and two pair of shoes; he gave me this bill of 8 l. (producing it) and desired me to give him the difference. I looked over the bill, and saw it was accepted; and as it had but a few days to run, I gave him 6 l. 7 s. which was the difference. I sent the bill to my banker, and their clerk received the money for it, the day it was due, of Mr. Russel's partner, on the Monday following, and Mr. Russel and hi-partner came to me, and told me it was a forged bill, and desired to know whom I had of. I told them I had it of Donaldson, one of the <rs id="t17711023-15-deflabel74" type="occupation">clerks at St. Thomas's Hospital</rs>

               <p>Q. Has there never been any transaction between the prisoner and you?</p>
               <p>Russell. No; I never remembered having seen him till before the Justice; then I supposed I must have seen him at the hospital. I know nothing of the drawer; it is all a mere fiction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not paid by your partner?</p>
               <p>Russell. My partner, as I am informed, was sitting at a desk; the banker's clerk brought the bill, and he laid out the money for it; mine is all home trade; I never had a bill drawn upon me in my life.</p>

               <p>Russell. The flourish is the contrary way to what I write my name.</p>

I saw it wanted but a fortnight of being due. From the address of the man, and its being so small a sum, and seeing the name of Mr. Russell to it, I had no doubt about it; and I readily gave him cash for it, upon the receiving two shillings for the discount: he indorsed it in the name of

               <p>Williams. I remember, at the latter end of July, two gentlemen were in the room with Mr. Donaldson; one of them was dressed in blue and gold: he desired me to go and get change for a guinea, which I did. Mr. Donaldson has told me since that he gave that gentleman cash for a note of 8 l.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and live at Hammersmith. I have seen Mr. Donaldson several times, and have drank with him. I was in company with him at Astley's riding school: from thence I went with him to the public house, and there I saw some money with regard to a note. I was a little how come you so, I believe; it was for eight guineas. There was a gentleman there in white, and another in blue clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the money was paid for?</p>
               <p>Berresford. I believe something in regard to a note; and I believe there was a bottle of wine given by the prisoner; but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there?</p>
               <p>Berresford. I believe he might be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Did you see this man there?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe he was in the room at that time: I have seen him there before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you subpoena'd here last sessions?</p>
               <p>Williams. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you subpoena'd to come here?</p>
               <p>Williams. Last Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. This subpoena was served this morning, or late last night.</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe I received it at half an hour after ten last night.</p>

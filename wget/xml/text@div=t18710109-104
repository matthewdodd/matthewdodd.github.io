                  </hi>. I am a draper, of 164, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico—on 8th December Steele came in for a pocket-handkerchief, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered me a half-crown, which I found was bad—she said she got it by selling coals in the street; but afterwards that she was an un<lb></lb>fortunate girl, and took it from a gentleman—I gave her in charge, with the coin.</p>

I took the prisoner to the station; but the charge was not pressed, and I let her go—I received this coin (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I followed her, with another officer, and saw her speaking to Steamson—we were in plain clothes—we passed on, as they appeared to be watching—Steamson walked on 150 yards, and Upson took him—he threw himself down on a doorstep—we got him up, and Upson found this parcel on the step, containing seven half-crowns and two florins—this bad shilling was found in his waistcoat pocket, wrapped in tissue paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Steele was not searched the first time she was taken—no female searcher was there—she said before the Magistrate "It was I threw the parcel of bad money down, as I was passing by; I saw them laying hold of the young man, and I did not wish him to get into trouble, and I threw it down"—she did not say that if she had been searched at the station it would have been found upon her—Steamson took it from his right coat pocket—he was looking in at a picture-shop window; but the moment he saw we were going to lay hold of him he threw himself down—the shilling in his pocket was wrapped in the same kind of paper as the other coin was wrapped in; unprinted paper—he said that he had had the bad shilling a long time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer B</hi>). I was at the station when Steele was brought in, and accompanied Morgan to watch her—we followed her to Grosvenor Gardens, where she joined Steamson, who was standing at a shop-door; they had half-a-dozen words, and Steele went down Ranelagh Street, while Steamson stood at the corner—I went through Victoria Square, and Morgan followed them—I came round and met Morgan, and saw Steele turn to the left, in Arabella Row—Steamson looked in a picture-shop window—I caught hold of him—he had his right hand in his coat pocket—I caught him by the collar; he resisted—Morgan came and caught hold of him—he threw himself on to a doorstep, and fell on his hand, like this, and I then saw this piece of rag there, containing seven bad half-crowns and two bad florins, in tissue paper—I found a bad hilling in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The paper in which the shillings were wrapped got crumpled up and destroyed—it was torn before the Magistrate—there was a coin in each fold—I did not hear Steele say before the Magistrate, that if he had searched her when he first took her he should have found these coins upon her—I was there all the time—what she said was, that she threw the counterfeit coin there, and knew nothing of the young man, and would take it all upon herself—I saw her pass by this step, but she did not go within three yards of it, and did not place the coins there—I saw Steam<lb></lb>son</p>

I am a brush hawker, of 13, Pitt Street, Old Kent Road—the prisoner is my son—he does not live with me, he lives with his mother—about two months ago I saw him receive four shillings from a gentleman in Peckham, for some shoe and clothes brushes, and among them there was a bad shilling—I cannot distinctly swear that this is it, but it is, to the best of my belief—it is one of the old-fashioned shillings—he put it in his waistcoat pocket, wrapped it up in a bit of paper, as I told him to keep it separate from all other money, in case he might give it away for a good one—I have been in his company since that, day after day, and to my knowledge, he has never been able to see the gentleman since—as far as I know, on the day he was taken in custody, the shilling remained in his pocket—he bears a good character, and is very kind to me and his mother—he has never been in trouble—he is my whole support, and I do hot know what I shall do.</p>

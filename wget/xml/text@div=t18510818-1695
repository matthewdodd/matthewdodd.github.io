                  </hi>. I live at 25, Cutler-street, Houndsditch, and am the prosecutor's daughter. On 15th July, by my father's directions, I went up to the back-garret where the prisoner worked, and found seven waistcoats and eight jackets under some rags, in a corner of the room—I brought them down to my father, who told me to take them up and put them in the same place again—no one else was at work in that room—these six jackets are part of what I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of re-made goods. Marks has worked for me since last Christmas; his business was to press and clean the goods—he worked at the top of the house—I sent my daughter up-stairs, (and she brought me down some goods; these are part of them—I went into the clothes'-market in the afternoon, and was fetched from there by Benjamin Cohen—I went home with him, and found a crowd of people; the female prisoner was at the foot of the stairs, and Marks a few steps up, without his coat—I knew Myers by her visiting him almost every morning and evening—I keep manufactured goods on the ground-floor where I work—nobody had a right to take them into the garret, they had no business there—I have no doubt these goods are mine.</p>

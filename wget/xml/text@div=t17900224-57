               <p>I am a carpenter. On Friday morning I went to work, as usual, and heard a person walk in the cellar; I steps to meet my master, and told him there was somebody in the cellar; and I heard the water flush in it: my master bid me go in; I went in; and the man was creeping through the joists of the cellar; I stopped while he got up on his feet, and then I collared him; a constable was had; and he was taken to justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>Was the cellar dry when you left it at night? - The leaden pipe lay upon the floor, along the wall, where he stood upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240056"></xptr>joists over the cellar; that had been broke</p>
               <p>Did it appear to be newly broke off? - Newly broke off, sixteen feet: the long pipe was never found.</p>
               <p>Did you find any leaden pipe about the cellar loose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that any part of what was broke off? - No: none of that was in the cellar; this lead, produced, was found in the house, on the floor of the cellar; these were broke off the back of the house, and it corresponded; I compared it; the prisoner was just under it: I can swear to this one piece, for I made a trough to fit it, the day before.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor: I was going by the door at the apprehending of this prisoner, and they called me in to assist; and I gave them a light; and they gave a ladder, to go down below, to see if any one else was below: I did not see any thing about the prisoner: the lead lay upon the floor; but whether all this lay there, I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Was he near the lead or not? - When I came in with the candle I did not see him nigh, because he was under, in the cellar, and the lead was above.</p>
               <p>You went in with these two men at night; where was he? - Coming out of the cellar: I found the lead just laying by the place where he broke in at; the boards were nailed down at night and broke open in the morning; I saw it nailed myself.</p>

               <p>As I was going along, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw two men standing at this door; I thought the carpenters were at work; I went in; and was coming out again, when they came in and opened the door.</p>

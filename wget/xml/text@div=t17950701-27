               <p>Q. Have you a house of your own? - I rent one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any property out of that house, and when? - Yes, on the 24th of June, a bank note; it was in my coat pocket; I left it in my pocket book. The lad lived with me as a servant; I left the coat off over night, and put on a morning gown that I have, and went up stairs, and in brushing the coat he took the note out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your coat? - I am very sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you discover the note was gone? - I did not discover it till the next morning. I discharged him in the morning, he did not suit my service at all; and I went to get some change out of my pocket book, and I missed the note, and I went to the magistrate and got a warrant, and I had a suspicion that he was gone to the White Horse coffee house; I went there, and I see him sitting with some wine before him, and I went in and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010056"></xptr>took him myself, and there he was searched, and we found he had a great deal of money about him, and had bought a good deal of clothes; and afterwards he confessed that he took the note and had changed it, and bought some clothes with it; but that he had left nine guineas in the coach that I took him to the magistrate's in; he said he changed it at a Mr. Banks's shoe warehouse, in Oxford-street. I went the next morning to Mr. Banks, and Mr. Banks had the very note in his hand, going to pay it away; I told him he must not pay it away; he said he must, for he must make the payment; I said, not with that; and I took that note from him, and gave him another bank note of the same value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that you went to the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly, and there this man confessed? - No, I did not, he confessed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What promise did you make him to induce him to confess? - None.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar had bought shoes of me several times, and knowing his person, I gave him cash for the note; I asked him whose it was? he said, it was his master's; I asked him to indorse the note in his master's name; he indorsed the note in a fictitious name, No. 25, Edward-street; Helen. I think it is spelt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the note that you received of him? - Yes.</p>

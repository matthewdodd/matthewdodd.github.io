On the 4th of June, I went out in the morning about one o'clock, and did not return again till about eight in the afternoon, when I found my room door open, and the staple on the floor; I had left it locked; to all appearance it had been broke open, and I found these things inserted in the indictment taken from the room: when I went out in the morning some were left in the chair, and some on the side of the bed. I missed likewise a great coat, which justice Addington thought proper to put it by; I found them again in the possession of the prisoner at the bar, in Dove-court, in Gray's Inn-lane; I got the constable, and went after him the next day, and found the things, inserted in the indictment, in his apartment, in a box; he was there at that time; he made a denial in the first place, that he did not know any thing about them, and at last he produced the property. The things are here; the constable has got them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the box locked that had these clothes? - To the best of my recollection the key was in the box, but it was not locked; he brought out the hat in the first place, and then he brought out the clothes; he made several excuses; he said, he hoped we would not take the advantage of him, and made some flight excuse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What is your name? - John Morgans.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this prisoner's house and lodgings, did not you go there in consequence of some direction that he had left at Williams's house, that he had found some things, and there they were when the owner pleased to call for them? - It was not made known to me if it was so.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps this house in Shipyard, where Morgans lodged. On the 4th of June the prisoner came in along with one Mrs. Sparrow, his aunt, who was a lodger in the house, and I saw him go in and out three or four times in the day, I took no notice of him, as he was an acquaintance of Mr. Sparrow's; about four or five o'clock I was going up to make Mr. Morgans's bed, and Mr. Sparrow and the prisoner met me on the stairs, and the prisoner went into Mr. Sparrow's room, and I went into Mr. Morgans's room.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find Mr. Morgans's room? - Locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - I stayed no longer till I made his bed, and done every thing necessary in his room; when I had done so, I came out and locked the door, and pushed it with my hand to see if it was locked, and the prisoner was in Mr. Sparrow's room at the same time; this was between four and five; about an hour after Mr. Sparrow came down, and says, Mrs. Williams, can you change me a guinea? No, says I, I cannot, but I will go up to the Fountain and get it changed. He said, no, it did not signify, if I could lend him a shilling. I told him, yes, I could lend him a shilling, but silver was very scarce, I would let him have six-pence and sixpenny worth of halfpence. A little time after that Mr. Sparrow went out, and his wife went out very soon after, and I thought to myself it must be some intimate acquaintance of theirs, that they would leave him up stairs; and in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after, I saw the prisoner go through the passage with a bundle in his hand, but I said nothing to him, nor he to me; this was about six o'clock in the evening. Mr. Morgans came home about eight or nine o'clock, and went to go to his room, and found his door open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This young man you had seen come to his uncle and aunt before? - No, never before this day, nor I did not know who he was till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you? - Not a great many; three on one floor, and four on another.</p>

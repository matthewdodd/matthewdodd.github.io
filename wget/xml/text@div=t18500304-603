                  </hi>. I live at Cattle-gate, Enfield. On 22nd Feb., I had three ducks and a drake in a shed near my house—the next morning two ducks were gone; these are them, I know them by the ring on their necks, and a little bit of white on their wings—I traced the footsteps of two men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 113). On the morning of 23rd Feb. I heard of these ducks being missed, I went to where they had been kept, and traced the footsteps of two men upwards of two miles across the fields—they led me to the house of the prisoner's mother at Hadley—I knew the prisoners, and I had seen them round that neighbourhood before—I found two ducks in a room, and in the next room I found the prisoners and a third man, who I believe was their brother—I took the prisoners to the station—I took off their boots, and compared them with the footmarks—Isaac's boots had two rows of nails, and Joseph's had the nails half-worn off—I measured the lengths of the footsteps with a stick, and they corresponded exactly—I had seen the prisoners near the prosecutor's house on the 22nd, about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

When I went home, we went across the fields, and the officer came, and said, "What did you do about the fields? were you round by Cattle-gate?" I said, "Yes;" just by the fields there is a wood; I returned from there, and went by the prosecutor's house again; there were six of us, and the other three turned away, and we went our way home; we got home between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; next morning I went to Potter's-bar after work; I was some time about the place, and about dinner-time the policemen came, and seeing the footmarks, they charged us with the two ducks; I said I had seen no ducks, but if there were any, they might have them; they found these ducks in the house, but how they got there, I don't know; they took us to the station, and then my brother told me that he had taken these ducks down home, and put them in the house; I said, "Why did you not say so before they committed me?" he put down his head, and said no more.</p>

I did not steal them; they are not his ducks, they are mine; I bought them at Mr. Rydon's, at Colney-batch; they have private marks about them; one is clipped on the wing, and one on the back; my brother has more ducks at home, all marked in the same way.</p>

I took the prisoner on 23rd January, and said that I took him on a charge of bigamy—he said that he thought he had a right to marry a second wife, as his first wife had committed adultery—I produce a certificate which I have compared with one at Hoxton Church—it is correct—I did the same with another certificate at St. Pancras—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Church of St. John the Baptist Hoxton—George Fisher and Hannah Burton, married 11th May</hi>, 1844.")—I looked at the book in the clerk's presence, and laid the certificate on it—I saw Hannah Fisher, in the prisoner's presence, at the station—3he said that she was married to him in August, 1844, at Hoxton—he said, "You know I have caught you behind the door"—she said, "You know it is false"—I knew both him and her—the second certificate was of the marriage of George Fisher and Hannah Jane Robinson, at St. Pancras Church, November 10th, 1867.</p>

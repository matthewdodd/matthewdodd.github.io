                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Kirk, an engineer; I live at Bermondsey—on 5th September, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon I went to a public-house in Bermondsey-street to get some refreshment—I saw the two prisoners there, and some conversation ensued between us—Smith said she had a very bad hand; that she had been to the Hospital, and been laid up for 6 weeks with her hand, and had no means of getting her livelihood—Crouch also complained of being ill—Smith offered to show me her hand, and she took the cloth off and showed it me—I asked them if they would take a glass of anything to drink—they both said they did not mind—they said they would take a little gin; I called for sixpenny worth, and it was drank, and we came out—Smith asked me to go to their place; I said, "No, I only live a minute or two's walk from here, and I will make you a cup of tea, such as I have"—they went home with me, and before I went in I purchased a haddock—when we got home I had a damson pudding in the cupboard, and I took the pudding out and asked them to eat that till the kettle boiled, if they were hungry—while they were eating the pudding Smith got up and told me my face was dirty, and offered to wipe it if I would allow her, which I did, and she rubbed my face on the left side and over my mouth and nose, and I remember nothing after that till I came to, about half-past 5 o'clock—when I went home with them, as near as I can tell, it was about a quarter-past 2 o'clock—when I came to myself I was lying on the floor—neither of the prisoners were there—there was nobody in my apartment—no one came in; I went down to my landlady in the kitchen—I felt wry ill—I examined my room—the things were all turned over; the cupboards were open, and all the things were taken away—I missed a barege dress, a pair of trousers of my husband's, the stuff for making a black alpaca dress, a bonnet, a black apron, a table-cloth, a scarf, and several other articles, and all my victuals that I had in my house—I gave information to the police directly—I afterwards met with the prisoners by Billingsgate steps over London-bridge on the Tuesday week afterwards, as I was taking some work home—Crouch was wearing my bonnet, and Smith had my collar on—I did not give any of my property to either of them—I did not give them authority to remove any of them—Crouch saw me, and ran down the steps, and Smith walked on and I followed her—she went several times, up and down as far as the Monument—she made a stop, and I said, "You may as well stop, for I shall give you in</p>

               <p>charge"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For robbing me"—she said she never saw me before—I said I should follow her, and one or two gentlemen told me to hold her—she began to swear, and said she would give me a b—y good hiding—I said I would follow her, and she said she would b—y nigh half kill me if I did, and she made her escape through the crowd—I got information afterwards—I have not been able to discover any of my things—Smith was taken afterwards, and Crouch was in the house, but I could not identify her at the time—I saw her in the morning with a bonnet—while I was in the public-house with them, we had sixpenny worth of gin; nothing more between us all—I had had half a pint of porter before.</p>

I followed Smith—I did not say anything about the other woman—she ran away—I did not know the way down those steps then; I have been since to see where they led to—I followed Smith for some time—I was close to them—it was between 8 and 9 o'clock at night—I was coming from the City—I had been taking work home—the prisoners were not apprehended till after I got information where they lived; they both lived together—I went to the house with an officer—Smith and Crouch were both there—Smith came to the door—I went in the house and saw both of them—I identified Smith though she had no bonnet—I was unable to identify Crouch, and she was not given in custody till the next morning—I was taken to the house again, and Crouch was gone out—I saw her in Bermondsey-street, coming out of a public-house—she had a bonnet on, and then I identified her—the bonnet I lost was a black silk bonnet I had made myself—when Crouch was taken, she had a black bonnet on, but it was not mine; but she had my bonnet on when I saw her and Smith by the Billingsgate steps—when I saw the two prisoners at the public-house, I had never seen them before—we had sixpenny worth of gin; it was divided between us—we were a quarter of an hour there—I can't tell whether the barman or the master served us—it was a man—I can't tell whether there was more than one man behind the bar—there were no people there but us—I could not tell the name of the public-house—I could find it—I went with a policeman, and pointed it out—none of the property I lost has been discovered—the prisoners' lodging was searched—I am sure about the hour and the day—it was Monday, 5th September, at 2 o'clock, just after dinner.</p>

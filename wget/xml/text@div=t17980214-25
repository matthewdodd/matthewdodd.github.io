             sworn. - I lost my purse between the 23d and 24th of January; I had given a gentleman change the evening before, between ten and eleven o'clock, I think it was Wednesday, and to the best of my knowledge, I had not the purse out of my pocket again till I missed it; I had both gold and silver in it; I looked every where that I could think of for it; I asked the girl if she had seen any thing of it; she said, she had not; I begged that she would look every where for it; she told me she had, and could not find it; I then discharged her, and as she was going away, I took her into a parlour, and told her, I must search her; she refused, and said, I should not search her; she said, she was sorry it was lost, and hoped it would be found out who had it; I sent for a constable, and while the constable was gone for, she gave me the purse; she said, she found it upon the tap-room table; she said, she would have given it me before, but there was not so much money in it as I had said, and she was afraid I should think she had stole it; she was then taken to the office; Mr. Smith, my lodger, has got the purse and the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose purse is it? - A. It is mine; I believed it to be mine when I received it from her; it contained the money mentioned in the indictment.</p>

             sworn. - I saw the prisoner turn her pocket inside out upon the table; she said, there was all she had; I sent for a constable; among the things that she pulled out, was a sixpence marked S. W. her mistress said, this sixpence was in my purse, I can swear to it; she said, I am sure you have got my purse; the mistress cried very much, and she dropped the sixpence; the girl then pulled out something like a night-cap, and undonbled it, and took the purse out of it, she held it to her mistress, and said, here it is; and she took it out of her hand, and gave it to me; I told the money out before them, there was a guinea, a crown piece, six sixpences, and a shilling; the girl that I sent, could not get a constable, and I went myself to the office for one; I have had the purse and the money ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Milne.) Is there any money amongst it that you can swear to? - A. I did not say I could swear to it; I had that sixpence in my possession, but I cannot say it was in my purse, I had taken it that day. (The purse and money produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe what the letters were? - A. I made some remark upon it, but I cannot tell what now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say immediately, upon seeing it, that that was your sixpence? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put all the money that you took that day, into your purse? - A. I cannot say that I did; she said she had found the sixpence upon the tap-room floor, and afterwards upon the table, I might have pulled it out with my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she found the sixpence, or the purse, upon the tap-room table? - A.Both.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you keep your pockets at night?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140030"></xptr>- A. Under my pillow; the prisoner slept in the same room that night, in another bed, my husband was not at home, I was not disturbed.</p>
               <p>Smith. The evening before, I gave Mrs. Milne a crown-piece to change for me, but I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know nothing of the money, the purse I have worn for ten years myself, I know this to be my purse.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Milne.) Had you ever told this girl how much you had lost? - A. Yes; I told her, I thought there were two guineas and a half in gold, and fifteen or sixteen shillings in silver, I don't know, really, how much there was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found the purse under the tap-room table, and gave it to my mistress, with every farthing in it as I found it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lose from this barn of your's? - A. A saw, two hand bills, and a hammer, which I found afterwards on the premises where the prisoner lodged, concealed between the ceiling and the floor, in the cellar of his father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time he was apprehended? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of these articles at that time? - A. He said at Bow-street, that he had found them by my pond, where he had gone to get some water for his mother.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Hart.)</p>
               <p>Q. When was all this done? - A. Between last December and January.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find them? - A. On the 30th of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up? - A. On the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that at the time you found them the prisoner lodged in his father's house? - A. No, he had left it I believe about a fortnight or three weeks before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live then at that time? - A. I do not know exactly; I believe he lived where his wife lived; he went backwards and forwards to the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is it that his wife lived? - A. In Brentford, about a quarter of a mile from his father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to search his father's house? - A. I had suspected him a long time of having robbed me; I applied to a gentleman for a search warrant, he advised me to let him alone and I should detect him in some fact. It went on till the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. You did take him up on a warrant, did you? - A. Yes, it was in September when I found them; he was discharged from that.</p>
               <p>Q. And the things were found before you had that warrant? - A. Yes, but I found a hammer afterwards at his father's house: he was liberated the first time I had him taken up, through my not coming up time enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. Then, If I understand you right, the hammer was found at an interval after the first time of taking him up? - A. It was, and the magistrate desired me to indict him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is his father and mother? - A. The father is allowed something from the parish, he is a very poor infirm man, he was a labourer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. Were these things found by themselves? - A. They were found among a great many other things, between the ceiling and the flooring, all were tools apparently.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I have not a notion of what you mean between the ceiling and the floor, you must mean between the flooring of the ground floor and the ceiling of the cellar? - A. Yes, the ceiling was broken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. Do you know a man of the name of Slauter? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said to any body that you suspected Slauter of stealing these things? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that the prisoner at his first examination said, that he found the saw and the two hand bills by the pond; at that time there was no charge made about the hammer? - A. No, not till after it was found with a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. As you have known the prisoner a great while, what way of life is he in: he seems to be a decent young man? - A. He is a gardener, I knew him to be a loose character.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the pond? - A. In one of my fields.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. I produce this hammer, which I found in the first one pair of stairs where the father lived. It was lying in the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Prosecutor.) Are these your property? - A. They are, I kept them in my barn in one of my fields, nearly adjoining to the prisoner's father's house.</p>



               <p>Court Q. By what particular marks do you know them to be yours? - A. By having them so long a time; and by using them a thousand times; I was in the constant habit of using these tools in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the barn be from the prisoner's father's house? - A. It might be about two or three hundred yards, there is only one field between.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first missed these articles? - A. I think it was between January and February that the barn was broke open and very thing taken out, the lock was wrenched, and the cross bar was quite broken.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this pond from the barn in which the prisoner at the bar told you he found them. - A. Between the barn and his house.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I have known him for sixteen or seventeen years, he is a <rs id="t18051204-2-deflabel13" type="occupation">gardener</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18051204-2-defend62 t18051204-2-deflabel13"></join> by trade, he was gardener to Mr. Parker at the boarding-school where I went to school; he had always an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing with regard of these articles, the saw and the two hand bills? - A. I know about the latter end of last April, I was going up Drum-lane, on my road to New Brentford, I crossed a field called the Haunted-house field; going into the lane, I observed the prisoner with a barrow and a water-cask, he was filling this cask out of the ditch, and in the act of dipping his bucket in the ditch, I observed him pick up a rusty saw and two gardener's knives. I cannot tell what gardener's call them; one had a long handle.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them which have been produced, were they like them? - A. Yes, the same thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they covered with water? - A. They were covered with weeds at the time he took them out of the ditch, and to the best of my recollection this saw had one rivet out of the handle, but that I cannot take upon we to swear positively to,</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there on purpose? - A. I had business that morning to come from East Sheen over Kew-bridge, and the motive that led me to come up Drum-lane, was on account of my being so many years at Grove boarding-school, which led me to see the premises again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had been familiar with those parts before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. It was quite a chance of your going there that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to come up just as the prisoner was getting this water? - A. Yes, and curiosity led me to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And curiosity led you to examine the saw about the rivet? - A. No, I did not examine it all, I took the saw up and laid it down again.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the rivets you know? - A. To the best of my recollection there was a rivet out, but I cannot swear positively to it, nor can I speak to the indentity of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards were you asked to give evidence upon it? - A. The first time that I heard of it was from his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you first knew that your evidence would be material for the prisoner upon the subject? - A. About three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the month of April down to three weeks ago, you did not know that your evidence would be wanted? - A. I never had the least idea or suspicion that it would ever be brought into court.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - A. No. 2, Ocean-street, Stepney; I am a wharfinger.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever much acquaintance with the prisoner at the bar? - A. Only by his being labouring gardener to Mr. Parker; the person I went to school with; he lived with Mr Parker, at Brentford at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. So that your acquaintance with the prisoner was at Brentford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at Stepney? - A. About twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before? - A. At Red-lion Wharf, Upper Thames-street. I left the school about thirteen or fourteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are speaking to his character about fourteen years ago, when he was a labouring gardener working for Mr. Parker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner put down his bucket into the ditch with which he was filling a cask; was there no pond nearer for him so get the water? - A. It was a clear ditch surrounded by a hedge, in the lane leading towards New Brentfords by the Haunted House field.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Is your field near this Haunted House field? - A. There is only one field between it and my field, and there is a pond in the middle of my field. The saw is the same now as when I lost it; there is no rivet out of the saw, nor was there then.</p>

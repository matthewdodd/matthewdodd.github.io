On the 21st of march I sent him to attend a lady in Queen-square with a variety of goods, and amongst other things a card of lace which I borrowed of a brother tradesman; he informed me when he returned that he sold goods to the lady to the value of 1 l. 4 s. and three yards of edging in part amongst other goods, of that which I had borrowed; I desired him to take this piece of blown edging to the gentleman whom I borrowed it of, informing him the quantity that they cut off; when he came back, he informed me that they mentioned there was three yards and a half gone of the lace; I asked him how that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100080"></xptr>could be? his answer was that he did not shew the blown to the lady himself, but he sent it up stairs, and she cut it off herself; after that I desired him to return to the lady and tell her that he believed there was a mistake, as there were three yards and a half gone instead of the three yards which she paid for; he went out apparently as going to the lady, and returned bringing me 2 s. 3 d. for the half yard of the blown, saying, at the same time, that the lady was very sorry, and did not mean to hurt me; I was not satisfied with the account, and I went to the lady that evening, I received a note from the lady's maid that the bill came to 1 l. 12 s. I then took the prisoner up stairs and told him I was sure that he had injured me, and insisted on knowing the contents of his box; on his opening his box I found a variety of different goods, my property, as stated in the indictment; immediately as I found these things on him I desired a servant maid to go down stairs and send a lad for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you with absolute certainty speak to these goods? - There is my own private mark on the muslin, and the whole goods are in my line; the prisoner acknowledged before the constable they were my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you any body interested in this business besides yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had this young lad come to you from Mr. Cary's? - He did, I had a very good character with him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he is the youngest of eleven children of parents in the country he has been very decently brought up? - He was, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he come from? - Out of Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - One month; he is sixteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you ever permit this custom that your servants do occasionaly take goods out of your shop and account with you for the value of them? - I do not.</p>

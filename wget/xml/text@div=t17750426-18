On the 7th of April, I went out about half after seven, in the evening; I left no one in the house; I took care to leave the house secure, I lifted up the latch of the street door to be sure I had locked it. I returned home about twelve o'clock, and found my house broke open. I went up stairs, and saw a parcel of things tied up in a bundle. The next day I saw the prisoner before the justice, but he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the house of Mr. Brookes. On the 17th of April, I went out about six in the evening, and returned home after nine. As I came down the street, I saw a light in Mrs. Smith's room. I was very much starried, knowing there was nobody at home. I got Mr. Chapman, and two or three neighbours to go into the house. When I returned, I saw the light was removed into my room, I unlocked the street door, and three men run down stairs; they blew their candle out, but the snuff was a-light: hearing them running down stairs, I pulled the door to again, but they wrenched it out of my hand, and rushed out, one, one way, another the other way, and the prisoner ran across the street. Mr. Hudson tripped up his heels as he was running. I saw him next day, before the justice: I did not see him when he was tripped up and taken by Hudson, not to be sure to his person, I went up to my apartment; I found the door wrenched open; I left it double locked when I went out: there were a shirt unmade, an apron, and a piece of cloth dropped on the outside of my door. I went to Mrs. Smith's room, and found her drawers broke open, and a bundle of things without the door; they had made an attempt to open the lock of my bureau with a chissel, or some such tool.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Brookes. I was at my door when the last witness came home; she told me, she was sure there was some body in the house, because she saw a light, and she knew there was nobody at home: she went to get some assistance, and while she was gone, I saw the light move out of the one pair of stairs into the two pair of stairs room. She returned with Campion and some other people: she seemed slurried, and said, now they have got into my room; she opened the street door, and they were coming down stairs with as much speed as they could. I cannot say how many came out, it was so dark: I am positive the prisoner is one that came out of the house, I kept my eye upon him; I took him three or four yards from the door, I never had my eyes off him till I took him; I was close to the door: I delivered him to proper people to take care of him, and went home; I was not in the house. I went next day before the justice; there he said, there were two more besides him in the house. I am very positive he is one that came out of the house.</p>

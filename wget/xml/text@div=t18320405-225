On the 1st of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, Preston came to my shop alone, and asked for some sugar-candy - he then changed his mind to sugar-plums; he asked the price of bread; I told him, and said he should have half a loaf if he pleased - he said he would go up the street, and get the money; he went out - I shut the door; he then came back, and said he could not have the bread - he made a leap on the counter; he took up the sugar-plums, for which he put down a halfpenny; I was aware he had taken something, but I did not know what - I went after him, and saw him join Phillips about eight doors off; I returned to my shop, and looked to see if I had lost any weights, but I had not; the officer came afterwards, and asked if I had lost any thing; I then looked, and missed a 5s. paper of halfpence, which had been done up the day before, to pay the baker.</p>

On the 3rd of January, I was called down by the boy, who was showing the prisoner a pair of shoes, and I saw the prisoner conceal a pair of shoes that the boy had given into her hand—I still watched her—the boy went for another pair—I accused her of having them—she dented it, and said she had put them into the glass-case—then she pulled up her cloak and gown, and showed her pocket, and said they were not there—I fetched</p>

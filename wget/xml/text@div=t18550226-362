                  </hi>. Esq. I have an estate at Clay-hill, in the pariah of Enfield—the chapel in question is in that parish, and on those grounds—it is my property; it is used as a chapel, and in my occupation—I believe it was originally an outhouse, attached to a former residence, which has since been pulled down—it stands upon the land, in grounds attached to my own house, about 200 yards from my dwelling house—there is a path leading direct to it from my dwelling house—it has been used for the pur<lb></lb>poses of divine worship for the last four or five years, up to the Sunday before the fire, according to the rites of the Established Church, the Vicar Minding his curate to perform the service every Sunday down to the Sunday before the fire—on the day of the Census the congregation consisted of 110 persons; the average attendance is from 70 to 80—the parish church is two miles off—I fitted up the chapel with open seats, a pulpit, and reading desk—there is no communion table; the communion is not administered there—the building is not consecrated, or licensed; it was put to the Bishop whether it was necessary, and he considered it was not—the arrangement has the sanction of the Bishop of London—the Vicar has officiated there—it is open to anybody; there is no payment for sittings; the doors are open during the whole time of divine worship (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAM</hi>. <hi rend="italic">expressed tome doubt whether a chapel of this description, neither licensed nor consecrated, came within the statute; and if it became necessary would consult the Judges on the subject</hi>)—there was a charcoal stove, it stood in the centre of the chapel—it had no chimney to it; we burnt prepared charcoal, therefore there was no effluvia from it; it stood upon stone—it was always lighted on the Sun<lb></lb>day morning—the fire happened on a Friday; there had been no use made of the chapel since the previous Sunday—I know the prisoner; he was in my service for about three year; he left last Sept.; I discharged him—there had been a fire on my farm buildings a week before I discharged him—he had been taken into custody, and was discharged by the Magistrate—on Friday, 26th Jan., about 10 minutes to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was about to leave my house, when an alarm of fire was given—I immediately proceeded to the chapel, which I heard was on fire—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>) I went by this path, which leads direct to the chapel; it goes by the side of the orchard, and comes up to the back of the chapel—the flames were coming out of the windows; the whole building was in flames—I observed footmarks in the snow—I think I was then immediately in front of the chapel—the letter E upon the plan does not represent where I was; I stood a little further forward, towards the road—a pathway had been swept, and I stood in the swept part of the path—there was snow on each side the path. about three inches deep—the footmarks that I saw were leading directly up</p>

               <p>towards the door of the chapel—the pathway was swept between the chapel and where I was standing; the footmarks ended where the snow ended—they were in a direction from the wall towards the chapel door; they were the footmarks of one person—I traced them as close as the snow permitted; the toes of the footmarks were towards the chapel, and also turned the other way, as going back again; there were two lines; the width of the swept path in front of the chapel was about two feet, I should say—the footmarks did not come within two feet of the chapel; the walk is about eight feet wide in front of the chapel; they came up to the end, and there was a line of footmarks returning in the opposite direction—they were the same foot. marks—there is a shrubbery in front of the chapel, extending down to this gate, on the plan—on seeing the footmarks, I walked by the side of them as far as I could on the path, and then I walked also on the snow towards the wall, until I could see over the wall, and saw some persons standing on the other side of the wall—I did not go quite so far as the wall; it is ten feet high from the road; it is not so high on the inside as the ground is raised—I traced the footmarks into the shrubbery; I went partly into the shrub<lb></lb>bery; the wall I speak of is in front of the chapel, next to the road, including that part of the shrubbery—I did not at that time pursue the marks further that way—I did not notice whether there was snow in the shrubbery until a few days afterwards—I was about five minutes in going from my house to the fire after the alarm was given me—I did not see any person there—I desired a person named Blendall to see that nobody trod upon the foot<lb></lb>marks, so that they should not be interfered with—I gave directions for the prisoner to be taken into custody—a policeman came, and I desired him to ascertain where he was, and to bring him there if possible—he was brought there in about ten minutes; it might have been more; his boots were taken off by the policeman by my direction, and in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a pair of boots produced by Davis, the policeman</hi>) these are the boots—at this time several persons had assembled on the spot; Mr. Heath, the vicar, was not there at that moment, he came up afterwards—Mr. Esdell was there very early—I saw the policeman compare the prisoner's boots with the footmarks—he took the boots and pressed them into the snow, by the side of three of the footmarks, and they appeared to correspond exactly—there were about a dozen footmarks I should say, but he made new impressions by the side of three of them—the boots are rights and lefts, and so were the footmarks—upon observing that they agreed, I desired the policeman to drop the boots into the three prints; he dropped them lightly in, and they were found to fit; that was only into three, and after the impressions had been made by the side, he left the other impressions untouched—I then observed, "Do not let it rest on my testimony, or on the testimony of the police;" and I asked the Vicar and Mr. Esdell to judge—on Saturday last, I set some workmen to clear out the chapel, and they discovered a hassock, or the remains of one—I was not there at the time—they placed it in the position where they found it, under the staircase, leading up to a gallery; it had been burnt, and was very nearly destroyed—that was not where hassocks are ordinarily kept—Walker is the person who showed me the hassock—the windows of the chapel are within three feet of the ground—the pri<lb></lb>soner had the care of the chapel for the last year he was in my service, up to the time of his discharge; it was his duty to sweep it out, and light the candles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time was it when you first heard of the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes before 7 o'clock, I think; I was going out to dinner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260065"></xptr>
               <p>and my carriage was at the door—I had ordered it to be at the door at a quarter to 7 o'clock—I was in my drawing-room, preparing to step into my carriage, when I was told of the fire—Alsop told me of it; he rushed into the room, and said the chapel was on fire—I went into my room and put on a pair of India-rubber shoes, put on my cloak, put Mrs. Bosanquet into the carriage; she was going out to dine; and then I immediately walked to the fire—I think it could not have been above five minutes; it may possibly have been more—I went up the long walk by the stables, through the rose walk, and then to the front of the chapel; I rather think I walked round the chapel—when I got there, the flames were coming out of the top windows—I did not go very near the building, because it was dangerous to do so; I went within about three or four yards of it—I then went in front of the building, and seeing the footmarks, I traced them towards the wall—I went on the footpath as far as it would lead me, and then I went on the snow towards the wall—I fancy there were about twelve footmarks in the snow when I saw them, between the chapel and the shrubbery, as far as I traced them—I did not trace them up to the wall; I should think I traced them for about twenty yards, or not so much; fifteen' I should say—I had not been up that way when I came from London—I think I might have been there five minutes before anybody came; I cannot be quite sure as to the time—I walked round, and I walked up and down the swept walk; how long that consumed I do not know—it appears that I met Blendall in the rose walk—I fancied that he had come across the park, and come close up to the chapel; I do not recollect exactly where I first saw him—the rose walk is part of the walk leading from my house to the chapel—when I first saw Blendall, I said to him, "Blendall, there are foot-marks leading towards the chapel, watch them, and see that nobody goes across them"—I cannot say when I came away whether anybody –did interfere with them or not—when I returned to the spot, a gentleman had got over a low fence at the side, and was coming across the footmarks; he was coming towards the footpath, and I called out to him to keep off—he did not come over the wall—I think I was able to stop him from coming across the foot marks—I desired him to go back immediately—he seemed so bent upon coming on the place where the marks were, that I am afraid I was rather rude to him, in desiring him to retire—I did not tell him not to touch the fire; I said nothing about the fire that I am aware of—I do not know the boots produced; I am not aware that I ever saw them, except upon your feet—they are the same sort of boots that I wear, but whether I ever wore them, I really cannot say—no; I think I can say certainly not, from the nails—they are precisely the same sort of boots that I wear, except the nails—I will not say that they may not be an old pair of mine—I never had such nails in my boots—something must have been done to them since I left them off—I could not observe any impression of the nails in the snow—as far as I could see, both before and after the boots were put into the impressions, there was no impression of nails at all; the snow would not take the impression—I am sure that before the boot was put into the footmark, an impression was first made by the side of three of the footmarks—some of the footmarks were more distinct than others—the three that were the most distinct, were the three that were first compared—I think Mr. Esdell had seen them before the boots were put in, and the policeman must have seen them, because he had the boots in his hand—I did not take them myself—they were dropped in very cautiously—I cannot say whether the nails would mark; I can only say that I did not observe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260066"></xptr>
               <p>any marks of nails in the snow—I am quite sure that I saw no marks of nails either before or after the boots were fitted—I went away from the fire before the policeman came to me—I went away to search for somebody, and left Blendall to watch—the policeman came up after Blendall and I were standing in front of the chapel—I first went away from the chapel, met Blendall, and we returned together to the chapel, and the policeman then came up to us—I was very careful in standing on the part of the path that was swept; I never left that; I walked backwards and forwards towards my house several times, but was very careful not to go on the snow, except on the first occasion, when I traced the footmarks towards the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Then it seems to me, that when you first went to the fire you made your way round the chapel, and went across the snow to the road to see if you could Bee anybody, and then came back and could not tell your own footsteps. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I cannot agree to that—I am quite sure that I had not been on the place where these marks were—I should doubt whether my toe would go in the footmark—I have got on now the identical slippers that I put on over my dress shoes, and this is the boot I had on at the time (<hi rend="italic">the witness handed them to the Jury, who compared them with the prisoner' shots</hi>)—I am not aware that you were dishonest while in my service—I never found you intoxicated on my grounds, but I have found you intoxicated off them—I was quite satisfied with you as long as you were in my service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first thing you did, as I gather, was to go along the rose walk, and to go round the chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whether I went on the walk in front first, or round the chapel, I cannot say, but I did go round the chapel—in doing so I kept on the path—the path was not swept ail round—I think I went all round—the part not swept was totally distinct and separate from the place where the footmarks were—I have no doubt whatever that I did not go on the part were the three steps were, but when I got near the shrubbery I was obliged to go on to the snow, because it was not swept there—I could hardly have been gone three minutes before I returned with Blendall—I told him to watch the footmarks, and then I think I went away again for two or three minutes in search of a policeman—I then returned, and waited till the policeman came up—the footmarks were exactly in the same state as when I first saw them, and so they were when the prisoners boots were taken off to compare with them—the first thing that was done was to make an impression with the boot alongside of one of the impressions—I could not see any mark of the nails in the impression then made by the prisoner's boot, merely the outline—I do not think I was more than five minutes after receiving the alarm before I got to the fire—the nature of the communication would hasten me a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you first observed these two lines of footmarks, going and returning, did you see any other footmarks on the snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I could only see those two tracks—I can say, with perfect confidence, there were no others.</p>

On 26th Jan., I heard a cry of fire in the neighbourhood, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I went to Mr. Bosanquet's chapel—I found Mr. Bosan<lb></lb>quet there, Mr. Esdell, and Blendall—Mr. Bosanquet pointed out to me some footmarks on the snow, there were upwards of a dozen marks; they were leading from the fence which joins the wall, up to the chapel, and back again—a person getting over the gate at the end of the shrubbery marked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260068"></xptr>
               <p>D on the plan, would be able to get to where I saw the footmarks, by coming through the shrubbery, and along the side of the fence—some time afterwards I found a footmark there, but I am not positive to its being the same footmark, it looked like it—there was no snow for about twelve or thirteen yards, from the chapel up to the gate—I traced the footmarks nearly as for as the snow went, but a great many persons got over the wall afterwards and obliterated them—when Mr. Bosanquet first pointed the footmarks out to me, I traced them within about eighteen inches of the wall; I went no further than that, at that time—there were two tracks of footsteps, one track leading from the wall and fence up to the chapel, and one going back again—Mr. Bosanquet desired me to take the prisoner into custody; I went towards his house, which is next to the Rose and Crown, and met him coming up towards the fire—I told him, I wanted him to go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, Mr. Bosanquet wished to speak to him—he said, "Oh, very well, I will go, then"—a few minutes after he said, "Mind, this is not the first time you served me this way, not you, but others; but this will not pass off so easily"—I had said nothing to him before he said that, beyond telling him that Mr. Bosanquet wanted him; I bad not told him for what Mr. Bosanquet wanted to speak to him—we walked together up to the fire—when we got to the stable gate, marked F on the plan, the prisoner stopped suddenly and said, "I have been ordered not to go on to these premises"—I told him he could go with me, and the other constable; I then continued my walk up to the chapel, with him; we went through the stable gate, and through Mr. Bosanquet's grounds, through the shrubberies, down the footpath, and up to the back of the chapel, the chapel was burning at that time—I found Mr. Bosan<lb></lb>quet there, Mr. Esdell and Blendall—the Rev. Mr. Heath, the Vicar, came up soon after—I proceeded to take off the prisoner's boots—we were under a tree, fifteen or eighteen yards from the chapel at the side of it—neither I nor the prisoner had gone upon the part, where I saw the footmarks—it appeared to me that the footmarks were then in the same state, as when I had seen them before; just the one line to and fro—I first tried the left boot in one of the footmarks, and found it was exactly the same shape and length—I then tried the right boot with another mark, and I then made four or five impressions close by those, with the boots; I made those impres<lb></lb>sions about five, six, or seven inches away from the others; so as to be away from the line—I made those impressions opposite to the marks that I had not tried, as well as opposite to the marks that I had tried, they appeared to me to correspond in all respects—Mr. Esdell had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing them as I made them, and so had the Vicar after he came up—I went there again three or four hours afterwards, and again in the morning about a quarter or half past 8 o'clock—a good many persons had been there by that time, but I did not notice any fresh marks along that line of footmarks with which I compared the prisoner's boots—I then com<lb></lb>pared them again carefully by daylight, and they exactly corresponded—I did not examine them with the boots then—the outer part of the heel of the boot is worn away more than the inner part, and the inner part made a deeper impression; and the upper leather bulges and leaves a mark—I noticed that in the footmarks where the snow was deepish, it just left the exact impression as those that I made with the boots—that was the case with the heel of both boots—I did not notice that at the time I made the impressions, but next morning—that was the case with the whole of the impressions, those that I had not interfered with as well as the others</p>

I remember the night of the fire—the boy Walsh came to my cottage and asked me for a lucifer fur a gentleman—I had not got any in the house—he then left—I told my daughter to screw a bit of paper up and take a light outside—she did so, and went outside, but could not see any one—she came back again with the paper in her hand—about two minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and asked me if I would let him light his pipe; I did so—he lighted his pipe—I asked him where he was going to—he said he was going up to Mrs. Ramsay's—she lives up the road, on the same side of the way as my cottage—he was only at my cottage just while he lighted his pipe, he then left—after he was gone, I told my daughter to go out and see which way he had gone—she returned, and said something to me, in consequence of which I afterwards went to the door and looked out—I looked both up and down the road, but did not sec any one—I looked up towards Mrs. Ramsay's—I did not see any one there—I could see as far</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> On Friday, 26th Jan. last, about the hour of 3 in the afternoon, I went into the Fallow Buck with Mr. Page, Mr. Bosanquet's carpenter; I saw Mr. Mann, and said to him, "You have not had your geranium plants which I promised you, but you shall have them this after<lb></lb>noon if you will go down with me;" he did not go with me; I went down alone, and got them ready; I went up again, and found he had left; I lighted my pipe there, and went home again; on my way my pipe went out; I shortly afterwards met a little boy, by Mr. Walker's house, who was walking from school; I said to him, "Have you such a thing as a lucifer?" he replied, "No;" I asked him would he be so kind as to go to the house and beg one for me; he then went in, and said, "Who shall I say it is for?" I said, "Oh, tell them a gentleman wants it to light his pipe;" he knocked at the door, and went in, but could not get one; he then came back, and said he was going by the Fallow Buck; I, not giving it a thought, said, "Will you get me one there?" we were walking together towards the Fallow Buck a few yards; I then left him, and went into Mr. Walker's, and asked him to let me light my pipe, and oblige me with a piece of stick or wire to clean my pipe out; I lighted my pipe, and walked out; he asked me where I was going; I said, "To Mrs. Ramsay's," but I did not tell him when; when I came out I went in the direction of Mrs. Ramsay's house, and down the narrow road into a field, to ease nature; from there I went into Mr. Short's field, and came out by the side of his new house, and straight home; when there I looked at the clock, and saw it was half past 5 o'clock; I sat down then till nearly 6 o'clock, when I got up, and took a wheelbarrow, and proceeded to Mrs. Ramsay's; on my way I saw Walker at his gate, who bade me good night; I replied in the same way, and went to Mrs. Ramsay's; as I got into the coach yard, I passed the coachman; I rang the bell, and Miss Branderd came to me accompanied by Thrussell; they gave me three boxes, which the latter assisted me in loading, and placing in the barrow; he then took hold of the barrow, and said, "It is very heavy, you will have enough to do to get down the hill with it;" before starting I received orders from Miss Branderd to take the boxes to her sister-in-law; it was then 25 minutes past 6 o'clock; I met Mrs. Blendall between Mr. Bosanquet's gate and the chapel; I bid her good night; she bid me good night, and she said, "Oh, it is you, George! I did not know you;" I said, "My load is heavy, and the road is very slippery;" proceeding about 100 yards, I met Henry Watson coming home from work, I suppose; I said to him, "Well, Henry, how are you getting on?" he replied, "I don't know; a few more words passed, when I said, "Listen at the fireworks, the squibs and crackers are being let off;" as there had been some let off the night before, in the way the chapel was; a few more words passed, and we parted; I then went to Mrs. Branderd's; in my way I met a man named Taylor, who said to me, "It is Mr. Short's house on fire;" I said, "No, if it was, we could see it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260074"></xptr>
               <p>more plainly;" I then said again, "If it is a fire, it is twenty miles off;" I unloaded the boxes from the barrow at Mrs. Branderd's, where I went directly after leaving Taylor, and left them with her; after a few words, I took the barrow and went home; when I got home, my father told me it was Mr. Bosanquet's chapel on fire; after setting up the barrow, I went out to see the fire, and on my way I met two policemen; one said, "Oh, here you are! where have you been the last two hours?" I answered, "At home, to be sure;" one said, "You must come with us to Mr. Bosanquet's;" I said, "What for?" he said, "He wants to speak to you;" I replied, "Very well, I will go, then;" I also said, "This is the second time you have served me like this; not you, but others, and it shall not be passed over as the first;" the reason I made chose remarks was, that a sheep shed, by some means, had been on fire before, when, for certain circumstances, I was led to think that Mr. Bosanquet suspected myself and the coachman of knowing something about it; when we got up to the gate, I refused to go further, as Mr. Bosanquet had desired me not to come any more upon his premises; the policeman said, "He will not say anything, because you come with me;" I then went on my way to the chapel; I met Mr. Bosanquet on the walk leading to the chapel; Mr. Bosanquet asked, "Who have you got here?" the policeman said, "George North;" Mr. Bosanquet turned back, and we all proceeded towards the chapel; when there I was asked to pull off one of my boots, and I did so; he told me to go and sit on the seat, which I did, which was under a chesnut tree; they took the boot, and compared it with the footmarks; they after<lb></lb>wards came back, and gave it to the second policeman, who was left with me; then my other shoe was taken, and compared with the footmarks in the snow, and whilst doing it, the latter policeman said to me, "These nails are very remarkable;" Mr. Bosanquet and the others afterwards came back, and I was told by Mr. Bosanquet's charge that I was taken into custody on suspi<lb></lb>cion of setting fire to his chapel; I put on my boots, and walked back with them to the station house, and they locked me up.</p>

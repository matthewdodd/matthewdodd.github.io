               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I received these cravats from the prosecutor, and found this handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket - he said he picked the things up in the shop when he was sweeping it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Where did this take place? A. At the office - I did not use any threat or inducement to him.</p>
               <p>MR. CRAWLEY. These handkerchiefs are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you search his box? A.About eleven o'clock in the morning - he did not sleep in the room his box was in; five of my young men slept there - I am sure the box was locked, and he took the key from his pocket; I have no mark on the handkerchiefs, but we have a particular method of folding them, by which I am certain of them - I had a nine years' character with him from Mr. Harper, of Fleet-street.</p>

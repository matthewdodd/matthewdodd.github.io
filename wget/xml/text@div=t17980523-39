all the rest, except one saw, which we found; the duplicate had been lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You and the prisoner were on very good terms, and worked together? - A. He was only as <rs id="t17980523-39-deflabel209" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you know it is no unusual thing, when poor people have duplicates that they fell them, and honest persons sometimes get possession of duplicates of things improperly come by? - A. It is very often the case.</p>
               <p>Westfield. This is my saw, it is of my own sharping; the stock has my own name engraved upon it at length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to swear that that is your saw, merely because it is of your sharping - do you sharpen differently from any body else? - A. There is a great deal of difference in sharpening, the same as difference in hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it is done in a more bungling way than common, perhaps? - A. I do not know but it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Any young beginner might blunder in the same way? - A. There is as much difference as there is in hand-writing; and there is a stain of porter upon it that I know it by.</p>

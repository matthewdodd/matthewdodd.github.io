                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Colebrook Terrace on the night of the 5th October, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I was going up Pentonville Hill, when I saw a crowd of men and women pushing about-in order to avoid them I crossed into the road; just as I got off the kerb I received a violent blow at the back of my bead which knocked off my hat, and I caught it in my hands—Saunders came up and put his leg between mine and threw me violently on the stones; I could not see who struck me, my hat received a violent kick right across the road, they got round me—King felt me about to see what I had got—I had got neither watch nor money—the detectives came up and King said "If we had known it was you Mr. Gurney, we would not have done anything"—I had known King before—I knew his father.</p>

On the night in question, I was on duty in plain clothes, with another constable of the Reserve in the Pen<lb></lb>tonville Road—I had been watching the three prisoners for about an hour—I first saw them on the top of Pentonville Hill, we charged them with loitering, being suspected persons—they came out of the public-house with another man and some prostitutes; I knew them—when Mr. Gurney. Came up they all stood in a dark place, where the shops were shut up, just above the Penitentiary, on Pentonville Hill—Mr. Gurney passed into the road, and immediately he did so Ennis walked after him and hit him behind the head which made him stagger-Saunders ran up to him, caught him by the shoulder and put his leg between prosecutor's legs and threw him in the road, King ran up, felt him all round and put his hand into his right hand trousers pocket—I ran to his assistance-Saunders had hold of him—I took King into custody—when I had got him a few yards across the road he turned round and said "If I had known it was you, Mr. Gurney, we would not have done it."</p>

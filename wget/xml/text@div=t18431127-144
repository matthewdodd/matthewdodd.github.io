                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Pugh, a tailor, in Marylebone-lane. On the afternoon of the 10th of Nov. I put a half-crown and shilling into my work-box on the table—I had a sixpence on the mantel-piece—I took particular notice of the sixpence in the morning, when I received it from the butcher—I left the room—the prisoner lodged in the next room, but had no business in my room—after I left my-room I heard the door shut, and a person go down and shut the street-door—I did not see who it was—there was no other person up stairs in the house except the prisoner—I went up to my room about five minutes after for the sixpence, and it was gone—I missed the half-crown and shilling from the box—I had pot them there about ten minutes, and when the prisoner came home in the evening I ac<lb></lb>cused her—she said I might as well accuse a child as her—I said I would get a policeman, and she said I might—I then got one.</p>

On Wednesday evening the 6th of February I heard an alarm in Hand-court; I went out of my door and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner; he said he had seen him drop something - we went, and found this handkerchief at the step of the door, which the prosecutor claims. Here are the other four handkerchiefs which were found in his hat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. I was not drunk, I was sober enough to know what I did. She lodged up two air of stairs; she ran up for a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you run out?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. I did not know the way out: it was a back room, and it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done after she brought a candle?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. She pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What upon the floor?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. No, upon the bed. Then I called for help, and she called for help, and we had a struggle for the watch. I cried out, murder. She called for her husband and others to come and help her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. No. When I called out, she put her apron into my mouth, and held a knife over my throat. I put my arm up in order to save it, then she slid the watch and 5 s. in money from the same pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing all this while?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. I was lying on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this about?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. This was about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that house in the whole?</p>
               <p>Bramstead. About eight minutes. She brought a candle, and gave me several blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call the watch?</p>

            . After the prisoner had been away 3 or 4 days, she came to me one night, (I am a watchman) to light a candle; I charged her with using a man ill: she said tell the man it is in pawn, and if he will take it out, he shall have it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the owner's name?</p>
               <p>Rimington. She told me his name was Bramstead.</p>
               <p>Sebrough Carney. I live in the same house where the prisoner does, she came up to me and asked for a bit of candle; I would not let her have any, she snatched one out of the candlestick, and took part of it. I heard the gentleman cry out murder, and said do not murder me, give me the watch, it is not my own; the next day she said it was in Blue Anchor yard, Rosemary-lane, that she had pawned it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rimington. I lodge in the same house with the prisoner, my husband was not at home that night: there are several other lodgers, men and women, in the same house. I heard the man cry murder, murder, he was robbed, but did not see him: the prisoner quitted her lodgings two days afterwards. I heard her say the old scoundrel should have his watch if he would pay her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I happened to hear a noise at the door, I saw the prosecutor cutting a woman's petticoats off with a knife, and said she had his watch: she got away, then he laid hold of my arm, I was afraid he was going to kill me. I never saw no more of him till he and a thief-taker came, then he said tell me where that woman is that has got my watch, and I will forgive you.</p>

               <p>I know this clock; it is the property of Mr. Leachman; I repaired it for him; the name was Smith, but it has been broke open, and another name has been put on; the name has been taken out, I can discover that very plain; it has been filed out.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a name piece? - Yes, it is.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250088"></xptr>Then it may be another name piece? - No, it is the same.</p>
               <p>(Shown to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. It has been fresh filed no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is what you call a name piece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is easy to put on a new name piece? - Yes; but this is on the same name piece.</p>
               <p>Would it not have been very easy to put a new name piece, with a new name, and in which there would have been no scratching, if any body had wished to have done it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. It was a great while after you was robbed, before you had any intelligence at all of this clock? - Oh, several months.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Athill? - I have known him by sight some time, but did not know what he was, any further than he told me he was a weaver.</p>
               <p>Had Athill occasion to come to your house? - He had.</p>
               <p>Had he been there frequently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How frequently before your house was was broke open had he been there? - Several times for one thing or another, but whether he had been there two or three days before, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was he there frequently after the robbery? - Mrs. Athill has been there since, but I do not remember seeing him since: Mrs. Cockvine used to come there before.</p>
               <p>You never suspected Mr. Athill of stealing your clock? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>You did not know so much of him then, as you do now? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mention the loss of your clock to him? - Never till I went to New Prison; I said I valued the clock more than any thing else; I have said so to Athill no doubt.</p>
               <p>How near did he live to you? - Within a hundred yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>It was impossible for any body within one hundred yards not to know it? - They advised me to advertise it, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Did Athill so advise you? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I delivered this clock to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>How came you by it? - I bought it of the prisoners at the bar; they were all three present when they brought it to my house the latter end of March, or the beginning of April, I cannot be certain, it was in the night time; it was dark I think.</p>
               <p>What part of your house did they come to you? - I have a bell at the chamber window, and I heard it ring, and I went down and opened the street door, and the three prisoners were at the door, and they had this clock with them, and some other things; and they came up to the chamber to me; there was a silver tankard, and some spoons, and a pair of salts, and several other things that I cannot recollect now; they asked me to weigh the silver, and I did, and paid them for it; then they asked me if I would buy the clock; I told them I could not pay them any money for it, because I did not know the value of it; they said they would leave it with me till I did; when they were going away, they desired me to get the things out of the house as soon as I could, for they came from a near neighbour of mine; I asked them who it was, and they said Mr. Leachman; they said they broke into the window-shutter; and Udney said he was obliged to creep over a great deal of lumber in the cellar, and his coat was all over cobwebs; I met Udney three or four days after, and I paid him fifty shillings for the clock, at the White-hart, in Webb-square, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>How long have you known these men? - A good many years.</p>
               <p>All of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Mrs. Cockvine during this time? - She was in the room with me, but not when I paid for the clock.</p>
               <p>Did she sleep in the same room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she up, or in bed? - She was sitting up in the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250089"></xptr>She did not get up then? - No, not at that time.</p>
               <p>You went down and let them in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Jury. Do you know this gentleman? have you seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it was the other Jury; I must ask him a few questions for your information.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Athill. How many trials have you been a witness on this session? - This is the third trial I believe.</p>
               <p>On each of those trials, you told us you was a notorious receiver of stolen goods? - I own I have been very bad, and my Lord knows it.</p>

            ? - I fancy it is.</p>
               <p>Fancy! why do not you know whether it is or no; I could tell him myself, but I am afraid, I am bound to secrecy: you told my friend the other day I believe you had been in trouble? - I did.</p>
               <p>You have been in custody very often? - I have.</p>
               <p>In your youth, you told him you had been very bad indeed; then you got a little better, then became very bad again for the last twelve months? - I own to the Court that I am not a person that has done right.</p>
               <p>Do not you own to the Court that you are a person to whom no sort of credit is due? - I cannot say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>In the course of the last twelve months, how many burglaries have you planned, and recommended.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not a fair question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You gave fifty shillings for this clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The full value? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is it worth less than ten pounds? - I really cannot tell; I do not know the value.</p>
               <p>This little bell at your window, it is to give an alarm in case of fire? - No, it was in case I was wanted.</p>
               <p>Why are you a public officer? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean it as the bell for thieves to ring at, when they have brought stolen goods? - They did ring at it.</p>
               <p>How long had the bell been up? - At that time, about three or four months.</p>
               <p>How far did the prosecutor live from your house? - How far!</p>
               <p>Ay; is it as far as from here to Newgate? that is a distance you know? - A couple of hundred yards.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prosecutor? - Five or six and twenty years; I have been at his house scores of times; I never heard from him that his house was broke open; I heard it talked in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Did you give him his clock again? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>When for the first time did you tell it? - I told it when I was apprehended; I voluntarily delivered it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you discover that cock to save the life of yourself and Mrs. Cockvine? did not you know if it was found in your possession, you were liable to be indicted for the burglary? - I made a discovery as soon as I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you make the discovery for fear of being hanged? - I did not do it to save my own life, nor Mrs. Cockvine's; I did not think of being hanged.</p>
               <p>Had you ever told any body that Leachman's was a good house to do? - No, Sir, upon my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>How lately had you been there before it had been robbed? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was not you there the evening of the day preceding the robbery? - No, Sir, that I was not in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was you not there in the course of the day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Tuesday before? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk about Mr. Leachman's house with Mrs. Cockvine in your life? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say he does not keep his doors fast; it is very likely his house may be robbed? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250090"></xptr>What made you go to Leachman's? - To buy bobbins.</p>
               <p>As you are very much interested in what his Lordship has said to you, did you attend to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear his Lordship observe to you, that no questions that we could put to you, could make you more infamous than your own account of yourself? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>I hope this is the last trial you are to come upon? - I hope so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Athill. I will say to you, in consequence of the last question that was put to you, that I hope it will be the last time, because you never can come as a witness any more, and therefore you must come as a criminal, and if you do, the world cannot save you; therefore remember, let nothing tempt you to do wrong again? - No, my Lord, never.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived with Mr. Athill; I know this clock.</p>
               <p>How came it to Athill's house? - The three prisoners brought it six or seven months ago, as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>By day or by night? - By night.</p>
               <p>How got they in? - They rung a bell at the door, that leads up to the chamber window.</p>
               <p>Whose chamber window? - In the chamber where we lay.</p>
               <p>Who do you mean by we? - Mr. Athill and myself; when they rung the bell, we got up; Mr. Athill went down stairs, and let them in.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did they come in? - They came in at the street door, and came up one pair of stairs where we lay.</p>
               <p>Did you get up? - I did not, I lay still in bed; the prisoners, I cannot say which of them it was, pulled out of his pocket, a silver tankard, and two table spoons, a tea-spoon or two, a pair of salt-cellars, and this clock besides; the plate was bought and paid for, and the clock was not.</p>
               <p>Why was not the clock paid for? - He said he was not a judge of such things, till he shewed it to somebody that was a better judge than himself.</p>
               <p>As it was not paid for, did they leave or take it away with them, till it should be paid for? - No, they left it.</p>
               <p>Was it paid for? - I cannot say, I did not see the clock paid for afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of these men before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - A ll three of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have only one or two questions to ask you; how long have you lived with Athill? - Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>You have known all his dealings exactly? - Yes, I was not present when the money was paid; I heard mention where the clock came from.</p>
               <p>How many clocks had you when he was apprehended? - Only this and a little one in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you for his keeping this? - No reason.</p>
               <p>Did he not tell you it would be convenient to have a piece of evidence against these men to save his life? - No.</p>
               <p>Who christened it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it done at home or abroad? - I believe it was taken out.</p>
               <p>Who performed that operation? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Was this clock at home when he was taken into custody? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - At an acquaintance's.</p>
               <p>Who is that acquaintance? - Why, Sir, he is a good way off from here.</p>
               <p>I do not care where he is, I want to know who he is? - It was at my sister's husband's.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - Down at Shadwell; his name is 
               <persName id="t17861025-38-person549">

            , he never was in trouble an hour.</p>
               <p>It was at her house when you was taken in custody? - It was, I sent for it; I took it home myself from their house, nobody desired me to take it, I took a coach and took it home from my sister's.</p>
               <p>Was it christened before you took it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250091"></xptr> your sisters? - Yes, it was; it had been there three or four months; I had not made a present of it, I gave it her to see if she could find a customer; my sister is dead and buried, she kept a chandler's shop; he is a waterman and lighterman.</p>
               <p>So you thought that a good situation to get a customer for this clock? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long was it at home? - Not a week in all.</p>
               <p>Who told you it would be better it should be found at your house than at any other place? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Athill tell you so? - He did not ever upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did not he mention it till he was in custody? - I do not think he did; I was bailed out because I had two children dying.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the plate? - No, Sir, it was sold; I have been at the prosecutor's house many times for some bobbins when I wanted them.</p>
               <p>How long is it since this house was done, that you and Athill had the conversation about the fastenings? - I never had any conversation about the fastenings, I did not know any thing at all about it's being done, not before the prisoners told me, when they brought the things, that they had done it just before they came; I heard the conversation pass, I recollect it perfectly.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you satisfy the Jury by irreproachable witnesses that you have borne a good character; you cannot be expected to shew where you was at that time, it is too long ago? - I have three people attending here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Great Wild Street—on Saturday night, 26th June, about 7 o'clock, I was at the corner of Gilbert's Passage, facing Portugal Street, and saw two vans coming along Portugal Street; the first ran had four heavy balks of timber on it—I saw five lit<lb></lb>tle children playing on the pavement on the off side of the van, against Messrs. Twining's reading rooms—the width of the pavement there is about three feet six inches—the van was coming down Portugal Street, and turn<lb></lb>ing into Portsmouth Street—that street is sixteen feet wide there, from kerb to kerb—this plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is very near the mark for a rough sketch—the van was driven round the corner at a very sharp trot, it was drawn by two horses; it was a heavy four wheeled van—as it turned the corner the deceased child was on the kerb, and the box of the fore wheel caught her in the buttock, as she stood with her back to that van; she reeled, and was thrown under the hind wheel, which passed over her chest—I was on</p>

               <p>the opposite side of the road—my daughter was with me, she screamed out, and then the van was pulled up, it had gone on about thirty-six yards from where the child was killed; it had passed Mr. Lack's public-house, and the Black Jack, and was right over Mr. Jewel's furniture shop; they are long fronts, it had passed three houses, and the horses' heads were on to the fourth—I did not see the driver—there was nothing in the street to obstruct the driver's view—I did not hear any calling out from the van before the acci<lb></lb>dent happened—the children were playing on the foot pavement—I directly went after a constable, and a man picked up the child—the timbers projected over the front and tail of the van, they were said to be about twenty-six feet long, I should say they projected full eight feet over the tail of the van.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And how much over the front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should sup-pose about the same—I and my daughter had been in Mr. Lack's public-house, we had one pint of beer there—there was no man named Beecham in my company—I don't know him—I came out of the house first, and my daughter followed me—the vans were then proceeding along Portugal Street; I can't say how far from me, I have no idea—I did not see Mr. Lack outside his house till after the occurrence—the driver evidently drew to that side of the road in order to get round with the timber that was in the waggon—it was not necessary for him to do so in order to avoid striking any persons on the other side—I have said that he was obliged to pull his van close 'to the kerb, to get his timber round; that was on account of his being on the off side—I can't say how far the hones' heads were from Mr. Lack's public-house at the time of the accident—I ran to pick up the child; they were not near Mr. Lack's house, I should suppose they were four feet from the pillars of the public-house, they might be more—the front wheel of the van grated the side of the off kerb as it passed—a person standing in Porte-mouth Street could have seen the accident—the children were three or four feet down Portugal Street, they were not in Portsmouth Street—the child was killed in Portugal Street, about three feet from the corner—the acci<lb></lb>dent happened as the van was turning the corner, the back wheel had not turned the corner—the front wheel was quite close to the kerb, the back wheel struck off, it was a very little distance from it, it might have been fifteen or sixteen inches perhaps from the kerb, not more—the van was between me and the child, I did not stoop to see the child, I was leaning with my foot on the spur stone—I do not know a person named Holder (<hi rend="italic">He was here called in</hi>) I saw that man—I did not speak to him about the accident, that I know of—I never saw him till I saw him at Bow Street—I did not say to him, or to anyone, that there was no blame to the driver—I should say I had not come out of the public-house two minutes before the accident happened—the van was going at a fast trot, I am no judge of pace—I have not said it was going seven miles an hour, no such thing, I said, about seven miles, according to my judgment—it did not go slower round the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law-writer, and live at 13, Blewitt's Build-ings—on this Saturday evening I was in Portugal Street, just at the corner, nearly facing the hospital, close to the Temperance coffee-shop—I then beard the rattle of wheels, and the van came along—the box of the fore wheel struck the child, and nearly turned it on one side—she reeled, and fell off the pavement, and the hind wheel went over her—I made a spring, but before I could catch hold of the child she was under the wheel—I was about a yard from her—it was so sudden that I did not take any</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4 A, Clayland's Road, Peckham Road—I was in Portugal Street on this morning, in front of King's College Hospital, with a friend—the two vans passed us—the front van was laden with timber—it was proceeding towards Portsmouth Street, at a rate of not less than seven miles an hour, and I am confident I am under the mark—I was about 200 yards from where the accident occurred—I kept my eye on the van until it vanished round the corner—I did not observe any diminution in the rate of speed—I did not actually see the child run over, but imme<lb></lb>diately after the van had gone round the corner, I saw the last witness with the child in his arms, running across with it to the hospital—I went on into Portsmouth Street, and assisted in detaining the horses—the driver had left the box and gone to the hospital, and the van was in charge of a boy.</p>

I am a law stationer, and live at 28, Cursitor Street—I was in company with the last witness—my attention was attracted by the rate at which the vans passed, which induced me to make a remark to my friend—the rate of speed was not slackened—I did not see the accident myself—I saw the child lying in the gutter afterwards—I should say the van passed at the rate of seven miles an hour—I have often rode in vehicles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you say what part of the child was run over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The upper part of the back, across the chest—there was no appearance of its having been crushed against the kerb—there were no bruises on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, at 5, Gilbert's Passage—I was looking out of my first-floor window on the night in question, and saw the van coming up Portugal Street, with timber on it; as it came to the corner it slackened its pace—I should think it could not turn the corner with the timber it had got at more than three miles an hour—I do not know the prisoner—I saw nothing of the accident—I kept my eye on the van till it had got out of Portugal Street—there was no child run over in Portugal Street.</p>

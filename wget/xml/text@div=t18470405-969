                  </hi> Our clock come from France, in wooden cases—I instructed the prisoner to sell certain cases at the latter end of Jan.—he stated he had sold them to Mr. Leek, the case-maker, but he could not get the money—that Mr. leek had not paid him—I sent him for it more than once—he said he could not get it—that he could not see Mr. Leek—he al<lb></lb>ways made excuses.</p>

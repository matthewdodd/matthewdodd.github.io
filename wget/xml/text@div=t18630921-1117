I am a stockbroker, of 2, Copthall-chambers, City—on 3d July John Calder called upon me with certain accepted letters of allotment in the Scinde Railway—these are four of them; there was a fifth for seventy-two shares, signed by Elizabeth Phillips—he also produced this portion of a letter—after some conversation with Calder, I went to Mr. Austin, and had a dealing with him for the shares that same day—I sold him the forty-three shares at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium—the whole were sold; if the result of the inquiries as to the seventy-two proved satisfactory; the tran<lb></lb>saction with regard to the forty-three was completed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the sale note which I gave Calder for those shares—it is my writing—as I went from my office that afternoon I saw the prisoner Jestico in the street, about two minutes' walk from my office—I had known him before when I was a clerk in the Post Office—at that time he was a letter-carrier in the same office—I spoke to him, and asked if he was in the habit of delivering letters at Messrs. Frestone's office—I can't say whether the prisoner was then in the employment of the Post Office; he had not the uniform on—Messrs. Frestone are solicitors in Coleman-street, to whom Calder had referred me when he brought the shares to me—Jestico was standing on the opposite side to Messrs. Frestone's—I asked him if he thought they were respectable persons—he said he thought they were—I think he told me he had left the service of the Post Office—I returned to my office, and found Mr. Frestone there—I gave the sold note to Calder, together with the cheque—this note represents the whole, the forty-three and the seventy-two also—I gave the acceptance letters for the seventy-two to Mr. Frestone in Calder's presence for inquiries to be made—I did not have any transaction with regard to the seventy-two on the following day—I was standing outside Guildhall when the prisoner was brought there in custody by Hancock in a cab—he came up to me and said, "Mr. Bennett, if I had known these things were going to be brought to you, I would not have done it for double the money"—he said nothing more—I turned away.</p>

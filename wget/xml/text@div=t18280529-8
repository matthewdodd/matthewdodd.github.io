The prisoner was in my employ for about five months; I received an excellent character with him. On the 17th of April I went to Mr. Woodruff's, in Cow-cross, to order some copper; Mrs. Woodruff brought me a piece of tube cutting, which I thought was mine, but it had no particular mark; I took it home, and compared it with my tubes - it corresponded with them; I never gave anybody authority to dispose of it; they were pieces which I sold to chance customers, to cut into ferrels; I never sold any to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Woodruff, a brass-founder and finisher of Cow-cross-street; we buy brass to melt and work up. On the 29th of March I bought 1 1/2lb. of brass tube cuttings of the prisoner, at 6d. per lb.; I bought 5 lbs. more of him on the 1st or 2d of April, at the same price; I did not know he was Mr. Stanton's servant, but on the Saturday following he brought me a bill of 19s. 10d. which I owed Mr. Stanton - my daughter paid the bill; I afterwards showed Mr. Stanton a piece of tube, which I bought of the prisoner - it weighed about 1 oz. - I cannot swear it is part of what he sold, for my daughter bought it of him, and she is not here.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. Joseph Woodfield Dyer, a cheese-monger, in Middleton-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner was employed to give out trade bills and cards—he had been employed for six days—I supplied him with trade bills and cards to distribute about the neighbourhood—I sup<lb></lb>plied him with some on the 8th of Dec.—I afterwards went to the police-court, and saw two bundles of the same bills and cards as I had given to the prisoner.</p>

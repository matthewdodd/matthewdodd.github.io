               <p>Q. On the 10th of June, were you employed in loading a waggon - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of William Griffin - A. I did; he was master of the proof-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you set out had you any directions with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160050"></xptr> regard to that waggon - A. I had. Griffin desired me to leave a box, directed to Mr. Vizer, Chamber-street, Whitechapel, at any public house on Tower-hill, till called for. I left the box at Mr. Finch's public house, the sign of the George, Tower-hill; and I left word that it was to be left till called for.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of June, did you learn any thing afterwards - A. I understood the box was not delivered. I went to the George, on Tower-hill; and on Monday the 13th, when I came to the George, I found the box in the street, at the door of the George; two men were heaving it on another man's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Vizer there - A. Yes; he was in the tap-room. I asked him if his name was Vizer, he said it was; I told him I came from Griffin concerning a box which I left on the 10th of June, which was not delivered to him. He told he me, had got the box now; it was all right. I went away then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the box which was heaving upon a man's shoulder, was it the same box that Griffin had desired you to take to town to Vizer - A. It was. No doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Woolley left a box at your house on Monday the 10th of June, directed to Mr. Vizer, Chamber-street, Whitechapel - A. It came in on Wednesday. On Friday I sent a man to Chamber-street, to let the man know the box was there. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards, on the Friday, I saw the prisoner; I shewed him the box; he acknowledged it was directed to him; he said he had got no advice of it. Then, on the Saturday evening, a person of the name of Griffin came, and called for a plot of ale. On the Monday following, about a quarter after ten, the prisoner called again with a letter. I delivered him the box in consequence of the letter. I delivered it to Vizer, and the soldier he got to carry it.</p>

When I went into Mr. Vizer's room, I told him I wanted him, and I asked him where the box was that he had from Tower-hill, with the gun-barrels? he put his head out of the door into the passage and said, there they are in the yard. I asked him if he dealt in them? and what he had given for them? he said he had not bought them. Miller and a gentleman came; they took him in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. STOKES. Q. You belong to the ordnance. Are them gun-barrels the property of the ordnance - A They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the ordnance sell rejected barrels - A. Not unless they sell them at public sales. These are not rejected; they are good barrels.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Griffin - A. Yes; he had been master of the proof-house about eight months. These barrels are the property of the king; they are worth 5 s. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, on the 13th of June I received a letter from Mr. Finch, stating, that a box was left at his house, supposed to contain some gun-barrels. I said to the person that brought the letter, that I had not ordered any of any body, not had I received any advice. I said the same to Mr. Finch as I did to the messenger. I received a letter from Griffin, saying, that he had sent thirty-seven gun-barrels; he would call on the Saturday night to know if I would have them. He did call. I told him, no; I did not want them. I saw no more of Griffin. After Griffin left my house, my wife informed me, that when I went out to be shaved he returned, and wished me to fetch the box, as Mr. Finch wanted it out of the way. I went, and had the box pitched in my yard. The letter I received from Griffin, I gave to the officer as a proof of their being sent not to my order.</p>
               <p>COOMBES. This is the letter the prisoner gave me voluntarily. The letter read:</p>
               <p>="Sir, you may receive a box, containing seventeen India muskets, and plenty of short ones, by going to the George, Tower-hill; and if you do not want them send me word; if you do not send to me I shall call on the Saturday night. I am, sir. Direct, to Wm. Griffin, Proof-house master, Lewisham. Addressed to Mr. Vizer, Chamber-street, Whitechapel.="</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

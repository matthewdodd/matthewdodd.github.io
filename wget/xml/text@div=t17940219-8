               <p>Q. When did you miss any of the things? - The next morning at nine o'clock; I sent my daughter up into the room, and she came down crying, and told me, and I went up stairs immediately myself, and I found all the articles missing mentioned in the indictment, every thing that is there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - Not till the latter end of the next week, I cannot recollect the day; I made application to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time the prisoner went out in the morning? - I cannot say I do, but there is a young man present does.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that took the lodgings? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time that you saw him? - He said nothing at the public house, but only denied me before the alderman that he never see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any thing of your things since? - No more of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her is she has any other lodgers in her house? - Yes, there is one of them here, there is a woman, and a man, and a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to ask her if any of these lodgers can go out in the morning without being discovered by the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she has not an inscription in her window with lodgings wrote on it for single men, and whether when I came to her house she asked where I live, and whether she went to enquire after my character? - Yes, I did; he told me that he served his time at Mr. Goldings, in Aldersgate-street, and he came with the shavings hanging about his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me take any property out of the house? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. The prosecutor applied to me, and said she had been robbed, about the 20th, and asked me if I knew the prisoner at the bar? I told her I believed I did, and that I thought I could find the person, (it was Monday morning) I looked about for the prisoner for a few days, I heard of him, and went and broke into his room, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - In his lodging room in Grub-street, he said he knew nothing at all about it; I took him to a public house and there were a ten or a dozen people, the woman and child come, and both said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman owns that her house was a common lodging house, I think it is a very unlikely story that that man saw me in the room and yet he can give no description of me. As the lodgers can get out of themselves at what time of the morning they please, they may take the things themselves. I am really innocent.</p>

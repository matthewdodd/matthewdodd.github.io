               <p>Row, Bermondsey—in the month of March the prisoner called on me with samples of flour, and five sack were afterwards brought by a carman—I afterwards received this invoice, of five sacks supplied by Mr. Jonas—after the flour had been delivered about an hour, the prisoner called—I asked him if he had come for the money for the flour—he said he would be obliged to me if I could pay him part of the money that morning, as he was short of cash—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him a piece of paper, and he wrote a receipt—he said he would call on Monday <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the remainder, and give me a proper receipt—he called and receipted the bill, and I paid him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance; the first receipt was then torn up—he called while they were delivering the flour, and asked how it suited—I said they were just fetching it in, and we had not tried it—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount—I did not know, at that time, whether he was principal or agent—he called about a week after I paid him the money, and asked if we wanted any more flour—I said "No"—he then said he had not paid in the money, and if anyone should call from the office, not to take any notice—he gave no reason for that.</p>

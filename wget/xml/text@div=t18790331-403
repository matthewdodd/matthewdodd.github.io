                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 338, Portobello Road, Notting Hill—on the night of 16th February I closed my house and went to bed about 10.30—about 12.30 I was called up by the police, and I found the shop shutters open and some suet and beef gone—the meat was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards identified it—the meat produced at the police-court was the same—it had a ticket on it—the meat was the fat ends of breasts of mutton.</p>

From information received I went, to the prosecutor's shop on the night of the 16th of February, and found the shutters rolled up and some meat lying on the pavement—I awoke Mr. Hughes, and then went to Swansbrook Road and saw Walsh about 4 yards away carrying a bundle which contained meat—in consequence of what he said I went to Pond's house, 46, Goldburn Road, and found him in bed—I said, "Get up, I want you for being concerned in stealing meat from Mr. Hughes's shop"—he said nothing—on the way to the station he said, "I know nothing about it; I was with him in the Eagle public-house last night, I know no more"—I took him to the station—I brought Walsh out of the cell and Walsh said, "That is the man"—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier—I was in the Porto<lb></lb>bello Road on this Sunday night, outside Mr. Hughes's shop, and saw two men there—I identified Pond at the police-court, and am sure he is one of them—he had his body half way in the butcher's shop—they are patent shutters, and were partly open—the other man when he saw me said, "Look out! you d—fool, here comes the postman, we shall get nicked"—I ran round to Ladbroke Grove Road to give the information to Harlow—I am quite sure Pond is the man who had his body half way in the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave my evidence on the remand—I could see Pond's face from the light of the lamp when he came out from the window and ran past me—when the other man made the observation he pulled himself out and ran away.</p>

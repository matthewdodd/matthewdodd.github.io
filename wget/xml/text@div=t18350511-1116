                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hampton Common. On the 16th of April I was at Old Brentford, and saw the prisoner—I never saw him before—I am positive of him—I first saw him about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, in the Britannia beer-shop—I was drinking there, and he sat by the side of me—I left the beer-shop between seven and eight o'clock, and was going home—it is five or six miles from my house—I saw the prisoner soon afterwards in Old Brentford, which I be<lb></lb>lieve is in the parish of Ealing, it it in Middlesex—he came by me and attempted to take my basket out of my hand—it was a very few minutes after I had left the house—he endeavoured to take the basket out of my hand, but could not—he then turned round and took me suddenly by the shoul<lb></lb>der, put me against the pales, and took it away—he pushed me down tight against the pales, and then forced it from me—he squeezed me against the pales and took it from me—it contained a waistcoat and hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I had these things at the Britannia, and he saw me there—they were my own property—I had been at the beer-shop about two hours—I cannot exactly say how much I had drank—I had had one pint of beer on the road before I went there—I was not tipsy—I was quite sober, for I ran after him, but he got away—I cannot say I was perfectly sober, but I knew what I was about—I did not see him again till last Friday—I have not seen my basket or property since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, and know the pri<lb></lb>soner; he lives a few doors from me. On Thursday evening, the 16th of April, the day before Good Friday, I had been to town, and on coming back I me thim about eight o'clock—he was near the prosecutor, between King's, the brokers, and King's, the green-grocer's shop—I saw him push the pro<lb></lb>secutor against the pales, and take the basket from him—he pulled it from him and threw it to another person on the opposite side of the way—I am certain it was the prisoner—the witness Hughes was going by at the same time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford. On the day before Good Friday I saw the prosecutor—I did not know him before, he had a parcel in his hand—I do not know whether it was a basket—I saw a man take it out of his hand and run off with it, the prosecutor ran after him—I did not know the man at the moment, but I knew him before—it was the prisoner—I believe him to be the man—I knew him before very well, but did not know him at the moment.</p>

Q.</hi> Who were you in company with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was alone—I was not in Tunstall's company, and never said so—I was on the left-hand side, on Mr. King's side, near the pales, about three or four yards from you, nearly in the middle of the road—I saw you push him and take the parcel out of his arms and run off with it—I did not see you push him—you ran towards New Brentford, and the prosecutor ran after you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure it was me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have very much the appearance of the man—you had light trowsers on, and a sleeve waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was drinking in the Britannia, with a man who told me I could get work at Drayton—between two and three o'clock the prosecutor came in and called for a pint of ale—he asked a young woman to drink with him—he then had bread and cheese and more ale, then a pot of ale—he changed half a sovereign—the landlord brought him in the change—he sat there, having pot after pot, till between seven and eight o'clock, and then called for another pot—he was stupidly drunk—he sat on the seat, and then on the ground—he had not money to pay for the last ale, and it was taken back—I went home to get some clean things, and then returned to the Britannia—I was running towards Drayton, and he was reeling about—he reeled against me as I was going by, and went back against the pales—I went into the road, and kept on my journey—when I got about twenty yards, I heard him call, "Stop thief," and, "Murder,"</p>

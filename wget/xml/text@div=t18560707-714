                  </hi>. I am the leading man of the joiners in Woolwich Dockyard. On Sunday evening, 15th June, I was coming from the station at North Woolwich, intending to proceed across to the other Woolwich—I was standing on the barge or dummy—my daughter was there—she had just landed with some more friends—there was a crowd of persons on the dummy—I felt myself shoved against from behind—I turned round, and was confronted with the prisoner Smith—I put my hand round, thinking my handkerchief was gone, and 1 said, rather angrily, "Where are you shoring? there is plenty of room"—he made no answer—I turned again to speak to a little boy, and I felt a second pressure—I was still keeping my hand in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pocket, on my handkerchief, and turning to pat the little boy's hat right—I felt another pressure on the same side, the right side—I turned immediately, and heard my daughter <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out—I had a watch in my right hand waistcoat pocket, attached to a short gold guard chain, which was through a button hole—my daughter said, "What is that man doing? he has taken your watch"—I looked, and found my chain hanging, and my watch was gone, and Smith also—I recognized him so well that I know him again—he was with another person, not with the other prisoner—I did not see Smith after the first pressure—I ran as fast as I could to the policeman at the railway station door, which might be 100 yards from the dummy—I saw Smith again in two minutes afterwards, when the policeman was coming out of the Pavilion tavern, with both the prisoners in custody—I said, "That is the one that took my watch;" a crowd collected, and it was neces<lb></lb>sary to put the prisoners in the place where they take the tickets—the constable left them there with me, while he went to the superintendent—Smith said, "Let us go"—I said, "I will see you hanged first"—I said I should very ill spare the time to prosecute, but I certainly should do it—Smith said, "You have got your watch," or "You will get your watch, what more do you want?"—Garrett said, "You did not see me there"—this is my watch, and the one I lost—here is the swivel attached to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of the last witness—I was with him on Sunday night, 15th June—I was on the dummy at Woolwich—I saw the prisoner Smith and another who is not here—I did not see Garrett at first, I saw Smith take his hand away from my father's right hand waistcoat Packet, with his watch—I saw the watch—the chain dropped directly, it did not leave his waistcoat, it hung down—I called my father's attention to to, and Smith ran over my instep, and hurt it very much—he was quite close to me—I said to my father, "Your watch is gone; run, and you will catch that man"—we both ran, and I saw Smith pass his hand to Garrett,</p>

               <p>who was standing there, and Garrett looked round and they both ran—that was in the middle of the brow—I could not see what Smith handed to Garrett, but I saw both their hands together, and they ran right up the brow—I could not run so fast—they ran in a direction towards the Pavilion—I went with my father to the policeman—I saw the prisoners in custody afterwards—I have no doubt about these being the two men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were a great many other persons there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing on the right side of my father, near the steamboat—I was rather before him, I had just come across and landed, and my father was waiting to come back home—I was facing my father where the persons were coming out—I have said before that I saw Smith take my father's watch—I am quite sure I did—Smith was two yards off when I saw Garrett—they were in the middle of the brow when I saw them-at the time my ankle was trodden on I did not stoop down—I said, "Oh, my foot," and I turned to my father—I saw Smith at that time, he had got about a dozen yards off—there was no one between me and Smith.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see Garrett till he had got half way up the brow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Garrett was like standing, and when Smith got to him, he looked round and they both ran off—I did not see Garrett on the dummy at all.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This witness's deposition wets here put in and read, in which she stated</hi>: "I observed the two prisoners standing near my father on the barge, and there were three or four other persons with them—I noticed the chain of my father's watch hanging down—I called his attention to it, and I observed the two prisoners running up the brow—my father went after them—the prisoner Smith appeared to put something into the hand of the other prisoner—I remember seeing Smith put his hand towards my father's waistcoat, which drew my attention.")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not state before the Magistrate that you saw Smith take the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I am sure I told the Magistrate that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how came you to sign this as being right, when it is here said "I saw the two prisoners standing near my father?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner Smith and another one were there, but not the other prisoner—this depo-sition leaves out about my seeing the watch, but I did see the watch—I never was a witness before—I am twenty-seven years of age—I am married, and have two children—the last witness is my father-in-law.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, Eastern Counties Railway</hi> 3) I was on duty at North Woolwich that night—there is what is called a dummy or a long barge, on which the passengers come from the steamer—there is a brow about 100 yards long, which comes from the shore on to the dummy—the passengers wait a good deal on the brow—I sayr the two prisoners, they both went on the brow—I was standing at the station door and Mr. Hall came to me and said he had lost his watch—the moment he spoke to me I saw both the prisoners at the Pavilion tavern door, I followed them in and saw Smith standing at the bar—I passed him, and saw Garrett, at the farther end of the passage, put something down—he was coming away—I took him back to the spot, and found this watch—I took Garrett in custody, and took Smith at the bar—I showed them the watch and said "This is what I want you for"—Smith said, "I am a stranger to this man,"</p>

            . I was at the counting-house on Sunday, the 23d - the safe was perfectly secure at four o'clock that afternoon - the doors and windows also; on the Monday morning, between six and seven o'clock, both the windows were found open, the cash drawer wrenched open, and the money taken out - the prisoner has improved in his dress lately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time do the men generally come to work there? A. About six o'clock; there was a great many men employed there.</p>

            . I am a veterinary surgeon. I was on Mr. Young's premises about six o'clock that Sunday night, I think, to order my horse and gig - I am almost certain of it; I saw the prisoner close by the counting-house window- I am certain he is the man; he had a cloak on, which I took to be the porter's - I knew the porter; I thought he was shuffling or wrapping the cloak about him.</p>


               <p>Q. This was in open day-light? A. Yes - it is a public place; there are not many men employed there on Sundays - I live opposite, and go in so often that I cannot tell what I went for.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there a place for the public to go through? A. No - it is not a public passage - the window looks into the yard.</p>

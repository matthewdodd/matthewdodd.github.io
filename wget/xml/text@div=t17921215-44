             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of November, (Saturday) about twelve o'clock, I was coming with one Luckney, a professor of the same employ, an utterer of bad money, I met the prisoner at the top of Long-lane, by Aldersgate-street, we went into a public house, called the Six Canns, in Barbican, all three, and had something to drink; then the prisoner said to me, I want to speak to you on business to-morrow, because I can put something in your way, that will be of service to you. I met him, by appointment at the sign of the Cart and Horses, in Sutton-street, in Goswell-street, on Sunday morning, at ten o'clock; I went there first, and waited about an hour. I was sitting at that time in the tap room; when he came, I believe, he spoke first; he said, he expected two sellers that were coming with some money, who was to meet him there; they did not come; I went out of the house with him, and we went down to Long-lane, about three quarters of a mile from the place, in Sutton-street; we went to the Bell; there he shewed me some bad money in a paper, that they had brought to him; I suppose there might be 40 or 50 s. most of them six-pences; he then took me up to Goswell street, almost by the turnpike, and said, they must go through the pot again, for they have been rubbed. That parcel of money was delivered to him in the lane, in a little court that goes into the square, in <placeName id="t17921215-44-crimeloc258">Long-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then you received this money of this man. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where else with him. - I went with him to a house in Fashion-street, Spitalfields; there was a public house in a Short street, that we went in before, but the house that I bought the money at was at <placeName id="t17921215-44-crimeloc259">the Queen's head, in Fashion-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else there? - There was a man in a sailor's habit; I bought of him there, in that house, sixpences and 3 shillings, bad money, for 5 good shilling. Mr. Croker has got it. This was on Sunday evening, about five o'clock, that I bought it; he asked 5 s. for these 18 bad sixpences and 3 shillings, and I gave it him. I went and delivered them to Croker, at the Feathers, in Hart-street, Covent garden, about seven o'clock on the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you kept this money separate? - I had wrapt it up in two or three papers, that it should not get lose in my pocket. When he was apprehended on the Tuesday following, he was then to meet me again in Church-street, in the Strand; I went there, and Croker with me and another officer, he was in the path, at first, and Croker and Davis followed a distance; he went out to the coach way, to bring a bit of comb out of the coach wheel to do them, because they were too bright what he had got.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Worsdale do me the favour to look at these gentlemen across; where do you live? - No. 13, Charles-street, Tottenham-court-road; I have lived there ever since I came down from Little Heath turnpike, in the neighbourhood of Mims, between Brent and Hatfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the toll collector to a turnpike? Pray are you the same gentleman that we have had so many complaints about bad money at Battle-bridge? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150080"></xptr>Q. I will take down that answer. - I never staid there but three weeks in my life, and that was about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I pass through that turnpike, at least, once a week, and I recollect you. How long was it since you was dismissed from Battle-bridge turnpike? - About three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. For being too honest, I take it for granted? - I went from there to 
Isleworth.</p>


               <p>Q. What might you be dismissed from Battle-bridge turnpike for? - Because I could not get money enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at Isleworth? - Seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. You left that, because you could not get money enough, I take it for granted? - I lost the use of two of my fingers; then I was out of employ for sometime, and went to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a landsman again? - Pretty near a year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Got into any other toll-gate since? - I collected the City street toll, and after that, I went down to Little Heath turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. Is 5 s. the common price for 18 sixpences and 3 s? - I don't know the common price, for some gives more and some gives less.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't know, whether you know, you are liable to be prosecuted as well for buying as for selling. Did you ever buy any before or since? - I have, I will not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you cannot tell the market-price? - They differ.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how many are you in the course of this day to try to convict single handed? - There are two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray now, Mr. Worsdale, what is the reward for this dealing? - I know not any, nor do I require any.</p>
               <p>Q. You do it all for the good of the public? - I do, it is never too late to mend.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, one question more; Have you not been discharged as the collector to the Sunday toll at Battle-bridge, because you was wonderous utterer of bad money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. No! Now, remember, Mr. Worsdale, that once a week, at least, I have taken bad six pences at that gate. Upon your oath. Has there never been a complaint against you for giving bad sixpences at the turnpike gate? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never heard of such a complaint? - There might be.</p>
               <p>Q. I would not hurry you; for the world's sake, take your own time, only tell me, on your oath? - I never heard of such a complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - If it had been made, there is not a doubt, but it would have been just.</p>

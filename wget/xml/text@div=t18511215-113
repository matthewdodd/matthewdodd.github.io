                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 39, Middlegrove-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. On Wednesday, 19th Nov., the female prisoner came and took a parlour on the ground-floor—I asked her how many she had in family, and she told me she had one baby at the breast. On Saturday, 22nd, she came and took possession of the room; she brought the baby with her—I did not see the male prisoner till the Sunday, and I there saw another little girl at the window—I first saw the deceased child on the Tuesday evening; I believe her name was Bridget—I heard the prisoners call her so—she appeared about a year and nine months old—the female prisoner came home intoxicated that evening—I followed her into the room, and saw the deceased in the room with her head in a basket, and her feet on the bed; she had nothing on but a dirty night-gown with short sleeves—I took the child up, went to the mother, and asked whose the child was—she did not answer me till the third time of asking, when she said it was her child, and she was the mother of three—the child seemed very languid through neglect and want, it appeared nothing but skin and bone; its little back was like feeling a piece of wood; it was very dirty, and looked as if it had not been washed for a full week—I asked her if she would allow me to take the children down-stairs and warm them—she said I might, and I took Mary Jane and Bridget down to the fire; there was but little fire in her room—I gave Mary Jane her tea, and gave Bridget some sop, which she ate ravenously—the male prisoner came home some little time after—I opened the door for him; I invited him down-stairs, and showed him the state the child was in, my husband told him it was starved, and I told him it would be a charity to take it to the workhouse—I asked him to go up and make his fire, and get his wife to bed, and take the children up-stairs—shortly after he went up-stairs, and I directly heard some quarrel<lb></lb>ling and screams of murder from the female—I went up; there was no light there, my husband carried one up—I asked the male prisoner if he had got any candle, he asked his wife if she had any candles—I do not think she made any answer, but I cannot be positive—the children were down-stairs at that time—he asked his wife for some money, and she gave him her purse; there was 61/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two halfpence in it—I fetched a candle with a halfpenny, and then left them—I heard them quarrelling again several times—I took the child Bridget up-stairs, and gave it to the father, and the other child went up with me afterwards—shortly after, the mother left the room, and said she should not return that night—I begged her to stay at home with her husband and children—she refused to do so—she went out and took the baby, and I saw no more of her till next morning, when she came in from nine to ten o'clock—her husband went out shortly after her, I opened the door to him when he came back—he had a piece of paper in his hand, with apparently a piece of meat in it—I do not know what he did with it—I went to the room in the morning to inquire how she was, and asked her if she would quit the room as that day, and I would give her the week's rent, as I</p>

               <p>was so annoyed by the nuisance—she turned round and looked at the chil<lb></lb>dren, and said she wished they were all dead, and she would not be with her husband one hour—I did not go into their room on the Thursday—the mother was out the <hi rend="italic">biggest</hi> part of the day on the Thursday, and I saw nothing of her; but in the evening I heard them jangling together as usual—on the Friday night I went and complained about the door being so con<lb></lb>stantly open, and said I hoped they would quit to-morrow—the woman said she would not quit that week; the man said I was not aware of the trouble they were in, and the female then told me that the two children were dead—I then went into the room, and saw the child Bridget dead, and laid out upon the table with a small chemise on—it had a black bruise from its hip down its leg—I asked what was the cause of it, and the father said it was a death-blow—the mother pointed to the little girl, and said, she was in hopes she should have buried that before the other one had died—she did not express particular regret at their deaths.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">William Murphy.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann Murphy</hi>. This child was six weeks ill; all the three children were afflicted with hooping-cough and measles. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never heard them cough—I do not recollect its being stated that they had hooping-cough—the came in on Tuesday night quite intoxicated—she told me that the children were both ill, and under the care of the doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper. The male prisoner was in my employ for the last five weeks, up to the time of his being given into custody—for the first four weeks he earned, on an average, 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and for the last week only 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he was out drinking—I only know that from what my men say—he might have had work, but he neglected it—he might have earned as much as he had done on former weeks if he had pleased—I pay my men by the piece—he could earn 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with ease, more if he pleased—he had been in my service several times before, and I have generally been obliged to discharge him through his intemperate habits—he is a very good workman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. TRIPE</hi>. I am a surgeon and physician, and live at 7, King's-place, Commercial-road. On Monday, 24th Nov., a child, who I believe to have been the deceased, was brought to my house, in arms, by the female prisoner—it had bronchitis—I prescribed for it—I saw it after death, on Sunday evening, 30th Nov., having been fetched to it by sergeant Kelly—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on Monday morning, 1st Dec—I found the child exceedingly emaciated and dirty—the dirt was quite <hi rend="italic">grimed</hi> in at the poll of the neck—I believe it had been washed since its death, but it could not be washed out—I found the vessels of the scalp slightly congested—on opening the head I found the vessels of the brain also slightly congested, and a small quantity of watery fluid in the ventricles—the air-cells of the lungs were considerably dilated—I have often seen them very much more so, but they were decidedly enlarged; the lungs were otherwise healthy—the state of the lungs was caused by hooping-cough—the liver was healthy, the stomach pale and empty, the intestines small, pale, and almost empty, con<lb></lb>taining only a small quantity of dark-coloured fluid—in my opinion the child would not have died at the time it did, had it had proper nourishment, or food—whether the hooping-cough would in the end have destroyed it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150056"></xptr>
               <p>or not I cannot say, but there were certainly not sufficient morbid appear<lb></lb>ances about the child to have accounted for death of themselves—I should say it had certainly not had any solid food for thirty-six hours before its death—I judge of that, from not finding any solid matter in the intestines; it would take that time to pass solid food through the system, unless there was any diarrhoea existing—I am ignorant whether there was diarrhoea or not—there was much less flesh upon the person than there ought to have been in a child of that age—I believe the water in the brain arose from a want of a proper quantity of blood, still the hooping-cough might have caused it, I cannot swear which it was—the child was labouring under dilatation of the air-cells, which shows that it was either then or had recently been labouring under hooping-cough—I did not hear it cough—it is clear it must have had hooping-cough for some little time—I have no doubt the whole appearances were caused by hooping-cough and want of food combined—I believe she died from those causes combined; want of food alone could not have caused the dilatation of the air-cells, or other appearances—the child was not suf<lb></lb>ficently emaciated to account for death from starvation alone—I should say the hooping-cough could not have gone off for a very long time, or the dilatation of the air-cells would have diminished; it must have been comparatively recent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does hooping-cough prevent a child from having much appe<lb></lb>tite? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, but not generally; it is rather the reverse sometimes, because a child usually vomits its food with each attack of the cough, and therefore, as a rule, takes more food to make up for the quantity vomited—I do not think there would have been such a complete absence of food in the intestines if the child had had food given it, and had vomited it up again, and then been re-supplied with food—I think there must have been a greater or less absence of the administration of food after the vomiting, but not sufficient to kill by starvation alone—it would have been more emaciated if it had died of mere starvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Murphy's Defence.</hi> On the Saturday night previous to this I gave my wife 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—worth of tea and sugar I brought in to save her going out again—on the Monday evening I left her 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by her own account—I came home on the Monday night, and on the Tuesday night she was drunk—I did not like that, and we got into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I went for a pound of steak, and gave the children their supper, and put them to bed, and got to bed myself—I said to her, "You had better go out of this place before we have any more <hi rend="italic">row</hi>;" so she went—I went out in the morning, and did not come home till about 6 o'clock, or half-past; the children were in bed every time I came in, and when I have gone out in the morning I have left them in bed; they generally had breakfast alongside of me, I made toast expressly for them; I have done my duty by the children, if it was the want of money that killed the children it is not my fault, I gave it to her; on my word and con<lb></lb>science I am speaking the truth, and there she is to contradict me if she likes.</p>

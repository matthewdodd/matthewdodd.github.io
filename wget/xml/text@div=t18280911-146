            . I am a hosier, and live in Gracechurch-street. On the 12th of August, the prisoner came and asked to see a pair of good cotton stockings - I shewed him some at 3s. - they were too dear; I shewed him two more pairs - he chose one, and threw down a 5s. piece; the sound was very fair, but on looking at it, I said "Have you got any more of these;" he said No; I said "You know this is bad; how long have you been in the habit of passing bad money;" he said he did not know it was bad; I asked where he lived - he mumbled some street, in Old-street; I questioned him - he said he had no more about him - that he was a costermonger, and that he got the money from a brother costermonger in change;" I said "What! did your change amount to, 5s."- he said No - I sent for an officer, who found nothing on him; I told the officer I should not prosecute, as he had no more; he took him to the Mansion-house; I attended two days afterwards, and finding nobody from the Mint, he was afterwards discharged; on the 26th, I was desired to attend at Guildhall, and found him in charge for a similar offence; I gave the crown-piece to the officer.</p>

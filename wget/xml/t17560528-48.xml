They said, I might have it all in one if I pleased, and ask'd how I wou'd have it made. I said, as they pleased, for I had never seen a banker's bill. It was made, and I paid down 70 l. I think I had seven shillings in change, the money being all in guineas. They ask'd me where I had the money. I said, I had kept it by me some time; it was black. They said, they wonder'd I should keep it so; it had been quilted up in the lining of an old waistcoat, lining upon lineing, and look'd with a mean pospect; I brought it so to London, having work'd very hard for it, and hardly spent an idle penny. The note was made payable to me only, dated April 19, 1754. The note produced. This is the unhappy piece of paper; it is but a little piece, but it has been very trouble some to me. I had my every day cloaths on when I came home with it, and when I went to bed I put it into my waistcoat pocket in my box, amongst all my other cloaths; the box was corded, the lock being spoilt. On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock, master Goodwin was at the Nag's-Head with

The next morning, being up pretty soon, I told my fellow-servant, that I'd step for my box. I went, and found it corded as I left it. When I was in Compton street with it on my shoulder, I met the four prisoners at the bar; this was April 30 about six in the morning.

             took the note, Daniel and I were contesting at that time. He charg'd me with making one of Mr. Goodwin's bills for 5 l. a 7 l. I said, take me to Mr. Goodwin's don't rob me. When they had got the note, away they all went, and left the box and other things. I was very sorrowful, knowing my note was in bad hands. I took my box, and carried it to Mr. Harmans's house. I went to justice St. Lawrence several times on this affair. The justice said, they were a set of villains, and what they had swore against me he believed was entirely false, for one Hambelton Gilboy, a companion of the prisoners, had sworn I had forged a hand writing upon a lottery ticket. They have been ever charging me with something or another, with stealing and carrying away rum and brandy from my master, and selling it amongst them for three shillings and six pence a gallon. Some time after this, the two Dogorties came and took me by the collar in Mr. Harman's distill-house, and said they wou'd take me to gaol. Master ask'd them what was the matter ? They said they were officers. I stood crying under their hands, and said, carry me to what gaol you will, but bring me my bill. A neighbour came in. I said, these men have got a 70 l. banker's bill of mine. They pretended they had ball'd me for a forgery upon a lottery ticket. I went to Mr. Child the banker's shop on the Saturday after I was rob'd, and met with the person that made out the bill. He told me that a man of fortune had demanded the money upon the bill, who told him he had siez'd upon my goods and chattels, and had kept me out of gaol. I told him I did not owe any man a farthing in the world, that I had lost my bill, and hoped he would stop it if it came, and the man that brought it. I was afraid to say I had been rob'd of it, being told that if I did they wou'd fly o ver to Holland with it. In the mean time the prisoners issued out several warrants against me, and took me before justice St. Lawrence, and I was committed the 16th of April. They swore they would send my soul and body to damnation. I have been in gaol almost ever since. There came two gentlemen to the prison from the banker, and said, these men were going to oblige their master to pay the money. I said, for God's sake don't let them have it. They said, will you be at the expence of stopping the note. I said, they had ruin'd me. I was very poor, and could not do any thing. They shook their heads and said, they pity'd me, and it was a very villainous affair they believ'd.</p>

               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Hopster. For forging a 5 l. bill of my master's for goods, to 7 l. to defraud them as they pretended of 40 s. but I did not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What justice was this before?</p>
               <p>Hopster. Justice St. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you charged before the justice with having forged, or upon suspicion of having forged any part of a lottery ticket?</p>
               <p>Hopster. I was charged with that, but they could not make it appear. Gilboy charged me with making the figure 8 into a 9, with intent to defraud his majesty. The ticket was 1258, a 10 l. prize. It was one of my own, I had two tickets; the other was 1259. When he said I had made the 8 a 9, the justice put on his spectacles, and said it was a 9. I then put my hand in my pocket, and produced the other ticket, which was the 9, but Gilboy made a firm affidavit that I had alter'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you or was you not upon that charge of the forgery'd ?</p>
               <p>Hopster. No, not upon the forgery of the figure; I contradicted that, by shewing the other which was a 9.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this Hambleton Gilboy ?</p>
               <p>Hopster. He was a stout jolly-fresh-colour'd man, an acquaintance of theirs; he did not look like a rouge if he was one.</p>

               <p>Hopster. No, I did so to prosecure Benjamin Delahay. who was charg'd with a conspiracy, with intent to cheat one of his majesty's subjects of 6 l. 10 s. Hambleton Gilboy was his bail.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether or no you gave bail for your own appearance?</p>

               <p>Ambler. I have no acquaintance with the prosecutor; he was brought to Hicks s-Hall, to be tried for a perjury. In giving an account of this robbery. I thought he was very ill used, and I myself gave Mr. Serjeant Hayward a see to get that put off till the men themselves were tried for the robbery.</p>
               <p>Daniel Dogorty's defence. I was committed by Justice St. Lawrence till a re-hearing, and then Hopster acknowledged himself perjured before many men of credit. I never gave an oath against him. The justice bound me and five or six more of good character over to prosecute. Hopster deposited this note in my hands as a security for being bound for him for a forgery, before justice St. Lawrence. I gave full value for the note, and was almost a year out of it before I could get it again. I borrow'd some money on the note, and laid it out for his use, by his special orders. I'll make it appear I served the man; and here are men will prove he offer'd money to swear against me. This is the 5th or 6th action he has brought against me for my own money; he brought an action of trover, and I was obliged to lay in a spunging-house; I stood the action in the King's Bench till it was tried and nonsuited; and he brought two others in the Marshal's Court.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280040"></xptr> The note was above eat up before I recovered a farthing. I came here voluntarily, and so did the rest of the good company to surrender also.</p>
               <p>Neal Dogorty's defence was much to the same purport with Daniel's.</p>
               <p>Q. Can the affidavit be produced which he made?</p>

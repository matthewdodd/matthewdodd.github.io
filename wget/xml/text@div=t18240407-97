            . I am a publican, and live in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel. On the 12th of February, both the prisoners were at my house in company with another man - they all three came in together, and called for a pint of beer; I saw Bounce offering to sell some silver spoons to the other man, who came in with them - I took them out of the other man's hands, and said I would buy them; I took them to the bar, and asked what he wanted for them - he said 20 s. I said if he would sit down I would send for change. I immediately sent to Lambeth-street for an officer, and before he came the other man absconded, and I detained the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to get away - A. They were in the tap-room; I told him to wait in the tap-room, and while I was in the bar, he went out at the back door. I then stopped in the tap-room with the prisoners till the officer came - they did not know that I was detaining them; they never offered to go. I am sure that Bounce first produced the spoons; he offered them to the other men for sale. I gave them to the officer, and pointed to the prisoners; he took them.</p>
               <p>EBENEZA DALTON. I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the prisoners at the house. Four spoons were given to me - they both said that they had found them in a dust-hole in Haggerston-lane.</p>

Two tea and one desert spoon belong to him, and the other to Mr. Hughes, from whom I had borrowed it; I had put my master's spoons in the wash-house about ten o'clock in the morning, and missed them next day in the afternoon of the 12th. There is only a latch to the wash-house door, but there is a gate to the garden, which is seldom locked. I did not see either of the prisoners about.</p>

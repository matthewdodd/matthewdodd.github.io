            . I assist at Mr. Burnell's pastry-cook's shop, in Fetter-lane. On the 26th of October the prisoner came in, and asked me to give him change for a 5s. piece - I said I could not; he said there was a pawnbrokers where he could get change by having it in halfpence - I told him to go to the pork-shop next door; he said he had come from there - I then gave him change in halfpence, and he gave me the 5s. piece - I looked at it, and called to a young man who was down stairs; the prisoner seeing him come up ran away - he was afterwards brought back; I am quite sure he is the same person - I gave the 5s. piece to Thomas Allen, who gave it to the officer; this is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you positively swear I am the person? A. Yes; I knew you by your features when you were brought back; I knew you directly.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Burnell's and was called up into the shop; I saw a man in the shop - he ran out, and I ran after him up the court; he fell down, and a paper of halfpence fell out of his hand and broke - he got up and run away leaving them on the ground - I saw Allen run after him; he was brought back - I had lost sight of him.</p>

            . I had observed this mark on it before, but I afterwards made another - they are both on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Farringdon-street; a baker came up, and said he wanted me - I asked for what - he said, "You have been to my master's, and offered a bad 5s. piece;" I can positively state that I am not the person - the prosecutrix might be deceived; there are nineteen butchers out of twenty who wear smock-frocks and red caps like mine, and that was what she swore to me by.</p>

My husband keeps a coffee-shop in William-street, Shoreditch—on Friday night 21st September, the prisoners came about 12 o'clock—they had each a cup of coffee in the shop—Higley paid for it with a good shilling—I gave change—he then asked me if I could let them have two beds; I said, "Yes"—he asked the price; I said, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—he said he could not afford that, he could give a shilling each—I said, "Very well, as there are four of you you shall have it"—he gave me a good half-crown—I gave him sixpence out and they went up stairs to two separate rooms—their breakfast was ordered in the morning but I could not say who ordered it as Miss Clark waited upon them—Clark afterwards paid me a half-crown; I gave her fourpence change and told her to put the half-crown on the drawers, as I was not up—when I got up I put it in my pocket and I went out to buy a yard of ribbon; I offered the half-crown and it was refused—when I came back I showed it to Clark—I then wrapped it up and put it by itself—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—on 2d October Smith and Gibbons came again—Smith asked if they could "have the same beds that they had before, for a shilling each—I said, "Yes, but have you any persons with you"—she said, "Yes, the two parties we had before"—she then went to the door and said, "Come in, it is all right"—Manhood and Higley then came in—it was about a quarter past 12 o'clock—my husband showed them upstairs—at the time Smith asked if she could have the beds, she laid down</p>

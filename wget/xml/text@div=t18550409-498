                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Adams, a farmer, of West Ham. I know the prisoner—I missed some lead from the lining of a tank, in a loft over a shed, on my master's premises, fixed to the building—I went up at 10 o'clock, and saw the lead, and then told Mrs. Betts to keep watch, as I suspected the prisoner; and when I went home, at 1 o'clock, there was a great piece cut out—I had marked it with a "W" a few days before, and that part was gone—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are two marks which I had put on it—it is William Adams's property, and is worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it corresponds with the lead in the cistern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On Monday, 19th March, about 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw my husband mark the tank—I watched till a quarter to 7 in the evening—I saw the prisoner leave his work, in the home fields, about twenty minutes past 11 o'clock, cross the road through the <hi rend="italic">bunching</hi> shed, and go into the loft close to the tank—I went into the wood house, and heard him jump out of the tank—he remained in the loft about ten minutes, and then went down to the <hi rend="italic">bunching</hi> shed and did something with some rods—he then went to his work, having been absent from it twenty-three minutes—when I saw</p>

               <p>the lead in the morning, it was left as it had been cut previously, and when I saw it at a quarter to 12 o'clock, after the prisoner had left, a square piece had been cut out—this is the piece; here is the mark that I saw my husband make on it—I found it in the loft, rolled up, and laid in some onion peeling and straw, near the door—it was about eight yards from the tank.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Adams, at Plaistow. On 19th March, I went on watch, by Mr. Betts's direction, at a quarter past 1 o'clock—Mr. Betts had called me, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, and I went up into the loft and saw the tank—it had been fresh cut—I saw Mr's. Betts search the loft, and find this lead under some straw and onion peel—I had been watching before, but was attending to the cows, and left Mrs. Betts there—I kept on the watch till about 7 o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner came again, and ran up into the loft—no one else was there—I heard something drop, and the prisoner ran down the steps again—I told Mr. Betts, and he was detained—I then went up into the loft, and found the lead about two feet and a half from where I had found it.</p>

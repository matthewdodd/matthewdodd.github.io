                  </hi>. I am a wire-rope maker, and live at Millwall—the deceased, John James Coghlan, was my brother—on Saturday night, 9th April, I was with him and another young man at the prisoner's coffee-shop, in Carr-street—it was past 12 when we went there—a man named French,—and another man were having a discussion about Garibaldi and the Pope. French made use of very strong language—he said, "B the Pope"—my brother said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself; the man (meaning the Pope) never did you any harm"—my brother then said to French, "What good did ever Garibaldi do?"—French said, "You fool, what did ever you do?—my brother said, "How do you know that I am a fool?"—French said, "I am sure you are"—my brother said, "Can you make a fool of me?"—French said, "I will punch your head," and they stood up, and were going out to fight—the prisoner began to shove my brother about—my brother said to him, "Don't shove me about I can go out without being shoved out"—the prisoner said, "If you don't leave my house, I shall have you locked up"—my brother said, "I have done nothing, that I know of, that I should be locked up for"—the prisoner said, "If you don't leave my house, I shall do you an injury"—they got to the door, and he shoved my brother out on the pavement—my brother returned and opened the door with his left hand—he only looked in—he did not put his foot inside the door—he said to French, "Are you coming out to make a fool of me?"—the prisoner made a hit at him through the doorway; he then let the door shut, opened it again in a moment or so, and threw a chopper out at my brother—my brother called out, "Look out, here is something coming"—the chopper struck him on the knee—I saw it—he sat down on the pavement—he was afterwards carried back into the coffee-shop, and his leg was bound up—the policeman</p>

               <p>was there then—the chopper was brought in by Betts—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Betts handed it to me, and I laid it on the table under a young man's jacket—the prisoner came and took it away and put it behind the water<lb></lb>butt, and I and the policeman found it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you the worse for liquor at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we had been to a public-house, and each had a pot of beer—that was about 10 o'clock—we had not been to any other public-house—we had no other drink—I left work at 4, and remained indoors till 9, and then went with my brother to see Betts, and we all three went to the public-house—my brother had only had what I state—he was not drunk—we only had some coffee in the prisoner's house—the prisoner did not interfere in the dispute till French was going to punch my brother's head—he then began to shove my brother about—that was in the endeavour to get him out of the house—French was then in the house—my brother did not go out directly the prisoner asked him to go, he was willing to go—after he was put out, he went back and opened the door—he did not put his head in nor his foot, he only called out to French—it was then the prisoner made a hit at him—it might have been an endeavour to push him out, but it did not look like it; it seemed as if he went to hit him—he did not put him out three different times—I did not hear him call "Police!"—I swear that he threw the chopper from the coffee-house at my brother in the street—my brother was on the pavement, about three or four feet from the door—I was standing close to him—I went out with him—it was a dark night—it was to me and Betts that my brother sung out something was coming, for us to get out of the way—I was looking—I will swear I saw the prisoner throw the chopper, for Betts picked it up and handed it tome—the prisoner was standing in the coffee-shop when he threw it—he opened the door and threw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was admitted there on 10th April—he had a wound on the outside of his left knee-joint—it might have been produced by this chopper—from the direct consequences of that wound he died a month afterwards—amputation was performed—he died of exhaustion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe, when you first saw the deceased, it was obvious to you that he was under the effect of liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—I may also state that if the wound had been one-sixth of an inch less in depth, in all probability he would have recovered.</p>

                  <interp inst="t18071202-54-crimeloc335" type="placeName" value="George-street, Whitechapel"></interp>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking it away. - A. Another man took it away, and Allen received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Allen in company with the man who took it. A. Not then; they knocked my head and stopped my breath, I could not call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Allen there when this was taken from you. - A. Yes, he was; Allen was up and counted the money by a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that another man took it, and the prisoner was not present, were they both in company together. - A. Yes; they took two guineas and two seven shilling pieces from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was this. - A. In the upper room, where there were five beds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many laid in the room. - A. There were two in one bed, and two beds but one in a bed; Allen and the other man laid together that took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it. - A. They pulled my trowsers from under my head; I laid hold of the pocket, and it came off in my hand; they pulled the trowsers from me and pressed my hand and took the money from me.</p>
               <p>- LAWRENCE. I slept in this house. On the evening of the 8th of November, the prisoner and another man came up, they laid hold of this man's trowsers; Allen pulled them from the side of the bed, and put them in again; he went down stairs and lit a pipe; when he came up again he swore that the poor old man had the money in his hand; the old man got out of bed naked, he called murder; the other man stopped his mouth with his fist; this other man had got the purse, the old man said he had five guineas when he came from the country, and when he came to London he had two guineas, four seven shilling pieces, and two or three shillings. This other man put the halfpence and the silver back into the purse; the gold he kept; he said he should have it all in the morning. They did not give it him, they went away before five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all in the same room together. - A. I slept there but two nights.</p>
               <p>JOHN HIMM. About six minutes before eight o'clock, there were these two men in the room; the man that lodged along with the old man wanted to get the old man's money; the prisoner said he would give the old man his money in the morning; in the morning he quitted the room before five; instead of giving the old man his money he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man take the money away from him. - A. I saw him force it out of his hands, and then he delivered it to Allen and Allen counted it; I cannot tell what money there was, it was only a small bit of candle that lay on the floor, I only saw copper. Then Allen said whatever deficiency there was it should be delivered to him in the morning. The old man said if it was so, he would give them a glass of gin or any thing they required.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made good to the old man. - A. No. Mr. Sparrow got up hearing them make a noise and laughing as they went down; in the morning he asked me if any thing was amiss, I told him the old cake man had lost his money; Mr. Sparrow found two seven shilling pieces about and two shillings and sixpence in silver; the old man said he had four seven shilling pieces, he was two guineas and two seven shilling pieces short.</p>

            . Q. This house of yours you let in lodgings. - A. Yes. I did not know any thing till the morning of the 9th of November; I live in the house myself. A man came down in the morning and shook the door of my apartment; in about half an hour I heard the prisoner and the other man go out, they left the door open; hearing them talk louder than common curiosity led me up stairs to know if any thing was amiss; they told me there was a robbery of the old cake man of two guineas and four seven shilling pieces; I told them it was most exceeding strange that they had not given me an alarm before; I searched the bed, I found in his purse two seven shilling pieces, about half a crown in silver, and about six pennyworth of halfpence. On Wednesday the 11th me and Mr. Griffiths apprehended the prisoner; when he was apprehended, he said he was innocent of the affair, he would go quietly with us to Lambeth-street office.</p>

            . I was in the room, I distinctly saw that this man that is not taken forced the money from the old man's left hand, and handed it over to Allen; he counted it over, and said whatever was missing he should have in the morning; apparently according to the account of the old man, he walked away in the morning, and did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lawrence. You saw none of this man's money. - A. Yes, I saw him take out a piece of paper wherein I saw a guinea and two seven shilling pieces; I saw it in Allen's hand after he put the silver and halfpence in the purse; the end of the candle went out; that is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday evening, I was sitting at the George drinking a pint of porter, this old man came in, he drank out of the pint, he asked me after I had the pint of porter whether I was going home, I said yes. When we came from the public house it wanted about a quarter to nine o'clock; when we came up stairs the old man was in the bed; this man went to the old man's bed he said this old man always sleeps in his trowsers; I said if Mr. Sparrow knew it he would not suffer it; after that he put on the old man's coat; I said to him take it off; I took the coat from him; I said here, father, take care of your coat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020042"></xptr>after that he takes his pipe and goes down to the George and lighted it; immediately I went into bed he came up again with his lighted pipe; he undressed himself and went into bed to the old man; he took his trowsers off, and finding that he had the money in his hand, he wrenched it out of his hand; then he jumped out of bed directly; I catched hold of the purse, the old gentleman said their was a little purse in the big purse, the little purse fell between the sheets; I took it out and counted it out before the old man; I gave it the old man again; I said, I dare say if you have lost any thing, he will give it you again. The other two men persuaded the old man to get in bed again, there was nobody would wrong him.</p>

The prisoner came by with more women; she took hold of my hand, took a three-shilling piece, knocked the rest on the ground, and then run away. She stopped when she espied me pursuing her; I asked her for the three-shilling piece that she had taken; she replied, you may go and get it; I'll go and spend it. She went to a public-house, about an hundred yards further; I pursued her, and called the watch; the watch came up. She went into a public-house, and had something to drink. When she was drinking, she said, I am spending your three-shilling piece. I retired from the door; she followed me out. The watchman took her into custody. She was taken to the watchhouse, and searched. I saw a three-shilling piece found upon her, a shilling, and a quantity of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know your three-shilling piece, did you - A. No; there was no mark upon it. It appeared to be a good one. I should not have taken such a three-shilling piece as that found upon the her; my master would have flung it at my head. I am in the habit of taking a little money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250032"></xptr>last witness called me in Oxford-street, about half past ten at night. I saw the prisoner run away from him; she went down Oxford-road, and went into Portman-street, to a public-house. I waited about two minutes, until she came out. The prosecutor gave me charge of her. I took her to the watch-house, and searched her. When I took her in custody, she said, here, you old b - r, here is the three-shilling piece, go and spend it; I said, no, I will not take it; I am an officer of the night. I searched her at the watchhouse; I found a three-shilling piece, a bad one, a shilling, and nine-pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My three-shilling piece was a good one; to the best of my knowledge that is not my three-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Ravencroft. It is the same three-shilling piece I found upon the prisoner; I marked it when I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a poor and unfortunate young woman. I met the prosecutor in the street; we spoke together. He said, that he had no less change than a three-shilling piece; I went to get that changed at a public-house; I was informed it was a bad one. I returned the prosecutor the bad one; he said, it was not the three-shilling piece he gave to me; I had no other to change it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs.

From information I received, I went on the morning of 9th March with Sergeant Gibson to 20, Little Colling<lb></lb>wood Street—the prisoner put his head out at the window and asked me the time—I said "Half-past five"—it was not half-past five, but I had a reason for telling him so—I asked if his name was Clark—he said</p>

About 10.30 p.m. on 8th March I was on duty in Weston Street, about 40 or 50 yards from this warehouse—I noticed a wicket door open—I went inside the yard and found the warehouse door open—I could see it had been forced, and shone my lamp for assistance—Police-constable 95 came—we searched the warehouse and found the office desk broken open.</p>

He said they were bones. I had seen him before. He promised to come next morning, but the policeman came and I told him they were bones. I gave him a description of Thompson and of his horse and cart. I was delayed in coming down in looking for matches and a candle. I am innocent.</p>

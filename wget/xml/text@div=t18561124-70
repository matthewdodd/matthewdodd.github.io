                  </hi>. I am clerk to a ship broker, and live at Four-Mills, Bromley. I missed a ship's yard, the property of Mr. Emery, about the latter end of Oct.—I should know it again—I have since seen part of it in the custody of the police, and can say that it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, living at Blackwall. This yard belongs to my brother—in consequence of information I received, I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police, and afterwards saw part of it in Benham's yard—it had been fastened with a staple, about eighteen inches from the end, and made feat with a chain to the wharf side—I examined the spot afterwards, the spar was gone, and the chain wrenched off—it could not have gone from the wharf without foul means.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long bad it been lying there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nine months—it was placed alongside the wharf to keep barges from chafing—it was always afloat—I had not examined it recently—I am confident that it is the same—I saw it often, and know it from it's general appearance—there was no private mark on it—spare occasionally float about—this was the main yard of a large ship, and was between fifty and sixty feet long—a similar large ship might have a similar yard—when I found it, it was out up into four or five pieces; two pieces I saw at Benham's place, another piece at the prisoner's place, and another piece must have been used—I went to the wharf sometimes once a month, sometimes once a week, and I always saw that it was safe; that was all I wanted—I never looked to see whether the chafing was severe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live at Stratford. I did not know the prisoner, but was employed by him to cut some timber this day three weeks—I was on the wharf at Barking-creek, and he asked me if there were any chain horses—I said, "No, you are too late for chain horses"—he said that he wanted them to pull some timber out—I said, "What will you</p>

I will do it"—I did it, and he out it up into four pieces at his place—he asked me to let it lay at my place for a day or two, as he had not room to put it in his place—I had three pieces of it, and placed two pieces of it outside of his door, by the side of the road—I saw it cut—his place is No. 16, Turn-pike-row, Stratford—I was questioned by the police, and told them what had happened.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). On Friday night, 21st Nov., in consequence of what Emery told me, I saw Benham; and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 16, Turnpike-row, and asked him whether he ordered Benham to cart a ship's yard away from Abbey-wharf—he said "Yes," and that he gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him who he bought it of, and how he came by it—he said that he bought it of a man named Holden—I asked him if he knew where he lived—he said "No," but no doubt he could soon find out—I asked him what price be gave for it, he said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him not to cut up any more of it, as he was cutting it up at the time, and that he must find the man, or find his address, and tell me to<lb></lb>morrow morning—he said that no-doubt he should see him that evening—Addington was with me all this time—I went next morning with Addington about a quarter to 9 o'clock, and asked the prisoner whether he had found out where Holden lived, or whether he had seen him—he said "No," and that he had not seen him—in consequence of something I learned, I saw him again about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and told him that he must consider himself my prisoner for stealing a ship's yard, or receiving it, know<lb></lb>ing it to be stolen; and that I had ascertained that he had been drinking with Holden at the Green Gate beer shop on the over night—he said that he had not been drinking, but Holden asked him whether he could not stand a pot of ale without hurting himself, and he refused—I asked him whether he had found out where Holden lived, or said anything to him about the ship's yard—he said "No," he had not mentioned it to him—he said at the station house, that he gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and spent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Green Gate beer shop, where he bought it—that is about 200 yards from the prisoner's house, and about a mile from the Abbey-wharf, or half a mile if you go by the side of the river.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

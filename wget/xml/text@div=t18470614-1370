On the 3rd of June, which was the day the Charity children went to St. Paul's—I saw the three prisoners in St. Paul's Church-yard—I noticed them from about then o'clock in the morning till about twelve—they had been together all that time—about twelve o'clock they were in Canon-alley, opposite the north door of St. Paul's—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix was there—they went up to her—I saw Williams put his left hand into her right hand pocket—directly he took it out I laid hold of it, and found in it three shillings and a sixpence—I told the prosecutrix—I told Chamberlain to take Lloyd and West—I went to the station, searched Lloyd, and found on him a half-crown, a shilling, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3/4—I found no other money on Williams—Lloyd and West were close enough to Williams to have received anything from his before I came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Ashley and Co., builders, of Kings<lb></lb>land Road, who are carrying out some works for Messrs. Caldecott in Cheap<lb></lb>side—the prisoner was employed there—the pay-day is Saturday, and the night gang is paid at 6 a.m.—on the 8th March a man who went by the name of Roland was employed on the works—I have a book in which the men's names are entered and the sums due to them—I take it inside a sort of box with a little window to it—Mr. Diprose, the clerk, takes the sheet, calls out the names and amounts, and I pay the men—on the 8th March Roland's name was called out loud enough for everybody to hear, and I passed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out at the window, which was the sum Roland was entitled to—I saw a hand only take the money—William Connor's name came next on the list, he was entitled to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—his name was called out, and I passed that money in the same way, and saw it taken—if I had known that the person who took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not Roland, I would not have allowed it to be taken away—I believed it was Roland—my cash balanced after I had paid the money.</p>

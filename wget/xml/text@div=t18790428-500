                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we live at 5, Herm Street, Plaistow Marsh—on April 10th he came home about 11.30, very much the worse for drink—my little girl and I were in the back kitchen—he spoke to the child, and she said, "We have been sitting up for you"—he said, "D—your mother, where is my supper?"—I said that I did not think he wanted any supper, as he had had plenty of drink, and he had better go to bed—he said he would not—the child said, "Mother says you had better go to bed"—he said, "I will give your mother something else before I have done with her," using bad language—my boy aged 10 came down from his bed and asked for something to eat—I was in the act of cutting him some bread when my husband said, "I want my supper," and took the knife from my hand—whether he intended to hurt my hand or only to</p>

               <p>cut himself some supper I don't know—I do not think he intended to hurt me—he slightly cut my wrist, but it soon healed up—the mark is there still—when he snatched the knife he said that he would put it through me if I did not mind—I do not know whether he meant to strike me with it, or only to wrest it away—there is not the least foundation for saying that I made a blow at him with the knife—I was very agitated, and I am very often in fault as well as my husband—I sat down on a chair and told him that I should have to put him somewhere else, as I could not put up with this, and he struck me—I halloaed out, and my boy came down—I said, "If your father don't mind what he is doing, he won't have the chance to go to bed"—the boy got him out of the room, and then the officers came—he had been drinking all the week—the little girl had gone for the constable as soon as she saw blood—this is the knife.</p>

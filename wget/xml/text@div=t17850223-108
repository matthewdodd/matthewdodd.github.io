             sworn.</p>
               <p>These are the things which lay on the bed where this man lay; I saw them found; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I stopped there till about four in the afternoon, after Mr. Curtis went away, and Penny and I went to the public-house to have some beer, he left me and went away, I went home after to go to bed; Penny was in bed, and had locked himself in; Bunce wanted to awake him, and he could not; I went into the shop to work, at last Bunce broke the door open, but he could not make him sensible; when I went to work again, I found half a gallon of wine in the shop, and Bunce thought he heard some foot in the room, which was me coming along the passage; Bunce said, what is the matter? I said nothing is the matter, come with me, and I will shew you what is the matter; I took him into the shop and shewed him where Penny had been vomiting all round, and I shewed him the half gallon of wine; Bunce was in a great passion, and told me to pack up my tools and go away out of the house that night, for he was afraid Penny and I should have words, accordingly I packed up my things and went and came back in the morning, and I was secured.</p>

               <p>Court to Bunce. Is this true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did Penny say to it at the time? - He did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Then at first, that night Williams said Penny had been in Curtis's room, and went and shewed you the room? - He shewed me where he had been vomiting, and were the wine was, that was just by the chamber door.</p>
               <p>Where had you heard the foot before? - It was in the chamber, I thought I heard the foot.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the chamber that night? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then it was in the shop room he took you to? - Yes, Penny said nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Which of them was most in liquor? - I do not know, Penny was in bed, and Williams was very much in liquor; I do not know when Williams went to bed, he said he should go to work, I did not see him go to work.</p>
               <p>Did you bid him take his tools and go to prevent their quarrelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I pulled off my coat and waistcoat and shoes, I thought I would lay in the same manner Penny did, he had not all his clothes off.</p>
               <p>Court to Curtis. How did this man behave before? I never heard any thing amiss about him, Penny had worked with me a few months.</p>
               <p>What was the circumstance that induced you to charge Williams rather than Penny? - Because Penny swore to him, and Williams owned it all before the Justice; the Justice asked him how he came to do this thing, and he said he was drunk; I had six quarts of elder wine, and they had drawn that out and got drunk with it.</p>

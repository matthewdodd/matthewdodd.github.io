                  </hi>. I am a hackney-coachman, and live in Clement's-lane, Temple-bar. On the evening of the 22nd of July I was driving my coach in Piccadilly—the prisoner stopped me, and asked if I was hired—I said "No"—he let two gentlemen in with the box, and he got on my box with me, by their direction, as he told me—he directed me to drive them to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross—and, on the way, one of the persons inside directed me to go on towards Whitechapel—when I got into Leadenhall-street they altered the direction again, and ordered me to go down Houndsditch—they stopped at a public house on the way, and gave me a glass of liquor—the prisoner got off the box in Houndsditch, and got inside, and one of the others got out to show me where to stop—he told me to go down Cutler street, and he would show me the public-house I was to stop at—when I stopped there a policeman opened the coach-door, and took the prisoner into custody—the others made their escape—the prisoner drank with the rest at the public-house.</p>

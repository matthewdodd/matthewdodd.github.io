                  </hi>. I live at 6, Warwick Court, Holborn—I have lived there twenty years, and am a wholesale perfumer—I am seventy-three years of age—the three prisoners rented the front kitchen from me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as a workshop—I let it to the elder Head—they did not pay the rent, and I gave them notice to quit after the first week—that was about five weeks before the assault—I gave Frost two notices to give to Mr. Head—they still remained on—I could not get the rent, and I put the broker in—I went to bed on the 23rd February, about 11.30, after fastening up the house—I heard several persons going in and out during the night, and about 2 o'clock I fell asleep—about 3 o'clock I heard a knocking at my bedroom door—I said "Who are you, and what do you want?—the younger Head said, "My father, Mr. Head, wants to speak to you"—I said "It is not the hour to come; tell your father to come tomorrow morning, and I will talk with him"—the father then came close to the door and said, "Mr. Pavia, be so kind as to open the door for a few minutes, because I have something of great importance to tell you—I repeated the same to him, and told him to come to-morrow—he said "It will be too late to-morrow; you will repent; open the door for a few minutes and you will be satisfied"—I knew the voices of the two Heads, and I opened the door a little way—as soon as I did so I received several blows on the head—about ten, I think—I fell down at the last blow—I was struck with the leg of a chair—I cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and they gave me another blow, and I fell on my knees quite unconscious—I lost I don't know how much blood—the father struck the ten blows—Frost struck me the last blow and then they went away, leaving me as dead—the younger Head stood opposite the door, looking on—I lost a great quantity of blood; all my shirt was red—I was attended by a doctor—I don't know his name—about half an hour after the assault the elder Head was afterwards brought to my bedside by a constable, and I said "That is the man that struck me"—the leg of the chair laid on the chair at the side of the bed, and the policeman asked the father if he knew it, and he said "Yes, it belongs to one of my chairs in the kitchen"—I was in bed for four days, and when I got up I was so weak I could hardly stand.</p>

I am housekeeper to Mr. Pavia—about a week before 23rd February, a notice was given to Frost to give to Mr. Head—I went into the kitchen to get some water, and Frost said the old man could not live long; he should like to give him a bit of this, and he took the knife out of his pocket—he said so to young Head—I told Mr. Pavia of it—I told Frost he had better keep his knife to himself—on the morning of 24th Feb<lb></lb>ruary I was awakened by hearing cries of "Murder?"—it was about 3.30—I got up and went down stairs—I saw young Head in the passage—I went in the parlour, where the cries came from, and saw Mr. Pavia there—he was covered with blood, like a slaughtered bullock—he was standing, leaning on the mantelpiece—he said the man in the kitchen had murdered him—I ran out into the court—I saw young Head in the passage as I came out of the parlour—he was dressed—I said "You know all about it," or something to that effect—I was so excited I don't know what I did say—he said, "You are in a fearful way, to be sure"—I ran into the court, and called "Murder? and "Police!" and young Head said "I will go for the porter at the gate," and he ran for me—I did not go into the kitchen—I was too frightened—the boy ran to the porter, and he came back with two policemen.</p>

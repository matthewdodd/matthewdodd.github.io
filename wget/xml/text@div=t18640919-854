On the evening of 24th Au<lb></lb>gust I was on duty in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner coming along with these two parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in consequence of something that was said to me by some one, I went to him and asked where he got them from—he said of a man at the corner of a street—I said, "At the corner of what street?"—he said he did not know exactly what street it was—I asked where he was going to carry them to—he said he did not know—I then took him into custody—on searching him at the station, I found a lot of these scarf-rings upon him; he said he got his living by selling them—he gave me an address, 37, Workman-street, Charlotte-street, Whitechapel—there is no such street in the neighbourhood.</p>

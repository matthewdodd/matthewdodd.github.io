I said, a friend of mine; upon that I told him, I was going to different places with an EO table, and I should want a vast deal; I told him that Marsden was the man that was to work the table for me; we went into a public-house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040041"></xptr>he brought out his money; he gave me forty-two pieces, and I gave him a guinea which had been marked by Marsden; it was past nine o'clock before we came from the Public-office; I went home to lock them up, and how it was I don't know, but I lost seven of them before I got to the office.</p>

I am a Police-officer: I went to a public-house in Fleet-market, with the last witness, on the 7th of June, in the evening; before I went, I marked a guinea; when we were in the house, Houghton asked me to lend him a guinea, upon which I picked out the marked guinea, which he gave the prisoner, and the prisoner gave him forty-two shillings, and counted them before me; Gilbert said to me, you may as well have half a piece, I refused; then he said, he had got a quarter of a piece, that I should have for five shillings; I immediately took him into custody, I searched him, and took some bad money from him, which I have here. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these thirty-five pieces, and tell us it they are good shillings? - A.These are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Houghton is a man of infamous character, he is a common informer, he said, he should pass all those to night, and he should want some more to-morrow; accordingly, the next day, he wanted Marsden to let him have seven more to make up the number, for he had passed seven of them.</p>
               <p>Marsden. Houghton asked me to let him have seven of mine, to make up the number, as he had lost seven, and I told him I should do no such thing.</p>

               <p>The following day, the prisoner was brought up again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. You stand convicted of felony, what have you to say for yourself, why you should not receive judgment, to die according to law?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I pray the benefit of the statute.(Mr. Ward, Counsel for the prosecution, put in a plea, stating, that the prisoner was not entitled to benefit of clergy, because he had been before convicted, which was read by Mr. Shelton.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Prisoner, what you have heard just now read is an allegation that you have been previously convicted, about two years ago, of another offence, of uttering copper money for less than it imported to be worth, and that if you were so, you are not entitled to the benefit of clergy; what have you to say in answer to that charge, of having been so convicted two years ago of another offence, namely, that of uttering copper for less than it imported to be worth?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought it was not a capital offence the second time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Q. Were you convicted two years ago of that offence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was only three papers of halfpence, I did not sell them to the man - I was cruelly used.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Do you admit that you are the man that was then convicted - you may say, you were, or you may say you were not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. You cannot leave it to me- were you or not convicted two years ago of putting off bad halfpence, at a less price than they imported to be worth?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, it was my brother, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Then they must prove that you are the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Prisoner, the offence of which you have been convicted here, during this session, is that of putting off to one William Houghton, forty-two pieces of counterfeit milled money, to the likeness of a shilling, not being cut in pieces and which you put off at a lower rate than they imported to be worth, that is to say, these forty-two counterfeit shillings, for the sum of one guinea, which is just half what they would have been worth, if they had been genuine pieces of money. As to what you said sometime ago, that the offence of which you have now been convicted is not a capital offence; if it had rested by itself, and there had been no former bad conduct on your part, amounting to a felony, it would have been, as you suppose, it would not have been a capital offence; but our ancestors have very wisely, for the public, provided, that men shall not be permitted to offend, from time to time, and be allowed the indulgence of what is called, a clergy, when they are called up to say whether they have any thing to alledge against a sentence of death being passed upon them in a case of felony. It is now a great many years ago, as far back as the reign of

            . when the legislature, in considering this question, I think wisely concluded, that any man, who had once had the benefit of clergy allowed to him, should not, for any future crime, be entitled to that benefit. If a man had been convicted of a felony, and was entitled to his clergy, that proceeded wholly from the lenity, and from the mercy of the law of this land; that lenity was founded upon the idea, or at least the hope, that the man who had been convicted of a felony, might see the extent of his guilt which he had committed, that he might repent, and might afterwards become a useful member of society; but they were satisfied, that as men were so hardened in their dispositions, that by their future conduct, they proved to the world, that they were unworthy of the mercy that had been shewn to them; it should not be extended to a second crime, and therefore, at the time I mentioned to you, the legislature provided, that no man, who had once had his clergy, should have it again; perhaps, in making that provision, they rightly attended to the interests of the public at large - we do find, from the records of cases which have passed in the Courts of Justice of this country, that in the last century it hardly ever happened, that a man, who was convicted of a second felony, was suffered to pass without undergoing the execution of that judgment, which it is my duty to pronounce upon you - perhaps the practice of that time might be more beneficial to the public than that which has prevailed in later times - undoubtedly, we do find, that at the period when that rule was attended to felonies, bore no proportion to what they do in the present day. If the lenity of Courts of Justice has contributed to the multiplication of crimes, it is much to be lamented. It has been the practice, not only of this Court, but of all criminal Courts, to look with an eye of compassion upon the case of the prisoners who are tried; and if any circumstances can be found, which, in any degree, will justify a Court, in interposing in favour of a prisoner, and in lessening that share of punishment which belonged to his crimes, the Courts have most readily interfered; and I am afraid, that in many instances, they have done it beyond what the interest and welfare of the public would warrant. But when we come to the case of second offences, the hands of Courts are considerably tied down; for, by the statute that I have stated, the legislature has provided, that in cases which otherwise would not be liable to the punishment of death, if they come before the Court as a second offence, if it be proved that the prisoner, guilty of that offence, has previously committed another, for which he has been allowed his clergy, that shall not be allowed again, and if the clergy be not allowed, nothing remains, but the Court is bound to pass judgment. There is no case in which, by the laws of this country, our most gracious Sovereign, from whom mercy flows, may not, if he thinks sit, in his wisdom, relax the rigour of the law; but if it be established in this place, that an offender, standing at this bar, has been already allowed his clergy for a former felony, the law says, that for a second felony, on conviction, he is liable to suffer death, and therefore, in the situation in which you stand, it is the bounden duty of the Court to pass that sentence upon you, which is, that <rs id="t17980704-52-punish245" type="punishmentDescription">

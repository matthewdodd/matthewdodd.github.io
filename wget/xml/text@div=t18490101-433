                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, and life in Lambeth-walk. Manley was in my service about eight months—I marked some pieces of pork—the gates of my slaughter-house open into Lambeth-mews at the back of my house—I have seen a belly of pork marked by me—Fall used to wash the cart, and go on errands for me—Manley recommended him.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 29th Dec., I watched the prosecutor's premises—about seven o'clock that morning, I saw Manley come out of the gates, and come to the end of the Mews—he had a jug in his hand—he stood still and whistled—he called <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> three times, and Fall came across the road and spoke to him—they went into a coffee-shop about a hun<lb></lb>dred yards off—Fall came out in about a minute, and went up the mews—then Manley came out and went into his master's premises—I sent an officer after Fall, and I said to him, "What have you got in this bundle?"—he said, "That is my business"—I took him to the station, and found on him this pork—Manley was away about three minutes before he returned to his mas<lb></lb>ter's premises—Fall was never at the prosecutor's premises at all—he could not have taken the pork from there, after he had joined Manley—Fall was carrying this under his arm—when Fall went into the coffee-house he had not anything with him—he passed me close—Manley stood in a position where I could not see him so well as the other officer could.</p>

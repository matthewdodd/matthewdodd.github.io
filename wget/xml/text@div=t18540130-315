                  </hi>. I am manager of the Sydenham Gas-works. Between 10th and 13th of Jan., the prisoner came to the Gas-works; he came two or three times—he came to me in the office, once or twice, while I was there, and once or twice in my absence—at first he told me he came on a friendly visit, but afterwards he said he was out of work, and he applied for relief—I had known him some years ago, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I had in my office a spirit level on a shelf—I mused it one evening, to the best of my knowledge on a Wednesday—I think the prisoner had been there on the Monday or Tuesday, and on the Wednesday in the same week I missed the level; I have seen it since—after I missed the level, the pri<lb></lb>soner came again on Monday, 23rd Jan., I told him I had lost a level out of the office, and asked him if he had seen it—he said he had seen no level, and none he wanted to see—I asked him if he would walk to the Bell with me—I told him that I had heard that he had shown it there—he still denied having the level—he told me he had a level, but it was his own; and he had sent it with other things to London—I asked him to go up the village, and we went up; and he wanted to go in the Red Lion—I told him I did not want him to go there, but he went and I followed him—he went to a back yard—he then came out of the public house, and he <hi rend="italic">shot</hi> into the next yard, Mr. Standen's yard, and he went to a closet there—I wanted to stop there till he came out, but he pulled the door to—I waited till he came out, and we then went on—he said, "Where now"—I said, "Come on to the Peacock"—I then gave him in charge, and the policeman took him back to the closet—this is my level, to the best of my belief; I had two of them—this is the same size and pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, at Sydenham. I was at work at the office of the Sydenham Gas-works on 12th Jan.—I remember the prisoner coming in the office—I spoke to him, and am quite positive it was him—what drew my attention to him was, there were two of us, and I said he was very much in the way of our work—he went away, and he came again about 7 o'clock in the evening—I had a good light, and I saw him put his hand on the shelf and remove the spirit level while Mr. Cresswell was writing a direction on a letter—the prisoner took the level down, and looked at it—it was about the size of this one—this is about the descrip<lb></lb>tion of it.</p>

                  </hi>. In the first week in Jan., I was in the employ of the Sydenham Gas Company, as a collector—I saw two levels in the office on the 12th or 13th Jan.—I examined them both; I found one of them was not quite true, and I filed one of the screws down a little—I left the marks of the file on it—I did it to lower that side to make it true—this is the level—I think these are the marks of the file; these are very similar marks to those I made—I believe this to be the same level.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know who that spirit-level was made by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I cannot say whether that same person has manufactured more like it—if one that was not true had fallen into the hands of any other person, they might have filed the screw down—I cannot swear that this is the very same level; I believe it is—I never saw a spirit-level in your possession.</p>

               <p>station on the 10th Jan.; I do not think I have any witnesses here who can throw light on the subject; Cresswell swore he saw me on their premises on Monday, 9th Jan., but the parties from Euston-square station could prove that I came to that station at middle day on the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Scovell, of Scovell,'s-wharf, Tooley-street. Last Saturday evening I was on the wharf, and saw the prisoner Jones take a firkin of butter off a truck, which stood opposite the cellar steps half unloaded, and place it on a tierce of pork—he then took another in his arms, but seeing Mr. Gibson the foreman, coming, he laid it down by the side of the truck till he had passed, then took it up again, and placed it in a cart, which stood there—I saw Mayo back the cart towards the truck—I went to the cellar, and told Sculley, who im<lb></lb>mediately came up, and went to the cart—Jones was then in the cart, cover<lb></lb>ing the firkin with a tarpaulin—Mayo was at the horse's head at the time—Sculley asked Jones what he was going to do with it—he immediately jumped down, and ran away-Mayo ran away at the same time, leaving the cart—about ten minutes after, as we were taking the cart towards the green-yard, Mayo came up, and demanded to know where we were taking the horse and cart to, and said it belonged to him—he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—Jones was also taken on the wharf by Mr. Gibson. <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you saw me take the firkin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> did, off the truck—I was only six or seven yards from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mayo. Q.</hi> Did you see me bring the cart on the wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, hut I saw you <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it against the truck; I am sure of that, and I had seen you come down the wharf with the tarpaulin op your back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. John, Henry, and George Scovell. I was walking down the wharf on this Saturday, about six o'clock, and saw Jones running down the wharf, very fast, with two or three of our men after him—I allowed him to pass, not knowing the meaning of it, but hearing the cry of "Stop thief," I pursued him up Tooley-street and Dean-street, took him, and brought him back to the premises.</p>

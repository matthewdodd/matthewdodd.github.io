On the 13th of November, at five minutes before two o'clock in the day, I was standing in the shop with the other young man, and saw the prisoner, who had been walking before the window for several minutes or a quarter of an hour; and seizing an opportunity, when few persons were passing, I saw him strike a large pane of plate-glass with his elbows; it was very thick, but he broke it into several pieces, then put his hand into the window, and took this brooch, the case being open, he caught it, the lid shut, and he lost his hold in shutting it - he picked it up again, and walked away with it; I immediately followed, and collared him twenty yards from the house, with the brooch in his pocket - I said, "You rascal, what have you got there? give it to me;" he immediately took the brooch out of his pocket, and I took it from him, and sent for an officer who took him - nothing more was found on him; this is the brooch; it is master's property, and worth 18l.</p>

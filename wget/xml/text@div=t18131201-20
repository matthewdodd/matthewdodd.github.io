               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him; did he come on board your ship on the 30th of October - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner first - A. When I went on board the second ship from us; the ships were all close together, alongside of one-another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the prisoner before you saw him on board that ship - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had a watch, had not you - A.Yes; the watch was in the cabin, in the bed place; I sleep in the bounds of the big cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you last saw your watch - A. On the night of the 29th of October, between nine and ten at night, I then saw my watch either in the cabin or the bed place. I missed my watch between twelve and one o'clock. Before I missed my watch, I heard a trampling upon deck; I went upon deck, and asked who it was. I asked the man what he wanted. It was dark; I could not see his person. He told me he was going on board the Mary of Newcastle. I then looked for my watch, it was gone; the man went over our ship, and went over the tier. I called the ships crew up, and told them I was robbed of my watch, and that a man had gone over the tier of the ship, I was suspicious of him; we then got a lanthorn, and went in pursuit of him, and found him in the second ship from us; he was standing at the back part of the rudder trunk,

             got up to him first; he said, he saw the watch; I came up to him last. I asked the prisoner to let me look at the watch; he held it out, and said, is this your watch; I looked at it, and said it was my watch; I put the watch in my pocket. I took the prisoner to my own ship, and kept him there till day light, I then sent for an officer; the officer came, and took the prisoner before the magistrate. Before the magistrate I laid my watch down on the table; the magistrate gave it into the constable's possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The night being dark the waterman unfortunately put me on board this ship instead of my own; I heard the mate sing out; the waterman said here, take this watch, keep it for me; I did not know whose watch it was; the prosecutor heard me sing out for the waterman.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you recollect the prisoner telling you the waterman gave him the watch - A. Yes, he told me the same story.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Snowden calling you up upon deck - A. Yes, he told me he had lost his watch; we then took a lanthorn and went over the tier to look for the man; I saw him behind the rudder trunk in a ship, the next but one to us. I said to the mate, he is here; he began to hustle his clothes, and asked what we wanted with him; he said he was mate of a ship, he had plenty of money and good friends; I said you have got our mate's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010021"></xptr>watch, and we must have it. He said he had no watch. I looked sharp at the prisoner to see what sort of a man he was. I saw the glass of a watch in his right hand. I then told the mate he had a watch in his hand; the mate took hold of the watch. The prisoner said he had not stolen it. He wanted us to put him on board the Mary, and he would shew us the person that took it. We then took the prisoner to our own ship, and the next morning the prisoner was put into the bands of a constable.</p>

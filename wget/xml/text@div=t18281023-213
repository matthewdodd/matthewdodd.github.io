               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the prisoner been your tenant? A. I think last November; I let him the premises rent-free - one Dale was there before; I think it was in May or June last that I brought the ejectment - I did not pay the costs, on condition of his going out; I understood from my solicitor that 20l. were paid to me in part of the costs - this was on Michaelmas-day; I never received that as rent, and never understood it as such - I do not know that there was any lean-too to the premises the prisoner occupied; he took down a door and a frame, but not a building, to my knowledge - he took some premises on the opposite side of the way: my premises have been a baker's shop for fourteen or fifteen years, and it is my wish to continue them so; I know all these timbers very well - they were worked in the building.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever give the prisoner any laths or timber? A. No.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Hanwell, and am a carpenter by trade. I had the overlooking of the prosecutor's premises - giving cheques for the bricks, and any thing wanted; the prisoner was a tenant of Mr. Gosling's in the month of July - I saw him living there in the latter end of July; I had orders from Mr. Gosling to watch his premises - I went down, when off duty; I saw a number of bricks on these premises, perhaps one thousand at a time - they were on the adjoining premises, in front of Mr. Gosling's new building; there were some laths and wood there likewise; In August last, I missed three pantile laths, and a little after that three pieces of timber and one paving-stone - I had seen the timber the night before I missed it - that was early in August; I had been working up some of these timbers myself, that enabled me to know them - it was on Sunday morning I missed the timber; I afterwards saw William Brown, and in consequence of what passed between us, I went to the premises of Mr. Gosling - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there that day, but I did on the Sunday, in the bakehouse which he occupied of Mr. Gosling; I saw the pieces of timber and pan-tiles on the oven on the premises he occupied of Mr. Gosling, covered with some empty sacks - the prisoner was not there then; this was before I took Mr. Gosling to the premises over the way - we afterwards went over the way, and saw the laths and some elm and fir timber, which I did not know, and some bits of paving-stones, shot down loose in the wash-house - one of them I could speak to, as I had seen it in the bakehouse on Mr. Gosling's premises, covered with two sacks; some bricks were missed from the premises, but I could not identify them; I saw Filby on the premises, but not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If I understood you rightly, you began to miss these things in August? A. There was a good deal missed before, but what I missed was in August; the prisoner was then in possession of the bakehouse on the prosecutor's premises - I told him the prisoner was robbing him, but he continued in possession of his house; the house opposite was building for him, but that part which he had to build I do not think was built at that time; I did not take away the timbers which I saw there; I spoke to Palmer about them, he did not take them away, and I had orders not to molest him in any way; there was something about the action going on, but every man on the premises was told not to hurt a hair of his head - and it is my opinion Mr. Gosling would not, had not the stones been taken away; I took something to another house in July because some things had been missed, but we had not seen any thing on the prisoner's premises then; I know Abbot; Mr. Gosling claimed some rafters, but Abbot was not called to prove that he had supplied them, in my hearing; the prisoner has been living there ever since, and came here this morning.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Gosling, as a bricklayer; I took up some paving-stones, which had been the flooring of a pantry, in some old houses of Mr. Gosling's; I took them up with a pick-axe, and used some of them for back-hearths, and left the other laid in a place which was formerly a pantry, but the walls were pulled down that were adjoining the prisoner's premises; about the beginning of September I saw the prisoner take some of them and put them into a barrow, and his servant was wheeling them away; I told him they did not belong to his master but to Mr. Gosling; he said he did not know any thing about it, his master told him to wheel them away - I afterwards saw some of them on the prisoner's premises over the way; I know there were some pan-tile laths, timber, and bricks - I did not miss any of them, for I had not much to do with them; I went with Higgs to the prisoner's premises about October; I had told Higgs what I had seen - I saw the prisoner there, but did not see him do any thing; I saw three pieces of timber at the coach-house door on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning there were but two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this coach-house? A. On the premises, adjoining those of the prisoner's - it was six or seven o'clock in the evening when the stones were removed, in the beginning of September; it was not very dark- I saw it, and any one else might have seen it - the prisoner brought them down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him bring them down? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230088"></xptr>Yes - he brought them down on his shoulder, placed them in the barrow, and his servant took them.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's service; in August last I wheeled away some new bricks from the stack of Mr. Gosling by the prisoner's direction; he was not on the spot at the time; I wheeled them over to the place he was building over the way - I wheeled above four barrows, but the prisoner was not there; I saw some fir timber in the bakehouse of Mr. Gosling's premises - I did not know whose it was; I did not see the prisoner do anything with that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you left the prisoner's service? A. About five weeks - that was before this business; I am now in the service of Mr. Strand, of Brentford, and have been so for three weeks; I think I did not take any thing away when the prisoner was present - I took them away about one o'clock, when the men were at dinner; Mr. Abbot built the premises over the way for the prisoner, but the bakehouse and wash-house the prisoner was building; I left the prisoner because he worked on Sundays, and I did not like it; when I was going away, he said I had charged loaves to his customers.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the premises stand by themselves? A. There are some new houses about, I do not know whether any body lives there; I had given notice to the prisoner all that week, and when I went for my money he told me of having charged loaves to customers; I saw the prisoner bringing one long paving-stone to the premises. I shot down the bricks, and they were used for building the oven.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's premises, and received these laths, which had been taken down, and these timbers.</p>
               <p>MR. GOSLING. These belong to me - they are what I saw nailed up against the prisoner's premises; this piece of timber was in the pig-sty, and this was a rafter in the wash-house, and these laths were there; here are some of the stones here - I did not take any proceedings against the prisoner, when I heard of none of my property being on his premises; because I had had so much trouble to get him out, I should not have taken any steps had he not continued to take things - there was no argreement with him for a lease; it was on account of the difficulty of getting him from the premises that I took no steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is this agreement about getting him off the premises? A. I really do not know; it was done at Westminster Hall - I cannot tell whether it was settled by my solicitor and the other, before the trial came on; he continued on the premises after that; Higgs told me of this in July or August, and I believe the agreement was made in July, but I cannot tell exactly; I had had so much trouble I did not really intend to take any steps; I think it was on the 4th of October I went before the Justice.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; his father rented a house in Hanwell many years - the prisoner afterwards took the house of Mr. Gosling; I saw some stones removed from his father's premises to the bakehouse, at Mr Gosling's - his father's premises belonged to the Rev. Dr. Bond; four or five of the stones which are here I saw at the bottom of the truck, which the prisoner took from Dr. Bond's premises to the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Dr. Bond alive? A. No; it is six or seven years since I saw the stones on those premises - they then went to Mr. Gladman's, a painter, at Hanwell, and remained there till a few months ago, when the prisoner took the house of Mr. Gosling - I did not see them removed, but I saw them a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them removed? A. No; but I know they were at Gladman's in a box, and it was so weighty it could not be removed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the prisoner's father's house pulled down? A. Yes; I was called on to speak about the stones last night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you before that any conversation with the prisoner about them? A. No; last night was the first time I heard anything about this - the prisoner's father had some stones which were removed to Gladman's, and I saw them afterwards at the premises occupied by the prisoner at Mr. Gosling's - it was the same premises and bakehouse, used by his father before him - I saw these stones in the bakehouse, and one was laid down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you build the premises over the way. A. No; I am a baker - I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230089"></xptr>the bricks taken by Palmer - I swear he took no new ones; I cannot tell what he took at any other time.</p>

            . I am a baker. I know Palmer; he was my apprentice nearly two years ago; he said he was fourteen when he was put apprentice - he has left me about six months; from what I know of him I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Give us some reasons? A. He was in the habit of fetching yeast for me every day - he went to another place and got it cheap, and got threepence a day by me; he has acknowledged it himself oftentimes - another reason is, he got into bad company, and ran awya twice; if I sent him anywhere he has always told me lie - I sent him once to Wimpole-street, and went there two hours afterwards; when I got there he came to the gate - he told so many lies I could not believe him; here is a person here who told me he has acknowledged that he robbed me of 4s. a day, but I do not believe it; he took a pound of butter of mine and asked a young man to take it away, but he would not - I found the butter under the trough.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it because you found him in the daily habit of telling lies that you would not believe him? A. Yes. <rs id="t18281023-213-verdict1243" type="verdictDescription">

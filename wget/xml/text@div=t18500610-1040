                  </hi>. I am butler in the service of Mr. Barnes, of 16, St. James's-square. I was in the same house when he lived in Piccadilly, but living with him—that was near to the Duke of Cambridge's—it may be about six or eight years ago—I heard that Periera was in England last year, but I did not know her then—I do not know the day she came to my master's house this last time, but I think it was about 30th April—neither I nor my master were at home—I saw her the following day—in consequence of what I heard and what she told me, I Went tor Mrs. Parry's, and obtained from her this letter—it was produced at the police-court, and the male prisoner there said it was his writing—in consequence of the address which I got from Mrs. Parry, I went to Halsey-street, Chelsea, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Luck—I afterwards went a second time with Periera, and while we were there the two prisoners came in; and Periera directly said, "I come for my box, my sovereigns, my watch, and chain"—the prisoners looked at one another for a considerable time, and the male prisoner then said, "I do not know where your box is, I left your box in the cabin"—the female prisoner then took Periera by the arm, and took her into the back kitchen, or wash-house—I heard the female say, "Who is this gentleman you have brought? why did not you come yourself? who gave you out address"—she said she had lost it, but she got it again from Mrs. Parry—she said, "This gentleman comes from Mr. Barnes, the brother to General Barnes; he is to have my box"—the female prisoner then walked back into the kitchen, and seemed very much agitated and confused"; and when she got back, the husband said, "I do not know; I left your box in the kitchen, and I employed your agent, who made me pay very dear;" I think he said, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd "for clearing his luggage; you may go to him"</p>

               <p>conduct which she chose to adopt yesterday, inasmuch as sending for some paltry things which was forced on Mrs. Smith by Caroline Periera, is anything but reasonable or agreeable; Caroline Periera must know that she was continually bothering Mrs. Smith to accept presents from her; but as Mrs. Smith knows too well the character of East Indians, she would not accept her rubbish. Caroline Periera's conduct, in making Mrs. Smith a present of an Indian chair during her passage home, and again taking it away from her, shows a great deal of the pariah breed. The Chinese sewing silk in question, with the greater part of the English silk, Mrs. Smith only took it when Caro<lb></lb>line Periera said she would throw it overboard. As to the ivory card-case, it happens to be made of wood. The fact is, Mrs. Smith cannot reconcile such mad, baby tricks, as forcing presents upon people and then sending for them again, to the great inconvenience of the parties to whom they were given. In conclusion; as Mrs. Smith is about to leave for Ireland to-morrow, Monday afternoon, she cannot think of upsetting her baggage to oblige Caroline Periera's mad whims. When Caroline Periera can write to Mrs. Smith on a more agreeable subject, her address is 32, William-street, Cork, Ireland.")</p>

I returned from Madras last April, in the <hi rend="italic">Wellesley</hi>, accompanied by Mrs. Darwood and my five children—when I came down to Madras, I found my wife had engaged the prosecutrix, Periera, as nurse to my children during the voyage—to the best of my recollection, the <hi rend="italic">Wellesley</hi> sailed on 31st Dec.—the agreement with Periera was in writing, and I have it in my pocket (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—there is a lady here, Mrs. White, who will prove that it is in the writing of Mrs. Ford, the widow of the physician-general of Madras, my wife's father—Mrs. Darwood advanced Periera 150 rupees, which was half the sum agreed for—I took her on board ship myself, with the baggage, to look to the children; and when she came back she was going home—we were to sail next day or the day after, and she said she wanted money; and I said I could not give her money then—it is not usual to carry money in your pocket in India; but I said I could spare her six rupees, which I gave her—when the ship arrived off St. Helena, she made an applica<lb></lb>tion to me for money, and I gave her two sovereigns—I understood it was to buy clothes, and I was told she did buy clothes—she went ashore there with me and my wife—I am quite certain I gave her two sovereigns—when the ship arrived in England, I settled with her in the docks—I deducted the six rupees, the 150, and the two sovereigns—she did not make any objection to that—Mrs. White was present at the time—I paid her eleven sovereigns odd—I forget the odd money; it was a shilling or two; it was in silver—I calculated the rupee at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Francis, the steward, told me that was the exchange; and I said to the <hi rend="italic">ayah</hi>, in the hurry of coming away, if it was not correct, to come to me, and I would give her the balance; and I gave her our address—I did not know the exchange, not having landed, and I acted by Mr. Francis's calculation—the whole settlement proceeded on the rupee being worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the engagement was for rupees, not English money, and I offered to get rupees for her if she preferred them—I think she said she would rather have gold, but I am not very certain about that—no reference was made at the time to the written agreement—I never said I had got possession of the agreement, and had thrown it into the sea, or overboard, nothing of the sort—she did not make any claim for passage-money back—I</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a major in the 8th Madras regiment: he is now in India with his regiment. I am sister to Mrs. Darwood—I am lodging at 8, James-street, Westbourne-terrace—I have resided there seven or eight months—I was Irving there at the time the <hi rend="italic">Wellesley</hi> arrived in England—I was present when an address was given to the <hi rend="italic">ayah</hi>—I wrote it myself partly, I think altogether myself—Dr. Darwood began to write it—it was my address—I gave it into the ayah's own hands—it was written on board the <hi rend="italic">Wellesley</hi>—the object in giving her the address was that she might know where to find Dr. Darwood—he was not sure where he was going; Dr. and he came to my house first—I believe it was written on a card of Dr. Darwood's—the number of rupees she had was also written on the card—I know these two ear-rings to be my sister Mrs. Darwood's property—I have known her to have them about fifteen years—before her marriage I took them out from England—my sister was then in India they are English I manufacture—they were bought in London—I took them out as my own, and my father had another pair made, and gave to me, exactly like them, and my sister had these—I have from time to time since seen them—I have one of my own here—it is not an ear-ring now—it has been altered into a watch hook—I broke the ear-ring, and I afterwards had the top made into watch hook, but the top is exactly the same—I am quite sure these ear-rings are my sister's.</p>

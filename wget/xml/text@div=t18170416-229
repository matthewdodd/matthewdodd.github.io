            . I have been servant to Mr. Newman for two weeks. I was taken up on the 19th of March. I had gone to town with the carts on the Thursday before.

Peele said nothing to me before - He got on the cart, and threw the hay down-Day took it in. Peele told me to watch about, and tell him if any person came. We had some beer, and drove to town.</p>

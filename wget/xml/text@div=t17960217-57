               <p>I am a constable; on the third of February, 1796, I was in possession of Mrs. Holbird's house for the King's tax; Esther Cavannah gave me charge of the prisoner; in his pocket I found a broken telescope tipped with silver; she said she would swear to that being in the box when I packed them up; I told the prisoner I should take him to the Compter; he said, for God's sake don't take me, I will tell you where the things are; I made him no promises at all; I asked him where they were, and he said, in Golden-Fleece-Court, in the Minories, in a cellar which he paid a groat a week for the use of to keep his baskets in; he sells fruit about the street; I went with him and found the things covered over with some hay; I brought him back to Mrs. Holbird's, and the box with me; Esther Cavannah informed me they were all right; that is all I know, (produces the things).</p>
               <p>(To Esther Cavannah). Look at these things; whose property are they? - A. Mrs. Holbird's; she is confinement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. While she was in trouble, I moved all the furniture for her as quick as I could, for fear they should be seized; and I went to her in prison, and she desired me to sell these things to pay the taxes; I shewed the constable where I had put them for safety; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cavannah). What is Mrs. Holbird in consinement for? - A. For keeping a disorderly house, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner remove any of the things to avoid the taxes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hindes.) Did the prisoner remove any of the things that they should not be seized? - A. Not to my knowledge; the officer seized the things for the taxes, and sold the things for them.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

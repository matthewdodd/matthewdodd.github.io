                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe-maker. On the 8th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, I went to the Rose and Crown public-house, Crown-court, Islington, to measure a woman named Mary Bush, for some shoes—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another there—I believe he heard Bush give me the order for the shoes—he had the opportunity—she told me to send them home as usual—on the 13th, I sent them home by John Dwyer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to the prosecutor. I was sent with a pair of shoes to Mary Bush—my master had told me to go to No. 9, Rose and Crown-court, but I forgot the number, and I asked a woman at the top of the court, if she knew where a person of the name of Bush lived, and she told me at No. 7—I went there, and saw a man named Briant—I left the shoes with him, and told him they were for a woman of the name of Bush—as I was coming out of the court I saw the prisoner—he told me to give him the shoes, and he would give them to Mary Bush when she came in—I told him I had given them to Briant—he told me to go and bring them out of Briant's and give them to him—I did so, and then returned to my master—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I saw him again on the Wednesday morning following.</p>

               <p>You saw him walk up to the door? - Yes, and he appeared to stay some time there, and seeing a man and woman coming past, he went from one door to another, and he turned back, and in an instant he entered.</p>
               <p>That is the question I ask, when he went to the door, he went in an instant and shut the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says she was looking out of a two pair of stairs window, two doors from the house, on the same side of the way, how could she see the door shut or open, or how could she be positive to the person's face? - When he went into the house he had dark cloaths on, I saw his height, and I was the first that saw him when he came out of the house as the watchman held up the candle and I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you or did you not observe his face, so as to know his face before he entered? - That was impossible.</p>

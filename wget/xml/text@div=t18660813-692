                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the "Prince Alfred," Eleanor Road, Hackney—about a month or six weeks ago, at 8 a. m., Clements came in for a glass of sixpenny ale—it came to threehalfpence—he gave me a bad shilling—I returned it—he said that he only had one penny, which he gave me—on 30th of July Brown came in alone and called for a half-pint of porter and a screw of tobacco (I had noticed Clements pass and go down the Eleanor Road)—Brown drank the porter and gave me a bad shilling—he said that he had only one penny—I kept the shilling and Mrs. Empson tried it with caustic; this is it—I told him it was bad—he said that he humbly begged my pardon and I could keep it; he left—I went to the door and saw Clements, who turned back and passed again and went towards Hackney—Brown went the same way—I spoke to Mr. Eady—we had not tested the coin when he said that I might keep it.</p>

On 30th July Eady pointed out the prisoners to me riding in a cart in Church Street, Hackney—I stopped them—Clements was driving—I went to the horse's head and told Clements I wanted him; he would not stop, but kept going on—I kept the horse's head for perhaps fifty seconds, and then tried to get into the cart—I saw Clement's hand go into his breast; he drew out a small parcel—I got into the cart, and he made a motion as if he threw something from the cart—I stopped the cart—Hunt and Jessop came up, and Jessop handed me a parcel containing six bad shillings and four bad florins—two more bad florins, which fell out, were handed to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Hunt said that he saw Clements throw it from his hand out of the back of the cart—another constable came to my assistance—I took Clements—Mr. Eady came up and charged him—I searched him, and found a purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, a memorandum-book, and a pair of glasses—he said at the station that Brown was quite a stranger to him, he took him up on the road and gave him a lift.</p>

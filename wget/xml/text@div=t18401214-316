               <p>six to nine months—I knew them carrying on the business of lithogra<lb></lb>phers in Church-street, Soho—they were, I believe, in partnership—I had done some business for them, to a trifling amount—card-plates, their own door-plate, and articles of that sort—on Monday, the 9th of August, Mazeaux came to me and placed in my hand two papers—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was then a perfect, whole note—the other paper he produced, was similar to that, but printed in different colours, and had the figure "5" upon it—this has "25"—he asked me if I could engrave a plate to correspond with that paper—I had never seen any thing of the kind before—I looked at it, held it up to the light, and saw on the paper a water-mark—I said there would be a difficulty in getting paper with that water-mark on it—he said the persons he was executing the plate for, would get that themselves—I bad then a person named Gould in my em<lb></lb>ployment—he was present at the interview—he engraved in the shop, and was there in his business—I spoke to him on the subject, and then told Mazeaux we could execute it for him—he said the price was no object—he went away, leaving me both the papers—I saw him again, I think, on the same day—next day I went to Mr. Smart, a refiner and changer of foreign money—I consulted with him on the subject, and showed him both the papers—in consequence of what passed between us, I found out the Rus<lb></lb>sian Consul, and had an interview with him, I think, on the same day, Tuesday—I made a communication to him of what had occurred—Ma<lb></lb>zeaux came to me again that same day, and had both the notes away which he had left with me, and said he would ask whether the person would have them executed—(I have in my hand a little diary of the trans<lb></lb>action—I entered each circumstance as it occurred from time to time—this is the original paper which I wrote)—he brought back the note pro<lb></lb>duced, on the Thursday, I think—I never saw the other again—Ramuz and Mazeaux came together on the day it was brought back (prior to that, Mazeaux had asked me if I could engrave it for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said yes)—they came up to my bed-room, which is on the second floor, and gave me a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they said I was to go on with the note—one of them gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other gave three sovereigns—I do not remember any thing else passing—I then set about the engraving—while the engraving was going oh, I saw both Mazeaux and Ramuz a great many times—sometimes together, but more frequently Mazeaux—he came on several occasions, and I think about a month afterwards I showed him a rough print, which he took away with him—it was a proof—I once made a re<lb></lb>mark to Mazeaux, with reference to the paper, to print them, and he said he had not got it, but the party would get it—neither of them gave me any directions what I was to do with the note, or where I was to put it—the whole of the note was not a style of engraving which I could execute—I engraved the centre part of the front of this note—it has been cut to its present state for the purpose of engraving—a piece of the border has been lost in the progress of the work—I employed another person to do the border—there is also a border round the back part of the plate—(<hi rend="italic">For<lb></lb>rester here produced the plates</hi>)—this front plate is the one I executed without the border—it was from this plate the proof was given—this paper marked "Z," is the first proof I took from the plate—I gave it to Ma<lb></lb>zeaux—I applied to Mr. Bacon, an ornamental engraver, to do the border—he did the border for the back of the plate, and a plate was exe<lb></lb>cuted for the border round the front of the note—I had an impres<lb></lb>sion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140063"></xptr>
               <p>taken of the border he engraved, which I gave to Mazeaux—this is the border-plate which Mr. Bacon prepared—I went to the house in Church-street a great many times, and I showed the prisoners from time to time the progress that was making in the work—I saw Ma<lb></lb>zeaux transfer a print from the plate on to a lithographic-stone—I think Ramuz was not there at the time—after that I received directions from Mazeaux, respecting the back-plate—I saw Ramuz on the subject of the back-plate several times, and he asked me if I was getting on—this is the back-plate, which I executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them, at any time while the work was in progress, tell you what the notes or papers referred to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, both at different times—Ramuz said he would not have it known for any sum of money—some of them were engraved at that period—on one occasion Mazeaux said they were for some use, such as a banker or some person was to place them in such a position that they were to represent some which had been taken away—he said he was aware they were money, and that they were to be used, or placed in a drawer or box, where the good was taken away, and these were to have the appearance of the good, but they were fictitious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will endeavour to give his words—the subject was this, admitting they were good money—he said that they were to be used to represent money if the real money was taken away—I do not know how to explain the thing better—he said it was to be used in a way that if there was money in a drawer or box, if that was taken away, these were being manufactured to be placed in their stead—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect what led to this conversation—on one occasion I took a print to the house, and gave it into the Hands of Mazeaux, at the door—he opened the door—that was a print from the back-plate, without the border round it—I cannot recollect how many impressions altogether I gave to them—I gave them several—when I took the print Mazeaux told me the man they were executing the order for was present in their house, in their parlour—(I think that was about a month before the officers went)—I was in the pas<lb></lb>sage at the time—nobody was present then—in consequence of what he said, I watched outside the door after I left, and saw the prisoner Rault come out of the house—about three weeks after that I went to the house again, and saw both Ramuz and Mazeaux—they made an objection to the back-plate, saying it was not so good as they wished, and said that I had better get on with another plate instead of it—I agreed to do so, and came away—I went again about a week after—I do not recollect whether I took any thing with me then—the two plates were then in my possession—I saw Mazeaux—I took the plates about a week after—the original back and front plates—I saw Mazeaux then—I took a proof of the back-plate, and he did not like it—he said it was not good, and begged I would alter it, but he would show it to the gentleman it was for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said before, they objected to the back-plate, and you agreed to make another, and some time after you took the same plate, not a new one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I took the original ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do when you went with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left one of them, I think the front, but I cannot be sure—Ramuz called several times prior to the officers taking them, about other business which I was doing for them, cards and card-plates—I kept the back-plate by me—on the day they were taken into custody, which was on a Thursday, I went to their house, about half-past three o'clock, and saw Mazeaux and Ramuz</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140064"></xptr>
               <p>—they were both standing at the door—I went into the back-parlour with them—I gave into the hands of Mazeaux the front-plate, which he had previously brought back to me—(the back-plate was at my house then)—they said they wanted the thing finished—I went there that day, by arrangement with the officers—the officers came in soon after I got there—these impressions, marked "B, D, E, G, and K," were pulled off from the plates, and are similar to those I gave the prisoners at different times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever seen Rault at any other time than you have men<lb></lb>tioned seeing him coming out of Church-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him several times during the progress of the engraving—I have seen him in conversation with Mazeaux and Ramuz.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you bad asked him to show you the man, and he did show you, would you not have had an opportunity, by examining the man, of know<lb></lb>ing whether he (Mazeaux) told you the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I am compelled to give you that answer, because you put it in such a round about way, I do not know what answer to give you, I do not understand it—if I had seen the man it would have given me an opportunity of seeing whether Mazeaux had told me the truth as to whether he had employed him—I did not like to ask to see the man—I do not know that I had any reason to ask a man to show me his customers—I was at that time in com<lb></lb>munication with the Russian Consul for the purpose of detecting these men—I communicated to the Russian Consul that Mazeaux had told me the man who employed him was in the house, and that I did not ask to see him—I think that was about a month before they were taken up—I think I communicated it to the Russian Consul a day or two after Mazeaux told me—I never asked Mazeaux to show me the man after that communication—my house is about five minutes' walk from where Mazeaux and Ramuz lived—they are in debt to me now for various things—I gave them credit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver—I am at present lodging in Lon<lb></lb>don, but my residence is in Bath. In August last I was in Mr. Salt's employ<lb></lb>ment, and was there when the prisoner Mazeaux came there—he produced this note, and another with the figure "5" in the corner—it was of a similar appearance to this, the same language, I should say, but I rather think it was printed in blue—Mazeaux asked Mr. Salt if he could execute a paper similar to that—MR. Salt asked me if I thought I could do it—I said I thought I could, and Mr. Salt told Mazeaux he could do it—I remember Mazeaux saying something about the price being no object—he left the two papers on that occasion—he came again, I think, the next day, but I will not be quite positive, and took away the paper with the figure "5" in the corner—he left the other—I do not remember any thing that passed be<lb></lb>tween him and Mr. Salt at that time—after that I saw Mazeaux and Ramuz there—they generally came separately—I saw them together once, and they went up stairs to Mr. Salt's bedroom—he was then ill—I do not ex<lb></lb>actly recollect how soon that was after the one was taken away—I after<lb></lb>wards went to work on the plate—I engraved both sides, the front and reverse—I did not engrave any part of the border—it is not a sort of work which Mr. Salt did—it is done by a machine, and he is not a machine engraver—I remember being at work on the reverse plate when Mazeaux saw me at it, and he told me to put aside the paper, the original note, in case any one came in—it was at that time lying by my side, while I was working at the plate—these impressions appear to have been taken from the plate I engraved—I remember the, day the prisoners were apprehended—I do not recollect the day, but I remember its happening on a day—I did not see any one in company with them that day—I know the prisoner Rault—Mr. Salt pointed him out to me, (I cannot exactly say the time,) in Princes-street, right opposite Mr. Salt's shop, in the street, looking in at a shop window opposite—that was perhaps about a fortnight before Ramuz and Mazeaux were apprehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machine-engraver, and live in Angel-court, Skinner-street. Mr. Salt came to me the last week in August, and brought an octagon-shaped border—this is it, I believe—there was a piece cut out of the one he brought—I think I have a portion of it, but not with me—I cut it out, and reserved a portion—Mr. Salt brought me the border for the purpose of imitating each side of it—it required to be en<lb></lb>gine-turned</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City. In consequence of information I received, I went on Thursday, the 8th of October, to No. 22, Church-street, about three o'clock in the afternoon—there was an arrange<lb></lb>ment made beforehand for our being there—when the front-door was opened I went into the passage and opened the door on the right, which leads into a front parlour—I saw a person standing at the front-window, inside the front-parlour, doing something—I looked, and was turning round, when I saw Ballard open a door which leads into a back-parlour—there is a communication between the two parlours—Ballard was in the front-room at the time he opened the door, the door opened to him, to the best of my recollection, then I walked in, and he followed immedi<lb></lb>ately with my brother John—(he is an officer—Ballard is not now, he was formerly)—when I went into the back-parlour I saw Mazeaux, Ramuz, and Salt—they were standing nearly all together—I said, "We are officers," and at the same moment I took a plate from the hand of Mazeaux—I marked that plate afterwards—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">the front one</hi>)—the prisoners were brought into the front-parlour, and on a table in the front-parlour I found this border-plate, wrapped up in a piece of pa<lb></lb>per and this pocket-book—I presented the pocket-book and border-plate to Ramuz and Mazeaux, and said, "Do these belong to you?"—they said "No"—the paper which the border-plate was wrapped in was partly open, so as to be exposed—the pocket-book turned out to belong to Mr. Salt—I searched Mazeaux, but nothing transpired on his person con<lb></lb>nected with this affair—there was a printing-press in the back-room—I did not find any thing upon it—I took them into custody.</p>

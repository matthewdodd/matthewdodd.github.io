                  </hi>. I am a tobacco-manufacturer, of 86, High Holborn. On 26th March, a little after seven in the evening, the prisoner brought me a written order—I supplied him with the articles—he did not offer to pay for them, or ask for a receipt—he came back and asked for a bill—I said, "I will send the bill to-morrow when I send the other articles"—he did not say anything about paying.</p>

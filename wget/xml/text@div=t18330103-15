            . I am a City-officer. On the 5th of December I was at the end of Duke-street, West Smithfield - the prisoner passed me; he turned his head round two or three times, and looked at me - he had a bundle under his arm; he went up Cloth-fair - I followed, and stopped him, and asked what he had in the bundle; he said linen, which he was going to take to his washerwoman; I said, "You have something black there;" I untied the handkerchief, and found it was a coat - there was a shirt and flannel waistcoat with it; the coat was much too large for him - I said, "This is much too large for you;" he said No - I said, "What are you going to do with it?" he said, "I am going to take it to my washerwoman to pawn for a shillings;" I said, "Could not you have done that yourself;" he said he thought she might get more on it - I asked where he lodged; he said at the White Hart, Giltspur-street - he did not object to my taking him there; I found he had lodged there some time off and on, and the landlady said she had no doubt but the coat belonged to Mr. Mottram.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030023"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. When you said there was something black, what did he say? A. He said it was a coat.</p>
               <p>JAMES MOTTRAM. I never gave him permission to pawn it - he has brushed it for me once or twice, and I should think he knew it was mine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could any body in the house get into your room? A. Yes; it was used during my absence - it is on the third floor - the prisoner lodged in the garret.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the coat some distance down Snow-hill for 8s. - I took it home, and kept it till next day, when I was going to Hampstead after a situation; I wanted some money, and took the coat - I went before the Lord Mayor; the prosecutor was not in town; I was liberated on promising to come next day - I went and slept at the house, and, in order that the Policeman should not walk with me, I certainly went out of the way, but I went to Guildhall, and met the gentleman who owned the coat.</p>

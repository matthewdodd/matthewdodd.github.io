At half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 29th of April, I was going to my bed-room up one pair of stairs; the bedroom was open, and the cream cheese which had been near the door, was gone - I called my husband; he went down and sat down; but I went up again and called to Mr. Underwood, my lodger; they were in bed, but he came down and knocked against the prisoner; he said, Halloo! and brought her down; she had been on the second pair of stairs; I knew her by living in the court - but she had no right in my house; all the property stated was wrapped up in a parcel together, and was on the second staircase; it had been in my bed-room before - I had seen it all safe at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

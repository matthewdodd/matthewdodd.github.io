               <p>Q. Do you speak this from your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Green. I do, I shall mention nothing but what I know of myself, I was in the denomination of an undertaker myself; the coal-heavers wanted sixteen-pence a score, the undertakers would not give it; they kept off from work three or four days, then the undertakers were willing to give it; after that the coal-heavers would have eighteen-pence a score, then in a day or two they would have nothing to do with the undertakers, but would have it under the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since this disturbance began?</p>
               <p>Green. I think it began about the month of February last, several of the coal-heavers applied to me; then I got a recommendation to the Alderman, I was represented as a proper person, that I was in some degree master of it; upon which the Alderman sent me to Mr. Russel; in that time Justice Hodgson had taken them under his management: then Mr. Russel and I went down to Justice Hodgson, Mr. Russel made him acquainted that he was appointed agent by Mr. Alderman Beckford; they went into a room together, what discourse they had I cannot say; then Mr. Russel and I came home to my house, and to see for the most convenient place for an office for these men; it was our opinion Justice Hodgson's office was at too great a distance from the water-side; Mr. Russel naturally expected Mr. Hodgson would direct these people to him, as we let him know we had fixed upon an office at Billingsgate; the next day no coal-heavers came to be registered.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Green. I really cannot tell the day of the month, I believe it might be about the beginning of March; Mr. Russel then sent me down among these men, to let them know he was ready to register them at the office at Billingsgate, or any place where they should appoint; I went down and told them, several of them told me they had no objection to Alderman Beckford's appointment, but as they were under the direction of Justice Hodgson, they understood he was the Alderman's agent, and they would be directed by Justice Hodgson; then I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060023"></xptr> sent to Justice Hodgson by Mr. Russel with this complaint, to tell him Mr. Russel would give him a meeting at his house, or in Whitechapel, at the Angel, to consult to bring these men over, that there should be no mischief done. Mr. Hodgson said he had no objection to it, he could not conveniently come, but would send his clerk; but said I have this to tell you, if he does not desist, he will meet with trouble, and I will give him a pretty dance to Westminster-hall, for the act of parliament is in so vague a manner any body may keep an office; it is just like one publican keeping a pot of beer better than another, and as we have the best men at our office we need not fear we shall have the business?</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Hodgson any deputy?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, he had one Dunster, who had served him as clerk before, I have seen him in the Justice's office, giving receipts for ships loaded with coals, and likewise taking down the obligation for that payment, when the ship should be set to work; I have seen Dunster walking the streets with no less than 300 or 400 of these men.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Green. That was two or three days after that; then Mr. Russel advertised in the paper for men to come, still none of them came; then he advertised for them to come by such a time, or he would employ such able bodied men as chose to come; then many did come, and they were put in the gangs: this Dunster saw me doing this at Billingsgate, and he brought to my door I believe no less than 3 or 400 of these men; a great many of them threatened they would pull my house down; they said I had better be quiet, or they would do for me; this was one evening, between six and seven o'clock; they went away, some howling, some hallooing, and some pointing to me; I said, what I am doing is nothing at all; Mr. Alderman Beckford has appointed one, and I am accountable to Mr. Russel for what I shall do, and he will not suffer any mean thing to be done; Dunster was at the head of them; when they first came they did no mischief that time, several of them came back to the window (when it was coming dark) howling, saying they would have my life, and they would have my house down.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these?</p>
               <p>Green. They were coal-heavers, I knew a great many of them, my wife and family were very much terrified; I did not imagine but that they would act as they have; I had no arms in my house, only a brace of pistols; I loaded them, then I went to the Mansion-house to my Lord Mayor, in order to let him know the danger I was in; I did not see his Lordship, but I saw a gentleman that went to him; he said he could be of no service to me, and directed me to go to some magistrate thereabouts; they assembled four or five times before ever they attacked me.</p>
               <p>Court. Drop all that happened from this time to Saturday the 16th of April.</p>
               <p>Green. On that Saturday morning these men had put up some bills, a neighbour's servant went and pulled down one; the coal-heavers cried out, Green's maid has pulled down one of our bills; the girl ran over to her master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of the bills?</p>
               <p>Green. The purport was, that the advertisement was a libel upon Mr. Alderman Beckford, and that what was done was Mr. Russel's own doing; then directly they came running from different parts of Wapping-wall, and other parts, to my door; in less than fifteen minutes time I believe there might be upwards of an hundred at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Green. It might be about nine in the morning, I asked them what they wanted with me; they cried, by Jesus they would have my life if I offered to meddle with any of their bills; I said I had not meddled with any, nor none had that belonged to me; one of them cried, by Jesus he shall have a bill put up at his own window; he took up a handful of dirt, and put it upon the window, and put the bill upon it; another of them laid hold of my collar, and dragged me off the step of my door; another said, haul him into the river; said another, by Jesus we will drown him; I got from them, and retreated back into my house; I then said, gentlemen, you had better go about your business, for you may bring yourselves into trouble, one way or other; it is very hard people cannot be at quiet in their business, for such a pack of abandoned rascals as you; after that I went to Billingsgate, and met several of them there; there they threatened they would have my life, it was my business to go there on my duty; when I came home it might be between four and five in the evening; I think in about an hour after that I saw a great many of these people running from their different habitations, some with bludgeons or broomsticks, and weapons of that sort; they did not collect themselves in a body, but were running to the head of New Gravel-lane, I believe about 4 or 500 of them came within 200 yards of my house; they went to Mr. Metcalp, a neighbour of mine, and threatened him; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060024"></xptr> was one of them that was a pretended friend of mine, that had promised, when he knew of any thing against me, he would let me know, that I might get my wife and children out of the way, and be upon my guard; he came to my house with a great bludgeon; he said, if it had not been for me your house had been attacked some time before; I said, I see they are assembling, I hope you will not deceive me, but let me know if they mean to use me ill; he said he would be with me, and let me know before he slept; he said he be lieved they were going to get some man out of goal or spunging-house; I set up to guard my house, and I sent my wife and children out of the house; after that I prevailed upon my wife to stay in the house upon this man's intelligence; he came about twelve, and told me nothing was intended against me, that they had done their business they were about; I went to bed, and was asleep; I was awaked by my sister-in-law, calling, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, for God's sake, we shall be murdered, this was about one o'clock on the Sunday morning; I jumped out of bed, and ran into the next room where my arms were; I took and levelled one, and said, you rascals, if you do not be gone I will shoot you; they were then driving at my door and shutters, the noise was terrible, like a parcel of men working upon a ship's bottom, I could compare it to nothing else; I fired among them, I believe I fired about fourteen times, and when I had not any thing ready to fire, I throwed glass bottles upon them; they were at this about a quarter of an hour, when they all dispersed; they went away howling, as their manner is; I went down stairs, and found a pannel of my door broke, and two pannels of my parlour-window shutters broke, and I think five pannels of the different window-shutters of my tap room; this was the lower part of the house; I think below stairs and above there were twenty-five panes of glass broke, the sash over the door, the frame of it, was broke; they cried out, when I fired first (which was only powder) d - n you, Green, where is your powder and ball; I fired that morning only bird and swan shot, no ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen on the Sunday?</p>
               <p>Green. No, not in particular; I saw a flash of a pistol among the rioters, but it did not go off.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance might that flash be?</p>
               <p>Green. It might be about twenty or thirty feet from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was you in?</p>
               <p>Green. I was in my dining room in the front up one pair of stairs, the stones came in as thick as hail; I stood behind things as well as I could, to keep myself clear of them, from being knocked on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them might there be?</p>
               <p>Green. It was dark, I cannot form any judgment of the number: on the Monday I went to Billingsgate about eleven, I saw several of them there; they threatened me there, I saw Dunster there; they told me they would do for me if I did not desist in my proceedings, that was to register such people as applied; there were always some of the coal-heavers about Dunster, he talked of the advertisement that had been in the paper, and said they were mine; for he said Mr. Russel had told him he totally declined having any thing to say in it, and it was my doings only; I said, do not deceive these men, that is very wrong of you; I asked him, if Mr. Russel did not tell him he would advertise to this effect; I began to be afraid, as many of them came about me, I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the prisoners ever threaten you?</p>
               <p>Green. I cannot speak to any particular person that did, only the prisoner Cornwall and Flaharty; these two men were at Billingsgate among the others at that time; I knew Flaharty by fight before, he has a mole upon his face; I had seen Cornwall before, I know his person, but not his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these two men use any threatning words to you at that time?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, Cornwall did; he held his hand up and shook it, and said I had better be easy or I should be done for; I saw Grainger there, but do not remember he said any thing in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How many coal-heavers might there be at that time?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe there might be between fifteen and twenty. Nothing happened after that till the Wednesday night, that was the 20th about seven in the evening; then I saw a great many of these coal-heavers assembling together about three, or four hundred yards from my house, going up Gravel-lane; I went into my house again and heard a body of people hurrying; after I had been in about ten minutes, I saw them coming from Wapping-wall, there might be about four hundred of them; they went up Gravel-lane after the others; I heard they had been threatening to burn

He had been an undertaker, and was likewise under Mr. Russel as a clerk; her house was shut up all but the front street door; she said to me, I believe they will be with you by and by, for they threatened you at my door; I came home again, and I think I had not been in my house above eight or ten minutes before my opposite neighbour came and said, for God's sake, Mr. Green, get your house shut up, for they are a coming; I shut up as fast as I could, and told my wife to get out of the house as fast as she could with her children; accordingly she went away with the child that was asleep in the cradle; Gilberthorp was in the house drinking a pint of beer, (I did not know his name then,) said I, brother tar-pawling, (he is a seafaring man) I am afraid I shall have a desperate attack to night from what I have heard, will you stand by me and give me all the assistance you can; yes, said he, that I will; when the house was secured backwards and forwards, I went up stairs, some stones had broke some windows there, I believe some of them had thrown stones and ran away; I heard them call out Wilkes and liberty; I saw the neighbours lighting up candles; I said to my maid, for God's sake, light up candles, for these people shall have no occasion at all to use me ill; I said to Gilberthorp and

               <p>Q. How many candles might be then lighted?</p>
               <p>Green.

             was in the other room upon the same floor backwards, I was in the front room; I don't know where Gilberthorp was at that time, he had left me about two or three minutes before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know now where that gun was fired from?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I do not indeed, it was not fired in my house as I know of; if it was, it was quite contrary to my orders; there was a very great mob assembled about my house; they came round the alley and threw stones into my first and second story windows; I went to the window and begged of them to desist, and said if they knew any thing particular of me, I was willing to resolve any thing they wanted to know; I seeing I could not defend myself, I disguised myself and put on an old watch-coat and a Dutch cap, and went down stairs in order to get a magistrate to come and prevent my house from being pulled down; I had one Dunderdale a shoemaker that lodged in my house, he went down with me; when I came down to the back door I heard them threaten they would have me and have my life; I then found it impossible to get out of the house; I ran up stairs then, fully dermined to defend myself as long as I was able; I spoke to them again in the street from the window, and begged of them to desist from what they were about, and said I could not think why they were acting against me in so violent manner; I desired them to tell me what I had done; they called out in the street they would have me and hang me over my sign-post; others said they would broil and roast me, and words to that effect; stones came up very fast. I used to shelter myself against the wall behind the window, and at different times put my head out and talk to them from the sides of the windows; I saw a pistol fired, but it did not go off, that was about the time I ordered the lights in the second story.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening?</p>
               <p>Green. That I believe might be about half an hour after seven, or very near eight; stones came up very fast, they calling out, d - n you, Green, why don't you fire; others called out, where is your powder and ball; they said they would do for me before morning; stones were coming up quick and fast as they could; I said, I find my good lads, good words nor bad words would not do for you, come have at you; I took a brace of pistols from the table and fired among them, loaded with powder only; I then had recourse to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060026"></xptr> more arms; there was a great noise below of threatening; two or three of the first I fired had only powder; after that I kept firing away among them what arms I had loaded with bird and swan shot; they dispersed in the front then; I immediately ran backwards, they were heaving stones into the back chamber windows; I fired from the back chamber windows; after I had fired some few rounds backwards, they desisted from heaving stones into the back part of the house, but I did not find they had left the place; I stood and listened to hear if I could hear them say any thing backwards, I heard them say the bucks and the brothers would assist them on the back part all the night long; they did not do any thing; I went up to the window and found the alley backwards clear; I sent my servant maid out of the house to see who acted against me, that I might know them the next day; I bid her go to a house opposite the way, to have her eye about to see who she knew; she went over the way and did not come home that night; just after she was gone, I was again attacked both in the front and back part of the house; I fired among them sometimes from the front of my house and sometimes from the rear; I imagined they would have broke into the house presently, if I had not kept a warm fire upon them; I heard them call out several times, I am shot, some, I am wounded; still they said they would have me and do for me; after I had been firing upon them some time, they would go away and be a little easy, and leave off heaving stones; they generally howled when they ran off. I had various attacks in the night; I saw no fire-arms they had till eleven or twelve in the night; they were driving at the door about ten, but I cannot tell with what; I looked through the door and saw their hands moving, driving something hard against it. About twelve they fired into the house both in the front and the rear; the balls struck the cieling in the room where I was, sometimes close over my head, as they were in the street and I in the one pair of stairs, the balls went into the cieling and dropped down on the floor; I could not walk along the room with any safety, I was forced to place myself by the wall between the windows, and sometimes I would crawl under the window to the next, and sometimes I stood behind the brackets; then I would stand up and drive among them like dung; I have seen their balls strike the ceiling as I have stood under the cover of the wall, and as I have been going to fire they have come over my head, and some lodge in the cieling.</p>
               <p>Q. What size balls did they fire?</p>
               <p>Green. They were larger than buck shot, they were what may be called common musket ball; there were none came in at the rear of the house, the alley being narrow they could not stand to fire at distance enough to fire in to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this firing continue?</p>
               <p>Green. It continued all the night and all the morning at different periods.</p>
               <p>Q. How many balls might there be fired into the room where you was?</p>
               <p>Green. I saw many balls about the room the next morning; I remember I fired four of their balls back again; I never did count the balls; I heard them say at the time of the firing they would have my heart, and they would hang me over my signpost; I could not affect the mob from the back windows, the alley being so narrow, what I fired there went over their heads; when I attacked them backwards, I used to crawl out of the window on my belly, and lie upon the wash-house leads with my arms; I have heard them say, you that have arms are to fire upon him, and you that have stones are to heave, and so many to break the door, and so many to climb the wall; if they got up there they could get in at the window from the leads; I had Gilberthorp below to guard the door, for part of the front door was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since made any observations about how many balls came into your room?</p>
               <p>Green. There is the appearance in the cielings in the first and second stairs, of about 260 shot in the front, that is bullet marks, the ceilings are torn all to pieces; there are several small shot lodged in the window shutters below, they are without number; the pannel of the door that Gilberthorp guarded was broke that night; I got off I believe about nine in the morning, they continued so long firing, the longer the more desperate; they fired from the opposite windows; I saw them firing likewise out of the street door of Axford and Maplan; I could see them come to the door, and hear them say, there he comes, this might be about one or two in the morning; Axford lives at the Swan and Lamb, and Maplan the sign of the Ship; they held a continual rendezvous in the street and in the houses; they would stand in the entry, they would say, now you will have him; then there was firing; the lights of the houses were of service to me, those that discovered them to me, they ordered the people to take their lights down; they shot from the rooms opposite me between six and seven very desperately, and on till towards nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How far are those windows from your windows?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060027"></xptr>Green. I measured the ground, it is about twenty feet, (the mob took possession of these houses as I heard without the people's consent;) about nine I had no more ammunition left, only the charge that I had in my blunderbuss, except what were in the musket that would not go off, so I said to the men that were in the house, you see they are firing from every quarter, there is no help for me, they will come in, and I can make no return upon them to check their insolence; the best way to make them desist is for me to get out of the house, you will all be very safe whether I make my escape or not; Mr. Gilberthorp said, do what you think best; I said, they only want me, if they get me it is all over, or if they know I am gone they will desist; I took my blunderbuss over my arm, and my drawn hanger in my hand, and went out of the back window upon the leads; I saw several of them in the alley, I levelled the blunderbuss at them, and said, you rascals, be gone, or I'll blow your brains out, especially you, (that was to one under me) but I scorn to take your life; he said, God bless you, Mr. Green, you are a brave man; he clapped his hand on his head and ran away; I went over into Mr. Mereton's ship-yard, one of the shipwrights met me; just as I jumped, he said, Mr. Green, follow me; he took me to a saw pit, and shewed me a hole at the end where the sawyers use to put their things; he said, go into that hole, you will be safe enough; said I, don't drop a word but that I am gone over the wall; I got in, he left me; there I lay till the guards came; I heard the mob search for me; some said he is gone one way, some another; they were got into the yard, I heard one of the shipwrights say he is gone over the wall, and gone away by water.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there before the guards came?</p>
               <p>Green. They came in about half an hour after; then one of the shipwrights came to me and said the guards were come, and desired to know what to do; I did not know what to do, fearing they might shoot me from one of the chamber-windows as I went along; he went and consulted, and said he would take their opinion; after that he came to me and told me it was Mr. Mereton's opinion, it would be best to surrender to the guards; my opinion was to lie there till high water, that it came up to the wharf, then to go and surrender to my Lord Mayor: I was told if I should be found there they would cut me to pieces; then I said, go and tell the officer to draw his men up and come into the yard, and I'll surrender myself to him; the soldiers came, and I came out of the saw-pit; I had nothing but my handkerchief about my head; I had been wounded between ten and eleven at night; I surrendered myself to the officer; Justice Hodgson said, Mr. Green, you are one of the bravest fellows that ever was, who do you intend to go before, me, or Sir

               <p>Green. Davis never fired a gun the whole night.</p>

               <p>Green. I believe he did fire five or six times.</p>

               <p>Green. I cannot take upon me to say whether it was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was it that you saw the flash in the pan of a pistol?</p>
               <p>Green. I saw the flash of a pistol before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you took the resolution to fire among them?</p>
               <p>Green. That might be nine, I cannot justly say, it was after I gave them notice that I would fire several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many balls might you fire away that night?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe I fired away 108, I fired at every opportunity I had, to keep them from attacking my doors and window-shutters; I told them I would do it, and bid them take care of themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the pannel of the door broke?</p>
               <p>Green. I think that was broke about ten; sometimes they would cry, d - n the bouger, all his powder and ball is gone; as soon as I discharged my piece, I supposed the door was broke; I ran down stairs, intending to fire out at the hole; I placed myself under the broken pannel, then I saw it would not do for me there; I said to Gilberthorp,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060028"></xptr> do you take them at one side through this broken pannel, so I went up again to guard my house there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they begin to fire?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe they began to fire about twelve o'clock; they flung a number of stones, there are a wheelbarrow full of stones of a heap now that were throwed into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess where that ball came from that struck the cieling just over your head, was it from opposite or from one side?</p>
               <p>Green. It seemed to be from rather on one side, it was from out of the street.</p>

               <p>Crabtree. He stood on the opposite side to Mr. Green's, I think he went into Mr. Axford's house, and returned again, and fired several times; this I saw as I stood at my own door; I saw the prisoner,

            , go up a passage opposite my house, and fetch a musket, and go to Mr. Green's house, and fire it against his house.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance was he from Mr. Green's house when he fired it?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. He stood on the opposite side the street, and fired it upon an angle, or aslant, he stood about ten yards from Mr. Green's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. I think, as he came through the passage, he said he would be revenged of Green; he then was crying.</p>
               <p>Clarey. Mr. Green had shot my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the general cry of the mob?</p>

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you saw Cornwall fire?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. That was about six o'clock; I heard firing before I opened my door, or got out of my bed; I saw Mr. Green fire several times, in order to drive them away, and I saw them attempting to break his door with an ax; there was a gun fired out at the door that did no execution; the second fire from thence I saw wound a man in the cheek; I saw him drop the ax, and run over the way; then he dropped himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who that was?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. That was Clarey's brother?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the cobler was shot?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. I believe he was shot on the Wednesday night about eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him killed?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. No, I did not, I heard the firing, but I did not go out of my house: afterwards I stepped out, and found a man was killed; the people were then breaking Mr. Green's windows.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Clarey that was killed doing with the ax.</p>
               <p>Crabtree. He was cutting with it at Mr. Green's pannel of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might that be?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. I believe that night between eight and nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Cornwall did not fire up in the air?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. I saw him firing slanting, pointing towards Mr. Green's house, as by the levelling of the musket it seemed to be; I do not think he intended to fire up in the air.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Cornwall before that time?</p>
               <p>Crabtree. I knew him some years before.</p>

             there; when Mr. Green fired out at the door, and killed Clarey's brother, I was at my own door; I heard the discharge of the guns; I saw Clarey's brother drop, it took him in the cheek and neck; Clarey said, O my brother, my brother is killed, I will have satisfaction, I will have blood for blood! after that I saw him with a musket in his hand.</p>

               <p>Anderson. That may be about half an hour after; he went to fire it opposite Mr. Green's house at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060029"></xptr> his windows; it being a wet morning, it would not go off; he tried it several times, but at last he did fire it off; after he had fired it he went in at Mr. Axford's, a public-house right opposite me; the piece was loaded, but by whom I cannot tell; he went out again, and fired at Mr. Green's house; thus he did seven or eight times, if I was to say ten or a dozen I should not tell a lie; and I saw Richard Cornwall keep firing just in the same manner; I saw his piece miss fire to, he fired seven or eight times.</p>

               <p>Evenerus. There are three houses between my house and his, I live on the same side the street; I saw Clarey fire several times at Mr. Green's house; he was sometimes by himself, right opposite Mr. Green's house, and sometimes nearer my house; he missed fire about three times, he stood watching for Mr. Green's head coming out at the window, a s I apprehended; at another time I saw him with a cutlace, and another time with a pistol that he pulled out of his pocket, but I did not see him fire it; I heard him say the rogue had shot his brother, and if he could have him out he would hang him on his sign-post; there were many people standing by my house, fearing Mr. Green should fire upon them.</p>

There is no need to wonder at his saying that, he knowing I saw him; on the Wednesday night I saw him throwing stones and brickbats at Mr. Green's window, and I saw Peter Flaharty throwing stones or brickbats in; I saw Cornwall, Lynch, and Murray there on the Wednesday night, all throwing stones and brickbats at Mr. Green's windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of these five there the next morning?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did, that was the Thursday morning; I saw Flaharty, Clarey, Lynch, Cornwall, and Murray, all on that morning firing at Mr. Green's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention what you saw of each separately.</p>
               <p>Cummings. I saw Clarey fire several times at a very little distance from the house; he fired into the house when he saw Mr. Green coming to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the morning was this?</p>
               <p>Cummings. This might be from near four in the morning till towards seven at times; he pointed his gun up to Mr. Green's window; I saw Murray fire several times at Mr. Green's house; I happened to be down at King James's stairs, and there saw him buy powder and swan shot that same morning a little before six; he bought them of Mr. Potts. I saw him load his piece as he stood cross the way from Mr. Green's with them; I said to the boy that had sold him this powder and shot, sirrah, do you know what you are about; he said, O dear, call him back again; I answered, do you think I want to be killed myself; he came to the corner of Wapping-wall, I followed him; he stood there some time to see if Mr. Green came towards the window; then he went a little farther to Murphy's door; when Mr. Green came towards the window, he called, d - n his eyes, I have him now, and fired his piece at him.</p>

               <p>Cummings. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Murray fire any more?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I saw him fire a dozen times after this, all at Mr. Green's house; when Mr. Green came towards the window, Murray would swear and blaspheme all the time; I saw Peter Flaharty fire at Mr. Green on that Thursday morning, between four and five o'clock; whether it was a musket or a fowling-piece I cannot tell; it was a gun, I saw him firing at his house, both forwards and backwards, and I heard him make use of such expressions as are not proper to mention; he said he would have his heart, liver, and lights, and hang them cross his sign-post; I heard Clarey,

In the morning about seven I came there again, then I saw Cornwall standing over the corpse which was in a shell, with a piece in his hand, and look up at the window divers times, and kept it levelled over the cove of Mr. Green's window; at last he fired, and I heard the shot slap against the window or sign-post; then he said, d - n him, I have done for him.

            . My house is right opposite Mr. Green's house. On the Wednesday night about eleven o'clock, I saw the soldier named Wake killed by Mr. Green's door; I saw Cornwall and Murray there; I shut my door up about ten, and went to a room up one pair of stairs, and looked through a pane of glass that was broke, and between three and four in the morning I saw Cornwall from the street firing into Mr. Green's house; he stood on my side the street slanting, and fired at the one pair of stairs window, the lower sashes were up, it was the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see him fire?</p>

I saw him four or five times; during that time I saw Mr. Green in his dining-room walking backwards and forwards; when Cornwall had an opportunity of firing he made a run of it; this continued till eight o'clock; Mr. Green looked and pointed at me, meaning (I believed) if I could see any enemy coming, to give him a signal; I acted upon that belief, and gave him signals when somebody were going to fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any more of the prisoners there?</p>
               <p>Burk. I saw Murray fire in at the window in the same manner as Cornwall did; there were two men got into my house the back way, I did not know either of them; they came in with two pieces, and said they must go up stairs; they fired from the first pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>

               <p>Q. How was the soldier killed?</p>
               <p>Burk. There was a man breaking Mr. Green's door with a hatchet; the soldier came and stood behind him, he made a motion to stop down, and seemed to have a mind to help him, and I believe it was Mr. Green fired down from a window and killed the soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>

               <p>Mr. Green at first did not know me because I had not any soldier's clothes on, I have not had a soldier's coat on since I have been in the army; that night when this affair happened at Mr. Green's, I was drinking a pint of beer at a distance in the same lane where he lives, at the Wheat-sheaf; we had nothing to do; we heard a great noise of men with cutlaces going along the streets, they knocked them against the sides of the houses and stones; we went to Mr. Blow's and drank a pint of beer, and eat a mouthful of victuals; there were four or five people came in with cutlaces and bludgeons, and told us if we did not come out directly we shall all be murdered, Mr. Green had killed two or three people; they drove us out before them, the landlord went with us; word came that the soldier was killed; when Justice Hodgson came I went to him and said, here is a soldier killed, will you give me liberty to go to the Tower and fetch a party of soldiers; he told me, no, it was too late; this was done I believe about half an hour after ten o'clock; I said, I knew if I went to the Tower they would send men, especially as there was murder committed; he told me he would give no order; I said, perhaps by the morning the murderer will be gone; he said, then let three or four surround the house all night; before I went up there that man was in the shell; when I was drinking at Axford's house I had never a sword, stick, or cutlace, or any other instrument as I shall answer it to the great God. I saw three men with muskets in their hands, one of them is here at the bar, the other two are not; they were loading them with something, I do not know what; I saw nothing but powder; one of them said, why don't you take a gun or pistol, you have been in the army, you see one of your brother soldiers is killed, you ought to have your brains blown out; I own I did put powder in a piece; I went over to the shell, (Mr. Green said to me he believed he had killed thirty, and that he believed they were buried in some hole,) I said that man shall never go so, I'll die by him first, I will stand over him till the guards come down; I went and stood over him with the musket in my hand till they did come; they asked me what I was doing; I said I was standing there that he should not be buried, as it was reported many had that Mr. Green had killed; I went home with the musket in my hand, and a man came and said it was his musket, who it was that brought it to Axford's I know not.</p>

               <p>Flaharty's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at my lodgings between six and seven over night, and went out the next morning at six, but I had neither cutlace or weapon of any sort; the woman that has charged me she does not appear herself, but has hired two more to swear against me to take my life away; I never was guilty of a riot in my life.</p>
               <p>M'Cabe's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all about it, I never fired out of a gun in my born days; I suppose Mr. Green has bribed them to swear this; if they were to give me never so much money I could not fire out of a gun.</p>

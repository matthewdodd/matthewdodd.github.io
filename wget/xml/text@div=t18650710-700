                  </hi>. I live at 105, Hackney-road—the prisoner is my husband—we were married about a fortnight before Christmas—on Monday night, the 9th of May, we went to bed about eleven o'clock as usual—we were both sober—we had been quarrelling during the day—I went to sleep—I awoke with a feeling of something at my throat—I cannot tell how long I had been in bed—I instantly jumped up, and made my way to the window—there was blood about my throat—I cannot say how much—I saw ray husband, he had an ice spoon in his hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was holding it in his hand—he said nothing to me—I went out of my bed room into the next room, and out of that room into the cistern, and from the cistern into the yard—there was water in the cistern—it is about ten feet from the ground—I jumped from there into the yard—I tried to get over the palings, and I got over—I then turned round and saw my husband in the little room, at the window I got out of—I got over the wall at the bottom of the garden, and went into the next house up stairs—I remember nothing more—I was not cut any where else besides the throat—I know this razor, it is my husband's—it was kept in all places, sometimes down stairs, and sometimes up stairs—sometimes he would shave in the kitchen, sometimes in the bed room, and sometimes in the parlour—this knife was kept in the shop, and sometimes in the parlour—it is a confectioner's shop—my little finger was cut, I cannot account for how that was done—my husband and I attended to the shop—we had no servant—no one else lived in the house.</p>

Q.</hi> How long after you went to bed did you feel this at your throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as possible it was twenty minutes or half-past 6 in the morning—my husband had treated me with the greatest kindness since we have been married—he has been subject to sudden fits of gloom and despondency since he lost his money—he has very often told the customers that they had come in to rob him—the day before this occurred he went into the garden and tore up the ground with his mouth, or endeavoured to do so—on the day this happened there had been a quarrel between us, and I had run into the shop and made a noise before the customers—he did not threaten me in any way while we were in bed; he only said he did not think I should have disgraced him—I had struck him whilst in the shop—he did not say a word to me while he was standing at the bed-side, or while I was getting out of the window.</p>

I could not tell whether he was dressed or not.</p>

I am a surgeon at 85, Church-street—I was called to Mr. Wood's house on this morning—I got there about twenty minutes to 7—I saw the prisoner first at his house—he was in the back room on the left hand side—his throat was out—it was a clear incised wound right across the throat about five inches in length and two inches in depth, cutting through the gullet and the wind pipe—I afterwards went in next door and saw Mrs. Moretti—I found her throat was out—it was a triangular cut, about three inches by two—the wind pipe was severed—I attended to them both, and they were afterwards removed to the hospital—the wound on the wife's throat was a dangerous one—it might have been dangerous to life, if it had been left alone—the prisoner's wound was, I think, more dangerous than hers—there was a very slight swelling on the back of Mrs. Moretti's head—it might have been caused by a fall or anything—this razor might have been used for the man's throat—I cannot say whether it was used for the woman; it was a different kind of cut—the razor might do it—I don't think the knife could have done it; I don't think it would be capable of doing it—I don't think it was done with that knife.</p>

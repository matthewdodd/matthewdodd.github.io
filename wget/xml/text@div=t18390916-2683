                  </hi>. I am one of the Society of Friends, and am a hat<lb></lb>manufacturer, and live in Castle-street, Southwark. I have stables at Jackson and Ranson's yard, in Worcester-street, and one at the back of my house—the prisoner was in my service as carman, and had the care of the horses food in Worcester-street—a man of the name of Langford has the care of the horses in the stable at the back of my house—on the 15th of August, I had about ten sacks of oats from Thomas Bax—I was informed is was delivered at the stable in Worcester-street—I directed the prisoner that the corn should be kept in the stable in Castle-street—on the 27th, from information I received, I called the prisoner into my counting-house—I asked him where he had taken the sack of oats to—he said, "What sack of oats?"—I said, "You had better tell me the truth, you see I know about it"—I did not know Redford personally, but he had been employed to cart some loads of rubbish away—I gave the prisoner in charge in the afternoon—I went before the Magistrate, and he asked where Redford was—he was not in custody—he directed a warrant to be issued, and he was taken, but before he was taken he came to my counting-house—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I went to his place, and there found a sack, which was Thomas Bax's, and I have no doubt it was one in which my corn had come—the prisoner had no authority to deliver one of these sacks to any person, but to take the corn to my stable in Castle-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Jackson and Ranson, in Wor<lb></lb>cester-street—our counting-house is on one side of the yard, and my house on the other. I know Mr. Cooper's stables—I heard his corn was to be removed, and a day or two after I was crossing the yard, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner lowering a sack of corn from the loft door—I said, "George, you have begun your job?"—he answered, "Yes," and I undid the rope for him that he had lowered the corn down with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Cooper. I attend the horses into Castle-street—the prisoner never brought any of the ten sacks of corn to the stable, nor any alter the 15th of August—he brought a small quantity at a time, about a quarter of a sack to feed the horses—if any sack was lowered from the loft by the prisoner on the day mentioned by Mr. Ellard, I have never received it—I was at Worcester-street, at the stable, the day before that—the prisoner was there—I saw a sack of corn up in the loft, separate from the other sacks, with a cord tied round it—I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with it—he said, "I was going to lower it down to take over to your stable, but I have not time to do it</p>

               <p>to-day, I will do it to-morrow"—it was a sack like this—there was no corn brought to Castle-street—I did not notice whether the sack had the mark of Mr. Bax on it—I went the next day to the stable in Worcester-Street, and found the sack was not there—it never came to the stable in Castle-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 167.) I received charge of the prisoner for stealing a sack of corn—he said he had lent k to Mr. Red<lb></lb>ford—I went to Redford's the same afternoon—(he is a carman)—I did not find it—I searched for it in the stable—it was not there—I returned to the station-house, and found Redford in custody—in consequence of what he said, I went back to the stable, and then found this sack without the corn, under the manger, covered with some litter.</p>

I was a little elevated in liquor. I did not feel the woman taking the watch nor the money till she was going away; then I had the presence of mind to feel for my watch, and it was gone. Then I said hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you together?</p>
               <p>Morrison. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any familiarities pass?</p>
               <p>Morrison. No: Then she denied the watch, and made several protestations, and opened her bosom for me to search her. Then the watch came up, and some people, and used me ill. When the watchman came, I gave charge of her. She was carried to the watch-house, where she was searched, but nothing was found on her. Mr. Barrett, the constable, coming by, asked what was the matter; and there was a woman in the watch-house that saw the watch hanging by her side; the seal was tuck'd under her petticoat-string behind. I lost the two shillings at the same time, I cannot say out of which pocket. I don't know what money I had; she owned to taking five shillings to the mistress of the watch-house. I can safely swear I had two shillings in my pocket; I received eight or nine that night, some of one Mr. Gold, and some of a person in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the woman had you the watch?</p>
               <p>Morrison. I am very sure I had it when I met her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out while you conversed with her?</p>
               <p>Morrison. No.</p>
               <p>- Barrett. I am the officer. I saw this woman at the watch-house. I went to know what was the matter, and there was a noise about a watch and some money that was lost. Some people appeared to her character, and said he was drunk, and lost his watch, that I was almost persuaded of her innocence. A woman that was a prisoner said she certainly had the watch. I then searched her, and found it between her legs in her hand; I believe she was going to shift it. (The watch produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) There was no money found upon her. She could not tell what to say, she seemed confused. He was a little in liquor, he was not drunk; he had a black eye, and had been ill used. He told the number and maker's name of the watch directly; he was sober enough to know what he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down Drury-lane; this man met me, and took me down Steward's-rents, and asked me to oblige him. I asked him to make me a present; he said he would go and get change; I would not trust him, so he gave me the watch while he went to get change, and then he wanted to have it again; on my refusal, he brought three watchmen to take me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you give her the watch?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

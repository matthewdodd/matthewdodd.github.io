On the 16th of November I met the prisoner, (who was a stranger to me,) at the bottom of Holborn, with a friend of mine, who asked me to go and have a glass with him; the prisoner went with us - we then went to another public-house in Smithfield, stopped there some time, and then went to a pie-shop in Long-lane; the prisoner and I had several pies together - my friend had left us - I had a great coat tied in a bundle, and when I came out of the shop he snatched it out of my arm, and ran away with it; I have not recovered it- I met him on the Wednesday, coming out of a coffee-shop, and took him.</p>

The prisoner and prosecutor came in, and in about twenty minutes, the coat laid on the form; the prisoner took it up, and put it on his lap, and after having more pies went out with it under his arm; and in five minutes Howard came back, and asked if I had seen the man; he said, "I am done, and robbed;" I said, "What, of your coat?" he said Yes - I am sure the prisoner took it out of my shop; they had been drinking, but Howard was quite sober.</p>

               <p>HENRY GRAHAM. On the 6th of November I went with the prisoner to the bottom of Holborn, to buy some cloth, and on returning met Howard, who I had not seen for twelve months, and from eleven o'clock to half-past four, we were drinking with another friend - they were singing among very low company, and at half-past four o'clock I left them in a public-house; I wanted to get Howard away, but could not; they were all very merry.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EVANS. I took the prisoner in charge on the 18th of November; he said he had been in the prosecutor's company, but had returned him the bundle.</p>

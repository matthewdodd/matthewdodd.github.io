            , and John Vaughan: On the 15th of February, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to our house; I did not know him before, I discounted two bills for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him first? - A.In the fore banking-office; my partner, Mr. Vaughan, had referred him to me, and at the same time gave me two bills.</p>
               <p>Q.What were the amount of those two bills? - A. Six hundred and fifty pounds each, (Produces them); I have had them ever since, excepting when they were before the Magistrate, and the Grand Jury; when I received them, I desired the prisoner to endorse them, which he did in my presence; I then took possession of the bills, and gave him the money for both, deducting the discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how you paid him? - A. Yes; I gave him a one thousand pound note, two one hundred pound notes, a fifty pounds note, a thirty pound note, and seven pounds seventeen shillings and ten-pence in money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Have you not recollected this from referring to your book? - A. The book is here, (produces it); I took the notes from Mr. Potts, who made the entry; I was present when the prisoner was apprehended the day following, Sunday the 16th, at a pastrycook's-shop, in Newgate-street; from that pastrycook's, he was taken to Mr. Burton's Finsbury-terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from the prisoner where he lodged? - A. I heard him say, at the pastrycook's, that the notes were at his father-in-law's, in Finsbury-terrace; in consequence of which we went to Mr. Burton's; I went up stairs, and he desired them to be brought, and the notes were all brought down except the thousand pound note, and the thirty; there were others which I did not claim; the notes were delivered to Carpmeal.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen them since? - A. Yes, I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those notes part of the notes that you had paid to Mr. Dawson at the time you discounted the bills? - A. Yes; I asked him what had become of the thirty pound note -</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Had you not stated to him that he had better confess? - A. I believe, something of that sort might be said.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020049"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Then we must not hear any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. I received the notes at Bow-street, after the examination, they were delivered to me by Sir William Addington. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing at all about the one thousand pound note? - A. Yes; at Finsbury-square I had a one thousand pound note delivered to me by Mr. Burton, the father-in-law of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the one thousand pound note that you had given to the prisoner at the time he produced the bills to discount? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation respecting it, in the prefence of Mr. Dawson? - A. Yes; I asked for the one thousand pound note, and I was informed, by some person present in the room, that Mr. Burton had received that note, and was gone to look for it for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.Which of your partners was it that you gave the six hundred and fifty pound bill to? - A.

               <p>THOMAS CARPMEAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I was employed to apprehend the prisoner: I went with Mr. Fuller, about four o'clock on Sunday the 16th of February, to a pastrycook's-shop, of the name of Nicholl, I think, in Newgate-street; upon going into a back-parlour I found the gentleman at the bar, and a man with him; we put him into a coach, and took him to Mr. Burton's, at Finsbury-terrace, where he said he lived; I took him into the parlour where his mother, Mrs. Burton, was; I had been in the morning and searched the place, but could not find the notes; she said, that after I was gone, she had broke open a bureau, or a scrutoire, I don't know which, and took out these notes belonging to him; we waited till Mr. Burton came in, which was in about half an hour; there were several inquiries made of him where he had been, and he produced a one thousand pound note, and Mr. Fulier said it was not belonging to him; Mr. Burton said, he had received it in a note sent from the prisoner that morning, he said that in the prisoner's presence; he then produced another one thousand pound note, saying he had received it from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Are you sure the prisoner was present at this time? - A. I have no doubt of it; that second one thousand pound note Mr. Fuller said was his; I said, very likely the other belonged to somebody else, and I should keep them both; I took possession of them, and of the notes that I received from Mrs. Burton, I kept them till we got to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this sealed parcel? - A. This is the parcel containing the notes, there are two of one thousand pound, two of one hundred pound, a fifty pound, two of twenty pound, and three of ten pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. The one thousand pound note, the two of one hundred, and the fifty, are part of the notes that I paid for the bills.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There is one observation I wish to make: Carpmeal just now observed I was present at the time Mrs. Burton gave him up the notes; I was not present; for I never saw Mr. Burton from the time that he came into the house till I went out, for when these notes were given up, they were up stairs and I was below.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Carpmeal.) Q. Was the prisoner present or not? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. The notes delivered by Mrs. Burton, were delivered in the presence of the prisoner; the one thousand pound note delivered by Mr. Burton was delivered in his absence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Mr. Whitfield, of Covent-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020050"></xptr>Garden Theatre, and Mr. Boulton, of Charing-cross, who deposed that his character had been perfectly honourable upon all occasions.</p>

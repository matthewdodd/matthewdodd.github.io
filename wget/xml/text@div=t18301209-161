On the 4th of November I wrapped up four marked half-crowns in a brown paper, and gave them to Ryan, my porter, to put into the till, about eight o'clock in the morning - the prisoner was taken into custody about nine the same morning; he was desired to produce the money he had about him, and among the rest he produced one of the half-crowns I had marked and given to Ryan - I had looked into the till, and one of the four half-crowns I had given to Ryan was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he present when you looked into the till? A. He was in the back of the shop - I had at one time turned Ryan off, but he has been in my employ since; I do not know that he and the prisoner had had any quarrel.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since you dismissed Ryan? A, About twelve months, and then I took him again; he is a very honest man.</p>

            . I received the four half-crowns, and put them into the till, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning, while the prisoner was at breakfast; I staid in the shop about ten minutes, till he returned, and then I went to my breakfast - we were then both called in, and asked what money we had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the till before you put them in? A. I took all the money out, and left nothing but these four half-crowns, one shilling, and one sixpence; the prisoner has never given change when the till could not provide the change - that has never happened; I have never returned when I could not get change, and got it from the prisoner - no customer came while I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not often said to me, "Have you got a shilling or two, or whatever it might be?" A. Never, on my oath.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it after you deposited the four half-crowns in the till, before he was taken up? A. About twenty minutes - I went to the back of the shop to get my breakfast, at twenty minutes before nine; I returned in about ten minutes - I do not know what passed in that time; there was no one in the shop, on the grocer's side, when I went away nor when I returned -I did not keep my eye upon the prisoner till he was taken; he went up in the warehouse for something - there was a shilling and a sixpence in the till; my master examined the till.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you take him? A. Near nine o'clock - he produced the money himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Heritage knows he has applied to me for change, and when there was not enough in the till, he has said to me, "Have you got so much in your pocket?" I have given it to him, and he has paid me again out of the till - Ryan knows I have often sent him for change, and when he has not got it, I have been obliged to go up stairs and get it out of my box; the prosecutor never came down till eight or half-past eight o'clock, and before that time I had the whole management of the shop - I was anxious not to let customers go, and I gave them change if I could.</p>

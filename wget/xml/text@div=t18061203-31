            . I am a constable of Bow. On the 17th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going up Stratford, the prisoner at the bar met me with the wheelbarrow, he stopped and asked me if I would buy it, I asked him how he came by it, he told me that the foreman of the docks had given it him, he asked me five shillings for it; I saw the barrow marked M T. I told him the barrow belonged to Mr. Mackintosh, I took him in custody, and the barrow I put in the watchhouse, and I wrote a note to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030025"></xptr> Macintosh.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked for a gardener at Poplar, he had but one barrow, I asked a navigator to lend me a barrow, he said take it and welcome; I took the barrow and used it for three months in the ground; I left that master, and I said he should not have the pleasure of using the barrow after he turned me away. I worked afterwards for Mr. Thomas of Bow; I took the barrow out to get a bushel of coals, I happened to spend the money; that man asked me to sell the barrow, he asked me to take five shillings for it; I told him I would not sell it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Laura Terrace, Devonshire Road, Forest Hill—I had lodgings to let—on 16th December the prisoner called and inquired about them—he engaged to take a bedroom on the first floor and sitting-room on the ground-floor—he said he would pay from the Tuesday and come on the Friday, and that he was going to Southampton to see a friend—he asked for my address to take to the railway station, as he wanted to see after his luggage—he went out, and came back in about 10 minutes, followed by a porter—he asked to be allowed to wash his hands after giving me this reference. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "William Patterson, care of Patterson and Anderson, 21, Gracechurch Street, City.") Instead of going to the rooms he arranged to take, he went to the top of the house—he remained a quarter of an hour—I saw him when he came down—he said he would go and see what delayed his luggage, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—he left—he never returned—the following morning, on going to my dressing-case, I missed two brooches—the top of the dressing-case had been broken off and thrown into a drawer—it had been opened by a key—my nephew, Frank Hine, lodges with me—he made a statement to me three weeks afterwards—these two studs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are Mr. Hine's property—one is still missing—when the prisoner came they were in a drawer in the top front bedroom which Mr. Hine occupied a week before that—these three studs and this ring in this morocco case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belong to Mr. Hine—they were in the morocco case.</p>

             Hicks, Brothers, and Co., Basinghall-street. On the 10th of August Mr. Smith purchased these sixty yards of cloth of them - it was worth 50l. - an invoice was delivered to him at that time; he said he should send his porter for them on the following morning - on the 11th the prisoner came, and produced an order written by "Richard Powell, per procuration of Edward Smith," for the delivery of the goods; I have not got the order - I delivered them to him, in consequence of the order he produced - I never saw him before; I am quite certain of him - I was present while he packed them up, which was for about five minutes; I saw him again at the Mansion-house in about a fortnight - I have not seen the cloth since.</p>

He gave me a verbal order to receive three ends of cloth from Hicks and Co., and on the morning of the 11th of August, I had to go to Paddington with my uncle, and thought I would leave it till the afternoon; at dinner time I was sent for to Mr. Fox's, in Basinghall-street, as his man was taken ill - I met my brother in the court, and asked him to go for the cloth; he came to Fox, and I wrote him an order in pencil to Hicks and Co., to deliver the cloth; I do not know what became of it - I did not see it in his possession.</p>

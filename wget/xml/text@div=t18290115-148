            . I am a headborough of Shoreditch. I was near the shop and saw Barton standing against one door-post of the shop, and Gray against the other; I knew them and looked very hard at them - I then met two of the Bow-street patrol, and while in conversation with them, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw Barton crossing the road; he then turned to the left, and took a contrary direction - Gray went another way, but I took him in about half an hour, having a knowledge of him; I saw Fowler pick the brushes up, which were what Barton dropped: it was Fowler who raised the cry of Stop thief! and he made a catch at Barton, but missed him.</p>

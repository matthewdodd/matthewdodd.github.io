                  </hi>. I live in the house of Mrs. Murphy—I was present on the evening of 17th August, and saw all that took place—I and Leonard were standing at Mrs. Murphy's door, 269, Kent-street, when the prisoner passed by—she turned back and said, "Are you talking to me? if you are, talk to my backside"—I and the prosecutrix were talking to each other—with that the prisoner goes in-doors, and comes out and says to the prose<lb></lb>cutrix, "Here, I wants you;" and the prosecutrix said, "If you want me, you must come here"—she comes over, and with that hit the prosecutrix on the temple with the poker; and with that she went in-doors again, and she came out, and the prosecutrix went to make a grasp at her to give her into custody, and she had a knife in her hand—the prosecutrix held up her hand to keep the blow off her face, and she received it on her left hand instead—after that she fainted in my arms, and I called two young men to my assist<lb></lb>ance to take her to the doctor's shop; and with that I cried out to her sister, Mrs. Murphy, that she was stabbed—the prisoner rushed in-doors—coming back from the doctor's shop, I saw Mrs. Murphy's servant, Catherine Clark, break the windows with the poker—I left the prosecutrix at the doctor's—she was quite insensible at the doctor's—I came back to give the prisoner into custody, and I saw Catherine Clark break the windows with the poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 18th August, with a wound in her left hand about an inch and a half long—it was in the ball of the thumb, extending into the palm, very deep; it was a clean cut wound; there was a great deal of bleeding from it—in my opinion it was caused by a knife—I should think an ordinary dinner knife would produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the position of the wound, do you think it probable that it could have been inflicted by breaking a pane of glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be the usual way of breaking a pane of glass, and I should have expected to find glass in the wound, from the direction of it—it was not straight, and glass would not bend as a knife would—there was no glass in the wound; she was in a dangerous condition for some time—she had repeated attacks of bleeding, besides the danger of tetanus, that is in all these cases the great danger—she was there till the 15th of this month.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you hawk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I go out with a barrow with fruit; I have a license; I was last out with my barrow last Saturday—I do not know a man named Naley or Gooding—I have never been in custody or locked up in my life for any offence—the prisoner was in her own house when the prosecutrix broke the window; I know that because, when the policeman came and asked for her, she came out directly—I was not standing there when the policeman came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that when the policeman came the prisoner came out di<lb></lb>rectly, is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was in the doctor's; you asked me where the prisoner was when the policeman came, and I said, "In-doors"—I did not see the policeman there at all—I went to Mrs. Murphy's house, and put Leonard on the bed, after her hand was dressed—the prisoner was not at Mrs. Murphy's then—I did not remain there two minutes—I asked the doctor how much it was; he said, "I think it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" and I said, "I think it is"—after I left Murphy's, I went home—I did not see the doctor give a certificate when I was there—I was not at the police-court next morning, because they did not know I was a witness, and I was at work; I was there on the Wednesday following—this took place on Tues<lb></lb>day, between 10 and 11 o'clock; I cannot tell to five or ten minutes—when the prisoner went up the next day, she was remanded, and I went up on the Wednesday week—I never saw the prisoner in the street—I saw the row, but did not come there at the commencement; I went to where the row was, but never saw the prisoner; she was in-doors—it was Mary Ann Leonard that was <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> with herself, and the door was shut—I saw Mary Ann Clark; she fetched out the poker—I did not see Ellen Griffiths; she did not take the prosecutrix to the doctor's; she was not there at all; it was me and another man—I have never been examined before the magis<lb></lb>trate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that Ellen Griffiths was not there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She came to the doctor's just after it was dressed; that was where I saw her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did Leonard remain after the breaking of the second window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think she stood for three minutes; but she was losing so much blood, that I took her away, and Clark came out and broke the other window with the poker—when the window was broken the people shut their doors, and were frightened to come out; nobody came out, or took any notice of it, that was in-doors; and when I came there from the doctor's, the prisoner had been carried away by a policeman—I was at the doctor's about five minutes; I waited outside the door; I could not stand to see her hand dressed; I held her hand, and then gave it to another man to hold, and after it was done I took her home—she was in the doctor's ten minutes or more—I did not see a policeman come while I was standing outside; I did not see one till after the woman was taken home—the prisoner was taken in custody when I took the woman home;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185809200083"></xptr>
               <p>she was gone out of her house—that was the policeman I saw after I took the woman home (<hi rend="italic">pointing to one</hi>); that was afterwards, when he came to see if he could find a knife—it was not while I was outside the doctor's that she was taken away; directly the woman was taken to the doctor's the prisoner was taken to the station, but I did not see it—I do not know whether she broke the window with her clenched hand—the cut was here (<hi rend="italic">showing the place</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a paper-stainer, of 255, Kent-street—I was at the greengrocer's for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oysters, and heard a smash of windows three houses off, on the same side—I went out, and the door was shut, and the blind down—when I had been there half a minute, the pro<lb></lb>secutrix <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with her left hand and went so at the window, and I saw blood drop on the pavement which was not there before—I saw Carpenter take her away—I do not know Leonard—I afterwards saw a young girl with a rod of iron, or a poker, come from the coffee-shop door, which is next to the house where the window was broken; she broke a window, and said, "Poll, why the hell do you commence and not finish fort?" and her sister, as I was told, a big stout woman, called the one that was out, a b—fool, and said it was all against herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the prisoner all this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Inside the house; I did not see her there, or see her come-out or go into the house; I do not know that she was in it; the door was shut; everything was quiet outside while the window was being broken; I heard no noise inside—there might be thirty or forty people collected—Leonard was in the street when I saw her first, on the pavement—I cannot say whether she did it with her fist or her open hand—I saw no policeman come up—I only waited a very short time—they are all strangers to me; I may have seen them, but never spoke to any of them—I was within seven yards of Leonard when she broke the last window; I only saw her break one; I saw no smashing by Mrs. Leonard after I came up—it was not the first smash that cut her hand, I say it was the second—I only heard the smashing of one window while I was away, and then she broke the second—I was at the police-court, but was not called—I went to the doctor's door, after I had been home and come back, but the shop was so full that I could not see—I do not know Ellen Griffiths—I did not see Carpenter there, the shop was so crowded—I never saw the prisoner till about three days afterwards—I was at the police-court on the last day—I do not know how many times before that the prisoner had been examined—I never volunteered to give evidence for her; I became a witness through my wife telling the people all about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the prisoner standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I went up first, she was at her sister's door; she came from there and went to the window; she turned to the left; her sister's door is on the right of the prisoner's door, and she was between the two—her right hand was not towards the window—she passed, but not altogether, and turned round—she was swear<lb></lb>ing at those who were inside—the house, the window of which she broke, was at her left hand as she stood at the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is different from what you said just now; was she stand<lb></lb>ing with her back to the door or her face to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With her face to the door—when she came out of the coffee-shop she had to turn to the right to get to the prisoner's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 5, North-street, East-lane, Walworth—I was about calling on Mary Ann McDonald—I was passing 299, Kent-street, on the opposite side of the way, and saw the prosecutrix rush into the prisoner's house, and then she was pushed out and tried to force the door, but was not able—she broke a second square of glass and cut her left hand, and two young men led her from the window to the doctor's—on her breaking the second square, the blood flowed directly—I cannot say whether her hand was open or closed—another woman then rushed out from the coffee-shop with a poker or stick, and commenced breaking the windows—she broke three or four, and while she was breaking them she called Mrs. Murphy a cow, making use of worse language before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were you when you saw the prosecutrix trying to break the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close on the opposite side, and I crossed over and saw the whole occurrence—it is a very long street, and if there is a crowd in it you can see them coming from the other end—I may have been twenty yards off when I first saw the crowd—it was after she was pushed out that I saw Mrs. Leonard trying to break the door—she did go into the house—the window is a very short space from the door—she tried to break the door, and when she found she could not, she broke the window; she broke one square, and cut her hand—she did not come from her sister's house to break the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Kent-street, opposite Mrs. Murphy's—I keep a general shop—my husband is living—on the night in question I was standing at my own door—the prisoner was at her door, and the prosecutrix was at her sister's door—she went to the prisoner, caught hold of her dress, and tore her dress, calling her a bad name—she pulled her out and told her to come and fight—the prisoner went into her house, and the prosecutrix followed her—what happened inside I can't say; but the prisoner turned her out and closed the door—the prisoner knocked and hammered at the door for two or three minutes; she could not get the door open, and she then thrust one hand through a pane of glass, and then she repeated it a second time—I did not see it, but I heard them say that she cut her hand at the second blow—two young men took her to the doctor's—the prisoner did not come out any more—I afterwards saw the servant come out</p>

               <p>and break three or four more panes of glass, apparently with a poker—I did not hear her say anything at the time: there was a good deal of confusion—I saw nothing more—I know all these parties by living there, nothing more—I have no feeling one way or the other.</p>

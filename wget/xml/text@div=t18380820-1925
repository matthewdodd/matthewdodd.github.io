                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Conner, and live in Tindal's-buildings, Gray's-inn-lane—I know the prisoner, and knew his wife Mary Moore—I saw her about one o'clock the day she died—she was not then in good health—she was brought home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in a fit on the Thursday—I saw her in bed about seven o'clock in the afternoon—I saw no wound about her head or any where at that time—she died on the Friday week following, nine days after—I saw her on the Tuesday after she was brought home—she was then free from any wound—she was ill in bed, but could not speak—she appeared sensible—I saw her again on the Thursday night, and she was much in the same way-quite sensible, but could not speak—I went to see her between twelve and one o'clock on the Friday, and she was in a dying state—there was no alteration in her appearance then, but I consider she was dying—I never looked at her head—I afterwards saw her data—I saw the prisoner in the room two or three nights, I believe, when I went to see her-to the best of my belief I saw him two nights—I know I saw him there once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Courtenay, and live in Bell-court, Gray's-inn-lane. I knew Mrs. Moore seven or eight years—she had generally good health, from what I saw—she used to be in the milk trade, and sometimes sold milk about the streets—she was not sub<lb></lb>ject to fits, that I saw, till the day she got the fit in the street—she was</p>

               <p>fond of a drop, and got tipsy sometimes—I lived in the same room with her—one Thursday, my boy came and told me something about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and her hus<lb></lb>band brought her up into my room, as I understood, out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she was in a fit—she was working her feet and hands together—she had been bled before she was brought home—I saw her arm bandaged-her husband went for Mr. Owen—I did not notice any appearance about her cap then—on the Tuesday after, I observed some corruption in her cap—it looked like blood—she died on the Friday week—she kept her bed all the time after she was brought home, and I never heard her speak a word—I cannot tell whether she was drunk or sober when she was brought home, as she was in a fit—the prisoner was at home during the time—he was but two or three days at work while she was ill—he was as good a husband to a wife as ever came into a house, from what I saw—the deceased grumbled hard at her head, which was very bad—I saw it on the Tuesday after she had the accident, and it was very sore indeed—it seemed to me to be cut—that was the Tuesday before she was brought home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she said her husband was <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> at the Goat, in Tash-court, with a man named Sullivan, and that she came between her husband and Sullivan, and Sullivan struck her—she did not mention where—she did not say that at the time I was looking at the cut in her head—she mentioned about the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> on Sunday night, and on Tues<lb></lb>day showed me her head—she did not say that was the blow Sullivan had given her—she kept her milk-place from Monday, after she had received the wound, till the Thursday when she was brought home in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she lost the use of her arms and side altogether when she had the fit, and her speech also—I knew she was living away from her husband—she slept three nights in my place before her husband came—that was the week before she got the blow—the very night she got the blow, they came and lived together again, and did so till she died, in the same room with me—I did not see or hear any blows in my place, but I heard them <hi rend="italic">blowing</hi> Margaret M'Carthy <hi rend="italic">up</hi>—during the time they were separated, the prisoner lodged in Fox-court, where his wife came from, and she lodged in my room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Jeremiah and Bridget Cour<lb></lb>tenay, and am thirteen years old. I slept in the same room with the prisoner and his wife, at the foot of my mother's bed—on the Sunday be<lb></lb>fore the deceased was brought home in the fit, I heard a great noise in the night, and I got up and sat on my bed—I heard Mrs. Moore crying—she did not say who struck her, nor did I see her cut, or hear any noise of blows given—he told her to get up, and get his trowsers, and she would not—he stamped on the ground and said, "Get up"—she said, "I will get up, and go any where with you, if you will give me time"—she got up, and sat on the stool by the fire-place, and he got up, and sat with her—she had a baby in her arms, and he was playing with it—she told me on the Sunday night before this that she had been struck at the Goat—she did not mention, who struck her—I did not see the cut in her head till the Monday after<lb></lb>noon, when M'Carthy was there, washing it, and cutting the hair off-her</p>

               <p>husband was out then-M'Carthy poulticed the wound with bread and water—I often saw the prisoner assist in doing so—I never heard her say to him, "Oh Harry, you did this to me,"or charge him with giving her the wound in the head—on the Sunday night, when I was awoke out of my sleep, there was something occurred about wanting a light—there was no struggle between them, or any cry of "Murder"—they were both very drunk indeed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

In consequence of some communication made to me, I went, with another officer, named Whitney, between 6 and 7 on Thursday morning, 4th June, into a house in Thames-street, just opposite Mr. Allen's, the prosecutor—we went up to the first floor, and from the window we commanded a view of the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>mises, and of a turning down by the east side of them, called Rutland-place—on the other side of the premises there is a narrow turning called "Smith's-ride"—the principal entrance to the prosecutor's premises is in Thames-street—there is a side entrance in Rutland-place—there is no entrance from Smith's-ride—about 8 o'clock I saw the prosecutor's cart loading at the front entrance in Thames-street—when it was loaded it was driven away by the</p>

I was with Gaylor on this morning—I saw Mr. Allen's cart loaded and driven away by the carman towards Blackfriars-bridge—I saw Hardy follow at the near side of the cart—I saw him return by the side of Woodward's cart, in about two minutes—Woodward was driving, and he drove down Rutland-place—we were watching nearly opposite Rutland-place—we could see down it—there is a door there out of the prosecutor's premises—the tail-board of the cart was taken down by Hardy and Woodward in a very hurried manner—at that time I saw Adams standing at the corner of Thames-street and Rutland-place—he was standing there at the time the cart turned the corner, and he remained there until it was loaded and backed out—just before that Hardy joined Adams, and they stood talking together until Woodward, after back<lb></lb>ing out, turned his horse's head towards Blackfriars—I could not see the person inside the door, but I could see that some portion of the metal was handed to Hardy—directly Woodward started to back out, I left the room where I was, and ran down stairs, and got into the street before he had entirely backed out—I then followed the cart, Hardy and Adams being between me and the cart going towards Blackfriars-bridge—they crossed the road towards St. Andrew's-hill, and I crossed too, so that I almost touched them—I followed the cart and lost sight of them—the horse was going at a trot—I overtook it in Farringdon-street, and told Woodward to stop, and he did—Gaylor then came up, and told him we were officers, and said, "Have you any invoice?"—he said, "No, I have only part of my order; I ordered six sets, and I have only got two"—Gaylor said, "Where have you brought it from?"—he said, "From a warehouse in Thames-street"—he asked him the name; he said he did not know the name, but it was close by the mill—Gaylor told him he must consider himself in custody, and he was then conveyed to Fleet-street police-station—this was on 4th June—on that same day I met Mr. Hutchinson at Woodward's house, and searched the lower part of the house—I have a list here of the property found: 8 kitchen ranges, 16 register stoves, 7 fronts, 6 backs, 7 oven shelves, 6 bar fronts, 8 sets of bars, 1 oven, 1 boiler, 6 backs, register, 3 sets of backs fitted, 2 fire bricks, 10 iron bottoms, 115 pieces of register metal, 14 fall doors, 6 inside backs, 2 triangles, 2 trivets, and 1 eliptic stove, which Mr. Hutchinton iden<lb></lb>tified—there was a quantity of other metal there, but I only brought away that which Mr. Hutchinson identified—I have been looking after Robert Adams—I have not succeeded in finding him yet—he was in the prosecutor's employment at this time, and I have seen him at work there since these parties have been in custody.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say that Hardy might sell if he entered the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the clerk's duty to enter—Hardy had no right to sell under any circumstances without getting it entered by the clerk—he might sell if he got the clerk to enter the goods—he never received money—some of the clerks received the money, either Mr. Napier or Mr. Lindsay—there are six persons entitled to sell—I learn from the books, that Woodward has been a ready-money customer—I do not know him at all—if a person came with an order, he would take it to the counting-house to one of the two clerks I have spoken of—it would be entered in the books and then filed, or sometimes the orders might be given to the men after they were entered, instead of being filed—we give the men the invoice or the order, the order usually, to enable them to get out the goods, and they mark the weights on the order and bring it into the counting-house again—it might be that orders have been brought, executed by the men, and then brought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186307130066"></xptr>
               <p>and entered afterwards—I don't know that that has not been so, but the general practice is to enter and file them first—invoices are always given in cash transactions—the parties might destroy them when they went out—the clerk immediately after entering must make out an invoice—Mr. Allen, the principal, resides in Scotland and very rarely comes up—I have the manage<lb></lb>ment of the business—Mr. Napier is the next person in authority under me—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a rough estimate of the value of the property found at Woodward's—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. may be a much nearer price.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am one of the gaolers of Newgate—I received this letter on Saturday last from the prisoner Hardy (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Newgate, 8th July, 1863. Sir,—I have been in your employment, now, turned twelve years, and can sincerely say I have never wronged you till within these last three months. I have been a faithful, true, and honest servant to you. As a last resource I ask, you to pardon me this time, if you will. I am a broken-hearted man, have mercy on me this once; I have been in prison now five weeks, I now begin to feel my situation, for I never saw the inside of one before; extend your mercy to me this time, I have a family of young children crying at home for bread, and an aged mother nearly broken-hearted, which, of course, I ought to have thought of before. If it was possible that I could come to work for you to-morrow, Sir, I would do so, to pay you back all that I have wronged you of I am going up for trial on Monday, I expect the sentence will be severe, unless you do something for me. I earnestly entreat you to do your best for me to release me from this place, for I am a wretched and miserable man. If you will be kind enough to address a letter to me, for I am a truly unhappy man. "Signed, "James Hardy. Newgate goal."</p>

On the 30th of January, about twenty-five minutes past eleven at night, I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of No. 6, Lisle-street, by himself, he had nothing with him, he went to a house that was repairing, there is a fence before the house, he went up to one corner of it; as soon as I saw him in the corner, I crossed the way to him, his back was towards me; I asked him what business he had there; he made no reply; I asked him again; he told me he was looking for a glass-cutter, or glass-grinder; I asked him how he came to come out of that house; he answered still he was looking for a glass-cutter, or glass-grinder; I took him back to the door of No. 6, I asked him how the door came open, and how he came to be in that house; I told him when I called the hour of eleven o'clock, it was fast; at eleven o'clock I put my hand against the door, it was fast; then still he insisted he was looking for a glass-cutter, and when he was got within six or nine inches of the door, he put his finger to the key-hole of the door, and pulled too the door; the door fastened with a spring-lock; I then was going to take him to the watch-house, and when he had got to the middle of the front of the fence, he made a start, and got from me before I could get any assistance; I halloaed out, and he was stopped by a person coming along; I then secured him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man? - A. It is the same man, he was never out of my sight; he was searched at the watch-house, and nothing was found upon him; when we came back from the watch-house, we searched the parlour windows outside of the house; we found the two parlour shutters were forced open, and one of the staples broke; the bolt was hanging down, but the sash was fastened by the catch; the next morning I fetched

             sworn. - About half past eleven o'clock, on the 30th of January, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house by these watchmen; I searched him, and found nothing on him; the next morning I took him before the Magistrate, and by his order I went to the house to find out, if possible, by what means he got into the house; we found the parlour shutters wrenched, but the sash fastened down, and we found the kitchen shutters open, and the sash of the kitchen windows open; but I am of opinion it was impossible for him to get in that way, because the kitchen-door was bolted outside of the door, and there was no way, by my examination, which any body could get in but by the door; there was a chest of drawers in the back parlour, and all the drawers forced open but one; I am certain they were forced open, because I found part of the beading on the floor; Mrs. Jones was with me at the time.</p>

I was at work with my father on Wednesday, the 30th of January, and about half after four o'clock in the afternoon there was a man came and told my father, if he would send his son down to his house, he would give him some work; I went out to go there, I met some young men, and I staid out and drank with these young men; this watchman laid hold of another man, and whether he gave him something I do not know; he let him go, and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jones.) No part of what you lost has ever been found? - A. No part whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house the day before, in what state was the chest of drawers? - A. Every thing safe; it was full of clean linen, sheeting, counterpanes, and blankets.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

This pistol was sent to me by Mr. Probin - I have no doubt it is mine; I had seen the prisoner at Wood's livery-stables, where my house is kept - I had seen a man at my shop about three weeks before this was sent to me, but I cannot say it was the prisoner; I only saw this back - the stable he works at is just opposite my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When had you seen the pistol safe? A. I cannot speak positively to having seen it since last April, when I took stock, though I have no doubt of its being mine - when the pistol was sent to me I made some inquiry, and the prisoner came two or three times to my place, to explain what he knew of it; he said he bought it in the street for 2s. about three weeks before.</p>

            . I am a gun-maker, and live in Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I bought this pistol of Puddle, for 13s. - I saw a private mark on it, and supposing it was Mr. Lang's, I sent it to him by his errand-boy, when he came on some business; it being an odd one, is not of much value - I sent it to see if Mr. Lang had the fellow; the pair might have been worth 2l. 5s., with the mould and key, but I should have sold this for 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A stranger might have had the pistol without seeing the private-mark? A. Oh, yes, certainly.</p>

            . I live in John's-court, Golden-square, and am a stable-helper. I have known the prisoner about four years, and was often at his lodgings; I was there last Friday three weeks - I cannot say the day of the month; he came home to get his dinner, and opened a drawer, took out this pistol, and said, "I have a pistol - do you know any one who will buy it?" I said I would should it to a person, and on the Sunday following I showed it to Mr. Puddle, who gave me 5s. for it; the prisoner is a helper in that yard - he told me he bought the pistol at the top of the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the prisoner an honest man? A. He was always considered such; there was no secrecy in the business.</p>

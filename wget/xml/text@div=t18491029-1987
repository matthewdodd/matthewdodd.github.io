                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Leader-place, Chelsea—I have known the prisoner by sight several years; she says I have had one child by her—on 24th Sept. I met her as I was going into Hyde Park, about half-past seven in the evening—we went into the Park—she asked me for money—I said I had none, and if I had, I would not let her have it, for I did not con<lb></lb>sider her a proper person to give money to at that time, but if I saw her on Saturday, I would give her some—she had a baby on her arm, I was on her left side; as I wished her good night, she stabbed me through my cheek and into my tongue, saying, "Take that before you go"—blood came, and I do not recollect anything else till I got to a surgeon's; I was quite stupified. and was taken to the hospital—I was there three weeks—my tongue is quite dead; I have not the use of it as I had—she had sworn that child to me at the office, and I have paid for it.</p>

I am the wife of John Jones, of Holles-street, Edgware-road—the prisoner lodged with me—on the 24th Aug.

I hope he is dead, if he is not I hope he will die; had I struck him where I intended, he would die"—she did not appear angry—at the station she said she met him at Knightsbridge, and they walked into the Park together, and bad some words about some money, and O'Bryan had hold of her by the throat, and tried to strangle her, but she did not feel so much hurt as alarmed, and put her hand in her pocket, pulled out a clasp-knife, opened it with her mouth, strained it on her knee, and struck at him, he would have had it worse, but the knife turned in her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. O'Bryan was brought there bleeding considerably from the mouth, and from a wound three-quarters of an inch long in the right cheek; and there was a wound nearly through the tongue—a sharp knife would inflict it—he was sensible, but there was very little pulse—it bled till five o'clock next morning—there is a loss of taste and motion in the tongue, but he is pretty well.</p>

"he said, "No, d—you and the child too;" and laid hold of me; his thumb was under the string of my bonnet, and I took out my knife to cut the string; it was dark, and I do not know whether I struck him or not; he grazed the baby's arm, where it had been vaccinated.</p>

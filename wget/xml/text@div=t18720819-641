                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 7, Triangle, Upper Kennington Lane—on 13th July the prisoners came in and purchased two small articles, which came to 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—each paid with a florin, which I put into the till—there was no other money there—I paid away one; and the other I sent out to the grocer by my son, who brought it back broken—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—on the 16th, about 12.45, the prisoners came again—Quinnell asked for a man's shirt, but did not buy it; they bought 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of ribbon, and Wilkinson gave me a florin—I gave her the change—took it to the egg shop and got change; and about five minutes afterwards it was brought back, and it was bad—I marked it at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had just given change on the 13th for a sovereign, which cleared the till—I have no doubt my son brought back the same florin from the grocers; I had not marked it—I am sure it was Quinnell who asked for the shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; I keep a tobacconist's shop in High-street, Deptford—on 24th October the prisoners came into my shop about a quarter-past 10 o'clock at night—I was in the shop alone—they asked for some pipes, I showed them some and they bought one and paid a penny—Jeffries tried to go into my sitting room but I shut the door—he then tried to come round the counter—I prevented his going there—a gentleman came in and purchased some tobacco, and while he was there the prisoners left—the gentleman left, and the prisoners came in again directly afterwards—I asked them what they wanted—McGee said he had broken the pipe—it was broken off near the bowl and they said they wanted some pipes—I showed them some more pipes, and while I was showing them McGee threw some snuff in my eyes—that blinded me for a time, and he took my brooch at the same time—it was in my dress and he tore it out of the dress—it had a watch and a chain on it—the other prisoner was standing by his side—they ran out of the shop—I recovered myself in about a minute and went in the street—there was a man standing there—I gave him information—I returned to the shop—I saw the prisoners again about 11 o'clock the same night—they were shown to me at the police-station—they were alone, I am certain they are the two men.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Deptford—on the night of 24th October I was near Mrs. Wickham's shop—about a quarter past 10 o'clock I saw two soldiers come out of her shop, and run down the road—to the best of my belief Jeffries was one of them—I saw his face under a gas light—I don't speak to the other—I returned to the shop and Mrs. Wickham was at the door—she told me something, and, in consequence of what she said, I went to a policeman—I found him at the bottom of High-street.</p>

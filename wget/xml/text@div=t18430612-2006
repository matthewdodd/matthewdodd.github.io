On Sunday, the 28th of May, I saw the prisoner in private clothes, about a quarter to nine o'clock—he was allowed to be in private clothes after duty, which was over—next morning he did not come—I went into the office, and found a bunch of keys on the table—I took them up, and opened the till, and the money was not there—it was not kept in the till at night—this letter is in the prisoner's hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mr. Superintendant West, Eastern Counties Railway.—Birmingham, May 29th.—Sir, I am sorry to inform you I lost about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the principal part of the money taken for tickets at the Stratford station from my pocket, on Tuesday evening, where I cannot say. I went into the country, to endeavour to make the money good, but have not been able to do so.

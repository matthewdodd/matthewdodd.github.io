                  </hi>. I am a piano-forte maker. On the 24th of November, I went into the Sir Isaac Newton public-house, at the corner of York-street, Middlesex Hospital, with Mr. Withers—the prisoner and another woman were sitting there—I sat first by the fire-place, and then went and sat down by the prisoner—I left her—she came and sat down by me—I had in my pocket two half-crowns, one shilling, and some half-pence—I fell asleep while the prisoner was sitting by my side—my friend awoke me, and said he was going home, and would I have a drop more be<lb></lb>fore he went—I said I did not care if I did—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money from my right hand breeches pocket, on which side the prisoner had sat—I taxed the prisoner with it—she called me a liar—my friend called in the officer—he came and took up her gown, to feel in her pocket, and one half-crown fell down—the policeman stooped to pick it up—the prisoner said it was only a half-penny—another half-crown then fell down, and she said that was a half-penny.</p>

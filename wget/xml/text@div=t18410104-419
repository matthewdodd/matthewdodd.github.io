On Tuesday, the 22nd of December, the prisoner came into my shop to get an oil skin cover for his cap—it required a button to be put on—I took it up-stairs, and before I went up, I hung up my watch in his presence, in my parlour—he went away, and about two hours after I missed my watch—I went to the bar<lb></lb>racks, and described his person, and he having mentioned to me that he was going 130 miles into the country, the sergeant-major supposed it to be this man—I saw him again at the station on the Saturday night following—the watch produced and appendages are mine, and are worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the Scotch Fusileer Guards. I started on Wednesday morning, the 23rd of December, for Gloucester—on Thursday night the prisoner came into a public-house at Gloucester, where I was sitting—he was on furlough—I had heard on Tuesday of the loss of this watch, and the prisoner having such a thing, I followed him</p>

               <p>Q. What was the cart loaded with - A. A load of hay. I could not see him lay it on the cart, there was a garden hedge prevented me; when he came back to the stable I went to the cart, I found two trusses and a half instead of one and a half, which is the usual allowance; I put a twig of birch into each truss to know the truss again; my intention was to find out the receiver, as he had to go to London and back again. After he was gone with the cart I followed him; it was moon light; I kept as near as I could all the way to London; the hay was on the cart at Hendon, and at Golder's green, and at a watering house, the Black Cap, the hay was on the cart, and between the Black Cap and Battle bridge the hay was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to him about this truss that was missed <placeName id="t18090215-116-crimeloc659">between Camden town and Battle bridge</placeName>

On the Monday following I told him I wanted to know what became of the two trusses of hay that I missed out of the lost, one on Thursday morning and one on Saturday morning, because I had counted the trusses and knew where he took it from; he said he never took out any hay but what was for his horses; I told him I did not ask about what he had for his horses, that you had out of the hay rick, I ask you about two trusses that you had out of the lost; he always denied taking any more than a truss and a half for the consumption of his horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it might not have dropped - A. It was not likely, it might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a truss of hay - A. Three shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you say it was not likely to drop off, you do not mean to say it might not fall off - A. It might possibly fall off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Master has said at different times in the stable he did not care how much hay I had for the horses, so as I did not waste it; I never did waste it.</p>

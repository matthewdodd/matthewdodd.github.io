               <p>Court. Q. Your uncle, James Russel, is the agent? - A. He is property the agent; I reap no emolument, and I am not responsible; my name is in the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him four times; The first time I saw him was on the 11th of January last; he called at my office, and represented himself to be an officer of the first battalion of Rothsay and Caithness Sencibles; this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he told me, he had come to town to settle some matters relative to a deceased relation in India -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the gentleman, whether he does not recollect I was in a deranged state of mind at the time? - A. The prisoner did not appear to me to be so; he said, that he wanted some money; he had been some time in conversation with my uncle, previous to my coming into the office.</p>
               <p>Q.When he said, he wanted some money, what followed upon that? - A. We paid him a month's pay, as to ensign Sinclair; I understood, from my uncle, when I came into the office, that this was ensign Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum did you pay him? - A.Seven pounds four shillings and eight-pence, by a draft on Messrs. Coutts and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, any receipt given you for that sum? - A. I had; I advanced it to ensign Sinclair, as a month's pay.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He gave a receipt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you, after that, see the prisoner again? - A. I saw him again on the 17th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time? - A. From the hours of twelve to one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He said, on the 17th, that some mistake had been made in the money that had been paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what that was? - A. He remarked, that the pay-master had been in the habit of paying him more for a month's subsistence; I then recurred to the receipt, and made a calculation of the pay, and said, it was perfectly right, as ensign; he then said, he was lieutenant Benjamin Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the former receipt signed,

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.What did the difference amount to? - A. One pound, eleven shillings. He still said, he should want a few guineas more, as he was go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200035"></xptr>ing to join the regiment in a few days; and the further sum of six pounds, six shilling and four-pence, was paid him, in addition to the money I had paid him before, that made altogether thirteen pounds eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you pay him the remaining money? - A. It was paid in cash. I then proposed to the prisoner, to cancel the former receipt, and give me a receipt for the whole sum; the prisoner assented, and I handed him the former receipt, which he tore, and threw into the fire; he then gave me the receipt which I now hold in my hand. (The receipt could not be read, on account of its bad writing).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that the name of Robert Russel? - A. I signed it; the body of the receipt is in my hand-writing, the signature only is his.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How come you to give credit to this young man, when he came and told you, you had made a mistake? - A. After my uncle had granted the first sum, I had not a distant suspicion but that he was the person he represented himself to be, lieutenant

               <p>Q. Was he paid that thirty-one shillings? - A. Yes; then he applied to me for six guineas more, as his business had detained him longer in town than he expected; and he wanted six guineas more, as he was going to his regiment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any receipt given for the money you paid him? - A.There was; first a receipt for one month's pay, as an ensign, that was on the 11th, and that receipt was cancelled, and we took a general receipt for the whole. (The receipt produced.)</p>

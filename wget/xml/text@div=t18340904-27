Yes, there are - I cannot tell to what extent the prisoner's dealings went in the course of a year - it was to some thousands of pounds - he has not been the medium through which I have lent money to gentlemen and noblemen - he may have drawn some trifling leases for me - I am not certain whether he has drawn any warrants of attorney - I cannot say to what amount he has been the means of lending out money for me - I have lent some thousands of pounds - the prisoner must know that I took him on a charge of embezzlement, but I do not know that I mentioned the specific charge of 16l. 6s., at the office - I may have found out this since - I do not recollect doing it - I do not know that I had discovered this when I saw Mr. Clutterbuck - I let the prisoner put his name over the tobacconist's shop, to prevent other creditors coming in - I have not lent money at more than the legal interest - I had no bonus - I do not know what a bonus means - I never intended to allow the prisoner a commission for selling the syrup, and never made use of any expressions to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have been asked about the day when you saw Mr. Clutterbuck - did the prisoner then mention that he had received this sum? A. I do not think he did - I do not think I had discovered this when I charged him with the other - after he had his examination, I went to some of my customers.</p>

            . I am clerk to Newbury and Co. - the prisoner called a day or two before the 29th of November last, for an account due to Mrs. Canham - he produced a bill of 10l. 18s. - I told him of an omission in it of 5l. 8s., and then he brought this other bill of 16l. 6s.; on the 29th of November I paid him, and he gave me this receipt.(Read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I cannot bring it to my mind - I know nothing of it - this receipt is certainly my writing; but I have often gone into the City expecting to receive money which I was to lay out as I went home, for advertisements and other things - Mrs. Canham has frequently said, "Call at such an office, and advertise, or pay a bill," and when I have got home our accounts have been settled on a bit of paper, I have received and paid so and so - I suppose I did not enter this in the book - she has frequently omitted to enter sums which I have paid her - her porter knows that there have been many errors, and he had seen me drawing out leases and warrants of attorney, and she knows it, though she denies it - then she denies receiving bonuses, but I will name two parties from whom she has received them, and I can bring her own solicitor to prove it - the Marquis of *** and Sir *****, and they have been left with me in a blank at the door. I think she ought to be the last person to prosecute me, when she knows she has been defrauding Government so many years, by selling large quantities of medicine without stamps.</p>

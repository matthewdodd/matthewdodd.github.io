             told me that some person in the house was dishonest, he having several times missed money out of the drawer, and that particularly on the Wednesday before he had lost half a crown from the till in the drawer, which the apprentice was also sure was missing, he knowing what was in it at the time. I thought it necessary to lay a bait to find out the person that took the money, and that very evening, having occasion to go out, I mark'd nine shillings, three six-pences, and six pennyworth of half-pence, all with the letter A upon them; the journeyman and apprentice both saw me mark them, and put them into the drawer. I took out all the other money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175801130019"></xptr> and order'd none to be put in or taken out; this was on the Saturday night. Immediately my wife and I went from that house to another which I have in Holbourn, and left the care of the house to our servants.</p>
               <p>Q. What servants had you there?</p>
               <p>Flower. The journeyman, apprentice, prisoner, and porter. I was afterwards told the porter and maid took their evening walks when I was gone. When I came home the journeyman told me he had missed of that money 3 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to meddle with it?</p>
               <p>Flower. I order'd him only to look at it, and if he found any gone he was to borrow some money of the maid or the porter, whom I suspected, under some pretence or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually leave the till open?</p>
               <p>Flower. We do; but we seldom leave much in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the maid use to serve in the shop, or put in or take money out of the drawer?</p>
               <p>Flower. Very seldom; when we were out of the way she might serve a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go away on the Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Flower. About eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Flower. I missed three shillings and six-pence of the money that was put into the drawer, and borrowing two shillings of the prisoner at the bar, I found one had the mark on it which my master had made, the other had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce that which is mark'd.</p>
               <p>Mason. Here it is (producing one, which the jury look at.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her of it?</p>
               <p>Mason. I did not, till my master came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of it before he came home?</p>
               <p>Mason. Nobody but the apprentice, who had missed the half crown before, as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her pockets?</p>
               <p>Mason. No, we did not.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I own the fact. I am a great way from my friends.</p>

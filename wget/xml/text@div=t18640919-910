I am the wife of Matthew Grist—we keep a dairy<lb></lb>man's shop, at 14, Glbson-street, Waterloo-road, Lambeth—on Thursday, 4th August, the prisoner came to our shop, and bought a penny egg—I served her—she gave me in payment a shilling—I gave her eleven pence change, and she left the shop—I then sent the shilling down by a boy named Clark to my husband to see if it was a good one—he was in the kitchen at the time—Clark returned with the shilling, and I found it was bad—I put it apart from other money—on the following day I gave it to my husband—I had not mixed it with any other money.</p>

I am barman at the Spanish Patriot, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—on Friday, 5th August, I was serving at the bar—about half-past 6 in the evening, I saw the prisoner there—I served her with half a pint of porter, which was three farthings—she gave me in payment a six<lb></lb>pence—I put it in the till, and gave her change—soon after that she asked for another half-pint—she gave me another sixpence, and I gave her change for that, and put it in the till—I don't know whether there were other sixpences in the till—the prisoner then, left the house—I afterwards saw my master take some silver out of the till, and give it to a costermonger for change—between the time of my putting the two sixpences in the till and my master going to it, no other money was put in; I am sure of that—the prisoner afterwards came in again, and I served her with another half pint of porter—she gave me sixpence in payment—I examined it, and found it was a bad one—I gave it to my master, and told the prisoner it was a bad one—she said, "Give it me back again; I know where I took it"—she did not tell me where she had taken it—a constable was sent for, and she was given into custody.</p>

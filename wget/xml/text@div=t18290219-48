On the 21st of January, about half-past five o'clock, (my little boy had just come in, and was sitting by the fire,) I went into the room to get something off the fire-place- the prisoner came into the shop; I had lost a ham the day before, and had put a saw across this ham that they should not get it - the prisoner took off the saw, put it down, and took up the ham; I ran to him and said, "You had a ham yesterday, but you sha'nt have this to-day" - my little boy came up; he dropped the ham, and ran out of the shop - I pursued some distance, but was exhausted, and turned back; my little boy followed till he was taken- I had known him before.</p>

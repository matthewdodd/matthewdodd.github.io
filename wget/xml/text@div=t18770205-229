                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was an injury to the horse's leg, it had been scratched with a shoe about a week before; it was not a bad place, it did not require a bandage—I should have put one on, if it had remained, to keep the dirt out of the wound—the horse was found in a stable or open shed behind the public house—it was not much of a stable—it was a stand for horses; the door was open, there was no lock on it—it is a public-house yard; common to people going there.</p>

I reside at the Queen's Head, brook Green, with my husband, who is a licensed victualler, we went into the house last October—the prisoner rented the stables from our predecessor and was there when we took the house—he was carrying on the business of a car<lb></lb>man, with horses and carts—we had nothing to do with the yard or the stables; you can pass through the bar into the stable yard—there are double gates to the yard where the horses and carts go in, they are fastened at night, but left open through the day—the prisoner is a thoroughly honest and respectable man as far as I know—we have a-skittle ground at the back, that leads into the yard where the stables are—I know nothing about the horses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live opposite the George and Dragon, High Street, Acton-in August last I remember two men come in there with horses, one of the men was Gordon-those horses were shown up and down next morning for sale, one was a bay mare—I, saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there, he appeared to be dealing with the other two men, they showed the horses to him, both in harness and out—the prisoner took away the mare-Gordon wanted a stamp, and I saw a piece of paper handed from one to the other, the money was handed one way and the paper the other—it was about the size of that piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), that was handed by Gordon to the prisoner, and then the horse was mounted and rode away—horses are often brought in there; the gates being continually open, any one can go in, there is stabling for twenty or thirty horses—it is written up outside "Livery and bait stables"—I have known the prisoner for many years in the same place; I have been there many years.</p>

Yes; near a twelvemonth back; he continued in my lodgings near a twelvemonth; I let him a two pair of stairs back room for four shillings a week, he had the use of a feather bed, bolster, pillows, sheets, and blankets; he did not leave the lodgings; he had pawned the things and sold them; I had the room searched, I then found the things gone.</p>

            . I am a constable; I went in company with Slade to the prisoner's room, he and his wife were laying on a mattrass; I took him in custody; he said the bed was in pawn; I went to the pawnbroker's, the bed was sold to Benjamin.</p>
               <p>MR. BENJAMIN. I bought the bed of the prisoner; the duplicate and the bed stood me in about forty-four shillings.</p>

             a twelvemonth. On the 2nd of last February I was discharged from the 1st regiment of guards; from that time I was employed at Drury-lane till the house was burnt down; I was in distress, Mrs. Peters lent me a pillow case to pledge. When I had the duplicate of this bed I went to this Jew, I asked him to lend me seven shillings on the ticket; he said let me look at it, and call again in a quarter of an hour; I went; he then put nine shillings in my hand, and said we will say I bought it, and when you come for it again it is all the same, you must buy it again. He was to have a loan for the money; this was on the Tuesday; I called on the Friday, he was out; I went on the Saturday, after his sabbath was over, to give him the money, before the time was over; then he told me it was sold; I said I shall have you before a magistrate, I being poor I could not do it; I was taken up by my landlady on Sunday morning; she said now we will come to an agreement concerning these things, you must pay part of the rent this week, likewise take out the things I lent you to pledge. I was then put in prison; after that they had me out of prison, they brought me into the marines to pay the seven pounds; I was with them two days; I was taken to the doctor, he found I had a fault in my lungs, as such they could not take me into the band again, so they put me back to prison.</p>

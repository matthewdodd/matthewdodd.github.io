The officer secured the prisoner, and the watch I saw in the officer's hands. I knew it to be mine. I gave four pounds for the watch.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of November I was attending in Bridge-street, to prevent plunder. I saw the prisoner leave the prosecutor in a great hurry, which gave me suspicion. I followed him immediately. The prosecutor was standing in Chatham-place. I laid hold of the prisoner. The watch was then dropped. I picked up the watch, and laid hold of the prisoner again. I pulled the prisoner away from the crowd. There was a gang of them; they tried to rescue the prisoner. I took the prisoner to Giltspur-street compter. The prosecutor followed me; he owned the watch. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Could you see from whom the watch dropped - A. The prisoner was standing close by another man. It fell between the prisoner and him. The other man got away from me. I had hold of him as well as the prisoner. I did not see the prisoner take the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In Bridge-street we were drove by the mob. I saw the watch picked up two or three yards from me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

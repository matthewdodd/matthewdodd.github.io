                  </hi> (Junior). I am the prisoner's eldest son—he is a pipe-maker—I had been living with him about a fortnight before this occurrence—on the morning of the 25th I was awoke by a noise—I should think it as between 4 or or half-past 4 in the morning—my father and mother had gone to bed the night before very comfortably indeed, in the same room—the thing that awoke me was, my brother running out of bed—I heard my father exclaiming, "I have done it, I have done it"—upon hearing that, I went into the bedroom, which was on the same floor, and saw my mother weltering in blood on the bed—my father was standing by the bed-side—I have not lived at home for the last six years until a fortnight before this—I believe there had been a hatchet lying in that room, but I cannot say I had seen it there—my father said that he had had a dream; that he was told to do it; that his head appeared to be like a ball of fire, and he was just as if he had been shot out of a cannon, and he used the hatchet and struck my mother with it—my mother was shortly afterwards taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents—on the morning of 25th July I was awoke by hearing my father say that" it was done, it was done"—in consequence of that I ran into the room, and saw my mother lying on the bed covered with blood—I asked my father what he had done—he said he had been told to do it, and he had done it—he then dressed himself—he did not help my mother that I am aware of—a few minutes afterwards I saw a hatchet with some blood on the head of it, lying in the fender in the fireplace, close by the bed—it was usually kept in the coal-cupboard in the same room to chop wood with—my father left the room while I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185904040086"></xptr>
               <p>there, and went out into the yard and came back again in about five minutes—he appeared sorry for what he had done, and leant against the banisters and cried—he was sober at that time—my mother and he were never comfortable together, because he had often ill-used her—I have seen him knock her down and kick her, if he could not hit her, with his foot, and heave things at her—on these occasions she has always run out of the way to save being hit by him—I remember her being attended by a doctor once, I can't say how long ago, because she was hit on the head with a poker by my father.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I remember going to bed on 24th July—I do not recollect whether my husband went to bed at the same time—I went to sleep as soon as I got into bed—I do not remember anything after that for weeks afterwards—when I went to bed on this night I was quite sober—my husband was always very unkind to me; at times he has taken up a knife and threatened to stick it in my heart, with very bad expressions—he hit me on the head once with a poker, and I was attended by a surgeon; that was about four years before this—since that time his treatment has been very bad, throwing anything at me—at one time a tea<lb></lb>kettle; at another time a pot full of boiling water, which went all over my head and shoulders—at times he has used his fists, and given me such blows on the chest, arms, and legs, that they have been black and blue—I work out as a pipe-trimmer—on the Wednesday previous to this we went from the Kent-road to the Thames Tunnel, and I was passing a joke with him respecting an old neighbour that we met, and he up with his fist and gave me a tremendous blow on the nose, by which I lost a very great deal of blood—at that time he made use of very bad expressions, and he said he should not mind going in at eight and coming out at nine for such a woman as I was.</p>

I am one of the house-surgeons at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 25th July—I found several scalp wounds on the front part of the left side of the head; and there was a very extensive fracture corresponding with the scalp wounds—she was in an unconscious state, and remained so, or in a semi-conscious state for more than a fortnight—during that time three or four portions of bone were removed from the skull—she remained several months in the hospital—she has but recently left there—she will probably always feel the effects of the injury under any extra excitement—an instrument such as this hatchet would produce such wounds and such a fracture—I should say the back part of it was more likely to produce the injury than the blade.</p>

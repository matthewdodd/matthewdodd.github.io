I counted my sheep three or four times over between the hours of five and six in the evening of Saturday the 22nd of July, they were all right then; I saw them on the Sunday, but did not count them.

            . I live at Endeid. I know the two prisoners, they and a man named Corbey, who has run away, all lived in the same house, which is Corby's father's house. We went to the Two Brewers public house, at Ponders End; we there had a pot of beer outside of the door. After that we went to Mr. Mellish's field above the brick ground, and drove the sheep up against the hedge and the gate, and there

We took it down to Corby's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130025"></xptr>house, Streamer carried it part of the way, and we all assisted for that purpose. When we had got to Corbey's house, Streamer stuck it. We then went into the brick ground for some wood; we then went back to Corbey's, and Corbey skinned it, and I purchased it. We took the skin into a bean field, and we buried it in the field. I afterwards told Mr. Reynard, the patrole, where it was buried, and it was dug up there. The carcase was cut up into quarters, and put into a box, and the box was taken into a field of Mr. Allen's, two fields off of Corbey's house. I was afterwards taken up for an assault, and confessed to the patrole.</p>

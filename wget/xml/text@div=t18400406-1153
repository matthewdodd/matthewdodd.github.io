                  </hi>. I am a colourman, and live at No. 50, Old Compton-street. At the time in question I lived in Frith-street, in the parish of St. Ann Westminster—the prisoner was my servant of all work for between two and three months—on Sunday the 15th of March I Vent out about half-past six o'clock, leaving my cash-box in a drawer in my bed-room—she had access to the room, and had seen me every evening take my cash-box up stairs—it contained 3 sovereigns, 19 shillings, in silver, a bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a great number of papers, and a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forged note—I saw them safe on Saturday night about twelve o'clock—the drawer was not looked, but the box was—I went out at half-past six o'clock—came back about half-past eight, and met Hawkins at my door—in consequence of what he said I went up stairs and called the prisoner down—she was up in her bed-room—I asked her what she bad been doing—she said, "Oh, Mr. Fox, I have broke open your tin box"—I asked what she bad done with the papers and contents—she said, "Come up stairs, I will show you; the devil tempted me at the moment, and you can do what you like with me"—I went up and found the cash-box replaced, but broken open, and all the contents, except 1 half-crown in it—the forged note was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's—I have known the prisoner about two months. On Sunday night she came to my lodging at a quarter before seven o'clock, and wished me to go to the London and Birmingham railway with her, as she expected to meet her cousin there—I went with her, as I was to carry her box, but we did not meet him there—while we were waiting for the train coming in she shook some silver from her bosom—I saw her pick up two or three shillings—when we were coming away she showed me a Bank-note, with "forged" printed on it in four, different places—We afterwards went into a coffee-shop—she had a good many papers there—one was respecting two houses near Bridport-street, Marylebone—we left the coffee-shop—she made a full stop, and said the devil a foot further would she go towards her master's house—I asked her for what reason, and she told me and my wife that she had broken open her master's tin-box—I walked on, and she walked with my wife—I went right up to Mr. Fox's house—he was coming in with his family from church, and I told him this.</p>

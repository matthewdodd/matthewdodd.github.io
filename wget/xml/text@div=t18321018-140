            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday, the 6th of October, the prosecutor complained of being robbed; he described the girl and one of the men to me -I took him to a house, four or five doors from the Rose and Crown, and he pointed Herrington out, among four or five other girls, without any hesitation; I took her in charge, and on Sunday about twelve o'clock, I saw Corwall with some other men, at the corner of George-yard - I fetched the prosecutor, told him to walk by, and see if he knew any of them, and he fixed on the prisoner, without hesitation.</p>
               <p>Herrington's Defence. I was at the Pavillion till halfpast twelve o'clock, and as I came home I met the prosecutor; he took me to the Rose and Crown - he kicked up a row with a parcel of men; I went away, leaving him there.</p>
               <p> - WELCH. The prisoner Corwall has lodged with me nearly three months; he was at home on Tuesday night, the 5th of October; several poor Irish labourers slept there; Corwall came home a little better than halfpast ten, and went to bed - Whitechapel-church clock struck eleven when I locked the door; I had the key of the street-door in my bed-room all night; I found him there in the morning; we keep a lodging-house - my husband is blind; Luney has lodged with us six months - he went to bed a few minutes after the prisoner - he sleeps in the same bed.</p>
               <p>- LUNEY. I am a sieve-maker, and lodge at Welch's. The prisoner slept there with me on the 5th of October - he went to bed first; I was in bed before eleven; I was not awake when he got up, but I was before he got up; he could not have been out at twelve o'clock.</p>

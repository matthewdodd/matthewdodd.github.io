               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it when you left the house in Duke-street. - A. About eleven o'clock; when I got out in the air, I was intoxicated; and when I got home and pulled of my clothes, I missed my watch; I had money in my pocket, both gold and silver; I did not lose none of that, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner. - A. To my knowledge, I never saw her before; I saw her at the office; I did not see her that night so as to be sensible of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that she was at all near you. - A. No, I do not recollect any transaction at all with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your watch last. - A. When I left the house in Duke-street, I perceived it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it again. - A. The constable brought it me the next day; the watchmaker's name being in it that cleaned it last led to the discovery.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of November, at two o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn, I saw the prisoner pull the watch out of her bosom, and walk along the street with it; I saw her put it in again; I had a suspicion that she had stole the watch. I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>ANDREW - . I was constable of the night, the watchman brought the woman to the watchhouse with the watch; I examined the watch; I asked her how long she had had it, she said four or five years. I looked at the inside, who had cleaned the watch; from that I made the discovery of the owner; she said, she had the watch cleaned three months ago in Hatton Garden, that a gentleman had given her the watch that was gone to Bath; I told her that was not the truth, the watch was cleaned at No. 90, Oxford-road. The prisoner and the watch were taken before the magistrate the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was on Monday night coming through Lincoln's Inn-fields, at half past twelve o'clock; I picked the watch up. I went up Holborn there I met a young woman an acquaintance of mine; I shewed it her, I put in my bosom; the watchman was there, he saw the watch; he said he was sure I stole the watch he took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Birchall. In going home did you go through Lincoln's Inn-fields. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether or no you can say you might by any accident drop it. - A. The watch was very fast in my fob when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home were your clothes all dirty. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had tumbled down. - A. I either fell down or was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how many times you fell down. - A. No, I cannot.</p>

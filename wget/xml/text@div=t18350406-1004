                  </hi>. I am nearly fifteen years old. I was sent by my master with three watch-cases in a bag, fastened in a paper—I had the string of the bag twisted round my wrist, and up in my pinafore, as I went along—when I crossed the road in Galway-street, five girls and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on Friday, the 3rd of April—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," about nine o'clock, in Old-street—I went immediately towards the sound—it appeared the sound of a child—on coming up, I saw Finch—the prisoner was between ten and twenty yards a-head of her, on the same side of the road—the girl gave me information, and I went up to the prisoner and took him into custody—I said, "You must come to the station-house with me"—he said the Lord strike him dead if he went to do it—when he got to the station-house, her said he only did it in fun—I got the watch-cases from the girl.</p>

I had informed the watchman of it in the street, and the next morning, about nine o'clock I found him in custody, and have no doubt whatever of his being one of the men who threw me down - the property is not found - the watchman picked up part of the handkerchief, and I gave him the rest.</p>

            . I am watchman in Parker-street. On the 23d of May, I heard rattles sprung and cry of Stop thief! - I ran towards it, the prisoner was going towards Charles-street - not running; there was nobody else in the street - he came in a direction from the spot. I followed him to the corner of Charles-street, and stopped him - Crawley came up - the prosecutor was not there, and we let him go; he said he lived at No. 49, Charles-street. I afterwards saw the prosecutor, and at two o'clock in the morning we went there, and took the prisoner in bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I not stood at the corner, for a quarter of an hour - A. No, I followed him to the corner,</p>

            . I am a watchman of Drury-lane, my box is ten yards from Parker-street. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I head a cry, ran out, and saw the prosecutor in the kennel - he said he had been robbed. I saw the backs of two people a great way down Parker-street - I followed them into Cross-lane. Trimbey ran down there, and took the prisoner at the corner of Charles-street; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is this one" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know - take him;" we took him to the watch-house, could not find the prosecutor, the constable of the night discharged him; we returned into Drury-lane, found the prosecutor, and by his discription, which answered to the prisoner, we went and took him again. I picked up part of the handkerchief within ten yards of where the prosecutor was stopped, and in the way he ran. I will not swear he is one of the two men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in town but two or three days, and went to live in Charles-street. I promised to meet a man at the corner of Newton-street; I had been waiting there about a quarter of an hour when the watchman asked, if I had seen any man pass, I said,</p>
               <p>"No;" he said, then you are the man, and took me - the watch-house keeper said, Jones was tipsy.</p>

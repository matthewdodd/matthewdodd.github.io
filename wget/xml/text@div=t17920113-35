               <p>I am a publican, at the Globe, in North Audley-street; the prisoner lodged at my house eight or ten days, a little before Christmas; Friday before, he went from my house, and returned on the Monday, with a hair trunk, and a box of china and plate; on Tuesday morning he said his uncle was dead, and had left him nine hundred pounds, and sent and had a lock and key put upon the hair trunk; on Wednesday he went to Mr. Ibbott, in Broad-street, and said that Mr. Ibbott went to look over the will, and that he had a quantity of plate left him by his uncle; I understood him to talk of the plate and china in the box: on Thursday morning he asked me to go with him to the silversmith's, to sell a pair of candlesticks, Mr. Dalby's, Bond-street, and he said Mr. Ibbott was to go with him to his uncle's, at Windsor, to see if there was any thing more of plate left, at twelve o'clock: he took the plate away that day to Mr. Ibbott, as he told me; he went away in a hackney-coach, and took it in the coach with him: on the Friday morning I saw the coachman that took him, and I asked him where he took the box; in consequence I gave information, and had him apprehended; I saw him in custody the Wednesday after, and he was committed: the hair trunk was opened in the tap-room on Tuesday, the day after he brought it, and I saw most of the articles; three or four pair of candlesticks, a bread-basket, and some silver spoons; I never saw the box again till I saw it at Bow-street; the officers found it, and I believe it is the same I saw at my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I expose them all about to the people in the tap-room, and say they were come up from the country to me? - You did, and said they came by the coach.</p>
               <p>- DALBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a silversmith, in New Bond-street: one of the witnesses brought the prisoner at the bar to my house, Wednesday the 28th of December, and brought some silver tablespoons, and a caster, for me to weigh them; Abbott said they had been laying a wager about the weight, and wished to know; and I weighed and told them, and they took them away; they were both strangers to me then: on Friday morning, the 29th, they came again, and brought a pair of candlesticks, and I asked Abbott if they were the prisoner's property or not; he said, yes, he knew they were, and that his uncle was dead, and had left him nine hundred pounds; I asked him his name, and where he lived; he said Abbott, and kept the Globe, in North Audley-street; I said I should put his name down, to know, if any thing should happen about these candlesticks; with that, I weighed the candlesticks, and gave him the money for them, 7 l. 11 s. 6 d.; I have kept them ever since.

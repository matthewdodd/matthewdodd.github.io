The prisoner was in my service about five weeks. A silk dress was sent to me to dye; it contained three breadths, about a yard and a quarter long; the prisoner had it to tack for finishing, among other work; she returned all but one breadth to me; it had been dyed about a week before she had it. I sent for her, and she called at the shop, I neither promised or threatened her; she said she was sorry for what she had done. I had at that time a bonnet in my posession covered with silk; Warner delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you deliver the silk to her yourself - A, No; it was sent up to her; I told her parents that if she gave me much trouble it would be worse for her; I said, if she confessed relative to other business, it might be better for her.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you a piece of the silk - A. Yes; I know that on the bonnet to be part of the same from the colour and quality; it is a French silk.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 23d of April, I went to a house in Somers-town, where I found the prisoner; I told her I wished to see a bonnet which she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140029"></xptr>had been making up at our house on the Saturday before; she said she had not, she had made one up on Saturday week; I asked to see that; she went up stairs, and brought down a Leghorn straw black bonnet; I said that was not what I wanted, and I was determined to see the right, and told her to go up and fetch the other; after some hesitation she went and brought this bonnet; after saying she had acted very wrong in taking a breadth, and making it into a bonnet, I said I should send for an officer, and take her away; she fell on her knees, and asked forgiveness, and said she had taken it out of the silk box where they are kept; I said I could say nothing to it as, it was not my property - she got up and ran away with a young man, who was with her. I took the bonnet to Mr. Duggan. I have been a dyer, and I am certain that the silk bonnet is made of part of the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you never see two pieces of silk of exactly the same colour - A. Yes; when they were dyed together. I did not knock her down. I believe she fell down as she ran out of the room. I was rather irritated but did not catch hold of her to my knowledge. She had been discharged.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as the prisoner. I never saw this bonnet till Warner called. I was present; he told her if she came forward and acknowledged to taking the silk, he did not wish to hurt a hair of her head. I afterwards went with her to Duggans to deliver herself up.</p>

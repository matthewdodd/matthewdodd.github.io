                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Knightsbridge—Stevens was in my employ between four and five years. On the 10th of Feb. he was sent with my cart and horse with some fat to Elborough's, a tallow<lb></lb>melter, in South Audley-street—he had no authority to dispose of it to any one else—I saw him start between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and was in the employ of the pro<lb></lb>secutor—I am not now. About ten minutes to five o'clock on the evening of the 10th of Feb., I saw Stevens coming up Piccadilly with Mr. Jeffery's cart, alone—he turned round Park-lane, then stopped the horse, and took Watson up into the cart—Watson had an empty bag—Stevens then drove up Park-lane, turned down Hertford-street, and stopped about four minutes—they then took some fat out of the cart, and put it into Watson's bag, and went a little way, then Watson got out, and Stevens handed him a bag of fat on the shafts of the cart, and Watson came down towards Hertford-street—I followed, and gave him in charge of a policeman—I went with him to the station—I then came with a, policeman down to Mr. Jeffery's, and took Stevens.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were you in Mr. Jeffery's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left the last time about three weeks before Christmas—I have not been in employ since—I did not leave on a charge of robbery that 1 am aware of—I have no idea at all what I left for, my master never assigned any reason—I had been working for him nine or ten months on and off, but at this time I had been there five weeks regularly—I never was told that I left on suspicion of having robbed my master—I am not aware that Stevens detected me in the act of stealing from my master—I never robbed him of anything—there were wages due to me when I went away, which my master paid, and said when he wanted me again he would send for me—I did not ask for a charac<lb></lb>ter—since I left him I have lived upon my friends—my mother has sent me up money when I wrote—she lives at Southampton—I cannot tell when I wrote to her last, or what was the last amount of money I had from her, whether it was a bank note, or gold, silver, or copper—I knew Mr. Jeffery's horse and cart—the horse was walking when I first saw it—I lodge with Mr. Lloyd, Lancelot-place, Brompton—there was no question made about a leg of mutton, or a shoulder when I was with my master.</p>

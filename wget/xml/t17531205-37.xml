            . I was not here at the trial, nor when the prisoner received sentence. The day after he was taken I went to Clerkenwell Bridewell and saw him, and said I was sorry to see him; he told me he was taken up for returning from transportation before the time, and that it cost his father thirteen guineas and a half, and they let him go; I asked him what ship he went over in, he said the Greyhound; I asked him who went with him, he said Penprice was one that went with him and died in the voyage.</p>

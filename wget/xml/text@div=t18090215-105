               <p>Q. On the 14th of October last do you recollect being at the Kings Arms public house - A. Yes; I went to pay the men at four o'clock, there were three carpenters, a bricklayer, and a labourer; the prisoner stopped about twenty minutes behind, then he came in and sat down by himself in the tap room, separate from the other men; I paid the men; after that I went down to the building, I missed the brass cock and the pipe; I saw it that day, before I went to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the pipe - A. About two shillings and sixpence, and the cock sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Some time after that you met a man of the name of Cummings - A. I did, on the 6th of this month; I missed the lead and the cock on the 15th. On the 17th of October I had some information from some children in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he and you upon good terms - A. We were upon good terms, I had no difference with him whatever except in this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he brought any action against you - A. He has; that was after the 15th of October, he brought in a balance of seven pounds odd due to him; I paid him four pounds to get rid of him because he was a troublesome man.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you notice of trial - A. About a fortnight ago; he was apprehended a week after that, When the officer went to apprehend the prisoner the prisoner said he would not go without he shewed his warrant; the prisoner made his escape.</p>

            . I live at 44, Brook street.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where you live commands a prospect of Mr. Ben's premises - A. On the 15th of October last I was at work at my own shop, at my bench under the window, I could see the premises very plain, even the ground; I saw the prisoner standing with his back towards me, he had a piece of leaden pipe in his hand, between two and three foot long; it seemed to be something of the leaden pipe that belonged to the premises, I did not observe the cock to it; he was standing about five or six feet from where the pipe stood. On the 6th of February I communicated it to Mr. Ben. I accompanied Mr. Ben and Mr. Partridge to apprehend the prisoner; when we went to his house he was not at home; we went then to No. 15, Quaker street, he escaped through the roof. I apprehended him; I said Lawrence, I want to speak to you; he said do not hurt me; I said there is so and so after you; I told him I would conceal him, for the purpose of drawing him forward; I said how silly you were to steal the water pipe: he replied so I was, but good luck to you, you are a good fellow; do not say a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you, Partridge, and Mr. Ben went to apprehend him - A. On the 14th; Valentine's day.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you not to tell Mr. Ben of it on the 15th of October - A. I had no acquaintance with him then; I did not suspect that he was going to steal the pipe till a woman accused him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your shop - A. No. 44, Brook street, in the second story room.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the premises where the cock was - A. Yes; even to the foundation; if a shilling laid close to the foundation I could see it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

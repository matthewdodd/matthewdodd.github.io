Mr. Connolly, the minister of the Roman Catholic church, Moorfields—I believe that letter has been burnt—she came between two and three in the afternoon—no gentleman accompanied her—she was received into the Asylum, slept there that night, and was discharged on the following day, in consequence of giving a wrong Dame, and saying she had not been there before—she gave the name of Angelina Adams—it was discovered she had been in the house before—I cannot positively say when it was, but I think it was about ten months before—she certainly had not been there three months prior to 15th Oct.—I did not cut her hair, or give any directions for it to be done—no persons called nuns held her while I did it, or desired it to be done—I am called in the Covent, sister Mary Joseph—no other person there is called by that name, or by the name of sister Joseph—there is no other person of the name of Joseph there—persons are eligible to be admitted into the Asylum, whether Protestants or Roman Catholics—we understand the prisoner to be the same as ourselves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 47, Upper Seymour-street, Euston-square. I am a Catholic, what you distinguish by calling a Roman Catholic—I occasionally attend the Catholic chapel, in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell—one night last Feb. I met the prisoner there—it was not service time, but I had been to see the clergyman, as a duty of our religion—I found her there, and when I left, she asked me if I was not going in her direction—I asked her which way that was, she said, "towards King's-cross," and I said I was going towards Somers-town—she told me she had been in service, and had saved a few shillings from her last service, she was then living in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road; her money was exhausted, and she expected to be turned away from her lodging—I told her if that should take place, she might have a share of my room, if she had no better place to go to—she afterwards came—on 10th March I moved to another house, and she moved with me—after a little while she became acquainted with a woman in the next room, and went and lived with her—she afterwards disappeared, and I next saw her by my steps, some time in July—she asked me to take her in again—I looked at her, and saw she was looking very miserable, and said, "Where is your hair?"—she said, "I have been very bad, and they cut it off in St. Pancras workhouse"—she had a lock of it in her hand, but none on her head—she was very ill afterwards, and on 17th July I took her to the Free Hospital, in Gray's Inn-lane, and afterwards to Charing-cross Hospital—I saw her while she was. in the hospitals, every Sunday—I think I visited her four Sundays—on the next Sunday I sent, and beard she had left—I went myself on the Monday and found she had gone—that was some time in Sept.—she followed up the duties of our Church—we went to the same altar, and took the sacrament together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of St. Pancras workhouse. I know the prisoner by the name of Mary Ann Burke—she was admitted into the workhouse infirmary on 11th April, when she was suffering from scrofulous symptoms, and an enlargement of the abdomen; and I apprehend from the appearances that the glands of the abdomen were scrofulously affected—she remained till 11th July, when she left of her own accord—when she came in she had her hair—it had not been cut in any way—about a month before she left, it was cut as close as it could be, by my orders—it was not shaved off—I considered that was necessary to be done from the state of her disease—her hair is now grown as much as I can expect it to be from that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you order her hair to be cut off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was suffering from fever, and a good deal of derangement about the brain—she had then only been suffering from it a very short time—the derangement of the brain was brought on by the illness under which she was labouring—scrofulous illness is very painful, and calculated to produce great excitement consequent on the pain—the excitement consequent on the pain produced the derangement of the brain, which induced me to have her hair cut off—there was no particular danger, but I had the hair cut off to relieve the symptoms under which she was labouring—her hair was cut off by the barber, in the infirmary on the ground-floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not attribute the pains in the abdomen to the scrofulous disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; at first I did not make up my mind to what to attribute it; but subsequently I thought it was principally hysteria—that operates in a variety of forms—it is possible it might operate on the mind—it is the same thing as hysterics—the feverish symptom! I noticed were in the secretions of the body, and the tongue was furred, and the skin hot, and there was general constitutional disturbance—I do not think that that and the pain in the abdomen would excite the imagination of the mind—hysterics occasionally excite the imagination and mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nurse at the Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-lane. I remember the prisoner being there as a patient—I attended her in the female accident ward, for rather more than two weeks—her hair was cut close when she came in; I remarked it to her, and she said it was owing to having the fever so frequently; and it was done to her while she was in the workhouse—after she had left the hospital, I went to see her at the House of Detention, while she was under this charge; she recognised me in a moment—I said, "Do you know me, Mary Ann?"—she said she did—I said, "Who am I?"—she said, "My nurse;" and began to cry—I knew her by the name of Mary Ann Burke—she had first of all said that was her name, and afterwards said that it was Adams.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Roman Catholic priest and clergyman, at Moorfields Chapel. On Sunday afternoon, 5th Oct., I saw the prisoner in the chapel—in consequence of what was said to me, I asked her what religion she was—she said she did not know; she was an orphan, and had never been in any place of worship in her life; she had began an evil course on the streets at the age of thirteen, and continued it for six or seven years in and about London—I asked her if she was going on in the same course still—she said she was then living in a house of ill-fame, in Half-moon-pas<lb></lb>sage, Aldersgate-street—I gave her some temporary assistance, and spoke to her two or three times between that day and 15th Oct., on which day I gave her a letter, addressed to the Superior of the Convent of the Good Shepherd, at Hammersmith—after I had questioned and endeavoured to instruct her in the elements of Christianity, of which she was totally ignorant, I asked her if she was desirous of reforming—she said she was; and I told her there was a house at Hammersmith for such, and I had no doubt I could obtain her admis<lb></lb>sion—I communicated with the principals there, gained their consent, and sent the prisoner there with the letter on 15th Oct.—I did not know she had been an inmate there before—I gave her the means of conveying her to Hammersmith—I did not see her again till she was before the Magistrate.</p>

I have known the defendant from her childhood—I got her into St. Patrick's Roman Catholic school, at Hampstead, where she was educated; and about four years ago, I got her into the Convent of the Good Shepherd; she remained there about seven months—when she has been in distress, she has applied to me for spiritual direction—she is a Roman Catholic.</p>

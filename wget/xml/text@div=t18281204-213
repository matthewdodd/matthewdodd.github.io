            . I am errand-boy to the prosecutors. On the 1st of November I had this parcel to deliver at the Bell and Crown, and was going down Skinner-street - the prisoner stood outside Muncaster's (the pawnbrokers) window, and called to me; he asked if I would go and fetch him a coach - I had another boy with me: he said he would give us 6d. a piece - he gave us 1s.: I put my bag down, and said to the little boy, "You mind the bag," and while I was going I met the little boy by the Saracen's Head; I had been absent four or five minutes: the boy told me to bring a chariot - I immediately ran back to where I left my goods, and the prisoner was gone, bag and all; this was on Saturday - I saw him on the Monday morning, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you pointed him out the moment you saw him? A. Yes - I saw him come out of the lock-up place; the officer met some gentleman on the Saturday night, in Gracechurch-street, but I did not think right to go near them; I do not know whether that was the prisoner - I did not see his face - I was about three yards from him, but was not looking that way; we were going along and met him - I was about a yard behind the officer; the officer tapped him on the shoulder, but I did not see him do that - he stopped, and talked to him, and then I went away; it was rather dark- I did not hear what passed, and did not know it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were looking that way? A. They were looking towards Fenchurch-street, and I towards Bishopsgate-street; I described the person who robbed me as being above forty years old, and of very low stature; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge - I went to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave information directly, and about half-past five o'clock saw the officer tap the gentleman on the shoulder; I was robbed about four.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by a man of low stature? A. He was not tall.</p>

            . I was with Moorhouse; a man stood at a door in Skinner-street, by Seacoal-lane, and a man at the top said, "A man wants you there;" we went to him: he said he would give us 6d. each to fetch a coach - I staid by the goods, and he said to me, "Go and tell him not to fetch a coach but a chariot, and make as much haste as you can;" I went, and when we came back the bag and man were gone; we went to the watch-house directly - I left the bag with the prisoner; he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had he the same clothes on then? A. No, he was dressed in black - he had black trousers on; I never saw him before - I was keeping my eye on the goods: I was with the prisoner about nine minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been repeating your story to any body? A. No, Sir - Yes, Sir; nobody told me to say it was nine minutes - the man appeared about forty, but not more, and of a low size; nobody told me to say he was about forty.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What age do you think the prisoner is? A. About forty, and of low stature.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not cry, and tell your father next day that you were not there at all? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you tell your father so? A. I was afraid he would beat me.</p>

            . I am an officer. About a quarter-past four o'clock on Saturday a lad came to St. Andrew's watch-house, and said he had been robbed; I went in pursuit, and met two persons in Aldgate High-street that night - the prisoner was one; he said, "Mr. Gray, how do you do?" I said, "Very well, thank you," and walked away; the boy might be a yard or two off: I went to the office, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew at the time you were looking for the robber? A. Certainly - he was walking in the same line with me; he might pass the prisoner face to face - he might be a few feet behind, but he must have passed him; it was near a shop window, with a gas-light to it.</p>

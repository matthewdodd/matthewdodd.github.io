I rent the house, the shop is part of it. On the 2d of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I stood about sixty or seventy yards from my door, and thought I saw a man go into my shop; I went towards the shop, and about forty yards from it met the prisoner with a carriage harness, complete, except the bridle and reins - (another coachmaker lives just by) - I said,</p>
               <p>"What is your pleasure, what do you want there?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Where?" I said</p>
               <p>"Did not you come out of the coachmaker's?" he said No. I let him go, thinking the property was not mine. I returned to my shop, missed part of the harness, which had hung inside my shop, and pursued, but could not find him. I saw the harness at Bow-street, and am sure it is mine. I picked out the prisoner from six others, and am certain of him.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and know the prisoner perfectly well. On the 2d of February, about two o'clock, I saw him Everett-street, Brunswick-square, with the harness; I turned back to my master's house, and told him I suspected the prisoner - he desired me to go after him. He was not out of my sight. I went and asked him if the harness was for sale - he said Yes, and asked 25 s. for it. I saw there was no bridle, and noticed it. He said he had not got it. I asked him if he was disturbed, and could not get it? He said he did not know what I was talking about, it was given him to sell by a groom. I said it was odd a groom should have such harness to sell, as it was new. He said he was well known about the neighbourhood, and went with me to No. 51, Great Guildford-street - they knew nothing of him. I let him go, and took it to my master's, and in the evening I took it to Bow-street. He called at my master's that evening for it. I refused to give it up till he went before a Magistrate, and gave him in custody, and delivered the harness to Pitcher.</p>

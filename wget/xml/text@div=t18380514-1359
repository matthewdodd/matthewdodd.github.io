                  </hi>. I lice in King-Street, Seven Dials, and am an oilman. I know a person of the name of Stephen Fosdick, of Holborn—he keeps a tavern—on the forenoon of Saturday, the 7th of April, the prisoner came to my shop—I had seen him once before—he said Mr. Fosdick had sent him for a gallon of turpentine-varnish, to varnish his club-room—he turned round, and by the dimensions of my shops, showed me the size of the room—I gave him the varnish in a tin can, and he requested the loan of two brushes—on the Saturday evening I wanted one of the brushes—I went for it, and found it out—on the Monday the prisoner came again, and said Mr. Fosdick had some pictures, and he wanted some more varnish—I gave Him this, believing he came from Mr. Fosdick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I owe the prosecutor more than 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had dealt with him a Fortnight previous to this. Witness. No, he had obtained some goods for Mr. Fosdick—he had a very trifling thing, and I sent it down, and he came Almost every day for things for Mr. Fosdick—he had been at work there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor misunderstood me, and booked the things to Mr. Fosdick—I promised to pay him on the Saturday evening, and he Promised me five per cent. For cash. Witness. No, I did not—I said when Mr. Fosdick paid him I would allow him five per cent, for the recommend<lb></lb>ation—he said Mr. Fosdick sent him to me-at the time he had these Things he had left Mr. Fosdick, and he said Mr. Fosdick wanted them to Do his club-room—I have not grounded this charge on any previous deal<lb></lb>ing—I willingly lose that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler in High-Holborn. The Prisoner is a painter and plumber—I employed him in my house, and he Finished his work—I did not send him for a gallon of turpentine-varnish—he was employed by me to use some in the beginning of April, and he used About a gill in what he did for me—he merely varnished a small sign-board—I had no intention of varnishing a club-room—I never told him I had—I did not authorize him to use my name to get any goods—I paid him on The 3rd of April—I did not see him again till he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I had bought two or three things at the prosecutor's And I thought it a likely place to receive credit at—I went there, telling him I was employed by Mr. Fosdick of the Kings's Arms, and if he pleased he would be answerable for me, and he misunderstood me—some articles were sent to me at Mr. Fosdick's on the first occasion—after that I had a variety of small articles of him, and returned the brushes and pots when I had used them-when I got the varnish I told him I had a club-room to do, and I expected to have some varnishing for Mr. Fosdick.</p>

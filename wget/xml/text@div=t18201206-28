On the evening of the 1st of November Mr. Guest, a pawnbroker, of Fleet-market, came and inquired if we sold women's shoes, as a young woman had pledged three pair, and brought another pair that morning, which they stopped - she gave her address No. 36, Snowhill. I shewed my private mark, which he said corresponded with those on them. Upon going to his house I recognized them as mine. He came again in the morning, and saw the prisoner, who is the lodger's servant - she did not deny the charge. One pair and an odd one were found in her box. She begged forgiveness. She said she had burnt the duplicates, and had a key which let her into the shop. The key was found on her - it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060014"></xptr>the key of the lodger's coal-cellar, and opened my ware-room and shop.</p>

On the 17th of October the prisoner pledged three pair of women's boots with me; she said one pair was her own, and the others belonged to somebody else.

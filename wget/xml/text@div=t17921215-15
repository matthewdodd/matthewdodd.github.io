I went and got an officer, and when we came down, he stood exactly as I left him; says I this is the manner that I left the man; you have a right to go in and search the house; I went into the house along with the constable; we found one girl there whom we understand is since dead; we went up stairs, I picked up part of a purse, and a pair of sleeve buttons, and the glass of a watch. The constable has got them. I had known the prisoner Dawson as much as two years, she had been backward and forward all that time. I know the other prisoners by sight, by resorting to her house. Dawson was the reputed owner of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simmons. I am sure you don't know me. - I know her extremely well, as coming backward and forward to that house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dawson. Who told you that I keeps the house Mr. Clarke? - Because she has said that nobody will get me out, because I can live rent free, if I like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dawson. He keeps a worse house than mine? - I always take such lodgers in, as are hard working people I don't take upon myself to say all that come are married.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simmons. Did not Rederick, lodge at your house? - I don't know, she might have been with a Mrs. Miller, but I did not approve of it; I told her if she would go away and take her company with her, I would forgive her what was due.</p>

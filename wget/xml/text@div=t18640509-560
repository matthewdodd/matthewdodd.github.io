                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Augustus Tettgen, tea-merchant, of Bishopsgate-street—on 5th February last, the defendant came to my master's shop, and ordered tea, coffee, sugar and chicory, to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were to be sent to 14, Duke-street, Borough, after 2 o'clock, and he said he would pay for them on delivery—I sent the goods by a person named Tatchell—he brought back no money—I went to the prisoner the same evening—I knew him perfectly well—I said to him, "I want payment of the account"—he said, "You shan't have it; you sent over a man to get payment of the account, and I gave him another order, and I will pay for both parcels when the other is delivered"—I said, "I will not go till I get payment of the first account"—he said, "You shan't have it to-night; call over to-morrow at 12, and you shall be paid"—I then went away—I went again the next day, at 12—I did not see the prisoner—I did not get any money at any time—I saw the prisoner once or twice after that, and asked him for the money; he refused it once, and the next time, he said he should not pay a farthing of it, if he could help it—I saw another man there sometimes, and rather a stout man, with a beard—I saw him three times with the prisoner, in his shop.</p>

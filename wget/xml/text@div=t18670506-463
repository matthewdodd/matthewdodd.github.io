                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 404 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). On Saturday evening, 6th April, about nine o'clock, I was sent for to the King's Head public-house, in Perrywinkle Street, Brook Street, Ratcliff; the landlord of the King's Head sent for me, and a man was given into my custody for breaking a square of glass—I told the landlord he had better summon him, and with that the man struck me in the chest—I then took him into custody for assaulting me—that was outside the house—I saw the three prisoners there—I was thrown down and dragged about twenty-five yards by my legs—I was kicked and bumped all the way—I still had hold of the man whom I first took in custody—when I was thrown down he was rescued from me—I went to the assistance of Sergeant Butt, who had Barrett in custody—Barrett had dragged me away from the man I had in custody—he knocked me down and knelt on my chest—he was punching me in the ribs—270 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> came up and pulled him off me, and I then went again to Butt's assistance—we got as far as Stepney Causeway, and the mob began to throw flint stones and bricks at us—Barrett and Sullivan were there at the time—I did not see Sullivan do anything—I took a woman named Murphy in custody, who has since been discharged, and while I had her in custody Bayley picked up mud from the gutter and threw it in my face all the way to the station—I was smothered in mud from head to foot—several constables came up, and the three prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

On Saturday evening, 6th April, I was present when this disturbance took place—I was in uniform, and Peed also—I received information of a row in Brook Street, and went there—I saw a crowd—I made my way through it—I saw Peed on the ground and several on the top of him—I asked the crowd to disperse and let the constable get up—some one said they were determined he should not get up—I told them I should draw my staff—some one said, "If you do we will kill you"—I was then struck a severe blow on the back of the head—I got Peed up and took the man into custody, and forced my way through the crowd with him as far as Harris's Court, when I was knocked down and kicked several times by persons in the crowd; I got up, still keeping hold of my prisoner—I saw Sullivan throwing stones, one of them struck Sergeant Freestone at the back of the head—I called out to Sullivan, "You blackguard, leave off throwing stones"—he took another stone from behind him, threw it, and hit me in the forehead and knocked me down insensible; it cut me, here is the mark now—Barrett was there and took part in the disturbance—I received another blow with a stone at the corner of the right eye—I then lost the prisoner that I had in custody; Barrett got hold of him, trying to rescue him from our custody, and he was leaning over Peed when I first went up—I saw Bayley in the crowd, but I did not see her do anything—I was taken to a shop by some gentlemen, and attended by Mr. Ross, the surgeon—I have been off duty ever since—the cut laid bare the bone; it was about two inches in length.</p>

               <p>I went to Brook Street—I got half a brick on the chin, and another on the neck, and I was seized by three men—I said, "If you don't let me go I will draw my staff"—I did so, and made my way through them—I got into the middle of the mob—I found Peed and Butt on the ground, and about eight or nine upon them—I shouted out, "Stand off," two or three times—they would not, and I was ultimately obliged to beat them off—Peed and Butt then got up, and Sullivan threw half a brick at me, but I stooped—I said, "That will do for you, <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi>"—as soon as I turned round I got another one, which cut my head, and laid bare the bone two or three inches—I bled a great deal—I turned round to look for Sullivan and he was moving off—I could not tell whether he threw it or not—in about half a minute afterwards I saw him at the left-hand side of the mob—he threw another brick, and hit Butt on the forehead and knocked him over—I am quite sure Sullivan threw it—I fought in the best way I could to keep the mob off as long as I could stand, I afterwards found myself in the doctor's shop—I was attended by a surgeon for three weeks—I did not gee Barrett do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday, the 23rd of July, I was going home to Denham, between two and three o'clock in the morning—I laid down just over the bridge, about 100 yards out of Uxbridge, on the Denham side—I was sober, but was tired, having been up two or three nights—I had two handkerchiefs and a waistcoat, which I put down by my side—I had a little bag, containing eight shillings and three sixpences, in my left-hand trowsers' pocket—I am sure I had it safe when I laid down—I awoke, and the pri<lb></lb>soner Warren had got his hand in my pocket—I had seen him several times before—I only know Clark by sight—I am sure Warren is the man—I told him he had got my money, and struck at him, and he struck at me again—Clark was standing on one side, within four or five yards—they then went up</p>

               <p>into Uxbridge—I had been lying down for two hours—when I charged them with robbing me, they said they had not—where I was lying, I think, is in Denham parish, and I think it is in Buckinghamshire—it is about 100 yards from Middlesex—I am sure the prisoners are the two men—I followed them as far as the bridge, then went back after my hat, and saw my bundle was gone—I did not see that they had any bundle.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Medway-place, Deptford. I have an empty house there which is the property of Mr. Thomas Beck—I have missed a quantity of lead off that house I have compared the lead now here with what remains on the house, and can swear it came from there—here is a piece cut from the side of a chimney—I do not know when I had seen it safe—I was on the roof about six months before, putting a piece up that some boys had cut away.</p>

Hebden, but I saw this prisoner at that time—I knew him before; Hogg brought him to me at the station-house door—I said, "Come to the light"—he said, "You remember Dance"—I did not know him till some thing was said about lead—It was dark—It was a moon-shiney night when I saw him first—Hogg brought him to me about six o'clock at night—I said, the moment I saw him in the light, "That is him" Hogg said, "Do you know this man?"—I said I did not that I knew of—he</p>

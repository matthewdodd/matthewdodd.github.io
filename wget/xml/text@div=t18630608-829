On the afternoon of 4th June, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoners in company together in St. Paul's church-yard—I knew them, and watched them—they were standing at the end of Ludgate-street, when I first saw them, and they moved from there outside a confectioner's shop—I saw a female come out of the shop and stand close to the window—Clark moved to the right side of the female and remained there</p>

I am single, and live at Bow—on 6th October last, at a few minutes to 12, I was at the Netting Hill Station—the prisoner came and asked me the right direction to the City; I said I was a stranger in London; she said she was a stranger from Manchester, and had travelled all night—I said I was going to Victoria Station, and she said she was going there, too—she said she bad to go to Brixton first, to see an uncle who was a Superintendent there, and she persuaded me to go with her—we went from Brixton to Vauxhall, and then by the water to Nine Elms—I had a mantle on my arm—she asked me to let her have it over her shoulders, as she had a weak chest—I did so, and took it from her again—we then went down to London Bridge—she said she wished me to see Westminster, and</p>

               <p>when we got to London Bridge she said there was an important meeting "being held about the war, and we could not go in—she then took me to Golden Lane, a very low place, and I was quite frightened—I did not know where I was, or I should have left her—it was then about 4.30—she said she wanted to find her friends, and that they kept a cook's shop—we got to Victoria Station about 7.56—she then asked me for my umbrella—I said she had no occasion to have it—she said she had to go to the hotel to get her things, and she did not like to go with nothing in her hands—she went and got it out of the fish shop, where I had left it with the mantle, while I was thanking the lady for taking care of my things—the prisoner told me to go to the booking office—I waited for her till 11 o'clock, and she never came—my shawl was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the umbrella 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer W.</hi>) On 27th October, I was called to the Brixton Police Station—I saw the prisoner there—I told her the was wanted for stealing a mantle and umbrella from a woman on 6th October—she said "I met the woman at the Netting Hill Railway Station, I went with her to the river, and by the steamboat; on the steamboat I asked her to lend me the mantle to keep my cheat warm. After we left the steamboat I asked her to let me have the mantle to go and see my uncle, who was a superintendent of police at Brixton, as I did not like to go with the shawl I had got on. After leaving Brixton Police Station we went to the Victoria Railway Station, and she gave me her umbrella to get 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, as she had not any money to pay for her luggage. I went and tried to get 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the umbrella, being late I could not get it, when I came back the woman had gone. The mantle I am now wearing is the one I had of the woman"—the prosecutor said it was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutrix said that I represented the super<lb></lb>intendent to be my uncle, and I did so because I was ashamed that she should know I was a ticket-of-leave woman. I went to the police-station to report myself. I have tried hard to get an honest living, but I have no friend, and no one to help me. I did not steal the mantle; I have not taken the value of a pin since I have been out, and sooner than thieve again I would destroy myself.</p>

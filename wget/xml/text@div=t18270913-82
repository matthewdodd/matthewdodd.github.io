            . I am a constable of the Regent's-park. On the 24th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming along the road, with this piece of stone on his back; he said he was going home, and had bought it of a man in the road; the officer came up, and I assisted in taking him to the watch-house - he then said he bought it of a man in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know he was engaged in building? A. Yes; I believe he has two little houses, and is getting up another - he first said he bought it of a man on the road, and then he said he bought it at Battle-bridge, of a man of the name of Jones, who lived at No. 33, Covent-garden. I believe Mr. Sellers went there, and said he could find no such person a stone-mason - he found a man of the name of Jones, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130075"></xptr>keeps a cook's-shop - we have not advertised the stone - I have not been to the prisoner's house.</p>

Very early Witsunday morning I was going along the street, I had staid a little late at a house that I had been at in the evening, a public house. I went there about eight or nine o'clock, and I might stay there till half past eleven, at the sign of the Hope, near where I live, Vine-street, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any other public house before that? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober at that time? - I was so far sober that I had my perfect recollection. I found that I could not conveniently get into my own house, my little boy slept very sound, and I took a walk down the Strand; I was perfectly full of spirits; I was not in liquor, but I was merry. As I was going along down the Strand I met with the prisoner at the bar, standing at the corner of an alley, and she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink? I told her I would give her a drop; and I went to give her a penny worth, whereabouts I cannot ascertain the place, not a great distance from where I met her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A little before you come to Church-court. After she had the liquor, I asked her where she lived? she said she lived at No. 6, in Church court; and as she was going along she met with a decent drest man, a stouter man than me, and they had a few words pass between them, what it was I know nor, I could not ascertain what the words were.</p>

            Did the man overtake her or meet her? - The man was standing, and she spoke to him; this was very near Church-court. Then we went immediately to <placeName id="t17950701-32-crimeloc169">Church-court, No. 6</placeName>

               <p>Q. The man left you? - Yes, for the present moment; the man did not come with me not that moment. I had not been at the door a very short time, before this man came up and began thumping me about the head in a very violent manner; I don't recollect that he spoke a word to me; and this woman she stood behind me. I was facing No. 6, the door was not open, and I don't know how or which way hardly it was done, but by some means or other they forced my hat and wig off, and my coat; they cut my shirt here, and at the same time, with something, they cut my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else besides this woman and this man? - There was a soldier stood by; but he did not offer to touch me or assist me, he stood on the right hand side of the man in the court, and a very good looking soldier he appeared to be too. I was obliged instantly to run away, naked as I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know what part the woman took in this business? - I have some reason to think that she had a hand in taking my hat and wig off; respecting my coat, I think it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think the woman took your hat and wig off? - Because she stood behind me, and it was taken off by somebody that did stand behind. It was a club wig, and a very easy matter to take it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this hat or this wig in the woman's hand at all? - I did not; I ran away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the coat in her hand at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again? - No, I never found any of the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see her? - Just standing at the corner of Hungerford-street, by the New Church, nearly opposite Church-court, where she was before. There was a man came up and I said, that is the woman, lay hold of her; and she was immediately taken to St. Martin's watch-house; but who the man was I cannot immediately ascertain.

            Will you undertake, on your conscience, to say that she was the woman that you see the second time, as was with you in the court? - The case stands as this, before I went to the watch-house I asked her what her name was? She said, saucy Bet Hambleton; but I did not think it any great harm then, as the woman did not appear in liquor. I am positive to the woman as ever I was to any thing in my life; her face had been pretty much coloured with something, and I knew her perfectly; her face is pale now, but then it was coloured with something what it was I know not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man says that I accosted him, he spoke to me first; I could not ask him home, because I was locked out myself; and another thing, I had no place to take him home.</p>

               <p>I have been a watchman these five years. As I was crying four o'clock, at the bottom of Whitcomb street, commonly called Hedge-lane, I saw this woman coming along with a coat under her left arm, and a hat and wig; she passed by me going towards Church-court. I said nothing to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of this woman before? - No; I may have seen her, but not to swear to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prosecutor to know that you had seen the woman and a hat? - I told our patrols that I see a woman go by with a hat and things in her hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the patrols said any thing to you about any robbery? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not present when the prosecutor laid hold of her? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutor.

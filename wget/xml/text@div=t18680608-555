                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock maker, and live at 7, Brooms<lb></lb>grove Street, Birmingham—on 1st June, about 1.30 in the day, I was coming along the Greenwich Road, and met the prisoner just by the toll-bar—he spoke first, and said that he could see that I was on the road, and offered me a bed for the night—I told him I was on the road, but I had a few coppers sufficient to pay for a bed—he said that if I would pay for a drink of beer he would let me sleep with him; that he was going to see his child, and if I would wait for him he would take me to his lodging—I waited in a public-house for him, and when he returned I took my coat off and threw it over my arm—as I was entering a public-house to get some more beer, he snatched it off my arm and ran away—I tried to catch him, but he was out of sight—I had not given it to him to pawn—I went to two or three public-houses and gave notice.</p>

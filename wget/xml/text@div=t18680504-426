               <p>5th March—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bills, which I kept in my possession—I asked him his name, he said Barnard Tyman—I saw the name of Henry Coleman on the bills, and I asked him how it was that the name of Henry Coleman was on the bills and his name was Barnard Tyman—he said he took his mother's maiden name—there was no endorsement on the bills at that time—he called daily at my house after that—he said he wanted to go to the War Office, in Pall Mall, to see about some property he had, and he thought about going back to Australia again, and would I advance him more money—I said I was not in the habit of doing such a thing, but as the bills were his I did advance him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., just as he wanted it, to go to London, and I paid a man to go up and down with him, until he got about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my debt—when he had been there about a week I asked whether he would go to the bank and get the bills changed; but previous to that I showed them to Mr. Bernard, a gentleman who came from the London and County Bank at Greenwich, in the prisoner's presence—he said if I liked he would send one through to Threadneedle Street, to see if they were good—I asked the prisoner if he would endorse them; he said he could not write—he got the waterman to write "Henry Coleman," and he put his hand to the pen and made a cross—I gave that bill to Mr. Bernard to send it through the bank, and they sent it back, saying the third one was accepted—I told the prisoner of it, and he said he would go to the Bank of Victoria with me—I said I could not go then, but I would send the waterman with him—I gave the waterman the bills, and told him not to give them up unless he got a satisfactory answer about them—I did not see the bills again, nor the prisoner—I have not got back my 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I only got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant and chief clerk at the Bank of Victoria, in Threadneedle Street—on 5th March, the prisoner came there with the first and second of these bills, there is a third of the same date; they are drawn by our head office at Melbourn, and made payable at our bank here—I asked the prisoner if his name was Henry Coleman—he said it was—I told him that the third had come forward and had been accepted, and it was down at Norwich—I gave him the address of the bankers in whose hands it was, the Provincial Banking Company; and also the Rev. Mr. Cooper, who had interested himself in the case, and told him he had better make his way down there and establish his claim to the accepted bill—I asked him if he knew William Coleman—he said he had a brother of that name—I also asked him whether William Coleman had a son in the colony—he said he did not know, that he had been twenty years in Australia and had very much lost sight of his relations in this country—I gave him back the two bills—on 26th March he came again, accompanied by another man—in the meantime I had received information—the man gave the bills up to me—the prisoner said he had not been to Norwich as I had advised him, and he would be glad if he could have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bills—I again asked</p>

I came from Australia on board the <hi rend="italic">Somersetshire</hi>—before I left I got some drafts from the bank—I sent one of them by poet to my father, at Fauncett St Mary's, Norfolk, the other two bills of the set I had in my own posession—I saw the prisoner not many days before I left, Barnard Tyman was the name he gave me—he went on board the <hi rend="italic">Somersetshire</hi> with me—I paid his passage for him, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me an I.O.U.; it was drawn up by the ship's agent—I put the I.O.U. and my two drafts into my purse, with six sovereigns, put it in my right hand trousers pocket, and tied it in so that I might not lose it, as I was very unwell—I went into the hospital on board—the prisoner attended to me—he took off my clothes and attended to me until we arrived at Blackwall—he then left the ship without telling me; he had washed and dressed me that morning, and said he was going to take me ashore—I heard no more of him—a day or so before he left I heard the rattling of what I fancied was those two drafts—he requested me not to say anything to anyone about my money—he said he would take me home to my father—a day or two before I heard the rustling I had taken out my purse, and I can positively swear the bills were then safe—the prisoner has taken my purse out when I have changed my things and tied it in for me—I gave him no authority to take the bills, or to get money on them—the afternoon that he left the ship, the ship's doctor and another gentleman came to me, and I found that the drafts and the I.O.U. were gone.</p>

I am us innocent of this as the babe unborn. If I had wanted to act the rogue on a creature like that, I could have put it in my pocket at any time; no one knew anything about it on board but him and me. When I came ashore I got drunk, and got locked up. When I was liberated, I went to this landlord's house; I was under the influence of drink. I gave him the papers, and some jewellery belonging to a lady, to take core of. I remained there I don't know how many days in a stupid state. I went and received my pension, and gave it to him to pay for the grog I had had. When I went to Fauncett St. Mary's he wrote to the authorities there, and had me taken into custody.</p>

On the 9th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, there was a lot of flannels at the door, secured by a chain- I stood behind the counter, and saw the chain move - I ran to the door, and the prisoner had then just got this roll of flannel off, and put it into his basket; there were between thirty and forty yards of it; he was going off with it - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "You need not trouble yourself to carry that further, I will take care of it, and you also," and secured him; nobody could have taken it but him - nobody else was near.</p>

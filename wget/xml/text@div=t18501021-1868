I have done wrong, and I have that about me which is wrong"—I found seven handkerchiefs under his shirt next his skin, one in each of his trowsers pocket, and one in his jacket pocket—he said first of all that two men laid them down along side the railway, that he went there and was going to take them to them, and they came out of the timber yard and gave him a shilling to put them about him to take them to the Blind Beggars, public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Tucker, a silk handkerchief maker, these handkerchiefs are his property, and in an unfinished state—they are not in a state in which they are sold—there are three of one pattern, three of another, and four of another, completely new, and from a new block from which no handkerchiefs have been finished—these four had been struck off on the Monday before—we missed them from the dying-room, which is an open room—the prisoner was in our employ some years, and was dismissed a fortnight or three weeks before—he had no business near the premises.</p>

               <p>safe at all—Kitchen had charge of them—he is not here—he left the premises that evening about eight o'clock—he would know how many were hanging up there, and how many were missing—they would be counted the next morning by a person employed for that purpose—he would be able to tell how many there ought to have been—they were counted in the evening, and some missed I was told—I have examined these four myself, and ascertained they came from that particular block—other people make handkerchiefs of this kind, but not this pattern.</p>

On Wednesday 16th Oct. between five and ten minutes past six, I met the prisoner about twenty-four or twenty-five yards from the gate leading into the field, where the building is which the handkerchiefs were taken from—he stepped on one side apparently to avoid me, which made me look round.</p>

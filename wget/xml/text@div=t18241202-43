I am a dress-maker and milliner. On Sunday, the 17th of October, at five minutes after six o'clock in the evening, we went out. I fastened every window and door of the house - it was nearly dark; we had a candle before we went out. I returned a few minutes before eight - I unlocked the door - we went into the kitchen for a light, and found the clothes all over the kitchen - they were all right when I went out. I missed some lace, ribbon, and three pieces and a half of Irish cloth, from the shop - it was Urling's lace - I cannot state the value of that or the Irish, but the ribbons were worth 8 l. I lost six handkerchiefs of one sort, and five of another. I found the windows all fast - the persons must have entered at the front door by a false key - they could have got in no other way. I found some of the property at Bow-street, a week or a fortnight after. (Examining a bundle of ribbons produced by

            ), these are mine. I had only bought them on the 13th. I know one piece by having cut three yards off it - and another I cut one yard and a half from - another I only bought four yards and a half of, and cut one and a half off. The papers, which had marks, are taken off them. Here is another piece, which I bought in Holborn, to trim a cap; and a piece of white, which I bought at a different place - here is a narrow piece, which I bought at the warehouse, and two pieces of brown, and one piece which I bought for an order. Here are other ribbons; I can partly speak to them all - here is a piece of lace which I bought in Holborn; and the handkerchief they are tied in, is exactly like a piece, of six, which I lost; it is new now, and not hemmed. None of them have my mark now, but are all similar to what I lost - the value of the ribbons here is 5 l. or 6 l.; all that I lost cost me 8 l., and I lost a great deal more lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you lived in Leather-lane long? A. No; I know that it is in St. Andrew's parish; our part is not in the city, or we must take up our freedom. I left nobody in the house - we went to chapel, and took the servant with us. I saw the goods on Saturday night, and had not been out on Sunday morning; we just went down the lane in the afternoon, but it rained, and we returned - the servant was at home then. My mark is taken off every one of the things, - here is one piece which I marked S, on the block, but it is scraped off - the rest were marked on paper. I know nothing of the prisoner - we left the house a little after six o'clock. I cannot say whether there was sufficient light then to discover a man's features.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker. I have a piece of sand-paper which was found in the bundle with these ribbons. Shires gave it to me. I had been making the fixtures of Jones's shop, and left it there a week before the robbery - here is the word "feet," written on it in my writing - it is not so plain as when I first saw it, and it has the dust of the wood on it which I was working with - I know it by the colour of the dust.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at Bow-street, when it was much plainer than now, that you could not swear to it? Yes; but when I looked at it, it was as plain as the alphabet. I said I did not wish to swear to it; I was rather in a flurry, not having been before a Magistrate before; but when I examined it it was very plain - I was sure of it. I know the dust as plain as the writing. I told the Magistrate I could not swear to it - I had not noticed the dust then - here is a piece of the wood which I had been working on.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 18th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Goswell-street-road. I knew him before, and said, "Lot; I want you;" he said, "My name is not Lot." I said, "Your name is Cartlidge;" he said, "No, you mistake me." I said, I should take him to Bow-street - he asked what I took him for. I said, on suspicion of a robbery which took place at Margate. I left him at the office, and afterwards took him to the Queen's-Head public-house, and there searched him, and found all the property produced in his right hand coat pocket - he said, they were what he had bought - the piece of sand paper was in his pocket, with the ribbons and lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say who he bought it of? A. No - he said nothing about one Lowndes. I never recollect the name being mentioned. I swear I never heard it mentioned. I saw Howell before the Magistrate, and asked him if he could identify the writing - he said, he could not - we were ordered to make haste before the Grand Jury, fearing they would break up; and his name was not put on the bill, because he could not identify the writing - he said, next morning, it was very clear to him that it was his writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him in the office who I had them from; and Mr. Smith, at Bow-street, took down the person's name, and the public-house where I said I had bought them. Shires was present at the time. I stated to him that I had not had them in my possession a quarter of an hour, and that I had them of a person named Lowndes - that I had not wholly purchased them; but had paid part of the money down, as I thought I could find a customer for them. Lowndes told me he had bought them at a sale on the Friday before - Mr. Smith and Ellis were present at the time - it was at the public-house that I told him most of this; and as to my committing the robbery, I had been out of the way three days, for fear of being arrested for a debt which I owed to one Murray.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES re-examined. When I searched him, he had 1 s., and a few halfpence; he said, he had a sovereign, but I did not find it.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Peter-street - the public-house is Nos. 16 and 17. I keep a sheep's head shop; and have known the prisoner sixteen years. I always heard his character to be that of an honest upright man. I know no other character of him - he dined with me on the 17th of October, about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock, and did not leave my house till a quarter to eleven, when I went with him to the Bull's-Head, where he slept; and he breakfasted with me in the morning. I took the lodging for him, as he said he was in debt, and wanted to keep out of the way for two or three days, as he was in fear of being arrested.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go out at all on Sunday afternoon? A. No; I and my wife were there; nobody else; we all three staid at home. I was taking a pipe and some porter with my friend Cartlidge, till tea time; and after tea we had some more - he was never out of my place for five minutes - I do not think it was half five minutes - he was out of my presence for about three minutes; but I think he went down into the cellar. I have lived four years in the house, and have been twenty-seven years in the neighbourhood - we did not go to church.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Sunday, the 17th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and breakfasted with us; and dined with us at a quarter-past one - my husband accompanied him to the next house about a quarter to eleven o'clock in the evening - he was not out of my sight from dinner time till then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he left the house after breakfast? A. He went out about twelve o'clock, and returned before one - we sat in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never out of the room? A. I might be in the shop; but never went out of doors - my husband fetched the porter from Chisholme's - there is no back door to the house - he could not go out without coming through the shop - he breakfasted with us on Monday; and staid till half-past ten o'clock. I heard of his being taken up next day - we did not go to Bow-street - we were not sent for - we did not know where he was till the Saturday following. I heard of his being taken up next day; but did not know where he was till Saturday, when he was in Coldbath-fields.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BARTRAM re-examined. I heard of his being taken on the Tuesday; and on the Saturday I saw him at Newgate - his son came to tell me he was there. I went to see him - this was on the Saturday following the Sunday on which he dined with me - he said, he was fully committed. On the Sunday before, he dined with me, I think a relation from Whitechapel, or my niece, dined with me - I cannot say which - Saturday is a busy day; but I went to him about twelve o'clock, which is a leisure time with me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. He was taken before the Magistrate on Monday, the 18th of October, and again on the 20th - he was fully committed on the Friday week; not before - he never stated that he had been at Bartram's.</p>

            . This happened on the 28th of March. I went out at about nine o'clock in the morning, and came home between ten and eleven at night; I have no family; nobody but myself; I live over the stables; I have a servant, who does my work over the stables; but she does not live there; I am quite a <rs id="t18160403-49-viclabel257" type="occupation">single man</rs>

When I came home, the first thing I discovered was the door open; I went up stairs, and discovered the door of the hay loft open, which goes into the mews; they had come in through the cieling When I opened the dwelling room door, the cieling there, was broken. I discovered some clothes were gone, a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of small clothes, a handkerchief, and two shirts, a gold brooch, upwards of two pounds in silver, and a one-pound bank note; there is a door which opens from that room to another room, which door had been locked; but it was broken open with a poker and tongs. I learned from my man who helps me to clean my horses, that a man had slept in a coach house in the mews all night, and I asked him if he would come with me, and he did. We went to the man who owned the coach-house, and I told him what had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030036"></xptr>happened, and he said, we were extremely welcome to search his place. I asked my man if he had seen the prisoner at the bar that day; I had seen him several times before; he had been a regular servant with a man in the mews for about a month. In consequence of questions I asked, I found the prisoner had absconded. We did not see nor hear any thing of him for about a week; at last, I gained information of him, and we went down very early last Sunday morning, and found him at his father's house; his father lives at the other side of Hockland, by a place called Birchinghall. When I got there, we found my coats in his father's house; two waistcoats on his person, a pair of small clothes on his person, a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pair of boots, all on him. Mr. Lee found the brooch in his pocket; but no note, no money, nor silver.</p>

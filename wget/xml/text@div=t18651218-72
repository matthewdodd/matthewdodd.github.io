               <p>the wife of Thomas Griffiths, who works at the gas works near the Temple—on the morning of 26th November, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was looking out of my window, on the second floor, into the corner of Pleydell-street—I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and two other men in the court—I can swear positively to the prisoner, I could not swear to the other two—the prisoner was talking to the prosecutor, as if to a friend; then he twitched his chain and pulled it, and then took it right off his neck—the old gentleman resisted feebly—the prisoner put the chain in his coat pocket—I could not see whether there was a watch attached to it—the prisoner then put his hand into the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and then into his trousers pocket—the other men stood round him, but did nothing—the prisoner then enticed the prosecutor to have something to drink—I did not see him strike him—I told my husband to go and get a policeman—I kept my eye on the window till they got out of my sight—I then put on my bonnet and shawl, and went to the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness' husband—on this morning I was sitting at the table having my breakfast—my wife was looking out at the. Window—she called me, and I saw the prisoner take a chain off the prosecutor's neck—lie held it feebly by the left-hand—the prisoner took it off, put it first in his left hand then in his right, and then shoved it into his pocket—I then put on my coat, and went down into Temple-lane, and at the end, by the dung-holes, I saw the prisoner with his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, fumbling about—I went to look for a policeman—I saw two men who said they were detectives, and I heard one of them say to the prisoner, "What have you been doing to the old man?"—the prisoner had dropped a shilling and something at the corner, and was stooping to pick it it up.</p>

On Sunday morning 26t November, about half-past 9, I was at the corner of Temple-lane—Mrs. Griffiths came to me, and in consequence of what she said, I ran to the bottom of Pleydell-court, and stopped the prisoner there—I asked him what he knocked the old man down for—he said he would gouge my eye out—another officer came up, and we took him to the station—he was very violent at first—while being searched, with his left-hand, he tried to pass this piece of gold-chain over the dock—another officer seized his hand, and gave it to me—I have two pieces of chain here-one piece was picked up off the floor, close by his feet in the dock—I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket, a gold watch, key, and a knife, and when I went down the lane, I saw the prosecutor between the two dung-holes in the act of getting up—I ran past him to go after the prisoner—he came to the station, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

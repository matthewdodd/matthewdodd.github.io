                  </hi>. I live at 28, Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital, and am a carpet-planner. On 8th Oct., about twelve o'clock—I was with Walters on the tow-path of the canal between Macclesfield-road and the Gutter-bridge, angling—I heard a rustling of leaves for two or three minutes—I looked about, and could see no one—at last I saw the prisoner rise up from the hedge—he stood, looked about, and walked up the embankment into the Park—he was alone—I then saw a great bundle of leaves piled up near the hedge, Walters went towards the spot—I remained where I was, and afterwards saw the prisoner and another person come down—the prisoner had a hamper on his shoulder—they came down half-way, and when they saw me they made a stand, and sat down—they brought the hamper, and were about to take the clock, and I said, "You gentlemen, be careful what you are doing; I saw the taller one place the time-piece there"—I had not seen it, but was aware of it from Walters—they turned back again, and in two or three minutes the one not in custody came down in the embankment, looked at me, and said, "What did you say?"—I said he was quite aware of what I had said—he walked down, took the clock, and went away with it—he had not the hamper then—the prisoner was not in sight at that time, he was up the embankment—I next saw them turn the corner of the Alpha-road, walking as fast as they could together—the prisoner had the clock in the hamper on his shoulder—I got close to them, and was just going to get hold of them, when the other man turned and saw me—they put the hamper down in the street, and both ran away—the prisoner had on a dark cap similar to this one—I got the clock, and gave it to a policeman.</p>

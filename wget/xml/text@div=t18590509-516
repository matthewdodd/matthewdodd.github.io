                  </hi>. I live at 7, Saint Anne's-place, Limehouse, in the parish of Saint Anne's—early on the morning of 13th April, or after mid<lb></lb>night, I went over my house and locked it up—I particularly marked some shutters in the front window looking into the street—I went to bed, and about 4 o'clock I was called up—I looked at the same shutters, and observed that they must have been drawn open—the screw had been drawn—the bolt from the bottom was gone—the two hand-screws were drawn very much, and by forcing those bolts any one could have got in—I did not miss anything till the policeman awoke me, when he showed me this workbox, and asked me if it was mine—it contained a pair of ear-rings—this apron is mine—I had seen them safe at 12 o'clock at night, when I went to bed—I had to move the box to fasten the shutters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you put the light out before you went to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the window bad no fastening—I fastened the shutters—I did not sleep in that room—I never heard the policeman say that he was going to look for his mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the window have been opened from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it would take a great deal of trouble, because the sash-cords were broken—the shutters could easily have been forced from the outside—the sash-lines were broken previous to this, so as to make it difficult to raise the window—I was sleeping up stairs, and I heard no noise whatever until the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman, K</hi> 4). About 1 o'clock, on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 13th April, I was in the Commercial-road, near Saint Anne's-street, Limehouse—I met the prisoner there.—he asked me to direct him to a coffee shop—I did so—that was about a hundred yards or more from the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house—I saw the prisoner after this several times walking to and fro in the Commercial-road, near Saint Anne's-street—just before 4 I saw him turn into Saint Anne's-street—I saw that the prosecutor's shutters were open—I heard a noise as of a window being shut, and I saw the prisoner coming towards me—I was standing at the top of the street—I said to him "What have you got under your coat?" he said, "Nothing"—I then took hold of his coat, turned it back, and I found there this work-box—it was locked—I took him down Saint Anne's-street; and, when I got to the house, I said, "How did you become possessed of this box?" he said, "That is where I got it," pointing to where the shutters were open—I then rapped at the door—after a few minutes the prosecutor came down—I examined the shutters, and found the middle bolt drawn, and two screws drawn at each side—it appeared to me that whoever got hold of the shutters must have pulled them from underneath, at the bottom.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is not this a house of ill-fame? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is—I gave the box to the prosecutor's wife, while I went to fetch my mate—I do not think I, was away more than two or three minutes—I took the box, part of the way to the station-house, and the prosecutor's wife carried it the other part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I am a seafaring man—I had a drop of liquor, and separated from my shipmates—I was looking for a coffee-house, and passed this house—the shutters were open, and the window—I saw the box, took it up, and stayed by the house—the policeman took me, knocked the people up, went away to find his mate, and then took me into custody—I have been eleven years in and out of the port of London.</p>

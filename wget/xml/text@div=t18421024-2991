                  </hi>. I live in Leather-lane. At a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, on the 19th of October, I met the pri<lb></lb>soner—she made a sort of curtesy—I did not recognise her, but she turned round, and offered me her hand—she then told me a tale of distress about her sister, whom she had left in the agonies of death—I supposed she was about making an appeal for charity, but I found that was not the case—I crossed the road, and re-crossed, in order to avoid her—I thought she was about leaving me—I walked down a street in the Hampstead-road—she still followed me—I told her I had business to attend to, and I could not be <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> with her—she took me by my clothes, and pressed me very hard to accompany her—I felt her hand in my pocket—I shrunk back, and the gold dropped on the ground—I had felt her hand in my pocket—she</p>

               <p>ran away—I cried, "Stop thief"—I picked up one sovereign at my feet—I pursued, and immediately a man endeavoured to stop me—he took me by the collar—a second one took me by my collar, I got away from him; and a third opened his arms, endeavouring to stop me—I got to the prisoner, and she was then in custody of the officer—he found four sovereigns—we returned to the spot, and found another sovereign in the same place, on the pavement.</p>

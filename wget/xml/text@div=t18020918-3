             sworn. - I live at Old Brompton, near Chelsea; I have known the prisoners perfectly well since the middle of May last; Snowden occupied a house adjoining mine, at the end of the garden, and Wood was frequently there; Snowden occupied a stable of mine; on the morning of Wednesday of 25th of August, I went into the hay-lost over the stable, and saw three horses seeding, one was a black horse, apparently a carthorse, and a grey horse feeding from the rack; there was also another black horse, which belonged to Snowden; in the evening of that day, I heard Wood distinctly say to somebody, I cannot say who," I wish they were at home;" but whether he meant the horses or not, I cannot say, and I heard something, which appeared to me as if they were clipping with scissars; the next morning, about six o'clock, I went again to the same place, and the horses were all three gone; Mr. Fillingham's servant afterwards shewed me a cart-horse, which I believe to be one of the horses which I saw in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you went into the stable, you had no suspicion that the horses had been stolen? - A. I had not; I thought it was odd that they should be brought there in the night, remain the whole day, and be taken away in the night again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the hay-lost? - A. I suppose five or six minutes; Snowden had promised me the possession of the stable; it wanted some repairs, and I went to see the condition of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You being above the horse, could not discover whether it was a horse, or a mare? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WESTMORE sworn. - I am tap-boy, at the Greyhound, at Bath; on Friday the 27th of August, the two prisoners came into my master's stables, about nine o'clock in the evening; Wood rode upon a black poney, and Snowden on his own black horse; the black poney was a carthorse; I saw them delivered to Mr. Carey, and Mr. Bryant.</p>
               <p>JAMES CAREY sworn. - I am a peace-officer, at Bath; on Saturday the 28th of August, I apprehended the two prisoners at Bath; Bryant asked them both, whether they had any horses in Bath, Snowden said, they had two horses at the old Bridge; I went with a Magistrate to the Greyhound, at the Old Bridge, where we found two horses; I then found an advertisement in the paper, describing the cart-horse, I delivered that to Thacker.</p>

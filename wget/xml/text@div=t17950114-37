               <p>Q.What time did you send him? - Five o'clock is my time for shutting up and sealing my bags.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you send by him? - I believe that night, there were only two bags, but on particular nights we send three, one a paid bag in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the bags sealed? - It is a rule I always make, and also it is by an order of the office, to seal the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Fix your attention to any one of the bags, and describe that first? - The first is the inland bag unpaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what it contains? - That is the quantity of letters that are put into my box free, the same as it is in the General Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that sealed or unsealed? - Yes, that is sealed. Then there is another bag with paid letters, and another bag with news papers, that are all entirely put in the first bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these bags put in any thing else? - In a sack; and I take another bag from the Armitage, and another from Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your business to call at the Armitage and Tower-hill? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was he dispatched that evening? - I think at about a quarter to six a person came to inform me that my boy was stopped in Nightingale-lane, I immediately went up with the man to the last examined person, Mr. Butcher's house. When I came there I was told he was gone to the office; I immediately proceeded to the office in Shadwell; when I came to Shadwell the magistrate examined the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bags there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got them here? - I have; here they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you present at the sealing them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they sealed? - At the justice's office, before the Solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have they been since? - They have been locked up at my house, and the money that was in the bag, the money for the paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the same exact state and condition as when you see them at the office? - Yes, only that the solicitor told me to separate the money, the two shillings and sixpence from the ten-pence, which I did when I got home, I could not get a bit of sealing wax to do it at the justice's, but I did it as soon as ever I came home, and marked the separate parcels of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the bags you seat out that night? - I can swear to the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. And you marked the separate parcels of money as soon as you came home? - Immediately so.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce those that you sent.(Produces them) You are satisfied that all are the same? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money sealed up as when you sealed it? - It is positively so. My money, my boy says, it is two shillings and sixpence, but I think it is two shillings and ten-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Open it. - It is as the boy said, two shillings and sixpence; one shilling two sixpences, and sixpennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you put in the bag that night? - Two shillings and sixpence, that answered to the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the sum in the bill and the bag the same as it was? - The sum is the same, I declare on my oath; I sealed it up myself, and I open it now here for the first time.</p>
               <p>Q.What money did the Armitage bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140070"></xptr>contain? - Sanders's bag contained only tenpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You cannot tell what was in the Armitage bag? - I can tell so far as this, that the bag was opened before me at the justice's office, and the money delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these bags delivered to you from the post office? - They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 12th of December, I left my work a little after four o'clock, and I was going down to East Smithfield to see a brother-in-law that was at sea, in my way at the corner of Sun-yard, I was laid hold of by a press gang, and running away I ran over this lad, and there was a cry of stop thief, and I stopped just as I came to the boy, and they gave me in charge, and the constable and boy took me back to the place where he fell, and the bags were found; from thence I was taken to the public house back parlour, and from thence to the magistrate's, the magistrate sent the officer to search my habitation, and they found nothing at all amiss there. I have witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character, said he was a <rs id="t17950114-37-deflabel224" type="occupation">watch finisher</rs>

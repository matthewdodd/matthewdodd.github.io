On the 5th of May I found a bushel of black oats tied up in a sack, hid under a barn of mine. I wrote my name upon a piece of paper, and Mr. Hodge divided the paper into three pieces; I put it in the bag. The next morning I found the corn gone from the place where I had seen it. I then looked upon a cart loaded with hay; I saw it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assist in loading this cart - A. No; the hay-binder generally loads the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Who had the care of your corn - A. The corn was generally given to him once a week; six bushels on a Monday morning; but suspecting the corn was misapplied I gave out two bushels. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020015"></xptr>Monday morning, preceeding this, and one on the Wednesday morning; and it was on Wednesday I found this under the barn; and on Thursday morning it was upon the cart, underneath the bottle truss of hay; it was the same sack, with the same quantity of corn. Our carman are not allowed to take any corn to town; they are allowed a bottle truss of hay, and no corn to take away with them. The cart set off to London under the carter's care alone. I followed him on foot at some distance, until I met Bishop, the officer, near the Bird-cage. I then returned. I value the bushel of oats at five shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner in Kingsland-road, towards Stamford-hill. The team was going to London; the prisoner was driving it alone. I followed the prisoner until he came to the Bird-cage, Stamford-hill, and there he stopped. The ostler came out; they had a little conversation together; one of the Newington coachmen came by, and spoke to the ostler. The prisoner went into the public-house with the ostler. I then went into the public-house and took the prisoner into custody. I examined the cart in the presence of the prisoner; at the top of the load of hay covered over with the bottle of hay and a tilt, was this corn in this sack; I asked the prisoner how it came there; he said he put it there; he had brought it for his horses, his master knew nothing about it. On searching the corn, I found Mr. Holbrook's name on three pieces of paper; putting the pieces of paper together it was visible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

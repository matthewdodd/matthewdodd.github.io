                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Whitechapal-road. The prisoner was my shopman—he came to my house as a single man—on the 19th of September, at half-past three o'clock, I charged him with being married, and demanded to look into his box—I there found these two pairs of gloves, and two pairs of stockings—the silk was found at his wife's lodgings—he gave the address, and I went there with the officer—these things are mine, to the best of my knowledge—I have matched them with the stock I have.</p>

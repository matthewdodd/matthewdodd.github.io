On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, about eleven o'clock, I was going from my shop into the parlour, and as I entered the parlour I heard the shop window broken with violence - the shutters were not shut. I ran out, missed property, and went in pursuit. I ran up a passage three doors from my house, leading to the tap of a wine vaults, and saw a man running. Two or three women who were in the passage said he had thrown the property down - I looked and found nothing. I returned to the shop, and missed two gold chains, two gold seals, a gold key, a lady's watch, and two steel reticule clasps - the whole are worth 25 l. Mr. Watson, who was in my parlour, found the watch - it is an engine-turned one (looking at one) - this is it - it was in the window.</p>

The prisoner was brought back by an officer, with his hand cut and bleeding. I asked how it got cut - he said it was not, and drew it aside. I looked at it, and said it was cut.</p>

On the 10th of April, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock, I was in my room - heard a noise in the passage, and opened the door - the prisoner ran up stairs, and the constable after him. I picked up two clasps by the street door. His left hand was bloody.</p>

            . I live in Barbican. On the 10th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I was crossing from Redcross-street, and saw one man at one corner of Mr. Tyas's window, and the other at the other corner, nearer to the door. The one at the corner near a cheesemonger's shop broke the window, and in a minute or two he ran away. I saw something glitter in his hand, and tried to stop him; he gave me a blow, and ran down the passage, and I after him, and called to a person at the end of the passage to stop him - he turned round, gave me another blow, and shut the door at the end of the passage - I forced it open, and when I got near to him I saw him throw a clasp down - he went into one of the houses; I could not tell which - Howard's door was open. The officer went in, and found him there; it was the prisoner; I saw his hand bleeding; he is the man I saw at the shop. I saw his face when he struck me.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday night, the 10th of April, I heard Mr. Tyas's window break, and saw the prisoner running - he ran up a passage by the Redcross-tap, and I after him; I took him in three or four minutes, in the passage of Howard's house. I am sure he is the man whom I saw running. I had ran round Denmark-court to stop him. Howard gave me two clasps.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My brother took my shoes to be mended; I had not got the shoemaker's right address. I was returning from work, and was directed to Johnson, a shoemaker, and was told it was on the first floor - as I came down I saw the officer knocking at the opposite door; he came over, and took me; he was called back, and these things given into his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier and glover in Burlington Ar<lb></lb>cade—I saw the prisoner at the shop for the first time on Thursday, the 4th of February—he was there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I have no doubt he was the person—he asked for a pair of small woollen gloves; I showed him some; he selected one pair, and paid me for it—he then asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; he said he wanted one for his brother—I showed him some; they did not suit him—I then asked the sort he would like—my boy came in, and I sent him to a neighbour's shop to get one—he brought one; the prisoner paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and shortly after left the shop—in two minutes I began to re-fold my handker<lb></lb>chiefs, and missed one piece, containing seven handkerchiefs, which I had shown him, and after that two more—no one else was in the shop—I am certain he is the person—he came again on the 13th I think, with another person—he first asked to look at some woollen gloves for himself—I showed him a great variety—he selected one pair, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a sovereign; I returned him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs—I took two or three pieces from the top of a pile in the window, and said, "I believe I sold you a handkerchief some</p>

               <p>days ago?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "Perhaps you will pay me for the nine you stole that day?"—he affected surprise—I do not know what observation he made; but, before I could look round, he and the other man both ran away—in the course of five minutes he was brought back by one of the officers of the Arcade.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 155). On 27th August, I was on duty in Russell-court, Drury-lane, a few minutes before 2 o'clock, and saw three persons pass me; I could not say whether the prisoner was one of them—a few minutes after they had passed me I followed them up and saw one of them, a little taller than the prisoner, stop behind; the other two walked straight on up Russell-court—I came back again and got into a doorway; presently the three came back; I then saw that the prisoner was one of them—a few minutes afterwards I heard a rush and crowding noise as if some body was either shutting or opening a door; I went up to the corner and saw the prisoner half in at the fan-light of the Royal Standard public-house, 57, Drury-lane—the fan-light is over the door, and he was half in and half out of it; he was lifted up by the other two—I rushed up and attempted to collar one of them, but he stooped down and got away from me, and I secured the prisoner—I asked what he was going to do there—he said he was going to do nothing; he was merely putting in another boy—I tried the fan-light and found it was open—I left the house in charge of a person while I took the prisoner to the station, and when I came back I called the barman up—I had tried that fen-light with my staff about ten minutes before this occurred, and it was then quite safe; it felt very light, bat there was no fastening to it—I could not shove it open with my staff, it is suspended by a central swivel—it would require force to open it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Royal Standard public-house, Drury-Lane, kept by Henry Roberts—on the morning of 27th August, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I heard the bell ring very violently—I got up, came down, and found the policeman at the door—I found the fan-light open; it must have been pushed open from the outside—I had seen it secured at half-past 12 that night.</p>

On the 26th of April six men came to play at skittles in my yard; I believe the prisoners were three of them, but I will not swear to them - I had two chests of carpenter's tools in my ground; they stood one on the other, and the top one was locked - in the course of the afternoon there was a complaint that the tool-chest had been broken open, and I went and found it so; the men whom I had seen at the skittle-ground had an adze and some other coopers' tools.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Brown's service as charwoman on the 26th of April. I recollect some men coming to the house, and going to the skittle-ground; all the prisoners were among them - they called for a pot of porter, and played at skittles; there was a door shut, but I do not know by whom - I had never seen it shut before; I have heard it is more handy for throwing the skittleball when it was open; two of the men went away about half-past twelve o'clock, but neither of the prisoners - it was not till after they were all gone that I heard of the chest being broken open; no other person had an opportunity of doing it but those I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I suppose your master has a tolerable good custom? A. Not so many; I was the only servant - I carried the porter to them; I had not seen the prisoners before, but I am sure they were there; I am confident no other persons came there while they were at play; I believe it rained, and the wind was rather high - I missed the saws not more than two minutes after they were all gone; I had seen them safe three days before; I do not know who had been there in that interval.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BROWN. I had seen the chests safe at nine o'clock in the morning, and no other person had been there till these men came to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were the chests to the door? A.Close to it: and they threw the skittle-ball past the door; I have had some conversation with Holdway; I did not tell him to say that he saw the prisoners open the chest - I said, if he did not tell the same story as he did before the Magistrate, I should consider him as bad as them; I did not say, I would get a fresh indictment, and charge him in it - he did not ask me what he was to say, nor did I reply, "All you have to say is, that you saw them break the chest."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had he said before, that he saw them break the chest? A. He certainly had.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOLDWAY. I have known the three prisoners two or three seasons at the West India-docks; Stone applied to me to have a game at skittles; I saw the other prisoners in the ground; there were five persons there beside myself; I was stooping down, and on turning I saw Stone striking at the chest with a chequered adze - I saw an old hinge between the lid and the chest, which caused an opening, through which any one could introduce their hand; I said, "Come, come, let's have no larking here, leave other people's things alone;" we played one game more, and another pot of beer was brought, which we drank nearly out; Simkin, who was there, then said, "I am going," and I went with him - we went away, leaving the three prisoners and another man there.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH ALLEN (Police-constable K 62). On the 27th of April I went to the West India-docks, and took Atkinson and Stone; I afterwards took Kett, at his father's, in the Willow-walk; they all admitted they had been at the skittle-ground, but said they knew nothing of the articles.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 31st of October - the prosecutor was with me; I told him he had better make him some recompence, and give him part of his money back - he said he knew nothing about it, but in going along he said he took one half-sovereign, which was loose, wrapped it in a bit of paper, and gave it him back.</p>

            . I keep the Coach and Horses. In the latter end of July, the prosecutor came to my house with a person - he was fresh, and he was pulling out his money; I advised him to leave it with me - the person with him said he was a friend and a relation, and he would see him safe home; he put the money in his pocket, and then left the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Instead of meeting him at the wooden bridge, I met him in York-street, with a pensioner - we went to a public-house; he was accusing the pensioner of robbing him of a sovereign, but on searching his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010064"></xptr>pocket, he found a hole in the bottom, and there was one half-sovereign in the bottom of his trousers, which I gave him - he said, "Never mind, I know where the sovereign is, but I will go and pay something at the Coach and Horses," which he did; when we came out there were some girls of the town - we had some drink with them; we then went to the Cock, sat a long time, and I bade him good night.</p>

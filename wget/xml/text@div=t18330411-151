On the evening of the 2nd of March the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some bonnet ribbons; I placed two drawers of ribbons before her - she bought two yards and a half, which came to 3s. 6 1/2d.; she gave me 3s. 6d. - while serving her I observed her take a piece out and place it on the counter, and her handkerchief over it; when she went out my master followed her, and I followed her at the same time - when she was returning with Mr. Evans I saw the ribbon drop from under her cloak, between the shop and the street; Mr. Evans desired her to pick it up and bring it in, which she did - it was about four yards from where I served her, and a door was be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110080"></xptr>tween us; she had gone out as far as the end of the window - she had a cloak on; she had no bundle - she could not have swept it off with her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.This might have been a mistake? A. No, Sir; I had served her before - the value of what she stole is about 1l. or 25s.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EVANS. I keep this shop. In consequence of what the last witness said I followed the prisoner out; she had got four or five yards from the door, and was just turning round the corner into Grafton-street - I saw the ribbon drop as she was returning into the shop, in the door-way; she said she did not know that she had it - I lieve it must have been dropped from her pocket handkerchief; the ribbon she had bought was in paper, in her hand - her cloak had a large open sleeve; I am sure it fell from under her cloak; I desired the officer to take it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MOORE (Police-constable E 16). I received charge of the prisoner - I produce the ribbon, which I received from Mr. Evans.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the shopman had been joking with her while serving her, and that he must have rolled the ribbon up with what she purchased by mistake - that the paper had unfolded when the prosecutor had accosted her, and the ribbon must have fallen out.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Wise, the deputy clerk of the peace, at Maidstone; I was present at Maidstone last July, and know the prisoner is the person who was tried there.</p>

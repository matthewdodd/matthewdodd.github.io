                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I cannot speak English; I am in the employ of Jean Marie Leonidas Caillard, a tanner and leather dresser, of Marsh Gate Lane, Stratford; I live in a small house in the tan yard, belonging to my employer. On Wednesday evening, 13th May, about half past 10 o'clock, I heard a noise on the roof—I went out and saw two men on the roof, they had made an opening and taken away some lead—I left them there, and went and came back with a policeman—as I was running with the policeman, we met a man, and the policeman took his lantern, and put it on his face—we then proceeded and met the prisoners carrying some lead on their shoulders, I am sure of them—they turned round my cottage, and when they saw us, they threw away the lead, and one of them jumped into the water, and the policeman took him; the other cut his sticks along the houses, and two policemen went round and took him—I am certain of these two men.</p>

The last witness came to me about half past 10 o'clock, and I went with him to the tan yard—I met Grant, and turned my light on him, and he went past me; I saw that he had nothing—I ran to a brother constable a little in advance, and spoke to him—I went to the rear of the premises, and saw M'Quade and another man, each with some lead on their shoulders—I pursued one, and M'Quade went about twenty yards and jumped into the river, a branch of the Lea—I ran round to the other side and snapped at him, but he threw himself back into the river again; another witness went to the other side, and at last he asked to be helped out—I helped him out and took him—the other man escaped—my brother constable picked up the lead—I afterwards went to the house, matched the lead with the roof, and found that it corresponded.</p>

On Friday evening, 15th May, about half past 11 o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to No. 7, Cottage Gate, Marsh Lane, Stratford, with Lambert—Grant lives there; he put his head out of the window, and I requested him to come down and open the door—he came down, and I asked him where he was on Wednes<lb></lb>day night, about half past 10 o'clock, he said that he was in bed by half past 9 o'clock—I asked him if he was not in company with M'Quade and Ward; he said that he did not see them, but afterwards said that he was in their company at Bow at half past 8 o'clock—I asked Lambert if Grant was the man he had seen throw down some lead and run away—he said that he was—I then asked him if he was certain; he said, "I am quite sure of it, because I turned my light on him, and he ran past me"—Grant replied, "Yes, you turned your light on me, and I was there, but I know nothing about the lead."</p>

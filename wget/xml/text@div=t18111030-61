On the 25th of December the prisoner and five or six more were drinking in the house, a man came in between three and four o'clock and asked me if I had lost any thing, I looked, and missed some plates and dishes out of the kitchen: I went out and found the prisoner standing at the window of the White Lion public-house, he had something in a coal sack, I told him I thought they were my dishes; I asked him to go back, he immediately returned with me. Mr. Willans (the constable) examined the sack, they were plates and dishes, I had some of the same kind. The prisoner said he did not know how he came by them, he believed he got them at our house.</p>

The Prisoner Stuart was in the Booth, and asked me to come in and drink; telling me there was as good Liquor, as any in the Fair. So I went in, and called for a Pint of Beer, but they brought a Decanter of Cyder, which came to 5 d. and I had but a Groat in my Pocket; However, the Drawer said he would trust me t'other Penny. She drank the first Glass, and while I was drinking another, she took the Watch out of my Pocket, and I felt it go + ; at the same Time. As soon as she had got it, she ran out of the Booth, at the Back-door. I pursu'd her to the Door, but found it fast, and was going to break it open, but the Drawer came to me, and asked me what I meant by making a Riot in the Booth, and who I brought in, to make the Riot? I was afraid of going out, for Fear of being murder'd; so there being a Bed in that Part of the Booth, I lay down, and nobody came near me for some Time. At last she came to me again, and said, My Dear, what makes you so melancholy? I hope you'll give me something to drink. And I, with that vulgar Word, call'd her Bitch of Hell, and said, she was the Woman that robb'd me. She told me I was drunk; when I was as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030037"></xptr> sober as I am now. I took hold of her Arm, and said, I would take Care of her, and told the People in the Booth, that she had robb'd me; but they only laughed at me, and made Game of me. There were a dozen People (in all) in the Booth, and I complained to them; but the Drawer got between me and the Door, and rioted me. At last some Men coming by, I told them I was robb'd, so they assisted me, and she was seized, and carry'd that Evening to Holborn Round-house , and the next Morning before a Justice, where she deny'd the Fact, and said, she never saw me, nor knew any Thing of me.</p>
               <p>+ The Prisoner had been indicted capitally for privately Stealing, but the Fact appearing otherwise they were then acquitted, and this Indictment for Larceny directed.</p>

             . On the 18th of August, between 9 and 10 at Night, I was coming through the Fair with two of my Friends, and I saw Simmons have hold of the Prisoner, on the Outside of the Booth, crying out, Help me, I am robb'd. I asked him what he was robb'd of? He said he was robb'd of his Watch by the Prisoner, Yorkshire Hannah , and if you'll help me, I will pay you for your Trouble. Upon this we took her into the Booth, and kept her in Custody while we sent for an Officer. When we had sat about a Quarter of an Hour, Lawrence , the next Witness, said, she had given something to Shilcock. Shilcock ran through the Booth into the Back-place, where the Bed was; I ran after him, and saw him toss something out of his Hand toward the Bed. I suspected it was the Watch, and desired to speak to the Man who belonged to the Booth; but another Man came up to me, and endeavoured to pull me out of the Place. I told them, if they opposed me, I would send them all to Newgate; so at last the Master and Mistress came, and they deny'd that they knew the Woman. I bid them get me a Candle, and as soon as it came I searched, and found the Watch at the Feet of the Bed, and put it into my Pocket; but I would not let Simmons see it, till he told all the Marks of it before the Constable. As we were all coming out of the Booth we saw Shilcock , and seized him, (but I really believe he was so drunk, he did not know what he did) then we got a Light to go with us to London. Shilcock was the Fidler of the Booth; I believe he was so drunk, he did not know (what) one Hand (did) from the other, and I believe he would not have done such a Thing, if he had been sober. The Prosecutor described the Watch in a very exact Manner, before I shewed it him, and then he owned it.</p>

             . Shilcock was my Master's Fidler; he gave him Half-a-Crown a-Day to play there; and I was also a Servant in the Booth. The Prosecutor came in with the Woman, and call'd for a Pint of Cyder, but he had not Money enough to pay for it. Presently he came out, and said he had lost his Watch: the Woman asked him if she took it? He said, no; and so she went away. But when she came again, he went to the Door, and said she was the Person: and several Men coming up, they insisted on keeping her till the Man got his Watch again. The Fidler was eating his Supper at the same Time: I brought him the Bread and Cheese, and drew him a Pint of Beer. The Fidler was not near them at that Time.</p>
               <p>Shilcock. Ask the Prosecutor if he saw me near him?</p>

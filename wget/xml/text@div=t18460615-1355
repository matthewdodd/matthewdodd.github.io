Previous to May, 1844, I had no knowledge of the existence of the prisoner, or of any sister of hers—in May, 1844, I re<lb></lb>ceived this letter—before that I had received a note, which I destroyed—it was to the effect that a report prejudicial to myself existed in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood, and if I would call upon the prisoner she would explain it to me—I simply replied, declining to call, and requesting she would state it in writing—I did not keep a copy of my letter.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After that letter I waited on the prisoner, and found she was the person who had written the letter; I had some conversation with her, and she referred to Miss Richardson upon the subject—the conversation was to the effect that Miss Richardson had named me to a Mr. Jay, of Brompton-square, as being in the constant habit of calling at the prisoner's house, and that she had discovered that through a maid-servant—I went away—I said, I was so persuaded that Miss Richardson never uttered a word against me, or anybody else, that I would not annoy her, but a friend who was with me insisted on going on—after that time I noticed that the two young women were part of my congregation—in consequence of something that took place then, it was decided that they should not be admitted into their pew—it was after communicating with the Archdeacon, that I pursued that course—I received this letter in due course—I think it was on the 22nd of October, 1845—it is dated the 21st, and is in the prfisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Rev. Sir, I expected to have heard from you before this, through Mr. Combe, which would have prevented the unpleasant duty which, in jus<lb></lb>tice to myself and sister, I have now to perform—to enter into any particulars respecting the past would be absurd, as you are much better acquainted with the circumstances connected with our disgrace than we can possibly be; and likewise how it first originated, and who first uttered the slander, it is only left for me to tell its effects; it has robbed us of friends, connection, and pro<lb></lb>perty in various forms; and now that our funds are exhausted, I apply to you, as the injurer, to know what course in justice you ought to pursue to<lb></lb>wards us, after the unfeeling manner in whith we have been treated for some years past, and the serious injury we have received; I am quite unconsciow of ever having, by word or deed, injured you; but I must now make oar distress known, and as a vexatious law-suit would be as unpleasant for us as for you, I shall adopt a course more sure and less inconvenient, as witnesses as well as lawyers can be tampered with, and nobody cares to serve the friend<lb></lb>less orphans; I shall advertise our case as it stands, with our names, as we have no family to disgrace, and we cannot be more uncomfortably situated than we are at present; and unless I hear from you directly, I shall carry my plan out immediately by advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Times, Morning Chronide</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>; and I have no doubt but we shall meet with friends who will place us above want, as I have trusted always in that Friend who has pro<lb></lb>mised to be a father to the fatherless; and when forsaken by the world around, he will defend our cause against our persecutors, and make the inno<lb></lb>cence of my sister as clear as noon-day.

Miss F. would be obliged if Mr. Niven would say one way or he other whether be will make an amicable arrangement, or whether he will not, as Miss F. will not feel any sorrow for exposing the case; but if Mr. N. has not read the letters, as he has not answered, Miss F. would reflect upon herself, at it has always been the study of Mist F. and sister to oblige Mr. N. in any way they possibly could; but if, after applying to him so often, he still refutes to answer their applications, Miss F. must seek other means, as she has been compelled to borrow money to bring them back to town, from persons she never intended to speak to again, and has promised to return it next week. Miss F. has now sufficient to last her till next Wednesday, and must then turn out into the street, as she will no longer have a house to cover her, and her unfortunate sister, who has been the innocent cause. Miss F. gives Mr. N. till Saturday one o'clock, to answer one way or the other, as Miss F. is sorry to inform Mr. N. that she believes her sister's crime is being poor.

               <p>"Rev. Sir,—I now apply to you for the sixth time, earnestly entreating you to answer this; to enter more particularly into past circumstances would be useless, I only wish I could altogether forget them. I intended to have been at your church on Sunday morning, but my sister was too ill to come to the service, so we went down after you had left; my present object in writing to you is to appeal to you as a Christian: can you possibly see us starve, and you give us neither advice, comfort or pecuniary relief?—it is the very last thing I would do if I was not obliged. I made some sacrifices to leave Brighton and return to town, as my sister has been suffering for some time with a very severe pain in her back; and I have written to Mr. Bowling, of Hammersmith, whom I expect to see to-day, but will not mention our unfor<lb></lb>tunate circumstances, as I would rather hear from you. I ask you now, will you lend me some pecuniary aid, and advise me what course I had better adopt for the time to come? I suppose it useless for me to ask for a seat in your church, as of course you would refuse, and also I do not wish to be seen in that neighbourhood, situated worse than heretofore. If you would see me I should be much obliged; I would meet you anywhere, and explain anything we may have done to offend you, as perhaps your mind has been prejudiced against us, and 1 know we have no friends.

               <p>"Sir,—I apply to you again that you may have no excuse to make in not know<lb></lb>ing our exact position; were now here, having had a pawnbroker, who has given us 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon our watches and wearing apparel, which has paid all we owed in Down-street, and one guinea here last Wednesday week; being obliged to pay two rents, we are now in debt for board, firing, and lodging one week yester<lb></lb>day, without any property in the house, and without a change of clean linen. We are strangers I find here for the present. I write this principally to inform you, that if you do not make us compensation, I will leave what to yourself, I must write to Archdeacon Sinclair, to lay the matter before the Bishop of Lon<lb></lb>don, as I am well provided with witnesses, and shall give the whole history of myself and sister during the last five years; and that to-morrow, Friday, Jan. 23rd, at one o'clock, I shall carry a letter to the residence of the Archdeacon, if I do not hear before that hour from you, offering to make some amicable arrangement, and that also some terms settled before Saturday, one o'clock, be offered to me for approval, as we cannot wait any longer, as we are driven to this by distress. I would much rather make terms of peace with you, as I do not write from any vindictive motive, and would agree to any terms to keep us from absolute want, as we have always studied your interest in preference to our own, as our present circumstances testify, but we cannot remain as we are any longer. My sister is much better than she has been, but is now a living skeleton, not being able to obtain that which would make her better, and is with myself exceedingly anxious not to do you any injury; but necessity has no law, and we cannot continue longer, it is impossible. I shall prepare my letter to Archdeacon Sinclair this evening, (not really expect<lb></lb>ing an answer from you,) as this is the eleventh letter, and three months since the first; and as sure as I expect protection from an all-seeing God, I shall carry it myself if I am spared till to-morrow, one o'clock. I wish you distinctly to understand it is from poverty unexampled, and from no other motive. You are aware, I suppose, of the charges. I shall tell the truth, the whole truth, and you can prepare your defence. Yours, respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARIA FOUNTAINE</hi>. Jan. 22; 12, Lower Phillimore-place, Kennington. P.S.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After that letter this one was sent to me by the Bishop of London—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)</p>
               <p>" My Lord,—I appeal to your lordship on behalf of myself aid sister, who have been brought to the greatest distress, in consequence of my sister having been slandered by the lady of the Rev. W. Niven, incumbent of St. Saviour's, Upper Chelsea, in whose church myself and sister have occupied sittings since Christmas, 1840; and, during that period, we resided at Brompton, and were, by profession, morning governesses. Mrs. Niven stated to various persons that my sister was enceinte by the Rev. W. Niven, and employed persons to watch the house we resided in; and, if we walked in the streets, set persons (chiefly her own relations) to follow us, and insult us; in fact, so much so, that we had been unable to leave our own apartment, except in a carriage, for more than a twelvemonth before we left Brompton, which we did last October. Last June my sister applied to an attorney we had known for some years, to commence an action against Mr. Niven, which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150123"></xptr>
               <p>did, and after keeping us in expectation of obtaining some satisfaction for several months, refused to proceed; in fact, I have no hesitation in saying, Mr. Niven bribed the lawyer, to prevent any proceeding. I have since written a great many letters to Mr. Niven, and appealed to him as a Christian minister to compensate us, as we are friendless orphans, but can get no answer. My sister's medical attendant, Mr. Bowling, of Hammersmith, has also written to him, and received an answer from Mr. Niven's solicitor, which, with other letters, I wish to lay before your lordship. We are now residing at Kensington, and I wrote last Friday week to Archdeacon Sinclair; but, receiving no answer, I wrote again on Monday last, but have not received an answer. My object in writing to Archdeacon Sinclair was, for him to lay the matter before your lordship; but, as I cannot get an answer, I suppose it is in consequence of Mr. Niven being acquainted with Archdeacon Sin<lb></lb>clair. We are suffering the greatest privations. Our clothes have been sent to the pawnbrokers; we are in debt, without any means of paying, and must be turned into the street, for we have no home—no friends who will even give us a night's lodging; and, unless we can obtain compensation from Mr. Niven for the injury Mrs. Niven has done us, there is nothing left us but a poor-house, as our characters have been destroyed, our connections lost, so that we could not earn anything unless our characters are restored, and some pecuniary relief afforded us. I beg leave to apologize for troubling your lordship, but I do it in hopes your lordship can compel Mr. Niven, who is wealthy, to compensate us, and that immediately, for the serious injuries we have sustained. We are fully prepared to prove the statement, and have no objection to appear before your lordship, with evidence, and that in Mr. Niven's presence; and, I can assure your lordship, that the circumstances are understated, both as regards slander; annoyance, and our present poverty. My sister has been seriously ill, and property we have had left us; has been spent in endeavouring to regain our professions, and also our characters, but without success, as the slander has been most industriously propagated.

               <p>" Dear Sir,—I again appeal to you, as I wish to know on what grounds we are situated to each other; if I had a friend who would speak to you upon this subject, or one whom I could trust, I would not out step the bounds of prudence, as I am about to do. I ask you calmly and dispassionately what were your intentions towards my sister five years ago, and <hi rend="italic">what are they now.</hi> I have always believed you were greatly attached to my sister, and your unfortunate position has been always looked upon by us as a great calamity, and one which we hoped would soon terminate; and 1 supposed, when it did terminate, you intended to marry my sister, who is sincerely attached to you, as you must be aware of; in fact, she has always stated to me, that from the first she would remain single for life unless she married you, and, I believe, such is her present determination, and from that cause we are reduced to our present painful situation—as I have encouraged that idea; if we have been deceived in our opinions, and you have no affection for my sister, perhaps you would have the kindness to make us acquainted with the fact as early as possible, as our present circumstances can then be exposed, or perhaps you would, through some kind friend of yours, afford some little pecuniary assistance, to save us from utter destruction; and, if you have intentions towards my sister, you will prevent any exposure of our pre<lb></lb>sent</p>

               <p>position, for your own sake as well as ours. Our present distress is more than you can think, or possibly be aware of; and oh! for the sake of two friendless beings, do something for us. We are willing to act under your advice, be it what it may. We have been here a fortnight. I took the apart<lb></lb>ments for one month, hoping and trusting that something would be done to relieve our present wretchedness in that time, and we are getting credit with the trades people of this neighbourhood, for we are not found anything here, and we have no money, no clothes, not a change of linen, and the enclosed notice was served here yesterday, though how we were found I do not know; and oh, for mercy's sake, do not let our little all be sacrificed for the sura named, although our clothes ami work-box and writing-desk, &amp;c., will not make the sum to sell; they are worth much more to us, and I sent for some clothes from the Pantechnicon about five weeks ago, and I paid her part with what I obtained upon them. In fact, our clothes are pawned for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our books are at the Pantechnicon, where I cannot obtain them unless I pay two guineas, as they have been there near six months, and the remaining part are at Kensington, all dirty; and nothing but linen, and not another dresi besides the one we wear, and we cannot make ourselves decent any longer in this house. Apply to some person we must; but I hope you will not be so cruel as utterly to abandon us to such a fate, as we are willing; in fact, we have lost everything we possess, including our peace of mind for life, in serving you as we thought; and I am sure, both myself and sister, would make any sacrifice for you, but do in pity to our distress send me you advice, and whether you have any affection for my sister; and, if so, do not let us be disgraced for life in this way, and we would make you any promises, not to molest you in any way; and whatever course you wish us to adopt, it shall be done, as we have nobody to apply to but yourself, under whose ministry we have been so long, and under whom we have profited so much. I implore an answer, or, if not to me, perhaps Mr. Combe would do something in it; but I would rather receive advice from you, and, whatever you advise, shall be done.

About the 18th of March, after the date of the two last letters, the two young ladies called at my house—I requested them to leave—they declined—in consequence of that I took them before a Magistrate—they were held to bail for assaulting me, having previously at<lb></lb>tempted to assault my solicitor with a poker—I was not present; I only know it on his word—they came and claimed some compensation from me—I suppose it was to make me give them some money on the spot—the prisoner made a rush at my dining-room door, to push herself in; and since they have been held to bail they have molested me in the most extraordinary manner—I have bad nothing but annoyance from them ever since—I have received a writ from them since, and they have sent solicitor after solicitor, but they have not come or written to me at all, in any way, or personally annoyed me from that hour—there have been two writs served, one in December last, and the other was served upon my soli<lb></lb>citor for me; I cannot speak positively, but think it was about a week before I gave the prisoner into custody—I know that it has been served—the first time I knew it was at the police-court that day—I did not proceed upon these letters before, for I assure you, as a Clergyman, it is the greatest trial I ever met with to proceed against any human being—I have known Miss Richard<lb></lb>son, I think, between nine and ten years, as near as I can recollect—I do not think she ever was one of my congregation—my wife did not know her before she was married to me, nor subsequently, until I introduced her one day in the street, soon after the first letter was written—that was the only time they spoke, till they met in the police-office—I have not heard, since I received these letters, of there being any other reports from any other party—I did not offer, about six months ago, to abandon all proceedings if Miss Fountains would deny all the reports in circulation—I never instructed my sotaeitor to that effect—nor was such offer ever made to me if Mrs. Niven would give a denial to the reports—there was never any offer made me—an action was commenced in Dec., and abandoned, and another commenced a short time before the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

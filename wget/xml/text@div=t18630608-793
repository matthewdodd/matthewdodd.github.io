                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, living at 10, Conduit-street, Long Acre—on Sunday morning, 17th May, about 2 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Ald<lb></lb>gate—she spoke to me, and we went into the Chequer-yard, in Aldgate—she put her hand into my pocket—I did not feel her hand go in, but I felt it coming out—I had three halfcrowns, two florins, and some small change in my pocket—I directly put my hand to her breast, and 9he ran away—I ran after her, and she was stopped by a policeman—nothing was found on her then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 559). A little before 2 on Sunday, 17th May, I saw the prisoner run out of the Chequer-yard, which is not a thoroughfare—I ran after her, and caught hold of her—I said, "What are you running for?"—she said, "What's that to you"—I saw her put her hand underneath the cape that she wears—she said, "I am d—d if I go if you don't let go of my hands"—the prosecutor then came up and said, "That woman has robbed me"—I said, "Of what?"—he said, "Three half-crowns, two florins, and some small change; I can't exactly say what"—with the assistance of another constable I took her to the station—she was searched by the female searcher in a private room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to tell me whether she dropped any money during the time you were after her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think she did; I never lost sight of her from the time she came out of the yard till I caught her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Chambers, and am female Marcher at Seething-lane Station—I remember searching the prisoner on this morning—we were alone—I stripped her; all her garments were off—I found that the money was in her person, and I wished her to give it me, or I should send for a surgeon—she said at first she would not—I called the sergeant to send for a surgeon, and during that time she said she would give me the money if I would not say anything about it, as she should get four years if she came here—she then moved, and the money fell on the floor—I picked it up; there are two halfcrowns, two florins, two shillings, and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>:—"Last Thursday, about half-past 1, I met a young man named George Evans, who had got discharged from the militia, and all he had got coming to him was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave to me on the Saturday night—I paid Mrs. Hester, of 7, Lambeth-street, a halfcrown, and she saw the money in my hand; and the money I had on me was the change I had in my possession when I was taken."</p>

            . Early in the morning on the 31st of March, my servant came up to me, and informed me my house was robbed; I got up immediately and came down; that was between five and six o'clock; I found the window shutter of the compting house broke open, which is part of my dwelling house, an adjacent room to the parlour; they both join.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go out of the parlour into the compting house?</p>
               <p>Rauston. Yes; the bolt of the shutter was broke and wrenched off; the window was pulled down, and the shutters put easily too; it was nearly shut; the sash was not fastened down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how this window was left over night?</p>
               <p>Rauston. Yes, it was bolted; I examined the compting house just before I went to bed; they could get no farther; they broke open two locks in the compting house desk, and took out a bowl of halfpence, about 3 s. worth; then I presume they proceeded to the parlour; there were two locks there broke open, and 10 l. in cash taken out of the closet, a silver pint mug, a silver watch capped and jewelled; the maker's name Fish, at the Royal Exchange, a silver salt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210037"></xptr> six silver table spoons, two tea spoons, a pepper box, two pair of silver shoe buckles, one pair of silver knee buckles, between 13 and 14 yards of Irish linen, four razors and a case, with horn handles tipped with silver, four yards of long lawn, a canvas bag with a parcel of tickets; I swear to 60, I suppose there were 100; with regard to the copper tickets, the morning after the robbery I was sent to, and informed that Burch had thrown something into a poad in Mrs. Harrison's cow layer, Gray's-inn-lane; I imagined it might be the copper tickets; I got some people to drag the pond this day, and the drag brought out this bag (producing a canvas bag); this was in my desk; I kept them in it.

            . On Saturday the 3d of April the prisoner came to me, and said he was pretty sure he could find Birch, and directed me to Lestall-street, Cold Bath-fields; I went and took him; I searched him and found a watch upon him, and some gold and silver; I showed the watch to the prosecutor, but it was not his; I gave it him again; the next day we heard of a girl that was an acquaintance of his; we went to her lodging and there I found this cloth that has been produced.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of the affair as to the the cloth; I have witness I bought it and paid for it, and my serjeant is here who will prove I was in the Broadway, Westminster, at the time the pawnbroker says I brought the watch.</p>

            . About three weeks ago, or it may be a month, I was coming up by Hatton Wall, the bottom of Hatton Garden, and there I saw Birch and another man; they had bargained for some cloth; Birch had a piece of cloth under his arm; he had bought it of the other man, and was paying for it just as I was coming past; it was in the street the corner of Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man?</p>
               <p>Smith. I do not know; he had bundles of stockings over his shoulders; I saw him give half a guinea and 6 s. 6 d. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sort of cloth it was, did you look at it?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Smith. I cannot say; I went away; I did not stop three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloth wrapped in any thing?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he had it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Then cannot you tell what colour it was?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was a whitish cloth; I did not take particular notice; I then went on. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Birch?</p>
               <p>Smith. I knew his father and all the family of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you see Birch buy this?</p>
               <p>Smith. Between eight and nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I never did, nor since that I know of.</p>

            . I am a serjeant: Birch is a soldier in the first regiment of foot guards; he was on the drill fourteen days for missing guard: it is a light sort of punishment.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was that?</p>
               <p>Read. He was on the drill from ten in the morning till twelve, and then dismissed and sent home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did these fourteen days begin?</p>
               <p>Read. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the drill the 31st of March?</p>
               <p>Read. I cannot be sure of that?</p>
               <p>Q. He has no presence of being on the drill between one and two o'clock?</p>
               <p>Read. No, a quarter after twelve is the outside of the time always. Birch and I was on the drill on Wednesday; I mounted guard on Friday and came away on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Look at the linen once more what is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Read. It cost about 2 s. 9 d. a yard.</p>

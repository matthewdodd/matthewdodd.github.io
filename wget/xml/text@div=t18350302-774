                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Elias Moses, we live in the Minories, and are slop-sellers. I have known the prisoner as a customer—we had dealings with him, and I had no doubt of his respectability till about a month since, when my suspicions were excited by something I had heard—on Monday, the 2nd of March, the prisoner came to our house in a chaise, about six o'clock—it was dark—he went up into the back ware house with me—he came for a waistcoat, which had been ordered on Friday by some person belonging to him—I told him it was ready—he then said, "I want some velveteen coatees"—I waited upon him—there was a boy, named Coleman, in the room, and he handed the coatees to me—the prisoner selected three of them—he then said, "You have some very nice, or very handsome, spring waistcoats, I will look at them, but I shall not be a buyer at the present time"—I showed them to him—he selected some, and they were put with the coatees in a place under the counter—he purchased those waistcoats and the coatees—he then remarked that he would take the goods with him—that was after they had been put into the receiving-place under the counter, and I supposed he had finished—I then placed them on the counter again—he then saw another waistcoat, which he said was a very nice one, and selected that—he then said, "No doubt you have more like them;" and I went to the glass-case at the end of the room to see whether I had—I turned round, and saw the prisoner had left the part where he had been standing, and seemed very much confused—he had his</p>

               <p>hands down about his pockets—I then asked him whether he would walk up stairs to another room—he said, "No"—he went down, and I followed him—the bundle was left on the counter for his man to take down; but he went into another room down stairs to look at some hats—he said, "I want some hats, but I do not expect you have any which will suit me"—I said he had better look at them—from there he went into the front ware-house, and Mr. Fox was desired to fetch down the goods the prisoner had bought—I was agitated by my suspicion—Mr. Fox brought down the goods loose on his shoulder—they were put on the counter, and Fox en<lb></lb>tered them in the book—Fox then came down from the desk—I took his place to have the goods booked; and I took the opportunity of speaking to my clerk in a way that the prisoner should not hear, though he was just under the pulpit-desk—the prisoner appeared very much agitated as well as myself; and he looked at me very hard from the time of my coming down stairs—he then said, "I shall go to Christopher, and you can give the parcel to my lad in the gig at the door"—he then left—I sent Fox after him, who brought him back; and Fox said, "I have found this on Mr. Butcher," at the same time showing me a waistcoat which I had not shown to the prisoner—he said, "Good God!"—I made some remark, and I went into the counting-house with him and Fox—I then made some re<lb></lb>mark on the enormity of the case—I cannot express the words I used, and forget the answer he made—I then said, "Have you any more, Sir?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Will you allow me to feel?"—he said, "Certainly"—I then put my hand into his outside pocket, and drew out a dark waistcoat—those he had selected were light ones—I said, "Good God! Butcher, I never should have thought it"—he then, said, "Oh, Moses, pray do not go into the case," or words to that effect—he begged to see me in private—we went into a side passage adjoining the private house—he then told me he would make every restitution if I would forego, and not do any tiling in this case—he said he would deal with me and pay up if I would not do any thing—I sent for the policeman, who came into the counting-house with me—the prisoner was then in the warehouse; and before I could relate the case to the policeman, I saw a confusion, and it appeared that the prisoner had left the warehouse, and Mr. Fox also—the prisoner was pursued and taken.</p>

               <p>me, and giving me his custom—I did not tell the conversation that my traveller had, as I thought it was of no importance, before the Lord Mayor—I mean the report he brought from Brentford—the prisoner begged to see me privately—I do not know that I stated that before the Lord Mayor—I do not know whether these words were read over to me in my deposi<lb></lb>tion; or that I mentioned that the prisoner said, "Oh Moses, pray do not go into this"—perhaps I did not—I did not think there was any occasion to say that he wished to see me in private, and that we went into the pas<lb></lb>sage—I believe I did not state that I said, "Good God!

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say when Fox returned with Mr. Butcher, he produced a waist<lb></lb>coat, which he said he found on Butcher, and Butcher said, "Good God!" and went into the counting-house—did you say that to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I expect I did—I believe I did—I cannot recollect every word that was read over to me—I expect that was read to me—I think I heard that—the book that these things were entered in is not here, nor are the articles he bought—I was agitated by my suspicion—that would not assist my memory, certainly—I do not know that I told the Magistrate I was agitated by my suspicions—I did not state that I went to the glass case, before the Magistrate—I said I went to the end of the room, which is where the glass case is situated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen any woman upon the subject of this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—yes, yes—will you allow me?—it was the following morning after the robbery—money was not the subject of conversation—not a syllable passed my lips about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not any money mentioned at all—I went into a private room with her, at her request—she is the woman who lives with Mr. Butcher as his wife, though she is not his wife—I retired with her to the same room that Mr. Butcher had been in, on account of her feelings—I have heard since that she is not his wife—nothing passed from me on the subject of money—such a sum as 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not mentioned by me—I am rather surprised you should ask me such a thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to give us your version about the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the back warehouse—one of my young men came in, and said, "Mr. Moses, there is the young man in the gig that was here last night, and a female"—I said, "You had better deny me," and I was going up stairs, but she came in, following the young man, before I could get out of sight—she saw me, and said, "Where is Mr. Moses?"—I said my name was Moses—she then asked for my father—I said he was not at home, he does not live in London—she said, "It is a person with spectacles"—I said, "Then you must mean Moses and Levy, because that Mr. Moses wears spectacles"—she then said, "Oh, Mr. Moses," or to that effect, and took me into the side-room, as she was ashamed to be seen—she then said, "Good God! I have not slept all night; I have been either in hysterics or fits till five o'clock"—she said, "Dear Mr. Moses, pray do not appear against him," and she laid hold of my shoulder—after using many expres<lb></lb>sions, which I cannot recollect, she said, "Can I see Mrs. Moses, to work on her feelings?"—I told her she could not, as she was confined—she beg<lb></lb>ged and prayed in that manner that I could not get away—she said, "Will you not appear? pray do not appear"—she said she would give half she possessed if I would not appear, and she broke a smelling-bottle in her re<lb></lb>ticule <hi rend="italic">with her words and actions</hi>—she then turned out her reticule, and left the glass on the counter, and begged my pardon for doing so—she still begged and prayed of me not to appear—I told her if it had been his first offence I might have overlooked it, but I certainly should go on—she then said, "Where is Butcher?"—I told her I believed he was at the Compter, but I would inquire, for I did not know—she said, "Oh pray do not, for I am ashamed to be seen"—she then said her man would take her there—she then said, "I am ashamed to go through, is there any one there?"—I opened the door, Mr. Solomon was coming through, and I told him to go back—I then told her there was no one there but a boy, and she went out—that was all that passed, except that I said, I would consider of it—there was never any offer to compromise on either part, but she merely making the remark that she would give half she possessed—nothing was said about £100 a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon the sacred obligation of your oath, did any thing pass at any time—at any place—or from any body—in your hearing, about £100 a year for four years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—this is not the first I have heard of it—Mr. Hobler asked me whether I had offered to compromise it for £400—I denied it, and treated it with contempt, as I do the re<lb></lb>marks that you are making—there was no offer to compromise on her part or mine—what passed with her was before the examination before the Magistrate—I do not recollect every word that passed with her—I mean nothing unfair against this prisoner—I heard the woman who called on me was not his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Moses. On the 2nd of March Mr. Butcher came there—I saw him come from the back warehouse—my employer desired me to fetch the goods which he had selected, for the purpose of being entered—I did so, and placed them on the counter in the front warehouse—they were there entered, and in the course of their being entered, Mr. Moses indicated by his countenance that there was something wrong relative to Mr. Butcher, and I noticed the prisoner—he said, "Put up these goods, and give them to my young man, who is about the door in the chaise"—he then went out—I was desired by my employer to follow him, which I did—I came up to him, and said, "Have you not, Sir, by some mistake or other, got into your possession some waistcoats that are not yours?"—he said, "Certainly not, it is impossible, I think, but I will try"—upon which he put his hand iuto his great-coat pocket, and drew out a waistcoat, which I immediately recognised as the property of my employer—I said, "Mr. Butcher, this is a serious thing, and a most unaccountable one to me"—he said, "I did not take it with a felo<lb></lb>nious intent"—I said, "Have you any more, Sir?"—he said, "Certainly not," and felt about his pockets—he said, "To convince you I had no felonious intention, I will go back with you to Mr. Moses"—we then returned together—Mr. Moses opened the warehouse door—the prisoner went in, and said, with considerable agitation, "Sir, I am ashamed to see you"—Mr. Moses was about to make an observation, and he said, "For goodness' sake do not stay here, let us go into the counting-house"—we then went into the counting-house—I presented the waistcoat which the prisoner had given to me when I questioned him—I showed it to Mr. Moses and said, "This waistcoat was produced by Mr. Butcher upon being questioned whether he had not concealed some about him"—Mr. Moses expressed himself very much surprised, and said, "Good God! Butcher, how is this? have you any more, Sir?"—he replied, "Certainly not"—the prosecutor then asked him to allow him to feel, and he felt in his great-coat pocket, and drew out another waistcoat—he said, "This is a serious thing; how in the world, Butcher, could you have done so?" or words to that effect—the prisoner replied, "For God's sake, Mr. Moses, do not take any notice of it, I will make any reparation or restitution you can desire"—several other things were then said, and the prosecutor left the counting-house, to consider what he should do—Mr. Butcher then said to me, "Mr. Fox, interest yourself for me—do all you possibly can—endeavour to prevail with Mr. Moses not to proceed with it, and gratitude will prompt me not to forget you"—I think I said, "How can I, Mr. Butcher, interest myself in a case like this?"—Mr. Moses returned to the counting-house, and the officer was sent for—Mr. Butcher saw him arrive, and he left the warehouse in haste, and ran when he got out—I had to run with all my might, shouting, "Stop thief," and he was taken.</p>

               <p>about him"—had you asked him that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, motives of delicacy prevented me—I should say, the phrase "concealed," was not used—I do not think I used the phrase "concealed" before the Magistrate—it was not read over to me, but the substance of what he read was true, and I thought that was sufficient—I should say, the prisoner had not been drinking—his counte<lb></lb>nance did not indicate that, but a perturbed state of feeling—he walked soberly, spoke soberly, and appeared to act soberly—I should be surprised if the policeman had said he had been drinking—the prisoner is reported to be a man of property—I saw a female, who came to Mr. Moses's after this transaction, but I was not present at any part of the conversation—the lady began in a very warm manner, the moment she saw Mr. Moses—I believe she came twice, but I do not think Mr. Moses saw her twice—if the prisoner had intended to escape, I believe his horse and gig were at the corner of Houndsditch.</p>

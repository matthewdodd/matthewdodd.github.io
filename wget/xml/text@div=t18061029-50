               <p>SIR, - You will do me the favour to call upon Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co. to receive two thousand five hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>I told him that we had no order from the house at Manchester to pay the money; he expressed his disappointment, saying that he had fifteen thousand pounds in their hands, he said it would be very inconvenient to him, as he had made some engagements in Oxford road; I then asked him if he knew any body in the neighbourhood that could identify him, he said no, he was a stranger, having come from Brighton the day before. I told him it was impossible for me to let him have the money without he could bring some person to vouch the truth of what he said. I begged he would call again, when my partners would be in, I would keep open till near eight o'clock for him; he went away, leaving the letter he had produced in my possession.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you ever shew him the letter that you received on the 24th. - A. I did not, I told him I was sorry I was not at home the day before when he called; I asked him to walk in, which he did, I said it was a little extraordinary that our house had not apprised us of the money that he wanted, he said he was surprised at it, he had fifteen thousand pounds in their hands; he told me that he had written to them and they had sent him that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not produce to you any order. - A. No.</p>

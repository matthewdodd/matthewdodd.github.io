On the 3rd of May the prisoner came to me, and hired a horse and chaise-cart, which I let him, and he took them away the same day - the horse was property harnessed; he said he wanted it to go to Chelmsford, to the election, and he should be back in seven days - he agreed to pay me seven guineas for the week, and said if I went to the Bull, at Aldgate, he should get some money from the committee to pay for it - I agreed to let him have it for the week for seven guineas; he said his expences would be paid by the committee, who sat in Whitechapel, who would advance him the money - he had the horse, cart, harness, and a whip to drive with. I never saw him again till the 23rd of May, when he was at Worship-street - he was to have been back on the 10th; I made inquiry after him, but heard nothing of him - he gave me his card as living at No. 75, Aldersgate-street; I inquired for him there, and found he had lived there, but had left there some time - it was not his address at the time he hired the horse and cart; I saw him at Worship-street on the 23rd - the cart and horse were there: I had advertised them, offering 5l. reward, and found him in custody two days after - my horse was worth 20l., and the chaise-cart 12l., including the harness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish him to produce the advertisement. Witness. Here it is, in the Morning Advertiser of the 21st of May.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not in treaty between two and three years ago, to purchase the horse and cart of you? A. It may have been nearly two years since I saw him; after I bought the cart he came and asked if I would part with it, and I never saw him afterwards - there was no bargain about it - he only hired it for a week; I have a memorandum here in his own writing - he gave it to me at the committee-room; I saw him write it - (read) - "Mr. Macbeth, I agree to pay seven guineas for the hire of the horse and cart for one week, Thomas Shearman, Stretton Arms, Carthusian-street, Charterhouse-square;" I inquired there, and found he had lodged there, but not at the time - here is another note, which he wrote to me from Chelmsford; I cannot swear it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I admit the letter, and wish to have it read;(read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Macbeth, stable-keeper, Great Red Lion-street, Holborn, London. Chelmsford, 7th of May, 1831. SIR, - The election is all over at Colchester, and I am here; there is an old gentleman here, who has taken a fancy to your old horse, and if you will set the lowest price you will take for him, you may have a customer for the set-out altogether, and I will give you an order for the money on a house in Lombard-street - send an answer by return of post, directed to me, to be left at the Post-office here till called for.

            . I sent no answer to that letter, but went down to Chelmsford; I could not find him there, nor hear any thing of him at the Post-office, or of the horse and cart; I made inquiry about him from time to time, without success.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you ever get tipsy, and forget what you do? A. I always attend to business first.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am ostler to Mr. Macbeth. I saw master and the prisoner go out of the yard together in the cart, and on the 23rd a man came and gave information that he knew where the horse and cart were - I went and found the horse in Moor-lane, at Salt's livery-stables; the prisoner was not there - I saw him at Worship-street; the same horse and cart were there, and the same harness, except the collar, which was changed - the breeching was gone, also the whip and horse-cloth; the whip had the name of Charles Fowler on it - I have since seen the whip in the Policeman's hands.</p>

            . I am an oilman and grocer, and live at Hornchurch, in Essex, about fifteen miles from London. -I saw the prisoner first about three weeks before he offered this horse and cart for sale - he then told me he had been down to Essex, to an election; and I think about a week before I saw him in custody he drove up to my house, No. 8, Church-street, Mile-end New-town - he said he had been to Chelmsford and Colchester elections, and had driven up two or three publicans - I said, "Is this your horse and chaise-cart?" he said Yes, it belonged to him - I said I wanted one, and asked what he wanted for it; he asked thirty-four guineas - I called out a friend who was a judge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300004"></xptr>of it; he thought it would suit me, and I was to meet the prisoner at the Grey Hound, Smithfield, to go to Hampstead-road, where he was going - I was to go there to see how the horse would go; I said I wanted to go to Webber-row, Blackfriars - he said he wanted to go to Hampstead-road, and said he would drive me round there; I was to meet him at three o'clock on the Sunday following, to try the horse and, drive there - I did not go, as a person stepped up and said I had better have nothing to do with him, and the bargain went off; as I did not go to the Grey Hound, the prisoner called at my place about nine days afterwards, on a Friday - I was not at home, but heard he had called.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the prosecutor had lest his horse and chaise? A. On the Sunday - I was at Hornchurch, and when I returned my wife told me of the advertisement; I went to Machin's stable, in Fann-street, Aldersgate-street - I made inquiry, but did not see the horse and cart there; I went to Macbeth's on the Monday, and told him what had passed between me and the prisoner; I afterwards saw him at Worship-street, and am quite sure of his person - I took Macbeth's ostler and three Policemen, and found the horse at Salt's livery-stables, Moor-lane, and the cart and harness in a court in Whitecross-street, in possession of two men named Page and Crowder; they were moving it away while I was in the yard - I offered to buy it, to stop its being carried away, and Crowder offered it to me for 12l.; when the Policemen came up, I said I would have nothing to do with it - I had watched them remove it from Salt's stables to Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How many men have you hailed above in a night at Sergeant's Inn, in Term time? A. None at all - I have justified bail three times; I never bought any stolen blue; I was never advertised as a swindler.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said you are an oilman and grocer, at Hornchurch - do you carry on any business there? A. Yes, I bought the lease of the house - I live there, and carry on business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not offer to pay me in brick-dust and sawdust, which your stock consists of? A. I offered you the money if the horse would suit me; a person stepped up, said you had been in the pillory, and told me to have nothing to do with you - I had not a farthing for bailing the three men; they were customers of mine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you a residence at Mile-end? A. I lived there at the time the prisoner made me this offer, as well as at Hornchurch - I left Mile-end about a week ago; my family have gone down there - I carried on the oil and colour trade in Church-street, but I carry on that and the grocery business too at Hornchurch.</p>
               <p>TRUEMAN MACHIN. I keep stables in Fann-street. The prisoner brought the horse and cart to my stables on the 10th of May, and took them away on the 18th - they were within a mile and a half of the prosecutor's all that time; he did not say who they belonged to - he paid for the keep; he only went out with them once, and returned in the evening; he never used them again till he and another person took the horse and chaise away - he paid for the keep, as if he was the owner; I did not know that they were the prosecutor's at that time.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CROWDER. I am a publican, and live at No. 45, Golden-lane - I have known the prisoner some time. On the 18th of May he came to my house, and told me he knew of a horse that would suit me - he took me to Machin's stables, the White Horse, in Fann-street; I saw the horse and cart there - he asked if I thought the horse would suit me; I said I did not know till I rode it- I lent him 2l. to pay for the keep at the livery-stable; Machin would not let it came out without - I then drove it to my house, and went from there along Old-street; I observed the horse was lame, and told him it would not suit me - no price was set on it; he told me to take the horse, cart, and harness to my stables till he paid me the 2l. - he did not mention Macbeth's name to me; I was to work the horse for its keep - I drove it to Epsom races, and the following Monday the prosecutor claimed it; the prisoner was then at my house, and I sent for him to answer for himself; I was where the cart was found, and directed my servant to go and have him apprehended - it was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe I asked you to lend me the money till I could make my payment good for the hire of it? A. I knew nothing of his having hired it - I supposed it to be his own; I lent him the money to pay for the keep - he never told me he had hired it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to TRUEMAN MACHIN. Q.Did you object to the horse and cart coming away till the keep was paid for? A. Yes - I make it a rule that the keep should be paid for before 1 part with a horse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not rub out the City Arms and your name yourself, for fear of being informed against for lending them out without a stamp-ticket? A. No - the City Arms were on it when I bought it, but they have been taken off these two years, as I am not free; I did not know of the name and address being off till it was at Worship-street - I did not ask fourteen guineas for the week's hire; I agreed the week before to let it to you for 3l., but you did not tell me where it was going - when I let it you were to pay seven guineas.</p>

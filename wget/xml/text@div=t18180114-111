               <p>WILLIAM DELL. I am a waiter at Long's Hotel. On the 12th of January I was at the bar, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner coming from the staircase; he appeared very bulky, as if he had something about him. I followed him, and overtook him about eight or ten yards from the door, and asked what he had been doing up stairs? he said he had been to the water-closet, and that the housemaid had showed him up. I told him I thought he had something about him which did not belong to him, and asked him to come back. He then said he had lived in the house, which I knew to be false - I collared him, and brought him back, and put him into the coffee-room, and sent for an officer. While the officer was gone for, he pulled the things from under his clothes, and some from his pockets. The officer came and took him.</p>

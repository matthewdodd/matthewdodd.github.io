               <p>—on Sunday morning, 24th February, I went to bed last, after locking up—I had been in bed about 20 minutes when my wife called my attention to a noise below—I sprang out of bed and ran to the room door—some one said "Come on, governor, thieves in the house"—I ran to the bottom of the stairs and found the officer in a stooping position with Neville—he said "Take my staff, there are others in the house, strike the first you come to"—I took the staff and went to the back door—I saw Smith, seized him, and dared him to move or I would strike him—I struck a light in the shop—the constable sprang his rattle; another constable came and relieved me, and I went upstairs and dressed—I examined the place—a hand saw was removed from its place—the fastening of the lock had been strained—possibly one got in at the side door while I was putting up the shutters, as I had to go round the house—I heard the door bang when the officer came.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Serjeant, next door to Mr. Thomas's; I sleep in the summer-house: I was alarmed between eleven and twelve o'clock at night on the 11th of May, I was half undressed, going to-bed, that there was somebody getting over the fence; I heard first of all a lock or a latch list up; then I went up to the fence, where I thought I heard it, and then I stopped about five minutes; it is a fence between the walk and Mr. Thomas's garden; I saw the prisoner get in at the window of the summer-house; as soon as he got in he struck a light, and brought a tumbler and teaboard, and put them over the pales, and then he got over the pales back again into the next garden, and then he got on the top of the fence to get over the walk back again, and then he saw me; he ran back again down the garden, and over a wall, into a place where there was no thoroughfare; I went round about sixty yards, and stopped him at the corner; I took him to the watch-house, and gave the property to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cliston. Q. This was a very dark night, was it not? - A. No, it was a very light night; it was not moon-light, but it was star-light.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the summer-house from where you were standing? - A. Not more than a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You were within a dozen yards of him, saw him go in at the window, and did not attempt to stop him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(Hawkins, the watchman, produced the property).</p>

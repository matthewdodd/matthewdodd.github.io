                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Offley, who keeps a general-shop in Rotherhithe. On the 28th of Nov. the prisoner came to the shop, and said he came from Mr. Soames, a soap-boiler, at Wapping, to know if I wanted any soap—I told him I did not know such a person, and did not sell soap—he said, in consequence of the tide breaking in, there was a fourteen days' sale allowed by the Excise—he showed me a sample of good soap—I said it was not convenient, and he went away—he came again on the 1st of Dec,—I called my husband—he asked my husband what quantity of soap he would have—my husband said, "One stone and a half," the prisoner said, "Make it up a quarter of a cwt."—my husband agreed to do so—the prisoner said we could not have it that day, as the cart was delivering 2cwt. at Mr. Back's, and I should have it the next morning—I got the soap next morning, and paid the prisoner 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., believing it to be good soap, and that Mr. Back had bought some—that was the reason I let him have the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I kept the soap till the Excise seized it—it was of no use at all as soap.</p>

I have a partner—on the 23rd of April the prisoner came to our granary, and ordered 3-qrs. of oats, a sack of beans, a saok of split beans, and a quarter of bran, to be sent to his stable in Hatfield-street—he gave me to understand he had but one saddle-horse there, as he did not like to put his horse to a livery-stable—that his bailiff was coming from his estate at St. Albans, where he came from, once a week, to bring new milk and cream to his town house—I told him it was not our custom to leave sacks with any corn we sent out—he said they should he shot at the place and the sacks returned, and he might send the money back by the man, if not, he would send it in the morning—I gave a delivery ticket for the corn, and sent it by Corderoy, which the prisoner signed and returned—I have never been paid for my corn, nor seen the prisoner since, till I found him at the office, surrrounded by fifty or sixty creditors.</p>

I went with the corn, beans and bran to Hatfield-street, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him if he would let me have the sacks—he said I might shoot two and take them back, and leave seven, and he would send them back next morning by one of his men—I had had directions at the wharf about the sacks before I went there—I tole the prisoner I was not to leave them—he said I must, and he would return the seven next morning—I was induced, in consequence of that, to leave them—they did not came next morning, and I went after them, but found the stable shut up—I inquired for the prisoner, but could find him no where—nobody could give me any account of him, till I found him at Mary-le-bone office on other charges.</p>

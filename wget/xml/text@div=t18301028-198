On Saturday, the 11th of October, about half-past eleven o'clock, I ordered my servants to bring the meat from outside the shop - it was done; I went into the parlour. and in a short time heard a person call Stop him! I ran out, and found the prisoner in custody of a Policeman about one hundred yards off, with this veal in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not forty yards. Witness. I cannot exactly say the distance; the business is my own - the meat was inside the shop, on the board.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. I heard a cry of Stop him! in Marylebone-street; I turned round, saw the prisoner running towards me, and stopped him - he had a basket in his right hand; he then doubled himself down, with the basket between his knees, turned it over, and threw the contents out; I caught this knuckle of veal in my hand as it came out - I took it out of the basket; the Policeman instantly came up, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The basket was but small, and could not conceal the article.</p>

               <p>The prisoner (in a long address) stated that he had bought the veal in Hampstead-road - that he never entered the prosecutor's shop, and he did not throw the basket down, but was stopping to look into it for something, when it was knocked out of his hand.</p>

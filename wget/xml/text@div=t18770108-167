                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, living at 4, Bloomfield Street, Poplar-prior to Tuesday, 19th December last, I had been staying with a man named Francis Allen, a seafaring man—about 1 o'clock that morning I was in bed with Allen, at 14, Bloomfield Street, the prisoner came into the room, he broke open the room door, and the door downstairs as well—I believe he was the worse for drink; Allen was quite sober—the prisoner first struck me as I was in bed—Allen, who was lying against the wall, got up in the bed and said he could not see me struck, and with that the prisoner struck him in the face and pulled him out of bed on to the floor on his back, and struck him several times and fell a-top of him—Allen did not strike him, he had not time to do so; as he fell he must have struck his head on the chamber, I did not see him do so, I was so excitable—there was a lamp on the sideboard in the room—the chamber was on the washing stand by the side of the bedstead, it was quite sound before; the prisoner came in; after the struggle it was broken all to pieces, I did not observe any blood on it—there was blood on Allen's face, he ran down stairs in his shirt, and I got his clothes together and ran down after him in my petticoat—Allen went for the police and brought back two police<lb></lb>men whilst he was gone the prisoner ran downstairs and ran up again into the bed-room and laid there on the floor till the policemen came and took him into custody—he was taken to the station—I told Allen to go to my sister's and I went home—I next saw him lying dead in my sister's passage later that same morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner <hi rend="italic">about</hi> two years—he had been a teetotaller for a year and nine months before this, as far as I know; I have stopped with him now and then—the house in which I was living was taken in his name; he had promised to keep me; he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said at the police-court next day that Allen was drunk, I was excitable; he was not drunk, he was quite sober—I said at the police-court that Allen struck the prisoner in the mouth and they struggled together—the case was remanded, and on 30th December I told the Magistrate that I wished to make another statement, and I then said that Allen was quite sober and that he did not strike the prisoner at all—I had been at two public-houses with Allen that night, he had a glass of gin hot at one house, and a share of my glass at the second—he complained of being ill there, and said he felt queer in his heart, and in doors the same, before the prisoner came in—the prisoner had paid the landlord twice, by my giving—I was very excited at the time of this struggle—Allen was pulled out of bed and fell against the wash stand—I heard the noise of the fall and the chamber break—I am sure he was struck several times, and he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I generally paid the rent myself, when the prisoner paid it I gave him the money—there was not room to put a chair between the,. bed and the wash stand—Allen was pulled out of bed over me; he had no opportunity of getting on his legs afterwards, there was only one other lodger in the house; I received the rent from her—the prisoner had no right to come to me, except as an ordinary visitor—the street door was shut, and my room door was locked, and he burst them both open—Allen had been at home from sea three weeks—I had known him five years, and</p>

I live at 4, Bloomfield Street, in the same house with Eliza Beer; I pay rent to her—I am an unfortunate woman—on 18th December I was in bed with a man in the front parlor, I was lying awake, the man beside me was fast asleep—I heard the street door burst open first, and my room door next; it had been locked, but not bolted—the prisoner came into my room and said to the man who was lying by the side of me, the worse for drink "I will pay you," they had had a previous quarrel out<lb></lb>side—he pulled the clothes off him and began to beat him; he then left off beating him and ran upstairs—I afterwards heard a fall—I remained down-stairs, Allen ran downstairs and went for a policeman—I saw nothing more till the police came and took the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure that the prisoner struck Gilby, the man who was with me; he did not do more than pull him out of bed—I had not been in the prisoner's company that evening—I saw him in the African public-house, but 1 was not in his company, I was with Gilby in another compartment—the prisoner was a steady, well-conducted man up to this night—I had been living at that house about six weeks, Allen was there every day for three weeks out of the six.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., Three Colt Street, Limehouse 90, Gill Street, is about a mile from 4, Bloomfield Terrace—on 19th December, about 6 o'clock a.m. I was sent for to 90, Gill Street—I found the deceased, seated in a chair supported by Mrs. Grimm, quite dead—there were some contusions about the eyes, one more especially, what is commonly called black eye—he had been bleeding a little from the nose, but he had wiped it off—there was an abrasion of the skin about the eye—I did not observe any other wound—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found effusion of blood about the brain from a rupture of a blood vessel, and a small fracture at the base of the skull—the heart was enlarged to twice the ordinary size, the lungs were healthy, the liver was normal, but congested like that of a man who had been drinking lately; the spleen was natural, the kidneys inflamed and granular, the stomach and intestines natural,—in my judgment concussion of the brain was the cause of death—I believe the concussion caused the effusion of the blood vessel, not the actual rupture, that was very slight—the skull was the thinnest I have ever seen; I believe an ordinary skull submitted to the same amount of violence would come out unscathed—I do not, of course, know what the amount of violence was, but I can account for it in this way, that the peculiar fracture was caused by pitching on the head and the shock was communicated to the spine—I don't think a blow on the face with a fist would produce the fracture, unless it might in this being an exceptional case on account of the malformation of the bones—if he had been pulled out of bed violently and fallen on the top of his head, that would be the most probable way in which it would be occasioned—I don't think a fall against the chamber would aggravate it, that would shield and prevent the shock more or less, it would depend upon how he fell on it—death might have been due to the state of the heart if it had not been for the fracture of the skull—I think mere excitement might have caused the effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have said that the effusion was caused by the con<lb></lb>cussion and not by the fracture, the fracture was the exciting cause—if I had not seen the fracture I should have attributed the death to apoplexy—I should have been led to the belief that he died from heart disease—the effusion was capable of being caused without the fracture; where you have effusion you seldom have fracture—the effusion was on the surface of the brain, the fracture was at the base of the skull, at the hinder part, where the bones are weak—the effusion, however caused, was of itself sufficient to account for death; it depends upon the quantity—in my opinion the effusion was not caused so much by excitement as by the fracture—there were no internal injuries corresponding with the blow on the eye—the condition of the heart was such that it might have caused sanguineous apoplexy, or congestion of the brain, or effusion of blood on the brain—in my opinion the effusion arose from the violence which occasioned the fracture—excitement from the quarrel might have occasioned it—I did not say before the Magistrate that pure excitement alone might have caused it, I meant excitement caused by the quarrel and the fall—pure excitement'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080030"></xptr>
               <p>would cause sanguineous apoplexy, which would cause death—he had sanguineous apoplexy sufficient to cause death independent of the fracture, but I should not call it sanguineous apoplexy; I should call it effusion of blood on the brain; without the fracture it would be sanguineous apoplexy; with the fracture it would be owing to the violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say that the death was due to concussion, and the concussion was due to violence to the skull, the fracture.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The heart was in a bad condition, but I found no symptoms to lead me irresistably to the conclusion that he would have died of heart disease; I think be would have lived longer, I can't say how long—the fracture might have been caused by a blow from the fist, on account of the thinness of the skull, but a fall is what generally occasions that particular kind of fracture—that was the immediate cause of death, the remote cause would be disease of the heart—if I had not seen the fracture I should have thought he might have lived for years, perhaps ten year—from the condition of the heart there was nothing to lead me to suppose that he would have died within so short a period.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Frimley, a publican. We live at Islington—the prisoner was our servant of all work for a fortnight and two days—I saw her nursing the child in the bar on the 4th of May—I observed her put something under her arm, and she hurried out of the bar—I then missed one of the packets of copper from the table where, we occasion<lb></lb>ally put money—I directly followed her into the passage and accused her of it—I took the child from her arms, and then took the packet of halfpence from under her arm—there were halfpence and pence mixed—I waited till my husband returned, and he sent for a policeman—I know it was mine, for there had been seven packages of copper, and one was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I once found some Bank-notes in her bed-room—I took them down to her, and she said she had forgotten them—I took a sovereign to her that she had left in the bar, and she said she had forgotten it—I did not take the halfpence to keep them, but to quiet the child. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I do not recollect those circumstances at all.</p>

About 4 o'clock, on the afternoon of the 29th February, I was on Ludgate Hill with Underwood, another officer—I saw the prisoners there together—I saw the female prisoner passing backwards and forwards in the crowd, and placing herself on the right hand side of ladies—the male prisoner placed himself either in front of different ladies in the crowd, and sometimes on the left hand side to obstruct their passage—they worked about in the crowd in that way for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then spoke together—they came outside the crowd, and had a conversation for about a minute—they then crossed over to the north side of St. Paul's Churchyard, where there was also a great crowd—the female went into the crowd just on the left hand side of a lady—I took her into custody—she had this knife open in her right hand, and this purse in her left, containing 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Underwood took the male prisoner into custody—I told the woman she would be charged with picking a lady's pocket in company with the man—she said "I don't know anything about the man, I never saw him before in my life"—I took them to the station, and they were charged with picking a lady's pocket, then unknown, of a purse containing 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when at the station, the female had this bag under her dress, and a hole in her dress, so that she could have easy access to it—I said "What have you here?"—she said "Six or seven shillings—I said "Is that all you have?"—she said "Yes"—I took it from her and found it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the male prisoner pulled off two of his coats—he handed me one coat, from which I took this empty purse out of his pockets and this small memorandum book of some deaths—I said "Can you tell me anything that is in this book?"—he said "No"—I said "The entries are of great importance, you should know what is in it"—he said "I don't know anything of it; it is a book my little sister gave me"—the prisoners said they had never seen</p>

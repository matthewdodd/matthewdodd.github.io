                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live in the Strand. The prisoner was in my employment in the month of March last, as commission traveller, and from August, 1836—in the same capacity during the whole time—receiv<lb></lb>ing a commission on the goods which he sold, but no per centage on the money which he received—it was an understanding that the commission should cover that—I wrote to Mr. Emery about the middle of January, demanding payment of money due from him—I did not get the money—I had a con<lb></lb>versation with the prisoner about Mr. Emery's account—he told me that he should be sure to get it the following journey—that was in the month of April last year—his account of monies received on the journey was rendered about the 5th of April—he was to have brought it back, or remitted it—it was his business to have accounted for it when he returned home—I am not aware of any thing else particular occurring—there was a conversation which I cannot speak to—I gave the prisoner no order to write to Mr. Emery—I did not give any further order to the prisoner on that occasion—the prisoner made no proposal—he said he should have the money on the next journey—he rendered this account to me about the 5th of April, as near as I can say—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I did not instruct any professional gentleman at Hastings to write to Mr. Emery—this account is the prisoner's handwriting—these sums are stated to have been collected on that journey, for goods had previously—they were due some time</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hotel-keeper at Hastings.

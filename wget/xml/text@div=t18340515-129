On the 26th of December, I let the prisoner part of the house No. 2, (the shop, bakehouse, and first floor,) according to an agreement - she was to be responsible for any damage done to the fixtures, or the loss of them - and either party were at liberty to put an end to the agreement, by giving three months' notice in writing - I gave her notice to quit on the 24th of March - the rent was 30l. a-year, and 6l. for the use of the chattels and fixtures, to be used on the premises - that was settled verbally, by one or two witnesses - the business of baking was to be carried on, but there was not a loaf baked on the premises since she has been there - she is still in possession - about the 15th of April, I found some of the property I let to her was missing, and I gave her into custody - when I took the officer in, she asked what it was for - I told her she would know that before the magistrate - she said at the office that she had lent the things to Mr. Thorn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she herself mentioned Mr. Thorn's name to you? A. She did, at Worship-street - I have taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I was in prison for liabilities not my own - I received 9l. in advance from the prisoner up to the 25th of March last, she is to pay a quarter's rent in advance - I do not mean to say it is stated so in the agreement, but I understood so - I read the agreement hastily - her time would be out next quarter-day - she was to take the tenant's fixtures at a fair valuation, if she thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did she ever intimate to you any desire to take them? A. No.</p>

            . On the 23rd of January, I purchased of the prisoner two peels, six tins, a scale beam, two scales and weights, and a sieve, which she told me belonged to her husband - she said she had plenty of things to dispose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150076"></xptr>of, but they were put away with a friend of hers, as she was afraid the landlord where she lived before, would take them for rent - she said she was not going to carry on the trade, if I would serve her with bread - I went to the place, and did serve her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you brought any action against her? A. Yes, for a debt for bread and flour - I bear her no ill-will - I did not pay her for these things - they were to be set off - her son came to me for an iron peel, but that is not connected with these things.</p>

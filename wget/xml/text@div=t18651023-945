                  </hi>. I live at 35, Golden-square, and have charge of No. 34, which is a warehouse belonging to Auguste Garnier—on Tuesday night, 3d October, I saw the premises safe, about 11 o'clock; next morning, about 8 o'clock, I found a window and a fan-light broken, and under the fan-light I found this broken glass with a treacle plaster on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the fan-light very narrow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; a man could almost go through the hole that was made, and if it was all broken there would be space enough for any man to go through—there were no bars then, but some have been put since.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 82.) On 3d October, soon after 12 at night, I was in Brewer-street, Golden-square, and saw the prisoner there,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230024"></xptr>
               <p>with two other men not in custody—I followed them to the corner of James—street—one went up James-street, the other up John-street; they both joined in Golden-square, on the east side, stood two minutes in conversation and then separated again—one of them went over to the corner of Upper James-street, and the prisoner went to the corner of Upper John-street—the prisoner got on some area railings on the right-hand side of the door of 34, Gulden-square, placed a piece of paper against the window, and I heard a smash of glass—a signal was then given by the one at the corner of James—street, and a constable in uniform came round—the prisoner jumped down from the railings, went away round the square, and three of them met in Silver-street—they walked round the square and separated again—two of them went one way, and one the other—they met again on the east side, and stood conversing a few minutes—they separated again, and went to the two corners again—the prisoner then got on the railings on the left side of the door, with a largo piece of paper in his hand, which I saw him place on the fan-light, and heard the glass smash; that made a great noise—some persons were coming up the square, and he jumped down—they all went a way into Silver-street again—they went round the square, and stopped again on the east side—one of the men went over against the railings of the square, and looked for something—they then separated; the other men went down the square, and the prisoner went into Silver-street—I followed close behind him—I was in plain clothes—I saw him go to the doorway with something in his hand, which he placed in the doorway—I stopped him, and asked him what he had put in the doorway—he said, "Nothing"—I took him there, and picked up this jemmy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him to the station, searched him, and found a wax taper, and a large knife, used for pushing window springs back, also a brass chain and two pins—I went back to 34, Golden-square, and picked up this glass outside the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the men strangers to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was good gas-light—I was in the enclosure, seven or eight yards from the prisoner when he jumped from the railings, there were only some boughs between me and him—I could not be easily seen because I was lying under<lb></lb>neath them—there was a gas lamp just opposite No. 35—lam not mistaken in the prisoner being the man who jumped from the railings, I had seen him before, and he was the taller of the two—I left the enclosure and followed them—I was only two or three yards from the prisoner when he passed the doorway where the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> was found—he must have known I was near him, but he did not know who I was—he most likely heard me—I saw some<lb></lb>thing in his hand which I believe was the <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper in the employment of the Great Eastern Railway, at the Blackwall level crossing, North Woolwich branch—about three minutes past 7 in the evening of 2d February, the prisoner came there with his dray—I opened the gate for him to go across the line—he drove on to the line, and then refused to drive off—he had a couple of horses, and was sitting on the dray—he remained there about ten minutes—I tried to persuade him to get off the line, but he would not—I got the assistance of a constable, and he led them off—directly the gate was shut, a train passed—it was a little over-due—at this part of the line there is a curve, and you cannot see a train until it is up to you—if the train had been exact to time, it must have come upon the horses—I asked him to</p>

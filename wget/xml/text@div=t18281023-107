On the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Whitechapel with two young women; the prisoner left the other two, and asked me to go home with her - I said no; she said "Go and see where I live, that you may call another time" - I went with her to a small cottage at the end of <placeName id="t18281023-107-crimeloc630">George-street</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was not this girl pointed out to you more than once at a public-house, and you said she was not the girl? A. The officer went with me to a public-house - there was a young woman there, whom he spoke to - he asked me if either of them were the girl, but I did not go up to her; I do not know whether that is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the officer say "There is a young woman; look at her" - and does not that turn out to be the prisoner? A. The officer says it is, but she sat side-ways to me - I went two or three different nights.</p>

On Saturday the 2d of November I gave the prisoner a two pound bank note to get it changed, she brought me back a one pound note, and the remainder in silver and copper, she gave me the change, I put the one pound note into a little bag, and the next day, Sunday, I shifted my clothes about two o'clock. I left the little bag in my coat pocket, and the coat in the pantry, and a little after five I was sitting at my tea, I asked my wife where my coat was, she said she had brought it in, I put my hand in the pocket, and found the bag was gone, the girl absconded between two and three o'clock.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart, the corner of Leather Lane, and Portpool Lane. On Sunday the 3d of November, about six o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me to give Mrs. Jones, that keeps a coal-shed, change of a one pound note, she said she would take ten shillings in halfpence, if I would give change, I had plenty of copper, I gave her ten shillings in copper, and ten shillings in silver, I took this note of the girl, when the girl went out I saw another woman, the other woman said, is it all right. I then thought all was not right, I took hold of the girl, and took her into Mrs. Jones's the other woman on off, I asked Mrs. Jones if she had given this child a pound note to get changed, Mrs. Jones said, nothing of the sort, I had the pound note, I took the copper and the silver from the girl, I asked her where she lived, she first said at Hatton Wall, and then in Tothill Court, every thing she told me was quite false.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the note that was taken from me, I know it by a mark at the back; it is a one pound note.</p>

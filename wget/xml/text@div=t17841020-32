               <p>About the 27th of September, between twelve and one at night, I came to my lodging in Ratcliff-highway, no person answered, and Mrs. Palmer came up to me, and asked me to go to her house; I told her I would not, I went into the watchman's box, then she came again, and the watchman said I had better go with her than walk the streets all night, so I went with her, and while I was undressing myself, two young fellows came and asked me for some liquor, I said there was no liquor to be got, and they went away, the prisoner was in the parlour then, and she called the two young fellows in, there was a bed in the parlour, and I went to the kitchen door to make water, the two young men were in the parlour then, and when I came back I found nobody there, and my things were gone which I left in the care of Mrs. Palmer; I found the prisoner afterwards at my own door, and I gave the watchman charge of her, but he would not take it, the next morning I had her taken up.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Upon you oath, did not you go back and sleep in this woman's room that you supposed had robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew her perfectly before? - Yes, she called these young fellows in by name.</p>
               <p>By what names? - Tom and Jack.</p>
               <p>You told the watchman she should pay for them? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You slept in the parlour afterwards? - Yes, I slept with her in the bed.</p>
               <p>When you returned from the kitchen, was Mrs. Palmer in the room? - She was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>You said just now; when you returned there was nobody there? - Nobody in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Was not she looking after these men that had robbed the place, and calling the watchman? - No, she was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was sober.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I will tell you every word true; at half after eleven this gentleman came home, and his landlord was gone to bed, he began making a sham cry at the door, says I, you foolish blockhead, you had better go down to the watch-house; then Mrs. Palmer came past to get her a pot of beer for her supper, and he said he was poor and had no money; says she, you poor rogue, I will treat you with a bed for one night, so he went to her house, and I went the hour of twelve, and the door was a jar; I did not see the two men in the house; I came to my box and smoked a pipe, and Mrs. Palmer came to me, and said, come up to my house, for two men have taken the sailor's things; when I came up at one o'clock there were a couple of jockeys going over the rope-field, I had no business to go after them; when I came back there was only him and her, he said his clothes were taken away: he could not swear that Mrs. Palmer took them; she lent him a pair of shoes and stockings the next morning to go home in, and lent him sixpence, he had no money; he has lain in her house before, when he had a great deal of property; he was in liquor. I have been watchman two years and a half, my beat is in Ratcliff-highway, I have known the prisoner ever since she kept the house, I had never any complaints against her for robberies.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you learned so little of your duty as a watchman, to suffer women to come and pick up men at your watch-box?</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Do any of you Gentlemen live at that part of the town? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Make a memorandum of this man's name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. On the story of this idle drunken fellow, you will hardly think proper to convict the woman of felony, whatever opinion you may have of her.</p>

On the 8th of February, I came in and found my husband at home - I went to make the bed, the prisoner came in, and stood talking with us about five minutes - I put on the sheet, looked round for the blanket, and missed these things and her. I had pulled them off the bed just before; I did not see her take any thing - I and my husband were both in the room. My husband is not here; I went over to her, and said she had got my bed clothes; she denied it. I looked about the room, and in the cupboard I found the bed-tick and the apron in the chair she sat in - she was sitting on it. I have not found the blanket. I said I would fetch a constable - she threw the things in the kennel after me.</p>

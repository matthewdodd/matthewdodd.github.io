                  </hi>. I am in the service of Benjamin Higgins Wood<lb></lb>ward and another, carpet manufacturers, in Skinner-street. On Saturday, evening, the 7th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I had a piece of carpet, and a hearth-rug, belonging to my employers, to carry to Gains<lb></lb>ford and Booth's, in the Borough—I engaged the prisoner to carry it for me for a pot of beer—I told him I would take it of him at the end of Union-street—he took it on his shoulder, and I went with him—before I got to the end of Union-street, I missed him—I searched for him, and went to Gainsford and Booth's, to see if he had been there, but he had not—I had mentioned their names to him, and supposed he might have gone there—next morning I found the prisoner at a lodging-house in Blue-court, Saf<lb></lb>fron-hill—he told me he was very sorry, that he had missed me, that he had brought the carpeting home there, and put it into an out-house, and that some one had broken it open during the night, and stolen the carpet—I said that would not do for me, and offered him a sovereign if he would get it for me—he said he knew nothing about it, but some person he knew in the house would make a search, and if I would call in the afternoon it might be found—I came out, got a policeman, and gave him into custody—this is the carpet and rug now produced—our ticket is on it, and it is in the same sort of bundle—I had no intention in giving it to him, but to carry it—I happened to walk rather in front of him, and so lost him—I had seen him about the street before, but did not know his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday morning, the 8th of May, about twelve-o'clock, at No. 10, Blue-court, Saffron-hill—he said he was employed by Coxhead to carry this load to Union-street, that going along Union-street, he missed him, and had brought the bundle to his lodging for safety, that he had put it into an out-house in the back-yard, and it had been taken away—I searched the yard of that house, and two others, but found nothing there—I took the prisoner to the station, came back in about an hour and made further search, and found the property in the privy of the back-yard of No. 12—I had searched that place before, and it was not there then—the landlord of No. 10 was with me the first time—on the Saturday night, on which the carpet was lost, I had seen prisoner on Saffron-hill about a quarter to eleven, with this same load, resting it on the pavement—just before I got to him, some one assisted it on his shoulder—I asked him if he was going to carry it far—he said, "No, not far"—he carried it down Field-lane, which is quite away from his lodging, and while I went round my beat, he must have returned home again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lomax, and live at No. 19, Little Saffron-hill; I have known the prisoner eight years. On Sa<lb></lb>turday night, between nine and ten o'clock, he came to my door with a bundle similar to that produced, and asked if I would let him leave it there—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Never mind what it is"—he after<lb></lb>wards said he had picked it up in Whitechapel—I said I would not have it left there—he said if I would let him leave it, he would make me a pre<lb></lb>sent of the rug—I told him I did not want any present, to take it away, and he went away with it—he did not appear to be sober.</p>

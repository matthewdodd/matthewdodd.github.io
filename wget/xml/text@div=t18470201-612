I live at No. 32, Gloucester-street, Lambeth, in the house of Henry Frazier, who lives there—I look after the house for him—he takes in lodgers. On the 11th of Jan., at half-part eight o'clock at night, I was in the first floor back room—everything was perfectly safe then—I left The room, went into my own apartment, and am perfectly certain I shut the door close—soon after I heard footsteps—I went, looked down the stairs, and saw a young man in a light-coloured coat going out at the door—I turned back again and found the room door open, and a bolster lying on the threshold—I went into the room, found all the bed clothes stripped off, ex<lb></lb>cept three sheets—they are Mr. Frazier's property—I gave information to the police in less than ten minutes, and in about three quarters of an hour I was fetched to the station, and found the prisoner and the articles there—I missed them about ten minutes to nine o'clock, and found them about three quarters after nine—here are eight sheets and five quilts—I know them to be Mr. Frazier's property—they were safe in the room when I shut the door—some of them are marked—here is "Henry Frazier" in full on them—I have not a doubt of them.</p>

On the 11th of Jan., between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Queen-street, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Frazier's with this bundle of things—I asked him what he had got—he said he had some bedding—I asked where he brought it from—he said from New-street—I asked where he was going to take them—he said to his mother's over the water—I took him to the station and fetched Sanderson over, who identified them as stolen from Mr. Frazier's—the prisoner then said the things were his own.</p>

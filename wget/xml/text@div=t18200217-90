               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason for remembering that day - A. Yes, I wear out a great many shoes, and the last pair I bought I put the date in them to see how long they would last. I bought them on the 25th, and put them on the 26th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you at the examination - A. Yes, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170041"></xptr>remember about the date on the shoe. I had them on at the time, but did not pull them off to look at the date.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet him that day - A. I was with him every day for the last six months; we meet at a coffee-house every day at three o'clock, and have coffee together. We are prohibited from taking any thing else - he never shewed me the watch.</p>

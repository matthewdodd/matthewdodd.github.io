                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 94). About half-past 10 o'clock on Saturday, 15th September, from information I received, I went to Messrs. Ridley's, and after I had seen them, I went to the prisoner; I said to him, "I believe you are the person who pledged a table-cover at Mr. Hughes, 115, Old-street, yesterday?" he said, "I don't know anything about it; I was not in Old-street, neither did I pledge anything"—I said, "You must accompany me to the pawnbroker's"—we went there, and I said to the pawnbroker, Mr. Hughes, "Do you know anything of this man?"—he said, "I don't know anything further than he has pledged goods here; he pledged a table-cover here yesterday about 1 o'clock"—the prisoner said, "You are mistaken; I am not the person; I don't know anything about it"—the pawnbroker said, "You remember pledging a table-cover here yesterday, and taking out at the same time a gold chain?"—I said to the prisoner, "You must go with me to the station"—in coming out of the door of the pawnbroker's he turned round, and said to him, "You are quite right, I did pledge a table-cover"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this Albert chain; and at his lodging this bundle of worsted (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said at the station, "I met a man at a coffee-shop in Golden-lane, who asked me if I would pledge the table-cover for him"—the prisoner was not with me when I went to his lodgings.</p>

I said, "A ticket of mine in pawn." He said, "Let me look at it;" he looked at it, and said, "We will get five or six shillings up and get it out, and look at it." Another man came up with a parcel, and I went in and pledged the table-cover whioh was in it in his name; I know nothing about the worsted, it has been in my room for months.</p>

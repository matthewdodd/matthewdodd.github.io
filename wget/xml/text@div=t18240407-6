On the evening of the 27th of February I went on an errand, and returned about half-past six o'clock; it was just dusk; I saw two persons at the door; Pearson was one of them; I cannot speak to the other. Pearson asked me if my master was married, or whether he could see him, or if he was at home. I said he was not. He asked me the name of the street; I said Tavistock-place; he said it was Tavistock-street, and said that must be the place, and then he went up to look at the number, and asked if I lived with master; I said yes. He went away; I rang the bell and was let in, and the door shut. I went down into the kitchen. There were wine-glasses, tumblers, and a pair of silver cruet-stands in the parlour, and a spoon in the cruet. About five minutes after I got down stairs I heard the door shut violently. My aunt, who is the servant, went up, and called to me; I went into the parlour; found the table moved, and the middle door open; the cruet-stand and nine glasses were gone; one wine-glass was much smaller than the others; I have seen some of them since at Bow-street; they correspond in size and pattern; and the spoon.</p>

            's service; his house is in the parish of St. Pancras. On the 27th of February I let my nephew in, about half-past six o'clock; it was rather dusk; I do not know whether the lamps were lighted. I shut the door after my nephew, and tried it, and went down stairs; and in about ten minutes, as I was going to tea, I thought I heard footsteps, and said I thought master was coming down stairs; I listened, and heard footsteps again, and as I went up stairs I heard the street-door bang, and on getting into the passage I found the parlour-door open, and the table removed; I missed the castors, which I had seen safe about half-past three o'clock; the spoon was in them; mistress had one wineglass smaller than the rest, which she frequently drank out of; I saw that one at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a candle when you went up - A. Yes, it was dark enough for candles; my mistress had had candles in the drawing-room for about an hour.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of February, about a quarter to seven o'clock, I was on duty in Russell-square, with Mason and Dickens; I was not five minutes walk from the prosecutor's; I saw the prisoners coming in a direction from Tavistock-square towards Holborn; I saw them coming along very fast, arm in arm; I turned back after them; they crossed the end of Southampton-row, crossed Russell-square, and at No. 60 in the corner I saw Pearson throw something down the area; I heard it rattle as it fell; he immediately raised up his hand to throw something more away, and I took a large skeleton key out of his hand, and secured him, and in his right-hand waistcoat pocket I found a quantity of phosphorous matches, and in his coat pocket I found one wineglass; he had thrown one glass away before, which was broken. Mason searched Lock, and found a small wineglass in his breeches pocket. Mason brought a silver spoon up from the area, and upon Lock I found another glass. Mason tried the skeleton key to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it. I know that the house is in St. Pancras' parish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw them about a quarter to seven o'clock, was it dark - A. It was; I should think it had been dark more than a quarter of an hour - the lamps were lighted.</p>

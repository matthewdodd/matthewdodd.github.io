I believe there is some other property"—he said "No"—I searched and found in a drawer these sugar tongs, jam spoons, a tea spoon, 12 mustard spoons, 16 tea spoons, 2 pairs of scissors, 4 bottles of scent, and 4 pairs of kie gloves—the drawer was not locked—there was a bed in the room—the gloves were tied up in a brown paper parcel—Charles said that he knew nothing about the property—I said that I should take them for being concerned with their younger brother, who was under remand for stealing and receiving the articles—they made no reply—I found on Charles 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—none of Mr. Parr's pro<lb></lb>perty was found anywhere except in their room.</p>

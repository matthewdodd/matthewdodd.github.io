                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at West Ham, in Essex. On Thursday, 20th Sept, I and my wife left my house about a quarter before 7 o'clock—we went out together—two of our children were left in the house—when we went out, I heard my wife put a little nail in the window—that was the middle window—it looks into the road—the window was shut down—I know the prisoner—he had not been at my house a short time before I left, to my knowledge—he was there about 6 o'clock, when he came with the men with the brick maker's tools—he stopped about half an hour—I went out, and returned about half-past 11 o'clock—I had left a pair of boots at home, and a jacket on a chair in the front room—when I got home the window was shut—I did not see the nail—the curtain string was broken, and the curtain hanging by one side—there was no nail in the window—I could not see the end of the nail in the wood—there was a hole—I could not find the nail at all—I missed, that evening, a pair of water<lb></lb>tight boots, and a box which contained about 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that box was in another box against the foot of the bed—on the following morning I missed my jacket, and I gave information to the policeman in Stratford—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's house—I have seen the boots and jacket since—I gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the jacket about twelve months ago—the boots were worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 189). On 21st Sept. I went with the last witness to a house in Stratford Marsh, about 7 o'clock. We found the prisoner at home—he looked out of the upstairs window first—he then came down and opened the door—the last witness told him that he had very strong suspicion that he had broken open his house the night before—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—I searched the room on the ground floor, and under the bed I found these boots—I went up stairs, and saw a box—I was proceeding to open it, and the prisoner said, "It is no use to look in the box, the jacket is not there"—I found this jacket between two beds on a bedstead—the prisoner's wife was there, but no man but the prisoner.</p>

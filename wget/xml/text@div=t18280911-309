The Prisoner had been four or five months in her service; I missed a pair of stockings from the wash for about two months; I made repeated inquiries of the prisoner - she always denied any knowledge of them. On the 21st of July, in consequence of missing some other things, I went into her room, and I found my stockings in her box, which was unlocked; I called my sister - we both saw them, and knew them; they were marked and numbered - we came down, rang the bell, and called the prisoner, and asked how she came by my stockings in her box; she denied any knowledge of them - I said, "I will convince you they are there;" I took her up, but the box was then locked, and when she opened it the stockings were gone - in a few days they were found in a cistern.</p>

I am the wife of William Herring, a drug-grinder—we live on the second floor of 31, Fleet-lane—on Sunday evening, 14th January, I was on the third floor, and heard some screams proceeding from Mrs. Pepler's room—I went down, and saw the prisoner there, and Mrs. Pepler, who said that he had been going to strike her—the prisoner then made a rush towards her—I stepped between them and said, "Don't strike her," upon which he put his fist up to me, and said, "They are all b—s to me in this house, but you are the worst," and then struck me in the chest with a knife—I did not know that he had a knife, till I felt myself being cut, and then I cried out, "Good God! Almighty! he's killed me," and Mrs. Pepler said, "No, child!"—I felt my body was being cut through, and then I became insensible—I had been drinking a little, but knew what I was about, for I ran down stairs to protect Mrs. Pepler, as I thought her husband was beating her—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there about three weeks—the wound is still in my breast—I am now an out-patient.</p>

I live in the same house as the last witness with my parents—I remember coming home from church on this Sunday night—the prisoner was in our room—Mrs. Herring came in with Mrs. Doyle, and Mr. Doyle picked up a chair and swore—I saw him strike Mrs. Herring some where in the breast, but I never saw any knife or anything in his hand—I can hardly remember what happened after that.</p>

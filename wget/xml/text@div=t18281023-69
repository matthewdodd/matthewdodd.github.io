            . I am servant to John Street Dickson. Last Thursday the prisoner came and knocked at the door, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock; I let him in; he asked the shopwoman for a pair of nine-sized shoes; she opened the drawers; he began pulling them about, but could find none to suit him; the young woman left me to mind the shop while she went up stairs - I stood between two counters, and did not see him take the shoes off the iron, but saw him sliding his hand down by his pocket; he said he would call again, and went out; I looked out, and saw him running as hard as he could - I ran after him, calling Stop thief! and in St. Ann's-lane I saw him throw the shoes out of his pocket; he was stopped without my losing sight of him; I took them up.</p>

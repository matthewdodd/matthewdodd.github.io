On the 27th of January, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, I heard something fall very heavy from Cory's wall, and presently I saw two men go from that spot - they looked from the corner of Cory's house right and left to see if any watchman was there; they then came back to the dead part of the wall, and I distinguished them under the gas-lamp, at the corner of the house - I saw them go from there by the gas-lamp, with something on their persons - I immediately followed and came up with the prisoner, who was one of them, and asked what he had got in his apron - he then threw them all out of his apron - they were rabbits, but I could not tell the number - this was about fifty yards from Cory's house- I found two dead fowls at his feet, which must have come from the apron, and a bag containing four fowls, one old rabbit, and a young one, which I suppose the other man, who had made his escape, had left behind - the bag was close to the prisoner - I called my fellow-watchman, who assisted in securing the prisoner - I sprang my rattle, as the rabbits were running in all directions - two other watchmen came and picked them up; we took them to the watch-house with the prisoner - we came back, and about four o'clock found another rabbit, and another before five o'clock - Waters, the constable of the night, found another fowl opposite Cory's wall, and in the morning Cory found three fowls' heads - five heads were found in all - the padlock laid on the ground - we took the rabbits and every thing to the watch-house.</p>

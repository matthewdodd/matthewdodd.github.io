                  </hi> On the 20th of Aug., in consequence of direc<lb></lb>tions from the Commissioners of Customs, I went to No.20, Wych-street, and searched the house and shop—I found the prisoner there, up stairs—I seized two British books full of obscene prints, which the policeman brought away—the shop is kept by a person named Blacketer, who has just now come out of prison, where he has been three months for exposing these sort of things for sale in the window—the prisoner lives with him as his wife—this makes the fourth seizure I have made there—I never went there before without bringing away 100 or 150 of these books an pictures—we bring away the foreign, and the police take the British—as soon as I go into the shop and state what I want, he produce them I take them away, and in a few days they will begin again—these people are all leagued together, as soon as we go to one, they fly off to give notice to each other.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bookseller and news agent in Drury-lane. I am sent here by Mr. Blacketer, who is very ill in bed, to say that this person is only his servant, and that if anybody is liable it is himself—he wishes his servant to be cleared of this charge, as she has done it inadvertently—I have myself been six months in prison, not for selling prints, there was no sale, they could not produce the witness, he was gone to Dublin, but a party seized some in a friend's shop, where I happened to he at the time—I was not con<lb></lb>victed of keeping a shop for the sale of such things—I was convicted, certainly, but there was no foundation for it—it was entirely a fabrication—I have a charge of conspiracy and felony against this Mr. Davis.</p>

I live at 29, New North-street, and am a carpenter—I have a work-shop at 9, St Ann's-court—on 30th June, between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, I locked it up and left it, leaving some tools on the bench, two planes, two jack planes, and other tools, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I came there on the following morning about 6 o'clock—the shop had been entered from the back window, which was shot when I left it the night before—in the</p>

I live at 5, Carlisle-street, Soho—on Tuesday, 1st July, a little before 6 in the morning, I was in Dean-street, and saw the prisoner come from St. Ann's-court with another man—he had three or four large saws in his right hand, and a small lot of tools in his left; the man behind him was dressed in a flannel jacket, and carried a carpenter's basket, slung over his shoulder, containing very large planes.</p>

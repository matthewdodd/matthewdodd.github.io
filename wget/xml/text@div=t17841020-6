               <p>On Tuesday the 28th of September, between eleven and twelve at night, my wife and me were abed, my wife awaked me and said, George, the window shutters are broke open; I got up and looked at the parlour window, it was an exceeding moon-light night, I saw two men pass by the parlour window, one tall, the other short, the shortest came and peeped in, I said to my wife, make yourself easy, they are thieves: I went to the parlour window, and looked sideways, and saw two men turn down the middle turning in the court into Hanway-street; I came back and put on my coat, I was very much flurried: when I came to the sash again, the man that I believe to be the prisoner at the bar, came with his face, as if he was going to rush into the parlour; I did make this imprecation, I said, damn you, you rascal, are you there again! I pursued him, he stopped and pretended to walk the other way, and he said, there he runs; I said, you are the villain: he and I cuffed one another a little, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200016"></xptr> neighbour opened his street door, the man ran away, and I ran after him; I called watch all the way, but no assistance could I get: at the bottom of Hanover-yard, the watchman crossed upon him, in the road in Church-street, St. Giles's, we took him in a passage, and he cried out for mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you find your windows and shutters? - The shutters were intirely wrenched out of their place, and hung by a bit of nail, and were both flung back, they were bolted in the evening, they were folding shutters with a middle bolt that runs across the middle stile of the shutters.</p>
               <p>Was the sash open? - No, I have a screw within side that screws it down.</p>
               <p>Were any of the panes broke? - One was.</p>
               <p>Had it been broke before? - Yes, the bed is in the parlour close by the window almost, when I went to the sash I looked sideways, I saw two men a second time turning into Hanover-yard.</p>
               <p>Court. If the sash was fast how could a man be attempting to get in? - It appeared to me that he was close to it, and with an intent to open it, he seemed to be exceedingly eager in the attempt to get close to it.</p>
               <p>Do you think that he was attempting to get in? - I do.</p>
               <p>Was that what you thought at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far did he run from you? - From Hanover-yard I suppose half a quarter of a mile or more.</p>
               <p>When you came up to him what did he do? - He begged of the watchmen not to kill him, or something of that kind, and he would give himself up, we looked in Hanover-yard and in the court for some tools, but we found none, nor none upon him.</p>
               <p>Did you look all the way that you pursued him? - We did, as nigh as we could guess where we thought it was probable we could find any thing, after I dressed myself I went to the watch-house. I saw him no more, nor spoke to him, I only went to give the charge.</p>
               <p>Court. From your observation of your house, nobody had been in it; did you find a trace or mark of any body being in it? - No, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>The sash had not been forced? - No.</p>
               <p>The pane of the window had been broke before? - Yes.</p>

I have not been long come from Gibralter, I was a soldier in the 12th regiment of foot, I was coming through this yard; and met the prosecutor hallooing watch, I was on the opposite side of the way, he said, by God you are one of them, I crossed over the way, I said, my friend, I am going about my business, and I went to run away, and they run after me, as they have told you; I never was was near the window upon my soul.</p>

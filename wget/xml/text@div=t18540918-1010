                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The witness gave her evidence principally in English, with the occasional assistance of an interpreter</hi>). I am the wife of Antonio Janik; my theatrical name is Caradori; that was my maiden name. In Aug. last I was residing at No. 57, Gower—street, Bedford—square—I am always there; I reside there now—I was engaged at Drury—lane Theatre, as <hi rend="italic">prima donna</hi>, during the recent operatic season there, by Mr. Jarratt—my engagement was originally for 100 nights—about the middle of Aug. Mr. Jarratt's management failed—they closed the theatre, without giving a reason, and for some time had not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After that was an arrangement made by the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> to carry on the theatre if possible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was Mr. Jarratt's intention to re—open the theatre, but not under his name, and he talked to the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> about it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180057"></xptr>
               <p>first, all the expenses were to be paid from the receipts, the servants, car<lb></lb>penters, rent, illumination, scenery, and everything connected with the service of the theatre, and afterwards two—thirds of the salary of the chorus and orchestra, and one—third for the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>—I do not know the defendant by name—I saw him on the stage, but did not know his name—the term "association" would be applicable to such an arrangement as this—I do not know whether the prisoner would be one of the persons who would be favoured by this arrangement; I suppose he would—MR. Jarratt made all the arrangements, only his name was not put as director—he chose the committee—I remember Saturday night, 19th Aug.—the defendant had made no claim upon me before that night, either verbally, by letter, or in any way—he had never spoken to me but once, when I explained to him about a scene at the rehearsal of Semiramide; it was something which was going down, and I thought it should be straight—that was the only conver<lb></lb>sation I ever had with him; and next day there was another rehearsal, and he made it so as I had explained—I think that was on the Tuesday before the 19th Aug.—on Tuesday I explained to him how it must be, and on Wednesday it was done—I did not owe him a sum of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was not obliged to pay anything—he never demanded such a sum from me—I did not on Thursday, 17th Aug., state to Sloman that I intended to leave England—I had not seen Mr. Sloman on that day—I did not on that day state to any one that it was my intention to leave England—I had not the slightest idea to leave England, for I was waiting for another engagement—I did not before Saturday, 19th Aug., state to any one that I intended to leave England—I was arrested, between 11 and 12 o'clock on that night, by the house of Mr. Jarratt, No. 37, Alfred—place, Bedford—square—I had been performing at the theatre that night—I had. occasion to call at Mr. Jarratt's on my way home, to leave his lady's maid, who always dressed me at the theatre—I took her home; and when she was gone out, directly two persons came into my carriage—I should not know them again—Signor Pavesi was in the carriage with me—I took him always to the theatre with me, for he lives in Alfred—place—the two persons who came into my carriage said that I must go with them, before they told anything—I was so frightened, I thought they were bad men—I did not know anybody, and they came so <hi rend="italic">precipitous</hi> into my carriage, and they kept me—I moved myself and said, "What do you here?"—they said, "You must go with us"—"Why?"—"You must go with us; don't make a noise, and be quiet"—I was defending myself, for I was frightened, and did not know what it was for—I said, "Why must I go with you?"—"Don't ask; you must go"—Signor Pavesi thought they were bad men, and went out of the carriage and called the policeman—the policeman came, and the two gentlemen who were in my carriage spoke to the policeman, what I did not understand, and then they put Pavesi in the carriage, and brought us, and arrested us, and in the arrest I asked again, "Why, what for," and they said, "You owe 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Sloman"—I was quite astonished to hear that, for I did not know who Mr. Sloman was—he said, "You don't know?"—I said, "No"—"He is the carpenter of the theatre;" and I was the more astonished how it was that the carpenter of the theatre put me in prison—I said I did not know why, and they told me, "You owe that to him"—I said, "No, Sir; I don't owe it to anybody, for I am not obliged to pay"—I do not recollect what place it was they took me to—I was detained the whole night, and the next day, Sunday, till the evening—Signor Pavesi was also detained—I sent for Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, my solicitors, on the Sunday morning I do not</p>

               <p>know precisely the sum that I paid in order to got away, but it was more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it paid, but I do not remember how much it was—I was tired with the performance, and I was brought into the house without supper, and without anything, and a very bad bed; I could not sleep in it—they said, "We cannot get anything, for it is Sunday"—I could not have a bottle of beer, or anything, because they said, "It is Sunday; we cannot get anything"—Signor Pavesi does not speak English—while I was here I hired a carriage—I had not given it up; I had always the same; I have it now—I reside at No. 57, Gower—street, now—I had not given any notice to leave—now I have given notice that on the 27th I must be at Manchester—before 19th Aug. I entered into an engagement with Mr. Knowles, of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, to sing there—I signed the contract on 2nd Aug.—this is the contract (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I had intended to reside in England, to make it my home, for the purpose of following my profession—I had applied for letters of naturalization for that purpose—this is the answer that I received (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it on 17th Aug., at 8 o'clock—if I had intended to go abroad, it would have been necessary to have my passport <hi rend="italic">vise</hi>—I have my passport here—I have not since received the letters of naturalization.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are not the lady who is known in this country under the name of Madame Caradori Allen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know Mr. Smith, the lessee of Drury—lane theatre—between the time of Mr. Jarratt's failure and the reopening of the theatre I think about three weeks elapsed—in that interval I saw Mr. Smith upon the subject of myself and the other principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> reopening the theatre—Mr. Reichart, the other first singer, who is gone away, told me to go and ask Mr. Smith in what manner it could be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the principal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, yourself among the number, to form a committee for the management? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not in that way—the other <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> would not sing if Mr. Jarratt opened the theatre, and I went to Mr. Smith to ask how it could be done—MR. Jarratt wanted to make eighteen representations, because if he could finish the eighteen perform<lb></lb>ances, the committee of the theatre would give him back his dresses and property, which were under sequestration—MR. Reichart was the first that told me so—he said it could not go on, and that they wanted the four prin<lb></lb>cipal <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, myself, Reichardt, Formoste, and Buri, to give a guarantee to the committee of the theatre that we would perform, a guarantee to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the engagement at Manchester, in order to relieve the sequestration that was upon the dresses and property of Mr. Jarratt—Mr. Smith said that he wanted 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give up the sequestration, and we said we could not give so much—I did not tell Mr. Smith that it was my wish to go on with the theatre for the eighteen nights in order to keep faith with the public—I had been performing under Mr. Jarratt's engagement for the whole season, previous to the week commencing on 12th Aug.—I had seen the defendant on the stage, but I did not know him—I believe he and his men had the management of the working of the scenes, but I never spoke to him—I have not seen him there every night, but I have seen him sometimes—we certainly could not go on without the head carpenter and his assistants—I do not know who the treasurer was, before Mr. Jarratt was unfortunate—MR. Lewis acted as treasurer during the week from the 12th to the 19th—MR. Oswald offered himself to do what was necessary in the theatre, for Mr. Jarratt could not sign anything, and he is a great friend of Mr. Jarratt's—I do not know by what name he was called; we called him</p>

               <p>what we liked, but be signed the free tickets and looked to the accounts—it was his business to sign the accounts before they were paid—I directed Mr. Lewis not to pay any of the workmen's bills at the theatre that had not been signed by Mr. Oswald, because Mr. Oswald said if he did not look over the account it would not go right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you yourself say that you would not have Mr. Jarratt as the manager of the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>, but that you would have a new bill published that the matter was under a new management? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We all said together, all the <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi> and all who were in the theatre, that the performance ought to go under a new management, or else the creditors of Mr. Jarratt would seize the receipts of the theatre—MR. Levy then said that we must take off the number of the representation (it was the eighty—third representation) for if that was left on the bills the creditors of Mr. Jarratt would come and take the money, seeing it was a continuation of the old direction—that was for the public to think it was another director, and not Jarratt—my dresser's name is Pamela; she is the lady's maid of Mr. Jarratt—I was tired in the course of the week ending on the 19th—before the performance began under Mr. Jarratt, I said I would not sing more than a week, and that he might provide himself with other <hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>—I do not know whether the week ended on the Friday—I never had to do with the appointments—I do not know that Saturday, the 19th, was an extra night—I do not know whether it was or not—I had promised to sing that Saturday, and all the rest did not concern me—MR. Jarratt was the director—he said what was to be per<lb></lb>formed, and was doing what was necessary, and I had nothing to do with the rest of the affair—I did not see the accounts of a night—one day they brought a mass of papers on the table, but I did not understand them—that was only on one day—I think it was the first Monday after the first performance—that would be the 14th—the mass of papers was not brought for me—it was brought into the theatre—I think Mr. Lewis brought it—I never stated to anybody that it was my intention to go abroad, and return to my engagement at Manchester after the Friday at the end of that week—I had no such intention, and I never said so to anybody—I never told any one that I should go away—I said nothing about going abroad, I am quite sure of that—Signor Pavesi was desirous of an engagement at Manchester—that Manchester performance was not under Mr. Jarratt, it was under Mr. Knowles—in the beginning I believe it was Jarratt, but afterwards Jarratt said he had nothing to do with it, it was Knowles—Signor Pavesi applied for an engagement, and did not get one—I was not angry at that—I did not after that say to the prisoner, or to any one, that I would go abroad, and not return until my performance at Manchester, or anything to that effect—I was told that I had not been residing in this country a sufficient time to naturalize me—I learnt English in this country for two months.</p>

I am a native of Naples—I sing under the name of Pavesi—I was one of the singers engaged at Drury-lane, by Mr. Jarratt—I speak Italian and French, I cannot speak English at all, and do not understand it—I have seen Sloman, the defendant, some-times on the stage, but I did not know his name or his employment—I never had any conversation with him—I did not see him on 17th Aug.—I did not tell him that I and Madame Caradori were going abroad—I did not tell him that I was going to Germany—I was in company with Madame Caradori when she was arrested—I was not aware of any claim that Sloman or anybody else had upon me at that time—I was locked up as well—I could not understand, that in London, the first city in the world, we could be arrested, and shut up by the law; I thought I was in the house of an assassin, and I called for the police—I have got no debt, I owe nothing to anybody, and never heard such a shame in all my life—I was released at the same time as Madame Caradori, by the advance of a sum of money—I have been in this country ever since—I am engaged for some concert, after that I shall see how my affairs will go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you state to anybody in the course of the week, from the 12th to the 19th, your intention of immediately going to Milan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said to Mr. Jarratt, before the engagement at Drury—lane, that I should go to Milan to seek an engagement, but Mr. Jarratt pressed me and begged me to remain, and I got persuaded by Mr. Jarratt, and remained—I said to Jarratt, that I and Madame Caradori would not sing further than the 19th—I never agreed with the chorus to remain for the eighteen nights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a meeting on the stage, on Saturday, the 19th, and a disturbance on that very subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on the stage, and there was some noise—there had been a disturbance on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the weekly performance end on the Friday, and was not Saturday an extra night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing at all about it, I never mixed about the direction—I was disappointed at not meeting with an engagement at Manchester, but it was a disappointment that every <hi rend="italic">artiste</hi> meets with at times—I did not, on Thursday, the 17th, tell Oswald, the secretary, that I would go to Milan, nor on any other day in the course of that week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you and Madame Caradori usually travel together, when you have engagements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to Edinburgh with the other performers, and that was the only voyage I made—I went to Amsterdam alone, and came back to London—last winter they offered me an engagement at Milan, but I did not agree on the price, and I went and sang in Holland—I remained two months in London last winter, and then they gave me a promise of an engagement to sing in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Puritani</hi>—they gave me a part to study, but I never performed, and I went to Amsterdam—I went with all the <hi rend="italic">troupe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Saturday, 19th, were not the chorus so angry with you, that Mr. Smith was called in to explain, with you, why it was you did not perform your eighteen nights' engagement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Saturday I came upon the stage, and saw several of the chorus—I saw Mr. Jarratt talk with several persons, and then they called for Mr. Smith—I heard Mr. Jarratt speak with Mr. Smith, who was saying, "Yes, yes"—I went to Mr. Smith, and asked him to speak in French—I heard my name pronounced several times,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180061"></xptr>
               <p>"Pavesi, Pavesi"—MR. Jarratt said, "Is it not true, Mr. Smith, that Mr. Pavesi has come to ask you for the theatre?"—MR. Smith said, "Yes"—I said, "You tell a falsehood"—MR. Smith then made answer that this evening he would give the theatre for nothing, and then there was loud applause—on Friday I was on the stage, when there was another dis<lb></lb>turbance—MR. Levy called me into the green room, and said, "Come, come, I want to speak to you in private"—I said, "Speak before everybody"—Mr. Arnoldi, the baritone, was present—MR. Levy said, "If you do not sing the next week the chorus and the orchestra will go before the Judge, and obtain an arrest, to place you in prison"—I said, "Sir, do you speak the truth?"—he said, "Yes, they will place you in prison, you and Madame Caradori;" so I went to the orchestra and the chorus, and said, "Gentle<lb></lb>men, I do not know to speak English; I beg you will allow me to speak in French, and some one among you will translate what I say. Mr. Jarratt has come and begged and prayed for Madame Caradori and me to sing for him; we could not resist his prayers, and we consented; we said we would sing on Saturday, the 19th, and now the solicitor of Mr. Jarratt threatens to place Madame Caradori and myself in prison, if we do not sing after Saturday"—there was a great cry in the orchestra of "No, no, we will not do that"—MR. Jarratt came and said, "Oh, Signor Pavesi, you are mistaken; you are mistaken;" and Mr. Levy, who was rather behind, said loudly, "No, no, it is not true"—MR. Arnoldi said, "Yes, you have said it;" then the rehearsal was at an end, and every one departed—in an hour after I called on Mr. Jarratt, at the theatre, with Mr. Penini, and made him say that after Saturday we should not sing, and they were to place on the bills, that Saturday was the last night we would sing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of these conversations, was Sloman's name mentioned at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the Mr. Levy I have named is the same that has been examined here to—day—he said he was the solicitor of Mr. Jarratt, and he offered his services to me, and while I was in the lock-up house, on the Sunday, Mr. Jarratt came with Mr. Levy, and offered to arrange the affair.</p>

Sloman sought me; I never sought Mr. Sloman—when he came to me to draw the affidavit, I was not aware what the contents of the affidavit were to be until he told me—I did not suggest to him the fact that Madame Caradori had informed him that they were going away; that was no suggestion of mine—I was in the theatre on the Friday night, and Mr. Sloman came up to me and said he wanted to speak to me about Madame Caradori; he was afraid that he could not get paid, and therefore he intended to proceed against them—I said, "Come down to my office to—morrow and tell me, because I can do nothing now, and then I will speak to you upon the subject"—he asked me where he was to come, and I gave him my address; he came down on the following morning; he then told me the nature of his claim—I asked him how much it was; he went out of my office to get the amount, and brought it back upon a card—he told me that Madame Caradori was going away, and that I should arrest her—I said, "When?" and he said, "On Thursday she told me they were going away, and I shall lock them up," and Madame Caradori having told me the same, I believed it was the truth, she having told me in that week that she intended to leave the theatre and go abroad, I thought it was true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I am to understand that you did not tell Sloman first, but that Sloman came and told you first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; I never told Sloman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time that you have made any such statement as this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was only examined in chief at the police court; I was not cross-examined—when Sloman came to me about the matter, I said that under the circumstances, having seen Madame Caradori, and also having been about matters connected with the theatre, and being Mr. Jarratt's attorney, I would rather not have anything to do with it—he said, "Well, then, I must get some one; do you know any one?" and I said, "Yes, Mr. Lewis will do it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Sloman appear perfectly to comprehend what he was swearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should imagine so; I read the affidavit over to him, and he had it himself; I left it with him to sign while I went into the inner room for about three minutes—I read the affidavit over after I had drawn it for him—I certainly did not draw it from my own imagination, but from what he told me—he did not dictate the words to me, but he told me that she told him she was going away, and I drew the affidavit accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he also tell you that Signor Pavesi had told him he was going away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: he told me that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> said they were going away.</p>

               <p>upon the occasion when the affidavit was sworn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not accom<lb></lb>pany him; I went over to the Judges' Chambers, and he came on after me—I did not tell him to follow me—I told him to go to the Judges' Cham<lb></lb>bers himself, and Mr. Lewis would bring him over to swear the affidavit—mine were not the hands to hand the affidavit to the Judge's clerk; I will swear that.</p>

Leader and Cox, who had threatened proceed<lb></lb>ings against them in consequence of their not carrying out an arrangement that Mr. Jarratt had made with them—they asked me to see them, and say that in consequence of Mr. Jarratt's insolvency, their arrangement with him must fall to the ground, and they had nothing to do with it, it was their theatre—I went, and saw Messrs. Leader and Cox—I came into the theatre, and then Madame Caradori called me to know whether I had seen them—she said she would not be annoyed—she said, "If they intend to annoy me, I shall go from the theatre entirely"—I said, "It would be very unfair for you to go from the theatre"—then she went away—this was on the Friday—Signor Pavesi was behind with Mr. Arnoldi—in the green room after<lb></lb>wards, Monsieur Pavesi also asked me whether I had seen Messrs. Leader and Cox, and showed me a letter that he had received from Mr. Smith, and asked me what answer he should give to it—then they said they were going away—I said, "I have conveyed Madame Caradori's message to Mr. Oswald, and some of the chorus have been up stairs; and said, it is very hard you have got them to fall into an engagement for eighteen nights to sing, and now you are going away"—I was not in Court all the time Signor Pavesi was giving his evidence—I certainly did not threaten to arrest Monsieur Pavesi, on the part of the chorus—I said I had heard in the theatre that he was going to be arrested, and I said he had better stay the time out, but I never threatened him—when he called me on the stage and asked me, I said, "Certainly not, I never told you anything about the chorus; I merely said they complained that it was very hard after having made an arrange<lb></lb>ment with you for eighteen nights, you have broken the contract"—the contract was in writing.</p>

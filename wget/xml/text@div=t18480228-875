                  </hi> I live at Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. Two years ago the prisoner was my housekeeper ten months before I married her; she repre<lb></lb>sented herself as a single woman—we were married at St. Martin's Church—she afterwards said she had been divorced from her husband; and at another time that he had been dead four years—she began to drink a good deal, and we parted, about three weeks after which she was living in the next street, and I saw her goings on, which led me to inquire and have her apprehended.</p>

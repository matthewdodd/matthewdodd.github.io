                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Dethick, he keeps the Sun and Punchbowl public-house, Long-lane, Smithfield. I was in the bar on the 29th of August, a little after eleven o'clock at night—I saw the prisoners come in—Harrison asked for half a quartern of gin—I served him—he laid down on the counter a crown-piece—I saw it was bad immediately—I occupied their attention, and sent for my husband, who was up-stairs—he came down, and I gave him the crown-piece—the gin stood on the counter five minutes, while they thought I was going to give change, and Day said to</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of Ann Dethick. I was up stairs in my house on the 29th of August—I was called down, and found the prisoners at the bar—I got a five shilling piece from my wife—it was bad in my judgment—I took and collared the prisoners, dragged them into the box, and told them I wanted them—I said they were come before the fair—I sent for the watchman, and took them to the watchhouse—I gave the crown to Mr. Matthews, the constable of the night.</p>

                  </hi>. I was constable of the night. The prisoners were brought by Watts, charged with having offered this bad crown-piece—De thick <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down the piece and asked what I thought of it—I asked who passed it, and Harrison said it was him—Day said he was innocent of it, and threw down a good shilling and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "I must search you" they both said, "You may search and welcome"—Harrison had an apron on—I told him to untie it, which he did—as he did so, he passed his right hand behind him, while I put my hand into his rightband waistcoat pocket—Day was close behind him, and after Harrison put his hand behind him, Day went back towards the seat, and then came up again, unbuttoned his coat, and said I might search him—I found nothing on Harrison nor on Day but the shilling and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the crown-piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harrison</hi>. When he was searching me Day was full six feet from me—there were four or five watchmen present. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was only one watchman, who brought him in—no one was assisting me at all—the publican was just at the door—he did not come near you—the watchman was on the left hand side of the door—they went out and consulted together, and left the prisoners there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did consult, but I did not go out—Mr. Dethick went out, but I and the watchhouse keeper remained there, and Watts and two others, I believe—there were four or five persons—Mr. Dethick felt some hesitation about pressing the charge against Day.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty at the watch-house. I saw Harrison brought in by Watts, and saw Matthews search him—when he was being searched, Matthews ordered him to untie his apron, which he did, and put his right hand behind him, and Day was standing close to him—after Day stood close to him, he fell back to the seat and sat down—he then came back again immediately, and said, "You may search me and welcome"—they were then taken to the Computer—I picked up a five shilling piece close to where Day sat on the seat, and another where his feet were, wrapped up in a bit of paper—Harrison was at the table—I have the money—from the time the prisoners had been taken out, till the time I found the two counterfeit crowns, there had been no other person in the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you tell me who was there when Harrison's apron was untied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was Watts, the watchman, and Matthews Mr. Dethick and his waiter, and Mr. Strays, who keeps a beer-shop—the watch-house is very small, not much larger than that table—the seat lies along by the window—it might be ten or a dozen yards from the door—they had been there five or six minutes before this took place—the prisoners had not been in the same place all the time—Harrison stood up, and Day sat down.</p>

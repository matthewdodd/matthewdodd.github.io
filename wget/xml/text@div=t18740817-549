                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Saturday morning, 18th July, a little before 8 o'clock, I was with another officer named Roper, and saw Roberts, Shipgood, and Collins leaving Mr. Wiggins' premises in the Goswell Road they went to Messrs. Price and Co.'s premises in Upper Thames Street—I there saw Hasell—he had one of the Charity School boys in uniform minding a one-horse van—I saw him get out of the van and go into Messrs. Price's yard and speak to Roberts—Roberts looked up and down Thames Street, and then Shipgood came out and looked up and down, and he was joined by Collins—they had a conversation for about twenty minutes, and then Hasell got on his van and drove away—that was all I saw on. That day—on the morning of the 25th I saw the first three prisoners leaving Wiggins' yard—they had five horses between the three of them and three sacks of provender—they went to Price's yard in Upper Thames Street—it was about 7.45—a little after 8 o'clock I saw Hasell senior and Hasell junior, the prisoner, come in a van—they stopped just round the kerb from Messrs. Price's premises, out of sight of the premises—Hasell senior remained in the van and the prisoner Hasell got out—he went up to Roberts, Ship<lb></lb>good, and Collins—they took a portion of the provender out of each bag and put it in that larger one and gave it to Hasell, who took it outside and threw it in his van—Collins, Shipgood, and Hasell had some conversation, and Roberts remained against the wheel, then they went down the yard again and this other sack was given to Hasell from the van just as it had been brought out of Wiggins' yard, and Hasell put it in his van—I then followed the van away a little distance, and then Hasell called to Roberts and stopped his van—Roberts left Shipgood and Collins and went up to Hasell, and I saw him pass some money to Roberts—I could see it was silver, but what it was I could not tell—I followed the van as for as Bridge Street and got the assistance of officers and took the two Hasells into custody—the elder Hasell was discharged by the Lord Mayor—I told them I was a City detective officer, and I said "I shall take you in custody for</p>

               <p>being concerned in stealing two sacks of provender, the property of Messrs. Wiggins, and also with receiving the same"—the prisoner Hasell began to cry, and said "I am very sorry, I should not have done it only the others told me they bad got a little stuff and asked me to buy it"—I afterwards took Roberts and Shipgood into custody—they said they knew nothing about it and they had not seen Hasell that morning—there was no provender in Roberts' van at that time at all—he gave the whole of his as he brought it out of Price's yard—Roper took Collins—I searched the lodgings of all the men—I found four or five camphine cans and a gallon tin at Roberts' lodging—they were all empty.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Chattam: On the 1st of December I burnt to the amount of ten bundles of Cork; the prisoners came there after I had began burning it; after I had burned five bundles, both the prisoners were at work sweeping; the next five bundles were then burnt and swept; the two prisoners took a part of these five bundles from the burning-ground to a warehouse of Mr. Donothy's; I cannot say which of them did it, it was at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both together? - A. Yes; it was heaved out of the ground into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the workmen ever put it out of the yard to tie it up in bundles? - A. Frequently; it is sometimes bound up in the burning-ground, and it is sometimes carried out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is Mr. Donothy's warehouse adjoining the burning-ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This burning-ground is common to several warehouses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known cork after it has been swept carried by mistake into wrong warehouses? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What enables you to say it was one of these two prisons? - A. Because I saw the warehouse door open, and my master's property going in; I cannot swear to either of them, but there was nobody else about there.</p>
               <p>- DONOTHY sworn. - I live at No. 30, Cow-lane, West Smithfield; my burning-ground is in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell, near the Skin-market; I know the prisoners very well; I never saw the boy many times; they never brought me any cork.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend any key to them? - A. Yes, I lent a key to Griggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he apply to you for it? - A. No, I gave it him, and Mr. Walker called upon me the day before, and asked me to let him have a sack of shavings, and he said he would send Griggs for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110049"></xptr>them; he did not send him, but I saw Griggs in the morning, and I told him to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any cork in your warehouse? - A. Yes, I have cork of my own there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of Mr. Chattam's cork there? - A. No, not to my knowledge; I was not at home from nine in the morning till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Martin.) Did you find any cork in Mr. Donothy's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose cork was it? - A. My master's; it had not gone through my hand above an hour, it was quite warm; there was one very remarkable sheet of cork, you would not find such a one in twenty tons, that I took particular notice of; there were twenty-five sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss so many sheets? - A. Not till I saw it carried away; I examined that piece after it came out of Mr. Donothy's warehouse, and knew it again immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (To Chattam.) Q. Did you see the cork that was produced from Mr. Donothy's premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your cork? - A. I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for cork to get by mistake out of your premises into Mr. Donothy's? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Griggs's defence. It was an uncommon dark night; I was putting baskets of dust into Mr. Donothy's warehouse, and Mr. Chattam's foreman might suppose I was taking in cork, but I was obliged to have one hand to feel my way with the dust; I never took any cork in at all, and the cork that Mr. Martin made me take away from Mr. Donothy's warehouse was Mr. Donothy's own.</p>

               <p>Eady's defence. I took in two baskets of dust belonging to my master, I took no cork in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Griggs called three, and Eady one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>
               <p>Donothy. I went the next morning to Mr. Chattam's, and told him the cork in that warehouse was mine; I left from twelve to fourteen sheets in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your's warm? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any mark upon your cork? - A. No.</p>

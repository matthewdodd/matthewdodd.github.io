I said, "Good man, keep yourself to yourself;" I said that to him three or four times, and I thought he was gone, but he stood on the top step of the house till I came out, and then he said, "Come along, Richard;" I went on to a gateway at the top of <placeName id="t18320705-136-crimeloc725">Union-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean you gave him into custody on the Sunday morning? A. Yes, I did; I said to the landlord, "There is John McCarthy;" he said, "Don't make a bother, go and get a Policeman," which I did - I had been robbed about fifty yards from the same public-house - I did not call Police! at that time; I never said to any person that all the money I had was 4d., which I wanted for some gin - a man named Morris, and a boy attended for the prisoner at the office; I had not been talking to any woman on the Saturday night.</p>

            . On the Sunday morning the prosecutor came to me, and said he had been robbed, and he described the prisoner - I went with him to the public-house; he pointed out the prisoner leaning on the table, asleep - I awoke him and told him the charge; he refused to go with me, and as it is a very bad neighbourhood, I sent for assistance, and took him; we got him to Kirby-street, where he got away, but we took him again; he resisted very violently - we were obliged to tie his hands and feet to get him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sitting in the house at six o'clock in the evening, when the prosecutor came in - he knew me well, and had drank in my company; he said he came to get change - he went out, and came in again; he then said he had to meet a friend he had borrowed a few shillings of, and he would be back directly - he told me to wait till he came; I stopped till my father came in, and then I went away with him - I went to the same house again the next morning, and I should not have done so if I had robbed the man so near to it; when he accused me of it, I said I would wait till the officer came -I refused to go because I knew I was innocent.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Bloomfield, a carman. On the night in question I saw the prosecutor about nine o'clock, at the corner of Field-lane, talking to two loose girls; I saw him at the public-house between nine and ten o'clock, and he called for a pot of beer; a man came in, and asked him for 2s., which he owed him, and he said he had only got 4d., so help him God - he was then half drunk; I saw him carried out by two men into Union-court, about eleven o'clock, and when they left him, he fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many pots of beer had he? A. He drank one in my presence, and the man who came and spoke to him paid for a quartern of gin - I had seen that man once before; the prisoner was not there from nine o'clock till a quarter before twelve, at which time I left - he was not there at all, nor did he drink with the prosecutor while I was there; if he had been there I must have seen him - I had not left the house when the prosecutor was carried out; I lodge in that house, and have done so for fourteen months.</p>

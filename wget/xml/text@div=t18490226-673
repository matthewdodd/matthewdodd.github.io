                  </hi> I am a lath-render, of Fitzroy-row, St. Pancras; the prisoner worked in the same shop. On the Tuesday before I went before the Magistrate, about ten o'clock at night, we were at work—the prisoner, who stood alongside of me, asked how I was getting on—I said, "Very bad; I have broken my saw"—he said, "It's a b—y good job if you had broken your b—y head"—I asked," Why?"—he said, "Because you are a <hi rend="italic">snob"</hi>—I said, "There are more <hi rend="italic">snobs</hi> than one"—he came, and <hi rend="italic">pitched into</hi> me right and left, with his fists, four or five times—I had done nothing to him—he had been drinking a little; I had not—I threw a small piece of wood, which I had been chopping, at him—he picked up my axe, which had fallen from the block in the scuffle, and hit me a tremendous blow on the back of the head with it; I bled tremendously—he was put out the front way by Thomas Ring, and I and two mates went out the other way—in about two minutes I saw the prisoner and another man coming; he said, "I want you"—I ran in-doors—Ring took the axe from him—I ran up-stairs, and he burst the door open after me—I went to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lath-render. On 2d Feb. I was cutting wood—the prisoner spoke to Drake; a few words passed which I did not hear—Bryan rushed at him, and hit him in a dreadful manner with his fist, kicked him several times, and got a lump of wood and hit him on the back—Drake threw a little bit of wood at Bryan, and made his nose bleed—the axe stood on the side of the block, Bryan took it up, and hit him once on the head, and once on the back, with the back of it—he bled.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop at Islington. On the 31st of July, I was going home—as I was near home I saw Adams stooping down to my area—I crossed the street, and then saw him stoop down several times—at last he got a 4lb. loaf out of the area—I suppose some one gave it him, as he could not reach—it from the ground—I then saw a parcel in a handkerchief come up in the same way out of the area—he then put them on his left arm, and went across the road—I went to him, and said, I thought he had some of my property—he said he had not, he got it at the West end of the town—I took him back to the shop—I then opened the parcel, and found it contained two 2lbs. loaves, which belonged to me, and so did the other loaf which he had—I had gone out that evening about seven o'clock, and the loaves were then in my bread-bin in the shop—I had left my servant-girl at home—when I got back she was there—I sent her for a policeman—I then called Frazer, who was my man, up from the bake house—I told him there was a person outside wanted him—he came up, and said, "Who wants me?"—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> said, "That person at the door"—that was the policeman—I gave him into custody—Frazer was rather in liquor—there was a Miss Brown, a lodger, in my house.</p>

I am the prosecutor's servant—my master and mistress were out on Sunday evening the 31st of July—I was left in charge of the house—there was no one there but me, and Miss Brown in the first-floor—a customer came for bread after my master was gone out—I served it from the bin—there were then 2lbs. and 41bs. loaves in the bin—I do not know How many, perhaps half a dozen of each—Frazer worked for my—master—I let him in that evening about nine o'clock to his work—he</p>

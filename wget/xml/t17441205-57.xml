            . I lost my watch in the prisoner's room; I was with Rowling Brown and the prisoner. - I think I had it when I went into the room; I missed my watch in the room, and told Rowling Brown directly that he had it; he produced it in October last. - I took the prisoner to be a very honest man both before and since.</p>

            . On the 17th of October, Rowling Brown brought a watch to me, and pawned it for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Brown. On the 7th of June, Meakins helped me home with some cloaths which I had made for the company: he was very drunk, and said himself down; I took hold of the ribbon of his watch, and pulled it out; Doe desired I would not keep it; I said he was drunk, and I would keep it, he should never have it any more: I put it into a tub of flour. Meakins enquired for his watch, and Doe and I said we did not know any thing of it, I pawned it for a guinea, (it came in very good time, for my wife lay in) and gave the prisoner ten shillings. I was taken up for it, and was obliged to give my information against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. So you would hang the prisoner for your stealing the watch, and giving him ten shillings?</p>
               <p>Brown. I would not have him hanged; I only speak the truth, for indeed I took it.<rs id="t17441205-57-verdict364" type="verdictDescription">

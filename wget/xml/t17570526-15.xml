               <p>A. Yes, the prisoner came to my shop and said, I have bought a sack of coals for a particular acquaintance, and he don't want them at present; and said if you will have them you shall have them for the same price that he was to give for them. I said what is that, he said three shillings. I thought they were honestly come by, and I gave him the same price that I give to other people.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whose coals they were?</p>
               <p>A. He did not tell me.</p>

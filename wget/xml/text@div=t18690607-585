                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 16, Alfred Road, Kings-land—on 8th April, about 9.30 in the evening, I looked my bedroom door, leaving everything safe, took the key with me down into the bar, and kept it there—at 1.30 in the morning, on going to bed, I found the bedroom window wide open; I had left it closed but not fastened; and a chair was placed against the door, inside, to prevent anyone coming in—a box had been forced open, and about 501. in gold taken, a gold watch, two silver I. ladles, and three gold studs—I have frequently seen the prisoners at my house, in front of my bar—I saw Jennings there on the night of the robbery—he was in the passage of the house—there is a bagatelle room on the same floor as my bedroom, and about 16ft. from it.</p>

I live with Mr. Mackey, who is my father-in-law—I have repeatedly seen the prisoners at his house—I saw them both there on the night of the robbery—I saw Jennings at one end of the bar nearest the stairs, and Clifford in the place where he usually came to, quite the other side of the compartment—I did not see either of them near the baga<lb></lb>telle room that night; the night before I had seen Clifford go towards it, and he was absent about a half or three-quarters of an hour—I did not see Jennings while Clifford was absent.</p>

                  </hi>. I was potman to Mr. Mackey—on the night of the robbery, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw Jennings near the bed-room door—I said, "What will you take, sir?"—he seemed confused and said, "Oh, bring me a glass of bitter ale"—I got it for him, and when I took it up he was in the bagatelle-room—I said, "Do you want a game of bagatelle?"—he said, "Yes, but you are too good for me; I am waiting for a friend"—I left him there—I did not see him go out—I have seen Jennings in the house before, but not Clifford.</p>

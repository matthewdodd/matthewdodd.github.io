             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you act as guard to the Bristol mail coach, on the 2d of October? - I did. I went from London on the 2d, to Bristol, with the coach; I went from London the whole way on that occasion, that is unusual; it is my department only to come from Bristol to Marlborough.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been in London on the business of your own, and took that opportunity of returning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return with the coach from Bristol on the 3d? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the mail of Mr. Free, to bring to London? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as far as you could observe in the usual state? - I see the Bristol bag sealed, and put into a large sack, and the sack tied, not sealed; I brought it to the Bush tavern door, and and there it was handed up to me, and I put it into the corner of the box, the box under the guard's seat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you come with the mail? - From Bristol to Marlborough.</p>
               <p>Q. And then another guard supplied your place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar. - That is the person that went out of London on the 2d; he went outside as far as the top of Speen-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go the whole journey to Bristol? - Yes, but one part he went outside.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had arrived in Bristol, when did you see him next? - I did not see him till after I went into a room in the Bush tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return with the coach on the third? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the coach, which went from London on the second arrive at Bristol? - It arrived at Bristol about twelve at noon, on the third; it set out in return at four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did the prisoner leave Bristol on the return of the coach? - On the coach box with the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue there the whole of your part of the journey to Marlborough? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he change? - A little of this side of Calne; he got first of all on the roof, and said he was very much tired, and I told him I did not care if herid three or four miles in my place; he got over into my place then, and I went on the box along with the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the prisoner ride in your seat? - About four miles and three quarters, as near as I can guess; we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160119"></xptr>to a place called Backington, about six miles from Marlborough; I told him then I must have my own situation, he went over the roof on to the box again, and continued so to Marlborough.</p>
               <p>Q. You got into your seat then, and at Marlborough there you delivered up your charge to

            ? - I quitted the coach there, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the box at this time? - The box is not locked, it is fastened by an iron, that you shift upon it, a staple, that comes for a padlock to go through it, but it was not then locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the box locked when you stopped at Calne? - No, it was not; it was locked while I was gone to the Post office, at Bath, no other place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any persons about the coach might have got to the box at Calne? - No, I was not away two minutes, I am sure at the farthest; I jumps off when I comes to the office, and hands the bags out, and takes them to the post-master, and brings the rest and puts them in, and goes on again.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time you necessarily leave the place? - It cannot be two minutes, because I jumps off as the coach goes along.</p>
               <p>Q. The coach does not stop any where between Bath and Calne? - Yes, it does, at Chippenham, to change horses.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was unlocked at Chippenham? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the coach travels while it is on the road, eight and ten miles an hour? - About nine miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it not be a dangerous thing for any person to attempt the getting out this bag while the coach is moving so rapidly? - Not at all dangerous to me, for I have done it many times.</p>
               <p>Court. While the coach is going on you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. To a person not accustomed to shift the bags, as you are, it must be a dangerous thing? - A thin person may do it better than a person that is bulky.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether in your opinion, it would not be a dangerous thing to a person not accustomed to it? - Not so very pleasant to a person not used to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered this to him as an easier place to ride in, he being satigued, going all night, and coming back again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence of his taking this place, was not from his asking you, but your offering to let him have the place? - it was; he said he was so tired, he did not know what he should do; he got on the roof of the coach, and it was not possible for any body to ride there, sleepy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take the charge of this Williams? - I did, on the 3d of October last, at Marlborough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner ride when he set out at Marlborough? - On the box, with the coachman; he rode in that situation about half a mile; he then left the box, and got on the roof of the coach; and as we are not accustomed to let any one ride there, we exchanged stations, he got into my seat.</p>


               <p>Q. While the coachman was going on? - No, we always stop at the top of the hill, to give the horses a little wind, and then we changed places; we rode in that situation about twenty miles, till we came near to Thachum, there we exchanged situations again, he went on the box, and I took my seat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue so? - Till we got to Reading; I then told him he might ride a few miles in my situation again; he rode in my situation to Hare Hatch, about seven miles; I there told him he must go again on the coach box; about a hundred yards from Hare Hatch, the coachman and I exchanged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160120"></xptr>situations, and continued so to Colnbrooke.</p>
               <p>Q. You drove? - Yes; Mr. Thomas was then on the box with me. At Colnbrooke I got into the guard's situation again, and rode to London; Mr. Thomas rode all that way on the coach box; he got down at Hyde Park Corner.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him afterwards? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your coach stops at the Gloucester Coffee house, I believe? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you convey the mail from Gloucester Coffee house to Lombard-street? - I did; I brought it in a cart provided for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as depended on you; was it in the same state as when you received it at Marlborough? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain that Mr. Thomas, the prisoner at the bar, was the man that you saw there? - I have no doubt about it at all, I told him in the course of the Journey I had the pleasure of seeing his face often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There can be no doubt that Mr. Thomas was the person. I believe the prisoner was considerably. I satigued, and for that reason you offered him your place, I believe in point of fact he had very near fell off the roof? - He appeared to be going to sleep and in danger of falling.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you offered him your seat not only once but twice? - Yes; once at Reading and once at Marlborough.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Hare Hatch, then the coachman took your place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner came all the way from there to London on the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the coachman came fifteen miles in the guards situation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the coachman here? - I have not seen him in court, I believe he is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. To Scott. Where did you get these Bank notes that you delivered in? - The principal part of them I received through the channel of the Bank; I believe all that have been produced at this time in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160122"></xptr>consequence of their having been stopped on the 8th of October, they were brought to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you apprized that such notes ought to have arrived? - In the course of business we ought to have received the letter on the 4th, on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you learn that such letter had been sent that you did not acknowledge? - We suspected it on Monday, their letter written on Monday referred to one written on the third.</p>
               <p>Q. The Bank notes have they ever passed through your house? - One of them has, the one that Mr. Barnes paid to our house.</p>
               <p>-PARKIN sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner apprehended? - On Thursday the 9th of October, in consequence of information being given to the Post office. I went to the prisoner's house, in Denmark-street, St. Giles's, on the 9th, and told him of the circumstance of a Bank note having been traced to his hands; and I asked him where he received it? he said, that a person, a stranger to him, who made use of the name of a Mr. Wayman, came in his name and asked for change for the note, which he gave him; that the same person came again in a few minutes, and asked change for another note, which he gave him; that he returned a third time with other notes and made the like request; that he came a fourth and fifth; and, I think, he said a sixth time, on the same evening with the same request, that he gave him cash to the amount of one hundred pounds or upwards he believed; I thought it my duty to order him to be taken to the Public Office in Bow-street, and he was there taken on Thursday the 9th; and he was there examined before Mr. Addington; and at Mr. Addington's request, I took down in writing what he said; this is the original minutes that I have in my hand. After it was taken it was read to the prisoner, either by myself in Mr. Addington's presence, or by Mr. Addington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any objection to any of the facts stated as to the accuracy of them? - To no part of them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you appear again before the magistrate? - In the evening of that day. Mr. Addington then said that he should read it over to him, and desired if it needed any alteration or correction, that he would mention it as he read it. After Mr. Addington had read about six or seven lines of it, the prisoner stopped him, and said that that part of it was not true, for that he had not been at Croydon Fair as mentioned in the examination, but had been at Bristol, on which Mr. Addington said he should not further proceed in reading the examination.</p>

             sworn. - I am a jobbing man, and live at Walworth; I had a dark brown horse, which I used with my cart, worth about four pounds ten shillings; I turned him into Lock's-fields, on the 16th of July, at night, and I missed him the next morning at five o'clock; I found him again the same day in Whitechapel, in the possession of Mr. Griffiths; I am positive it was my horse; the prisoner had worked with me for a week.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday the 17th of July, about six o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, leaning upon a post by a horse-boiler's door, the horse was at a little distance from him, tied to a post; it was a dark brown horse, which Leake afterwards claimed; I took him into custody, and asked him whose horse it was; he said it was his, that he had bought it at Smithfield, and given three pounds ten shillings for it, three or four weeks before; I then went up to the horse, and saw that his throat was cut, so that I could have put my arm into his belly; his breath came out, he was standing by the post bleeding; I asked him how the horse's throat came to be cut; he said, he went to fetch it to go to work, from Walworth, and found his throat cut, and that was his reason for wishing to sell it; the prosecutor took the horse to the boiler's; I afterwards ordered a man to bring it to the Flyinghorse, in Lambeth-street, close to the office, which he did; some time after that, I took the prisoner before the Magistrate, and he confessed it was all false that he had told me, and then he told me whose the horse was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here to prove this confession - did you see the Magistrate sign it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Whitechapel, I met with a young fellow who gave me some liquor, and I did not know what I was saying.</p>

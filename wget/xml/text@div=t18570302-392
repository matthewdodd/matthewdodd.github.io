               <p>Holborn. On 9th Feb. the prisoner came, and had a glass of ale—he gave me a sovereign; I gave him a new half sovereign in change, and three half crowns—he said, "I can pay for the ale in halfpence if you will give me the full change"—I gave him the full change, another half crown, and he then wanted change for the half sovereign—I had not change there—Mr. Britton came in, looked at the half sovereign, and said it was bad—that was not the half sovereign I had given to the prisoner.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in your master's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three months—we have many customers—I had been attending there the whole of that day—this was about 9 o'clock in the evening—my master had been serving that day—the money that was taken from the customers was all put into the same till—the gold is separate from the silver—there are two little bowls in the till, one for gold, one for silver—my master had not gone out five minutes before the prisoner came—there were two gentlemen in the house, who were there before the prisoner came in—they are customers of my master—they were in when my master came back, and heard what he said to the prisoner—I did not say, when my master came in, that the prisoner changed the half sovereign—those other gentlemen stood close to the prisoner—they are not here—I did not hear the prisoner ask that the police might be sent for; he did not ask to be searched—my master told the policeman to search him—I did not hear the prisoner say, "Search me"—I was not far from him—he might have said it, and I not heard it—a good many other people were in the bar when the policeman came in—my master spoke to the prisoner about <hi rend="italic">ringing the changes</hi>, and he said he had not done so, it was the same that I gave him—he did not say, "I am a respectable man; I will give you my name and address"—he wanted ten minutes to do that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, ten minutes to think of his name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said he lived at No. 15, Exeter-street—I did not hear him say he was a traveller—no one, besides my master and myself, had been serving customers—my master takes money out of the till at different times during the day—it might have been a quarter of an hour before this that my master had been to the till—he took out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—when he takes money in that way he does not give me any account—he puts the money into a glass case—he does not make any memorandum of it on a paper or slate—if he puts any money in he does not make any memorandum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Kent Hotel; I attend to the till and the money in it. I remember the prisoner being there—I had been to the till about five minutes before he was there—I noticed one half sove<lb></lb>reign in it, which was good—I left the 'bar for about five minutes—the last witness was to attend to it in my absence—when I returned I heard some talk about change—the last witness said the gentleman wanted smaller change for the half sovereign she had given him—I picked it up, and it struck me directly that it was bad—I can swear it was not the half sovereign which had been in my till just before—I told the prisoner he had been ringing the changes—he said that he had not—I told him unless he would give me his address I would give him in charge—he refused for some time, and wanted me to give him ten minutes to go out, and said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020033"></xptr>
               <p>that he would return and give me his address—I declined that—an officer came, and the prisoner gave his address, No. 15, Exeter-street, Strand, and his name, 0. Stauffer—I accommodated him with pen and ink, and he wrote it down—this is it—I have been there, and they know nothing of him, more than his calling there—it is a very low house in appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the persons know him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he required ten minutes to go away and bring his address back with him—I think I have made that statement before to day; to the policeman and the parties present—they were customers of mine—when the policeman was sent for, I said something about wishing the prisoner to be searched—the prisoner did not express his willingness to be searched—he did not say, "Search me"—the policeman said that he had not power to search him then—I went with him to the station—we had taken an average sum of money that day; a few pounds—I had taken money out of the till—I had not taken any gold out of the place where this was—I had not taken a half sovereign that day out of the till—I had not taken any gold out of the till; I had put in silver and gold; 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that—that was early in the evening—T had not taken any money out of the till for about an hour On two before I went out—I had gone to the till to give change—I had given change that evening for gold—I had to go and change a cheque, and the half sovereign that was in the till I had got in change—I gave the gentleman the rest of the gold—this half sovereign I had put into the till five or ten minutes before the prisoner came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the gentleman you took the cheque from in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I took the cheque and gave him the full change—the waiter was serving him—the change included the half sovereign—the gentleman paid for the refreshment to me and to the barmaid—he paid the half sovereign and a sovereign—the barmaid took the money up—the cheque was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">i.</hi>—the change was given to the prisoner out of the case and the till—the half sovereign was given to the prisoner from the case—we never keep gold in the till.</p>

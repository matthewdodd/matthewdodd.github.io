            . On Saturday morning, about half an hour after seven o'clock; I went out and was sent for home; when I came I found Sherlock in my shop; the girl told me he had been in the shop and a canister was missing; I carried him to a constable. As we were going to the round-house, he fell on his knees, and desired we would be merciful and he would tell the truth; he said it was the first fact he had been guilty of; so he took us to the house where he lodged, (I do not know the name of the street) and bid Fordham give us the canister; Fordham drew it out from under a chest of drawers, and gave it us.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Gyles's parish; the prosecutor brought Sherlock to my house, and gave me charge of him; he said he suspected he had stolen a canister of tea; the boy said he knew nothing of it: as we were going to the round-house, said he to me, I can tell you where it is: he took us to a house, and ordered us to stand back till he got into the house, and he would help us to it. It being a bad house I would not part from him, so I went in with him; there was Fordham sitting by the fire; Sherlock ordered Fordham to deliver it to me: then Fordham took it out from under a chest of drawers; when Fordham delivered it, he begged to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I told them Fordham had it, and carried them to the place where he was. I leave myself to your lordship's mercy.</p>
               <p>Fordham. I have nothing to say for myself.</p>

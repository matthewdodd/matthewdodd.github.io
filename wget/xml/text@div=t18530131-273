                  </hi>. My husband is a ginger beer maker, in Wardour-street On 15th Jan. the prisoner came there, and had a bottle of ginger beer—he gave me in payment a good shilling—I gave him a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—my attention was called by another customer, and when I looked towards the prisoner he said, "Mistress, I don't much like this sixpence"—I took it, and gave him another, not thinking he was ringing the changes"—I noticed the one he gave me back, and I marked it as soon as he left the shop; it was a bad one—on 22nd Jan., that day week, the prisoner came again for a penny bottle of ginger beer—he paid with a good shilling—I gave him a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I recollected the former transaction, and had been waiting for him all the week, and I noticed particularly that the sixpence was a good one that I gave him—he went as far as the door, and returned, and said he did not like the look of that sixpence—I took it out of his hand, and found it was bad—I called my husband out of the room, and gave it him—I charged the prisoner with ringing the changes, and told him he served me the same trick before—he said he was not in the shop—the policeman came and took him—I had put the first sixpence on a shelf, and had marked it—I was about to give the two sixpences to the officer; the prisoner snatched them both out of my hand, and threw them to his mouth—one of them fell on the floor; the other he swallowed—the one that I gave the officer is the second one that the prisoner passed.</p>

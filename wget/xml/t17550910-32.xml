               <p>Flint. It is about a month ago.</p>

               <p>Flint. It might be worth about three shillings, she was taken and brought back (it was the prisoner) he took a piece of ribband from her, but I could not sware to the identity of the ribband; he can give a better account of the matter .</p>

            . I live with Mr. Flint; as I was serving the prisoner, she was fond of taking the ribbands to the door to look at them. I had a suspicion she had taken a piece of ribband; I missed a piece, and told my master I was positive she had taken one; I followed her, and took her, bringing her back, she put her hand in her pocket, and went to slip something into her bosom. I took hold of it, and it was a piece of ribband.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your master's ribband?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by it?</p>
               <p>Peirce . She confessed to me, she took it out of our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you hear her confess it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think she did not deny it; but I was not particular in asking her, I left her to the other evidence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

            . On the 5th of November I was in Mr. Collins' employ as messenger. I gave the prisoner possession of the house, No. 77, Sun-street; the glazed window sashes, sliding shutters, lead weights, doors, locks, keys, the glazed and pannelled partition, cupboard doors, shelves, and every thing named in the indictment was safe; there were about twenty-four feet of service pipe fixed to the premises; in consequence of information, I went to the house last Saturday evening with Joel, and found the prisoner there; the articles enumerated were all gone; the partition appeared entirely torn down; I caused the prisoner to be taken into custody; he said if we would wait till Monday, he would replace the things he had taken away, mentioning the sashes particularly; there was nothing left inside the house, or outside, but the bare walls; I had been in the shop once while he was in possession - there was no appearance of business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said I would bring the things back on Monday. Witness. I am confident he said so; I am quite sure I heard him say so.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Long-alley. I made frequent application for admission to distrain for rent since the 2nd of April; on Saturday, Millist came, and said the door was open, as they were shutting up shop - I went there; the prisoner was there, and another person, shutting up - I found no property to distrain on; some of the windows were left, but nine had been removed - the articles stated in the indictment were deficient; I called Bostock's attention to the circumstance, and sent for Sapwell, the officer - I said to the prisoner"Do you know what you have been doing? you know you can be indicted for felony;" he said, "If you will let it stand over till Monday I will have them replaced, or brought back;" every door in the house, except one, was taken away - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked if I would replace the doors; I said of course, when I left I should leave the house in the same situation as I found it. Witness. The expression was if I would let the case stand over till Monday he would have them replaced, or brought back on Monday morning: the value of all the articles removed is 52l. 13s. 6d. as fixtures - it would cost 80l. to replace them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took this house at the halfquarter for the purpose of opening it in the blacking line, having been promised several orders; I did not succeed in doing any thing - I was in daily expectation of doing something, till within a month of Lady-day, when Mr. Collins' clerk called for the rent; I said I dare say in about six weeks I should be able to settle it - he called about a week after Lady-day; I said if he would draw a bill I should be able to honor it. and next day he served me with a copy of a writ: last Saturday the broker and Mr. Collins' clerks came to seize - I said I was not aware these things were gone, but as I had taken the house I should leave it as I had found it; he said if the things were not returned by Monday Mr. Collins would give me in charge for felony - I said I would return them, but did not say by Monday; I did not sleep in the house, but at my sister's - a man used to open and shut the shop, whether he took the things. I cannot say, but he told the officer he would appear on Monday, but did not.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning, just after eight o'clock, Stevenson came outside the shop; Baynham went out to him - they both came into the shop; Stevenson put his apron on the block, and Baynham put a bit of beef into it - they had been whispering outside the door - Stevenson took down a piece of pork, and put it by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180057"></xptr>side of his apron; I pushed it aside, and said he should not have one of them - he took and put it into his apron, and went out; the officer brought the same meat back to the shop, and then I told master.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning I stopped Stevenson in Northumberland-street, with a bundle; I asked what he had got there - he said meat: I asked how he came by it - he said the <rs id="t18300218-122-deflabel671" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

               <p>RICHARD ADAMS. Baynham was in my service. I never sell meat without weighing it; he gave me no account of this meat - Stevenson had lived with me for six weeks, three weeks before this; Baynham lived with me at that time - Stevenson knew the custom of my trade very well, and knew the other had no right to give him meat, or to take any away without paying for it - I cannot swear to the meat, but believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Baynham's Defence. I allowed master 3s. 6d. for it, which I thought the full price - I did not weight it, as he was a poor fellow out of place; the boy saw me put the money on the desk for it.</p>
               <p>Stevenson's Defence. He let me have the meat, and said he would pay master for it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. No money was put down for it.</p>

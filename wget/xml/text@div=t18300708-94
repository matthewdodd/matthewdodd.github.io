            . I am a chimney-sweep, and live in Pye-street, Westminster. I was in the House of Correction for dusting, which is taking ashes with the servants' leave - Riddle was also there: he was discharged before me - he asked me a few days before he went out, what I meant to do for a living when I got out; I said if I could not get a place I should take a basket on my head, and sell things about the streets, as my father and mother had been accustomed to do; I was locked up with him two or three nights, and had conversation with him - I said I should sell things in the streets; he said, "Oh, d-n it, I would not do that - I have been at work at two or three houses for Mr. Anderson, and know where to go and get plenty of money, if you choose to go with me;" he mentioned two or three houses - I took notice of Lord Roseberry's, but cannot recollect any other; he said he went there to take a cowl off the top of a chimney - that he went up stairs, and searched two or three rooms, and in one room in particular he pulled open a drawer, and found a lot of money, and that he only took half a crown, being fearful of being found out when he went home to his master's; he said he knew where there was plenty of silver and gold laying about down stairs in the still-room or pantry - there was plenty of plate, spoons, and other things, and would I go with him; I said, "No, I never did such a thing in my life, and won't do it now;" he said he went to work there the other morning with Kondering, and in the kitchen saw plenty of things which he could have brought away if he had liked; he went out on the Friday, and promised to come to the gate and meet me the day I came out; I told him I did not want him, for I should have somebody there to meet me - he said he knew how to get into Lord Roseberry's house, and knew his way about it - that the porter opened the door with a string and did not get out of his bed, which had a curtain round it; he said he was to go about half-past three o'clock in the morning, and the porter would open the door and let him in, if he said he came from Mr. Anderson, of North-row; I saw Kondering on the Saturday night after I came out, and told him what the prisoner told me.</p>

            . I was a serjeant of the Police in June, and apprehended Lucas, with four others, at the Victory public-house, Union-street - I apprehended Riddle afterwards, in Little James-street, Lisson-grove, concealed in a cellar; on the road to the watch-house, he asked me what I wanted him for - I said "For robbing Sir Watson Taylor;" he said that was bl-y George Moore had done that - he said, "I have done the work, and he is spending the money."(Opera-glass produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Riddle's Defence. It is all false what they have said; I was playing for a pint of beer, and lost it.</p>
               <p>Westwood's Defence. I bought the opera-glass for a pint of beer, of a young man in the Edgware-road - it laid on the table when Wall came in; I asked him to give me a pot for it - he said, "What is it, it is broken;" I said, No, it was unscrewed, but I did not know what it was or its value - I had no idea of its being stolen.</p>

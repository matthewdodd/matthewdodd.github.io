            . My husband's name is William. I have known the prisoner nine years, she lived with me twice. On Easter evening I trusted her with six guineas to get changed into silver, and told her if she could not get it all changed, some half guineas would do. I never saw her since till now.</p>

            . I am constable. On Monday last, about two or three o'clock, Mr. Vaughan brought me a warrant from my Lord-mayor, backed by Mr. Pen. We went into Swan-alley and found the prisoner, there he gave me charge of her. I asked her what she had done with the six guineas; she said she had made use of one. I asked her where were the rest; she took out some money in a paper from her breast, and delivered it to me; when it was opened there were a guinea and a half of it. She said she had but three farthings more, having purchased two shifts, two handkerchiefs and three aprons.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

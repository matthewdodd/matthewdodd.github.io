PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who is Mr. Wigram? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He lives at Forest-house, near Wanstead-flats—I do not know how long the pri<lb></lb>soner worked for him, but he was regularly there, and his father also—he did not work there till the day he was taken—I cannot say how long before, because I did not see him every day—he worked at raking leaves—he had been at Mr. Wigram's more than four months—I have known him ever since he was a boy—I do not know what he earned a week—I do not know that he had come in from Mr. Wigram's on Tuesday night—it was seven o'clock in the evening when I saw him with the money—I do not know wheather that was his usual time to come form work at Mr. Wigram's—it would most likely be about the time—in that part of the country people are dismissed by a week's warning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he was at work on Tuesday he would not be dismissed till the follow<lb></lb>ing Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I cannot say—if he was not a regular man k✗ would not know from day to day—the general rule is from week to week.</p>

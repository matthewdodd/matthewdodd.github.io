            . I am the prosecutor's wife, On the 27th of January, about five o'clock, the prisoner brought up the tea; I rang the bell in about twenty minutes, and she was missing. I knew nothing of her going away; I went up stairs soon after, and missed all the plate, and some frocks; inquiry was made for her, but she could not be found.</p>

            . I am a constable of Kingston. In consequence of information, on Monday the 28th of February, I went to Mrs. Shaw's house; I searched a bed in Mrs. Shaws presence, and found, sewed up in the bed, three different parcels; one bundle contained a feather, artificial flowers, and some frocks, and another all this plate which I produce.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLLINSON. Here is a silver gill, a cream ewer, two gravy and eight table spoons, and a variety of plate, which are my husband's; they were kept in a drawer in our bed room; I looked into that drawer and missed them when she was gone; we had used the spoons at dinner; I had seen most of the silver safe that day; I think I had seen all of it; the frocks and feathers, were in my daughter's room; the table spoons are worth 6 l.; I had seen the silver forks, cream over, and sugar tongs that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, written. I beg leave humbly to inform your Lordship, I never opened any drawer; and that I restored the plate as I took it; I had warning, and was to have left two days before this happened; I was not aware of the value of what I had taken; I did it with a desire to go home to Ireland, and hearing my brother was ill at Hull, I took the plate, having no means to get home without money.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINSON. I have inquired about her at Hampstead since she left, and heard a good character of her; she had lived there two months, and I understand behaved well; we took her without a character, as she was recommended by my porter.</p>

On the 11th of July I lost seven sovereigns and a sixpence from my breeches pocket, which was in the kitchen drawer; I saw it safe about a quarter past ten o'clock, and missed it about ten minutes before eleven. The prisoner was in the kitchen between ten and eleven; he went away, and did not return till he was taken, which was on the 23d.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. (The witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) The prisoner lodged at our house; I remember the last day he was there I was in kitchen, and I saw him there. In the morning after my father and mother went up stairs, a knock came to the door; I went up to open it, leaving him alone in the kitchen; I then went up to call my father; I was not gone more than five minutes; when I came down, the prisoner was standing up against the drawers, with his right hand in his pocket; there was only one chest of drawers in the room. He went out of the kitchen, and a few minutes after he passed my father, and went out at the street door. I locked the kitchen door, and took the key to my mother. Nobody had been in the kitchen but him. I saw my mother give my father the key; he went down to wash his hands, and ten minutes after I heard of the money being lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had nobody else been in the kitchen - A. No; my mother had the key; there are several lodgers.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; my daughter brought me the key; I gave it to my husband, and about five minutes after he came up to me and missed the money. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house when he was taken; he was neither threatened nor promised any thing. I asked him how he came to take the money - he said he did not know how it was, but he did do it - he had left the house about ten minutes before eleven o'clock.</p>

I laid down and fell asleep - I put my sovereign in my jacket pocket, which hung over a chair. She awoke me between ten and eleven o'clock, said she had been out, and asked me to go up stairs and have some supper. I went up and supped - came down and went to bed; and in the morning I missed my money, she was still with me. I charged her with it - she denied it - then said if she had taken it she had put it somewhere, and would find it in a short time. I met her an hour after, she said she had found it and would keep it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you intoxicated - A. No. I put the sovereign carefully in my jacket pocket - I did not put my jacket on to go up to supper - the door was locked and she had the key the while. I went out to drink with her in the morning.</p>

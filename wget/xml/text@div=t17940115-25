            Was she an acquaintance of your's before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your sister live? - In New Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make acquaintance with her there? - She enticed me from my sister-in-law's to go to her lodgings, between nine and ten at night; she lodges just a few doors above, at Ratcliff-Highway, near my sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to her lodgings? - Yes, between nine and ten, and we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you both undressed? - Yes. I had two guineas and a half in gold in a purse, and five penny-worth of halfpence, and three shillings in silver.</p>

            Where was this purse? - In my breeches left pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches, when you went to bed? - Under my head, and the three shillings was in my waistcoat pocket along with the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen this money before? - Just at going to bed. I counted the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to count the money to her? - Because my sister-in-law followed me to the door, and told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150069"></xptr>I should be robbed, if I slept with that girl all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you shewed her all this money before you went to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you shewed her how you kept it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you was quite sober after all this advice of your sister? How long had you been drinking that day? - I had not been drinking a great deal that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking all day? - No. I had the share of two or three pots in the evening, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your money that night? - I cannot justly say, I waked with cold, and she was gone. The clothes of the bed were turned down; my clothes were still abiding, they were there; I left the house in the morning at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. After you first awoke, what time might you get up? - I cannot say, at that time, I first awaked, the mistress of the house was up; I called, and she came with a lighted candle, and I asked her, if she knew, where the girl was? I believe she is not here. I missed my money then, she said, she did not know any thing about it; she told me, if I made any disturbance there, she would have me turned out of the house; and as I had paid for the bed, I might stay, if I would be peaceable; so I set myself down by the bed-side till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell before, that you had paid any money for the bed? - I had paid the girl half a crown that I slept with, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you got up? - I got up, and asked her what recompence I should have for it? she said, she did not know any thing about it; so I made the best of my way down towards the shipping, to look out for more bread; and I met a shipmate, and he advised me to go back, and get an officer; I went, and got an officer; and we went after the prisoner, and we found her off the Unicorn, that was a few doors above the lodgings, Ratcliff-Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. At what o'clock was it? - I believe, it might be between nine and ten the time of taking her.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then, did you find any money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any money? - No, never found any at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Catharine Johnson? - Here she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the house belong to? - To one Mrs. Turner, as I have heard, I don't know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>CATHARINE JOHNSON sworn.</p>
               <p>That girl robbed the prosecutor; the girl said herself, that she had robbed him; I went to her to the Lock-up-house, I said, how came you to rob my brother, who has a wife, and two or three children? she said, she did not pocket the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her, it would be better for her to confess? - I did not; the first thing I said, was, how came you to rob my brother? she said, that she did not pocket a farthing of the money, that Hannah got it; meaning I suppose, the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Hemson? - He married my sister-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, that you heard what the prisoner said at the Lock-up-house, because you are very deaf? - I am sure, that was what she said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said any such thing; when I was in the Lock-up-room, she came, and scratched me down the face, and abused me. I wish to know what fort of a house she keeps.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. What sort of a house do you keep? - I have but a single member, and I have been three months lately in Scarborough.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150070"></xptr>Q. Do you know the house where Hemson slept with this girl? - I know the house, it is in New Gravel-lane, not far from me; she says, Will Turner keeps it; he kept it, and he has let it to this Hannah for a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her, how long it is since her first husband and her son was hanged.</p>
               <p>I was in bed with that man, but I did not take a farthing from him.</p>

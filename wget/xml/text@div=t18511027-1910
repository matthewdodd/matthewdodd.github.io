                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 35). About half-past seven o'clock at night, on 19th Sept I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Seven Dials; in consequence of what was told me I went to Monmouth-court, where I found the prisoner Franklin was lying on the top of Hedges on the ground—I took him off, placed him on his feet, and asked him what he was doing—he said some one had upset him, and put him out of temper—I asked him if he would go quietly if I let him go; he said he would—he made towards the top of the court, and as he was going he struck a woman in the face who was coming down the court—the blow knocked her down to the ground, and I saw blood come from her face—directly I saw that, I took hold of him by the neck, and the woman said, "I will give charge of him for the assault"—I pushed him out of the court, which goes into Little Earl-street—he was quiet till I got him out of the court, and my brother officer, Aspinshaw, came and took him on the other side—we went about twenty yards when he put up his hand, and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me in the face—I could not tell what he struck me with—it was a blow, and I felt blood coming down my face—we went about six yards further, and he made a jump or two, and we all three came down on the ground—the prisoner got up first, and kept his hand cutting and</p>

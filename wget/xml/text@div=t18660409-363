I live in Clerkenwell—at the the time of this occurrence, I was a workman in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company—on Saturday, 10th February, I was on watch at their stables, Royal Mint-street, Whitechapel—I saw Guiver and Maskell come to the stables with two cartloads of straw—Guiver drove one cart; another man not here, drove the other—I saw Guiver and Maskell walking and talking together—when the carts arrived, Guiver unloaded them—the straw war received by Bott—Hollumby took it from Bott, and placed it on the right. side of the stables—I counted the trusses—thirty-eight trusses were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Seabright-street, Hackney-road, and am a watchman in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company—on 10th February I was in the watch at their stables—what I have here is extracts from a book I made at the time—I saw two carts arrive—I did not notice who drove them that morning, or see who received the straw—Maskell delivered it—60 trusses were taken off the first load, and 38 from the other—after the straw was delivered, Maskell went, and I followed him from the stables to the corner of Commercial-road, Whitechapel—no one accompanied him—he there met Bott—they both went into Webb's spirit vaults—I went in close behind them, and stood at the side of Bott—Maskell said, "We have had 46 to-day; it is all right, I have squared it with your mate—at the same time Maskell gave Booth some money—I could not see whether it was gold or silver—they then came out—Bott crossed over Whitechapel, and went into a tobacconist's shop, and when he came out he made his way towards the stables, towards Leman-street—I don't know where Maskell went—on 13th I was on the watch again, and saw a cart come—I saw 32 trusses delivered by Maskell, but did not see to whom—on 15th I saw 59 trusses delivered from the first load, and from the second 66, by Guiver, from James Maskall's cart—I can't say to whom they were delivered—Guiver delivered his own load, another man delivered his—on 17th, 40 trusses were delivered from the first load, and 41 from the second—I saw them delivered to Bott and Hollumby—Maskell accompanied the two carts—Guiver was there also—on 22d I saw a cart arrive with the name of Maskell on it—Guiver was driving it, and 62 trusses were delivered to Bott and Hollamby—on 24th I saw a cart arrive with "James Maskell, Rornford," on it—Guiver drove it—he was accompanied by Maskell—I saw 62 trusses delivered to Bott and Hollamby—on 27th I saw two carte arrive at the market, the first was driven by Maskell, the second by Guiver—I went from the market to the stables—I saw 45 trusses delivered from the first to Bott and Hollamby, and from the second 60—when they were delivered I followed the cart from the stables into Whitechapel—I saw it pulled up alongside another cart standing there loaded with straw—Maskell took 10 trusses off that cart, and put it on the empty cart—I saw the cart from which the 10 trusses had been taken driven to Royal Mint-street, and counted 60 trusses taken from it—after the straw was delivered, the four prisoners went into the beer-shop in Great Presoott-street—on 1st March I was on watch again—I saw a cart come, driven by Guiver, and 62 trusses were delivered to Bott and Hollumby—after he had delivered them, Guiver went into the beer-shop, and in the course of about two minutes Bott and Hollumby went in—I went in—Guiver paid</p>

I was not aware of it—I have never seen men, when the straw is being delivered at the stables, taking trusses from the carts—I was at the stables constantly—I don't know how many stable<lb></lb>men there are—there are about 100 horses—a great deal of straw is used—both Bott and Hollumby were there at times taking the straw, and sometimes Bott received it and gave it to Hollumby, and sometimes Hollumby gave it to Bott—I cannot speak positively as to whether what the last witness said is true or false as to Bott receiving it first, and Hollumby afterwards.</p>

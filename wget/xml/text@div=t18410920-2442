I have been married to him ten years—I do not live with him—we have been separated since last April—I have one child, nine years old, who lives with me, at No. 50, Limehouse Causeway. On Tuesday, the 7th of September, I was in Oak-lane, with the child, and saw the prisoner coming up the lane—I said, "Mary Ann, here is your father coming up the lane, go and kiss him,"</p>

Do you see her?" and endeavouring to excite him, knowing his attachment to the child; that being distracted at her having the child, knowing it would be taken to improper places, he went in search of her, and met her in Oak-lane, and in the struggle to get the child from her, what she had stated occurred. That he had not quitted her five minutes before he met the man she cohabited with, who used most aggravating terms, which convinced him he was still living with her; that they had a struggle, and the man escaped.

Dear Kingwell, I thought, by not appearing yesterday, it would have been much better for you. The police found me out, and took me before Mr. May, the inspector at Poplar, last night; and I was obliged to promise to attend on next Tues<lb></lb>day, otherwise I should have been detained until the time: and my dear Kingwell, if I do not attend, you will only be remanded until I do come forward. And after Tuesday, should you be sent for trial, deposed on it that I will raise the money, and get a counsellor for you, so that nothing shall be left undone for you; and I can vary in my statement, which will make it appear very black on my side. Do not screen me, but say my thing in your defence that will make it favourable to yourself. I hope my dear Kingwell, I hope you will endeavour to bear this trial with forti<lb></lb>tude; it is all for wise ends, depend on it; and it may be the means of making us happier than ever we have been. I wish you to write to your sister, and persuade her, if she is your friend, to hold her tongue, down</p>

If she had not abused me on Saturday last, I should not have appeared against you; but it was galling to be called and re-called, by one that I had been a friend to, when she could not help herself; and all because I would not deny that circumstance. Now will be the time to try your friends; you will soon know who are your friends and who are not. I should be most happy if I could find any friend that would do me justice, with regard of the lies that have been told, or even a brother, that would take my part like you do hers. My dear Kingwell, you cannot be blind; you certainly must know that it is spite; and when a husband once speaks disrespectful of his wife, all the world is at once her enemy; and is it possible that a sister is nearer than a wife? even if it was the case, that will not deter me from doing all that lays in my power, for you to get your freedom again. I hope you will destroy this, and write often to me at 50, Limehouse-causeway. I still remain, dear Kingwell, yours affectionately, E. <hi rend="smallCaps">KINGWELL</hi>."</p>

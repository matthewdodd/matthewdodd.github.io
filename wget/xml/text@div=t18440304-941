Be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock in the morning of the 28th of Feb., I saw the prisoner in the front part of the house—she asked for change of a sovereign—I only knew her by sight before—the change was given her by the bar-maid—she pulled out another sovereign, and asked for change, which the bar-maid refused.</p>

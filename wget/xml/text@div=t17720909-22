               <p>Q. Did any body come to Mr. Mitchel's shop in August last to buy a sword?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes; a person who called himself Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bargain with you for a sword?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Thursday the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Between four and five o'clock; he bargained for the sword for four guineas and a half, and said he would go to a coffee-house, and send the waiter for it; in giving him change I gave him a guinea too much; out of the change he was to give me four shillings, two of which he gave me; he tendered me a bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? ( shewing the witness the forged note.)</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes, it is; I gave him three guineas, two moidores and half a moidore; he gave me two shillings in the shop, and said he would send the other two by the waiter whom he should send for the sword; when he was gone, I counted it over again, and found I had given him a guinea too much.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any coffee-house then?</p>
               <p>Lunn. He said he would go to a coffee-house, and send the waiter; when the young man from the New York Coffee-house brought me the two shillings, I found my mistake; I gave him back my figures, and desired he would send me a guinea and two shillings; while he was gone for the change I sent the note to the next door, to know if it was good; they sent it to a banker's, and the answer was, I think rather suspicious;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090029"></xptr> at my request it was sent to the Bank; the Bank stopt it, and some of the gentlemen came to know whom I had taken it of; I gave the best account I could; they sent, but the man was gone from the coffee-house. He returned me the one pound three shillings; the sword never was delivered; the young man was to have had the sword at the time he gave me the one pound three shillings. I had sent to the Bank, and detained him till the messenger came back.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard this note was not a good one, did you ever see him any more?</p>
               <p>Lunn. No; the Saturday following one Mr. Williams came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the person is they called Mr. Johnson?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I never saw him before; he is not the person that came on the Saturday, that is the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Between seven and eight in the evening; he asked me if a Mr. Johnson had not bought a sword the Thursday before; I told him he had; he asked me if the note was good that I took of him; I told him it was not; he said Mr. Johnson had been imposed on by a horse dealer, who gave him two bank notes, one of which proved bad, and fearing mine might be so, he had sent me back five guineas and six-pence, that I might be no looser. I told him Mr. Mitchel was out and I had not the note; he seemed desirous of leaving the money, but I refused it, not having the note with me; he wished to leave the money, and I was to send the note on Monday to Mr. Williams, at

            's coffee-house; I refused the money, and said I would send it on Monday; then he made the offer to come himself on Monday at twelve o'clock; he went away. On Monday morning I went to the Bank to ask for the note; there was no-body of any consequence at the Bank then to give me an answer; I told them I should get the money at twelve o'clock for the note. Mr. Russel and Mr. Payne came over, and said they would send two proper persons to apprehend the man when he came; they sent the note; I was to give it the man and get my money; two proper men came over, but Mr. Williams did not come till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I believe about six or seven o'clock; he then asked me if I had got the bill; I asked him if I was to keep the silver hilted sword or the steel one, that Mr. Johnson had looked at; he said the steel one should be laid by for him. I then asked him for the five guineas and six-pence; he did not give it me till I produced the note; I gave him the note, and then he gave me the money; I gave him the note, and then the proper people the governor of the Bank had sent got hold of him; after that he gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Council. Describe the manner of his taking the note.</p>
               <p>Lunn. I cannot; when he came for the note the first time he seemed much flurried; he said he had run, and was out of breath. When the men laid hold of him, he enquired the reason of that treatment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the note at the time he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I don't know he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, and see whether you are certain by any mark upon it, whether that is the identical note he gave you?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes; here are the initials of my name upon it, which I wrote at my Lord Mayor's in the evening</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write your name upon it before you went to my Lord Mayor's?</p>

            . I am one of the cashiers of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this note first brought to you?</p>
               <p>Boult. On the 20th of August, about a quarter before five in the evening, it was brought to me for the money; the lad that handed it over, said he wanted the money for it. I having many of the banker's clerks round me, in a hurry took the note; at first sight it appeared to be a bank note; seeing Jackson's name, I went to write my name, in order that they should have the money; perceiving the ink sink I turned my eye to the Britannia, there I saw it blotted; I turned it up to the light to see if it was our paper, and I saw it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark in your paper?</p>
               <p>Boult. There is wrote Bank of England in the moulds, and that makes the impression in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You are satisfied that it is not a real bank note?</p>
               <p>Boult. Yes, I am certain of it; I then asked the person who produced it, who he brought it from.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not material.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that mark is not always in bank notes visible in the paper?</p>
               <p>Boult. Sometimes it is not so, when a note has been long worn in the pocket and is dirty; it is always so when we issue them.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes it is so feebly marked in the paper that it is very difficult to trace it at first?</p>
               <p>Boult. Yes; there are other marks besides that.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any instance of your issuing a bank note upon the paper of which these words are not legible?</p>
               <p>Boult. None at all; we never issue them without its being very plain.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Upon the whole I understood you to say, you are positive this is a fictitious note?</p>
               <p>Boult. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jackson. No, it is not.</p>

            , a cashier at the Bank that has any authority to sign notes.</p>
               <p>Jackson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is that a true bank note?</p>
               <p>Jackson. It is not a true bank note?</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell, whether upon the day that bears date, any note did issue from the Bank signed by you of the same sum and marks, payable to the same person?</p>
               <p>Jackson. There was upon the same day the same sum and signed by me; but I doubt whether there was to the same person: there are two ten pound notes the same day.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Have you any knowledge of issuing a bank note that day without collecting the knowledge from books.</p>
               <p>Jackson. It is impossible so many notes as we issue (refers to the book.) On 10th of February two ten pound notes issued, payable to

               <p>Court. Did not you as a cashier keep an account of what notes you signed that day?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; it is impossible we sign so many. No. 453.

               <p>Jackson. All to bearer in that book.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Then you have no means of knowing with certainty whither you signed these notes or no?</p>
               <p>Jackson. It is most certain I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been at his father's house when he has been there?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time to have seen him drawing, or using a pencil?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He was shading a face when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Drawing in Indian ink or what?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090031"></xptr>Clarke. It was black; he was using a hair pencil; he put it into his mouth several times.</p>

               <p>Q. You have seen many little boys at school do that have not you?</p>

               <p>Jackson. No, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard him acknowledge whether he could, or could not, draw in Indian ink?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I did hear him acknowledge he could before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. This is the case on the part of the prosecution; I am ready to say I don't think it a case sufficient to convict, at the same time it is a suspicious case, and fit to be brought before a jury.</p>

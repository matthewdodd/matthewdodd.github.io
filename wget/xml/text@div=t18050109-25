             sworn. - My husband's name is William; on Tuesday night, the 27th of last November, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going on an errand, through <placeName id="t18050109-25-crimeloc124">Brooke-street, Ratcliff-highway</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. No, he gave me a push upon some steps; he laid hold of my arm and set me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take? - A. A little box of tickets, a shilling, and a night-cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shilling? - A. In my pocket, he took them out all at once, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. No, I know him because I could see him by the lamps; I did not call for assistance, because there was nobody to call to, and I was frightened; there were duplicates of a pair of blankets, a gold wire to put over a ring, a silk handkerchief, a waistcoat, and a coloured apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Upon what errand were you going? - A. The person I went for was very ill, and I was going to the public-house for some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking some gin before? - A. No, I was not fuddled.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes, I had but one glass, and that could not fuddle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any beer that day? - A.Yes, about a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your husband? - A. At sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pawned any thing that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning? - A. None; the woman gave me the shilling to get something to drink; she is very bad, in Love-lane, and her husband is at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tumble down, instead of being pushed down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry any bottle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had the shilling in your hand to pay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the shilling was in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you never said you would not have prosecuted this man, if it had not been for Mr. Brown, who told you there was 40 l. reward? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said so to Mr. Duff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to the pawnbroker, that you lost the box, and it was not taken from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner the day after? - A. Yes, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not say you had never seen him before? - A. No, I never saw him before to speak to him; I said I had never spoke to him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you complain of this transaction? - A. I went to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown told you of the reward? - A. No, I never heard it till now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had the shilling and bottle in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090027"></xptr>Q. You first said it was in your pocket? - A. The box and cap were in my pocket, I made a mistake, the shilling was in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this was in Brooke-street; have you not said it was in another place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In your examination before the Justice, you said it was in Butcher-row? - A. It is close by, I take it to be all one.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say it was in Butcher-row? - A. I made a mistake.</p>

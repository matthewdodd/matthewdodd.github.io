                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon—on Tuesday night, 17th August, I was at a beer shop called the Cricketer's Arms—Mrs. Bradley was at the bar when I went in—Henry Bradley came in afterwards—their daughter Louisa Bradley was there—they were having ale there; Mrs. Bradley said to me, "Will you stand a pint?" I said, "I have no money;" she said that I was <hi rend="italic">scaley</hi>—I asked Mrs. Bray to lend me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for a pint; she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I called for a pint of ale and gave the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and paid for it—Mrs. Bradley poured it in the glasses—they drank it—she said I must stand another pint—I said I had no more money—I went in the tap-room and Mrs. Bradley came and sat down by my side—Mr. Bradley came in and sat down, and he fetched Louisa Bradley out, and he hit his daughter, and Mrs. Bradley said, "I will give you one!" and she hit her, and then they all came round, and I pulled Henry Bradley off of Martha Bray—and then Mrs. Bradley stabbed me in the arm—I saw something shining in her hand; she stabbed me nine times—there was blood came from my arm, and my arm dropped by my side—a man pulled me away, and I saw a policeman behind me—Mrs. Bradley gave Mr. Bradley something in his hand.</p>

My husband keeps a fish shop at 179, City Road—the prisoner came in on Wednesday, 26th June, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—he asked for a penny piece of fish—he tendered a bad half-crown—I turned round and told my husband, and the prisoner ran away and left his fish—he was followed and brought back—I gave the half-crown to the constable.</p>

My wife is Mr. Edward Brackett's cousin—he has for some time past been residing in the house of the defendant, for about three months, I think, or it may be a little more—I made an arrangement for placing Mr. Brackett with the defendant, by order of his father, at the request of his father, who is a very old gentleman, bordering on eighty—Mr. Brackett was at a cottage for some time, and I called in Dr. Kelly to visit him at the request of his father—he thought it necessary for him have some shower baths, which there was not convenience for at the cottage—I asked Dr. Kelly if he would take him—he said he would, not so much for profit, as because he thought he could do him good, and he received him into his house at three guineas per week—that was with the understanding that his servant was to go with him, a female servant, he had never been out of her custody—that was by his father's request—he would not allow him to go without, and Dr. Kelly was quite agreeable to it—he wished it—he said he would rather her to attend to him; being perfectly harmless and very quiet there was no occasion for any man at all he thought—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him—he is subject to delusion—he used to come to my house, and I have gone to Dr. Kelly's and dined with him, and found him very comfortable and quiet—sometimes he would talk about horses, but I never paid any attention to that; I used to turn it off directly to something else; and he used to talk about the Queen, that he fancied he was married to her; and about being a military man—at one time he had a man to take care of him; but when Doctor Kelly was called in, the man bad nothing to do; he was so harmless—the man only slept in</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Saul, a cabinet-maker. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 12th of April, I was in the Robin Hood and Little John public-house with some friends—I was talking to my sister-in-law, and found the prisoner's band in my pocket—I had a purse in my pocket, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, in half-crowns,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100043"></xptr>
               <p>shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny-pieces—I detained the prisoner's hand there as long as I could—it was not out of my pocket when I seized it, but by a deal of exertion he got his hand out, and part of my purse and money came out with it—I seized him, and held him as tight as I could—I called for assistance—I have sworn that 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was "your <hi rend="italic">majesty"</hi> talking to your sister-in-law at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I <hi rend="italic">were</hi>—my sister is not here—she did not see the prisoner pat his hand into my pocket—she does not wear spectacles, I believe—I have no explanation to give why she did not see this—it could not be dark at that hour of the night—there were candles—I am called Queen of Kensall-green—if I am called so, I answer to it—my sister is with her family I suppose, in the City—I saw her last on Easter Monday—I did not think it requisite to have her here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, your sister talking to yon, and he having his. hand in your pocket, how long did you hold his hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As long as I could, some two or three minutes—my sister saw the struggle, decidedly, but she did not see the hand in my pocket—I accused another man of re<lb></lb>ceiving the purse, not of stealing it—I do not know how many persons were in the tap-room all this time—I did not count them—I know of five persons being in the tap-room, at the time of the robbery, besides my sister—none of them are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray what were you doing in the tap-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Speaking to my sister—I was not obliged to go there to speak to her, but I chose it—I had drank there that night, I do not know how much—I drank ginger-beer and half-and-half—I did not drink any thing else—my sister joined with me—I cannot say how long I was drinking—it was not half-a-dozen hours—I did not dance that night—I took hold of another man by the collar, but I can swear I did not accuse him of stealing my purse—I then went up to the bar, and accused the prisoner, after he had been in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of the money you saw in the prisoner's hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He passed it over into another hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner say it was a lie—he had not got it—he was not near you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the other man did not come and say, "Why, it is not long ago since you accused me of stealing your purse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not one of the men say, "D—n your eyes, you will swear any thing?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, I did not hear him—I did not retort the same phrase—a gentleman named May came out of the parlour into the tap-room—he was called by the landlord of the house—the landlord is not here—I saw the prisoner pass the purse to another person—I did not give an alarm, and cause that person to be taken—I did not see the person, I only saw the hand—the man's hand was very near to me, and the prisoner was not far from me—I called out to the landlord—I did not say that another man had gone away with my purse—I did not see a man, I saw a hand—it appeared to be a man's hand—it was no person in the room—I suppose it was between the doors—it was not in a room, and yet it was in a room—I can write a little—the signature to this deposition (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, is this true, "He got his hand out of my pocket—I saw him pass my purse to the hand of another man who was standing by"—is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100044"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you reconcile this with stating that he had gone to the door, and that you only saw the hand of a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see the man—it was passed into the hand of a man apparently standing by—the prisoner left the tassel of my purse in my pocket, in his struggle—I had not been in the house half-an-hour—we had one bottle of ginger-beer and one pint of half-and-half between five of us—I did not go home with my sister that night—when Mr. May got into the room, I suppose he saw her—I paid the people honourably who crowned me Que of Kensall-green—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all—we are neighbours, and we live as neighbours—it is merely inhabited by cottagers—I dance to oblige them when I think proper—I don't dance in public-houses, and not very often on the green—we have a room there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure you had this money in your pocket that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am sure the prisoner was the man that had his hand in my pocket—I am sure I saw the money pass to another hand.</p>

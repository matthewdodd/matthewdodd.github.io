                  </hi>. I live at 17, Abbey-street, Bethnal-green, and am a brewer's drayman—on the night of the 26th November I went to bed, about 11—previously to that I had secured the front door—about a quarter to 2 in the morning I heard a knock—I was sleeping in the back room—I said, "Who's there?"—somebody said, "A policeman; open the door; are you all right?"—I said, "Yes, for anything I am aware of"—I then put my hand against the front parlour-door, and found it was open—I said, "I don't think I am"—I then went to open the door to let the policeman in, and put my hand on the prisoner's head—he was sitting down by the front door, inside—he appeared to be in liquor, but it is not my opinion that he was—I found this work-box and other articles removed—an overcoat</p>

On the morning of 27th November I was passing 17, Abbey-street, Bethnal-green—just before I reached the door I saw somebody's head looking out at the door—as I got up it was drawn in, and the door was shut—I looked down against the door, and found this paper, with the name of Elsom on it—I knocked at the door, and asked if they had lost anything—as Mr. Elsom came to the door, he called out that there was some one in the passage—I saw a light there when I first came up, and it was put out immediately the door was shut—Mr. Elsom had no light—the prisoner was crouched down by the door—Mr. Elsom had hold of him by the collar—there was a work-box a tea-pot and an overcoat on the floor by the prisoner—the coat pockets were full of children's petti-coats, pinafores, and other things—I asked the prisoner how he came there; he made no reply—I found on him a tea-spoon, a sixpence, and twopence—the parlour door had been locked, and the door had been forced out of the box of the lock—there were no marks on the outer door—I tried the pro<lb></lb>secutor's key, and could not open the door with it.</p>

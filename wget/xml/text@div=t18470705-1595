                  </hi> I live at No. 4, Arnold-street, Salmon's-Lane, Lime-house—it is my dwelling-house—the prisoner and her husband lodged at my house. On the 19th of June I came home at night, and missed a shawl, waistcoat, and trowsers—I told the prisoner I would not say anything about them provided she would tell me where they were—between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday night, she called my wife and me into the room, and told us something, in consequence of which I found the clothes at her sister's house—her sister was repeatedly in the habit of coming to my house—the things produced are mine—I always found the prisoner sober, quiet, and industrious—I never knew any harm of her—I have trusted her with more than what she has taken, and think she must not have been in a right state of mind when she did it.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Hickley. - A. I believe he is something in the 15th light dragoons. I met him; he asked me whether I could inform him where Castle-street was. On going up Fetter-lane the right hand side of the way a person followed very close.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, this gentleman was going with his coat buttoned; I looked to see if he had his watch, some person following very close; it appeared that he had a watch chain and one seal to it, it was a kind of a barrel chain; I observed that we got half way up Norwich-court when the prisoner and another person past us; the prosecutor was asking me if I knew Mr. Keith who keeps the Castle; I said, I knew the house perfectly well; we went up to the house, the gentleman was a little elevated in liquor, no great deal as I could perceive; I took him round to the front door instead of the back door, there being a step more, and as he was going in the steps of the front door, there were two people on the steps before us; a scuffle took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said. - A. I did not hear that any thing was said, there was collaring one another, that was the chief of the scuffle, there might be some blows; we found ourselves at the corner of Castle yard, which is the place where the house is situated. I saw a person's hand upon Mr. Hickley's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170028"></xptr>watch chain when the scuffle took place; I cannot pretend to say whether it was the prisoner's, or whose hand it was; to the best of my knowledge, another person came up, which made three; in the scuffle two of them got away, while the prisoner and Mr. Hickley were scuffling together; then I ran after the other two; they run down Norwich court. I met the prisoner about half way down the court; he was following the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the prisoner scuffling with Mr. Hickley. - A. I did; I ran after the other two, and before I got half way down the court I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not meeting, he came past you. - A. Yes, he came past me; he asked me what was the matter, I believe the words I made use of were - the gentleman was robbed of his watch. I did not see his face at the time; he said let us go after him; he ran away, I was not able to run so fast as him; I lost sight of him; he is the same man, I saw him by the light in the Castle window; I am sure he is the same man; there was a light in the window that projected out about two feet; he was brought back by Mr. Norden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was at my examination Sheppard said he was not sure I was the person or not.</p>
               <p>Sheppard. I said no such thing; I could not say so, because I was certain of his person. The prisoner asked me whether I met him or not; I said I did, and I believe he mentioned it before that at the magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that made the snatch. - A Yes. There were three of them; they all ran away and the people after them. The prosecutor went a little way up Norwich court, there came one back and knocked him down, he struck him three times and cut his mouth open; then he picked up his hat and ran away. I took the prosecutor to our house, because his mouth was bleeding. Master sent me to Hatton Garden to get two officers; then the prisoner was brought back to our house.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker, I live in Charles street, Hatton Garden. On the evening of the 27th of January, coming out of my own street into King's Head yard, hearing the cry of stop thief I made haste; this prisoner was about thirty yards before the rest; I stepped over the way; I did not see any body before him, that was the reason I took account of him; he calling out stop thief, I thought he was the thief. When he came near he halloaed out stop thief the loudest; I knocked him down; he said he was not the thief; I said, stop a little, we can soon know whether you are the thief or no. A mob came up, and Mr. Sheppard he said that is the man that robbed the man in Castle street. I believe he had a white apron tied round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in his hat. - A. There were two handkerchiefs in his hat; I observed a pen in his hat, I asked him what he wore that pen for, he said he was a broker. Mr. Trott came, I gave him up. The boy said that is the man when he brought Trott in, and Mr. Hickley's mouth was bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you observe the apron round him. - A. I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Trott. The apron was tucked up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner struck me first when he was taking the chain and seal; afterwards the person knocked me down, by which it occasioned such bleeding in my mouth; he cut my lips.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from St. Bartholomew's hospital from my wife; I received these two silk handkerchiefs from her; I was going down Fetter lane to buy something for supper; I stopped at the pork shop, Mr. Sheppard came up to me, he said there was a man who had been knocked down and robbed; I asked him which way they went, he said they went that way, up towards Holborn; I ran directly, there was a cry of stop thief, I halloaed stop thief too; one of the witnesses knocked me down and brought me into the tap room as a prisoner. I was placed before the prosecutor who had lost the chain and seal; there were two gentlemen who were present asked him if he knew the person that robbed him, he made answer and said no; he was very much in liquor at the time; I told him I would give him every satisfaction, I told him to send for an officer; an officer was sent for; Trott came, he searched me, and found nothing about me but my own property; I was taken into the parlour, Trott went into the tap room and got the watch belonging to the prosecutor; the prosecutor then said he would not come forward. Mr. Trott swore he would be d - d if he did not come forward the watch should be his.</p>
               <p>COURT. If it is true that the prisoner was the man who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170029"></xptr>struck the prosecutor, and took away his chain and seal; the robbery is compleat, because taking it away in the open street, by force and violence, that is a highway robbery, because the man assaults the prosecutor first of all, by striking him, and then by violence taking the watch chain from his person; if you believe the prisoner is the man, in point of law it does not amount to a highway robbery; whether he is or not, it does not depend only upon the evidence of the prosecutor, because the boy, who was no ways concerned, he observed the prisoner; he says he is the man, he observed the apron round him, and the pen in his hat, at the time and when he was brought back he observed that; in confirmation of that Sheppard says he is the man; Nordon said he heard the cry of stop thief, no person running near him but the prisoner, he was calling out stop thief, upon which he stopped him; taking all these circumstances into your consideration, you are to say whether he is or is not the person that committed this robbery; he has called no person; therefore the evidence rests on the part of the prosecution.</p>

On the evening of the 22d of July I went out, and left my keys at home; I returned about eleven o'clock, and she said, "You left your keys at home, but I have taken care of them for you" - the next day she ran away; I thought she had taken a great deal of property, and sent for an officer - I did not then know what she had taken was so trifling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. When you got home, about eleven o'clock, did you remain at home? A. No, there was a person waiting for me, and I went out with him in a carriage, and I did not return till the following evening; a lady and a little boy live in the house - the lady sent the prisoner out, that she might look into her box - she came to me with a lap full of things, and said,"These must belong to you, Madam" - the prisoner went away directly, with her own box and these articles in it: she had dressed me the evening before, when I went to the Opera - these articles were left laying about the room; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140080"></xptr>believe they could not have been put into the prisoner's box by mistake, because her box was in the kitchen.</p>

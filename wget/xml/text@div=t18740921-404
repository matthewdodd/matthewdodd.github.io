                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 234). On 14th September, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I received information from a Mr. Kelley, in consequence of which I went into the Broadway, Westminster, to look for the prisoner—I then got another constable, and we, with Mr. Kelly, stood and watched at the public-house in Tothill Street—we then saw the prisoner two or three other leave the public-house—we then saw the prisoner Street again, I directed the other constable to go up and stop him that way—he immediately turned round and made a run at me, and said "You want me, Davis, do you?" and-before I could say "Yes" I received a blow on the cheek from the prisoner—at the moment I saw he was coming I guarded myself as well as I could—I knocked him down—we both fell together—he was on his back and I was on my hands and knees—I crawled over on him—while I was lying on my right side across his stomach he was striking at me with his right hand, and I was warding the blows—assistance came, the other constable and a man in plain clothes, and we got him up—he kicked the other constable several times, when he drew his truncheon and struck him on the leg—he still went on kicking, and the constable struck him on the head—we then managed to get him to the station—I</p>

About 9 o'clock on the evening of 14th September I was in the Broadway, Westminster, with Davis—when Davis went towards the prisoner he jumped clean off the kerb, and extended his band and struck him on the side of the cheek—Davis put out his hand to seize him, and they came into collision, and both fell together on the ground—as soon as I ran up and got hold of Purvey I saw blood coming from Davis's cheek—the prisoner struggled so desperately that I was bound to use my truncheon—he kicked me very violently on the legs—they were all bruises—a civilian came to our assistance and a policeman in plain clothes, and we then got him to the station—he said going along, that in years to come, if ever he came out he would do for me—I did not kick him before he struck me, nor did I use my truncheon before he attacked me or Davis—he kicked me very severely before I used my truncheon—he commenced a savage attack upon me and I kicked him.</p>

I am a labourer living at Wallingford, Berks—I was in the Broadway, "Westminster, about 9 o'clock on this night—it was about 9.30 when Davis crossed the road to take the prisoner—they both fell to the ground—I could not see whether he touched Davis or not—I saw him strike out at him—neither I nor Davis said anything to the prisoner till after they rose—Davis said "I don't want to hurt you; I have got a bit. of paper for you"—on the ground he said "You shall not take me, or I will put my b——y knife into you"—I saw the other consta<lb></lb>ble cross the road—they were both up when he crossed the road—prisoner kept kicking the other constable—I helped to take him to the station.</p>

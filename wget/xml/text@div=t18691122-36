I am the wife of Martin Markham, a bricklayer, of 71, Rutland Street, Mile End—the prisoner came to lodge with us on 19th July, and on 12th September she was confined of a girl, a very delicate child—she treated it well, as a mother would—it was very weak and low—on Saturday morning, 9th October, between 10 and 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, "I have poisoned myself and the child"—she seemed in a very wild and excited state—I said, "You have never done such a thing as that?"—she said, "Go and see for yourself"—she put her hand to her head, and said, "Oh dear, I shall go mad; troubles will drive me mad, they are so great"—I had a conversation with my husband, and went up stairs, and found the child on the bed, foaming at the mouth—I took it up, and it died my arms—the prisoner came up after me and said,</p>

death hourly, before she told me that—the child was unable to take the breast, the mother paid it all the attention and devotion which an affectionate mother could—she was always very affectionate towards it—ever since she received the letter from her husband the prisoner has been wild and vacant at times, and since the birth of the child I have observed her to be in a low, melancholy state, and she used to cry a great deal—irrespective of that I have frequently seen her wringing her hands and putting them to her head, and crying—the whole of the week before the 9th the state I have described was more intense—there was a restlessness about her eyes, and she was still more vague, and she used to come and talk to me, and then run away in a strange manner in the middle of a sentence—they administered an emetic to her the moment the doctor came, and he ordered her to be taken to the hospital at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the medical officers of the London Hospital—the prisoner was placed under my charge there on 9th October—I examined her when she was brought in—she was very pale and cold, and I had reason to believe from her state that she had taken some sort of poison—I gave her an emetic, and came to the conclusion, from what came from her stomach, that she had taken oxalic acid; salts of lemon would be practically the same—she remained in the hospital two or three days, and was then taken in custody.</p>

Q.</hi> From the instructions you received, did you think it necessary to keep close watch over her while she was in the ward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was very low and depressed while she was in the hospital, and on the Sunday evening I found a pocket-handkerchief twisted round her neck, and I believe she tried to strangle herself—it was on Monday, the 11th, just before 9 o'clock at night—she had been left alone for a short time, and when I came back I found the handkerchief in that state, and took it off and said, "You should not do this, because you are getting people into trouble"—she said, "I do not wish to do that."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was she in the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the 9th to the 13th—I only spoke to her for about five minutes on the 9th—she appeared to speak sensibly, but she was very low spirited—she was unable to do anything for herself, she was too ill—the handkerchief was not tied in a knot; it was so twisted that I thought she had been trying to strangle herself.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MORRISON</hi>. I am a surgeon—I attended the prisoner in her confine<lb></lb>inent, of a female child, in September—it was a very sickly child—I was called in again on 9th October, and found the child dead, and the prisoner partially insensible—my assistant had administered an emetic to her before I arrived—I was at a labour, and was sent for—I had her taken to the hospital—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of the child on the following Monday, and came to the conclusion that it died from an irritant poison—the symptoms were consistent with poisoning by oxalic acid—I put the stomach into a jar, and sent it to Dr. Letheby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you attended her, day after day, two or three times a week, since her confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every day, or every other day—there was a suppression of the lacteal secretion—I observed between her confinement and 9th October that she had a wild, vacant look; not so much as to warrant interference to have her confined in a lunatic asylum, but sufficient to attract notice, and make me suspicious of her sanity—the had the peculiar look of puerperal mania, which is a well-recognised form of insanity with women about the period of their confinement—it affects them when they are not able to give milk to a child, and is the consequence of it—this form of puerperal mania develops itself sometimes by acts of violence to the nearest and dearest, and to the offspring of the woman—there it no fixed period at which it arrives at intensity, sometimes one and sometimes two weeks after confinement—there are two forms, the acute, wild, raving, and the other is the melancholy sort, with which there are no delusions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us that again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One is violent, with debates, coming on usually within a day or two after confinement, and the other coming on after the 15th day—that is the melancholy, and is without delusions—they both lead to acts of violence—the second form is the melancholy type, and is what the prisoner's symptoms indicated—the second form is a recognised form of insanity; there are no delusions, but it leads to acts of violence—I do not believe that persons who have that melancholy form have sufficient control over themselves to prevent them committing crime.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your opinion (<hi rend="italic">reading from Dr. Taylor's work</hi>) that "In a person labouring under puerperal mania the killing of a child may be the result of an uncontrollable impulse seizing her at the time the act is done; but it may be done with a knowledge on the part of the mother that the act she is doing will cause 
death?"Knowing that the act of giving poison or cut<lb></lb>ting a child's throat would cause death, might she still be under that un<lb></lb>controllable mania which would cause her to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that she would know the result of what she was</p>

               <p>doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—sometimes persons hare been known to kill other people in order that they may be hung themselves—I believe that in this form of mania they would be conscious that they were doing wrong, and still not be able to prevent themselves from doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your opinion in respect to puerperal mania, that "Wherever there exists an hereditary family taint of insanity, the mind of the medical man should be particularly alive to the chance of its developing itself during a confinement?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I was never in<lb></lb>formed that there was insanity in the family till after the deed was com<lb></lb>mitted—a large proportion of the cases of puerperal mania are in persons whose families have had an hereditary taint.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with Dr. Morrison, that she would know the probable result of what she was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the depression, the melancholy, may be so great that, though she knew the result, still it would be an uncontrollable impulse—the mind may not be so disordered as to render the individual incapable of judging between right and wrong, yet the melancholy may be so great that she might commit the act, and try to poison herself as well—I think she would know that what she was doing was wrong; but if carried to its greatest extent, it might prevent her know<lb></lb>ing that it was wrong.</p>

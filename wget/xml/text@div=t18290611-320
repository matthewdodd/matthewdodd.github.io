On the 23d of April the prisoner came to my shop, about eight o'clock in the morning, and asked for the carcase of a sheep for his master; I said, "Who is your master?" he said, "Mr. Lailey," and as he had come before on the same errand, I did not hesitate to let him have the sheep; he asked me the price - I told him 6d. per lb., it would come to 36s. 6d.; he took it away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LAILEY. I deal with Mr. Scales, and know the prisoner. On the 23d of April he was not in my service; I gave him no authority to apply to Mr. Scales for a sheep - he had left me three weeks all but a day; he never brought it to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRHIMES. I am a constable of Leadenhall-market. On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock, the prisoner brought the sheep into the market, and exposed it for sale - I, suspecting him, went and asked the price; he said 3s. 6d. a stone, which is 5 1/2d. a lb.; I asked his master's name; he said, "Mr. Lailey, of Poplar;" I said, "Who authorised you to sell it?" he said his master would be there presently; I looked at the carcase, and said, "Why I think this belongs to Whitechapel," as I knew the score - he said, "Yes, it does; I got it from Mr. Scales, who killed it for master;" I then took him into custody, and he voluntarily said he had abseuted himself from Mr. Lailey for three weeks.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, complaining of ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110146"></xptr>treatment from his master, but nothing on the subject of the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, at Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, in partnership with my father—the prisoner has been our traveller for three years, at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—it was his duty to solicit orders and collect money, which he handed to me once a week if in the country, and sooner if in town—on 14th December a customer named Ambrose owed us 201., and on 16th December the prisoner paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a payment made by Ambrose—in May, 1873, Ambrose owed us 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the prisoner has not accounted for—a customer named Collins owed us 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in May—the prisoner has not paid us that amount, and it is still to Collins's debit—when the prisoner brought orders home, he gave me the prices at which he said that he had sold the articles, and I entered the prices from his dictation—I made out the invoices in conjunction with him—he used to call them out to me—he had no authority to make any deductions, only 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 per cent, for cash, if paid within a month—he did not tell me that he had made any deductions in those three bills, and I was not aware that any had been made—there is no foundation for the statement that he was going into partnership with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There had been no suggestion of a partnership—we took a shop in Kennington Road, for a bad debt, and I gave the prisoner 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to work it, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> pay for goods sent there, some of the <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> sent were our own, but we don't sell everything, and we gave him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy other goods—that was not given by cheque, but he deducted it from the sums he received from our customers—I do not know that large sums of money which he received in the Charlotte Street establishment, went into the working <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that shop—he could not have lost the amount deficient in 'the time—it was not a very losing business—I have no book here showing the expenditure of the Kennington business—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270015"></xptr>
               <p>here was also a shop in Cirencester Place—I am not aware that the prisoner kept it—I supplied that shop with goods—the name is Mrs. West, she is paying us off by instalments now—I do not know that the prisoner had anything more to do with that shop than taking orders there—there was another shop in Noel Street, Berwick Street, but the prisoner had nothing to do with that—I took the shop and put Smith into it, I managed it myself entirely till I sold it—the prisoner had not to pay the wages of the assistants and porters when I was out of town—I always paid them before I left—I went to Aldershot twice with the prisoner, and I have to to pay the hotel expenses now—he did not ask me for money to pay the hotel expenses, and I did not say "You can get some money from some one in the morning, get Mr. Riser to cash it"—this is the first I have heard of it—Mr. Riser is the landlord—the prisoner had money in his pocket which he got from oar customers on the Monday—he collected from our customers on the Monday, and we went into the country on Tuesday—I have been pressing him for cash for nine months—I do not know that in order to give me cash he borrowed money of our customers, there was no necessity—he sent us cash from time to time by post—I did not ask him whether he could manage 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by June 1st—he did not borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me from a customer on the eve of the Derby, nor did he represent that he had done so—if I wanted money I should take it from my own cash-box—he did not get an accommodation bill for 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did I pay it into the London and Westminster Bank; that was not an accommodation bill, it was money owed by his brother-in-law, St. Aubyn, for goods delivered, and also money which I had lent to the prisoner—I have his book showing the money lent to him, and he gave an I O U to my father, which was returned on his giving us a bill—I think I returned him one I O U, and my father the other—his brother-in-law gave the bill, the prisoner had not to pay it, but he did pay it with our money—the bill was dishonoured and we gave it to the prisoner to take to his brother-in-law—he did not do so, but collected the money from our customers and paid it into the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank—I don't think he met the bill with a penny of his own money—there was not an open account between us—I do not know that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out-from the prisoner's own account at the Union Bank of London—I was not aware that he allowed for over charges.—we had a customer named Baden—I am not aware that the prisoner allowed him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. overcharge on one occasion—if it was allowed, it will appear in my books—they are all balanced and I do not get any allowance here for that amount—here is only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount—I do not find any overcharge in Bufferings' account—I will not say that no allowance has been made, but I will say that none Ought to have been made—Crook's account was closed on January 15th—I don't know why—I did not find that the prisoner was out in his accounts about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been round with him to the customers many times, and I think I went round with him in June, "this year—I did not ask him to make out a book with the account, and I don't know that he did—I gave him in custody on July 3rd—I did not ascertain that he had been making large allowances to the customers when I went round to them, but it was ascertained at the Police Court, I was present—he told me he had made out a book with this account, but I did not know it—I went with him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see his sister, he told me he was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, and we told him he could not stop with us unless we had some security, and he offered us a bill of sale on his</p>

               <p>furniture for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he stopped with us—we took the bill of sale, and his sister said that she would be responsible for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and her husband for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and her husband wrote to say so—there was a bond to secure the bill of sale, but not faithfully to serve us—I did not believe at that time that he was thousands out—I believed him to be an honest man, and only thought he had got wrong—my father would not accept his brother-in-law in any amount—I am not a partner, I manage the business for my father—the prisoner suggested to give us the security of a bill of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a legacy of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wrong, and we would not keep him with us unless we had security—the bill of sale was on 30th May, but we applied for further security on account of the heavy amounts the prisoner was receiving, and I didn't think it was enough—I never found out the other amounts till he was given in custody—I had not been round to the customers before my father wrote this letter of 9th June, not with the intention of finding out any<lb></lb>thing against the prisoner, but I may have been with him to obtain an order—I think I went round to Aldershot with him, but not for the purpose of ascertaining the amounts he received—we never made him responsible for dishonoured cheques, nor had he to sue in his own name for one received from one of our customers—I have heard of no dishonoured cheques but his own, if there were any I should take them on myself—I did not tell him that he must borrow 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, and I would transfer the bill of sale—we had a customer named Atkins—I did not charge the prisoner with a dis<lb></lb>honoured cheque of Atkins for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Atkins's was a bad debt of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we took his business in Vauxhall Street for it—I have sold the shop, and received the money—I have not asked the prisoner to furnish me with a book referring to the overcharges—there ought not to be overcharges—we said "Show us the overcharges"—he said "I will" and in the meantime I went out and found out that there were so many other accounts that we gave him in custody—I have never seen this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the case has been adjourned for a month, and you have had the opportunity of inspecting our books, but you have not done so.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). No one has inspected the books, although the case was adjourned for the purpose—they have always been ready for inspection—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to the prisoner does not refer to any of these accounts—I do not think 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will cover the deficiency that I have discovered at present—there ought not to be any overcharge, because the invoices I sent out were exactly in accordance with what the prisoner gave me as the prices quoted to my customers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him in custody in July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, after I found out this falsehood—I told him I had found out large deficiencies, and that we should give him in charge for embezzlement—he said "Very well" <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270017"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner had the business transferred to his own name, which he had no right to do, and he re-transferred it into mine—I don't know that Mr. Buffery, one of my own witnesses, was present at the transaction between the prisoner and Atkins—I see him here.</p>

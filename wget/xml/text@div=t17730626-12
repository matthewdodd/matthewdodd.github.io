On the 28th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); the handkerchief, sleeves and cloak were in a drawer in my room; the drawer was locked and the key in it; the counterpane was on the bed, and the rest of the things in a chair. About seven o'clock I went down into the one-pair-of-stairs fore room, and locked my door; I staid about half an hour; on my return I found the room door open; I saw the prisoner standing by the fore garret door with something in her lap; I asked her what she wanted; she said one Mrs. M'Carty; I told there was no such person lived in the house; I went into my room and missed my things, which made me suspect her; I came out and asked her what she had in her lap; she said things to wash; I asked her to come into my room and put the things down; she said she would not leave them for they were things to wash; she got down one pair of stairs with them; I raised the house; I saw the things on the floor. She was carried before a magistrate and committed; she said nothing at all for herself.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the same house, on the first floor. On the 28th of April between seven and eight in the evening, I heard the prosecutrix cry out, a thief! I went up and found the prisoner on the two pair of stairs; the people in the two pair of stairs had stopped her, and the things were dropt; she said she had been up stairs to one Mrs. M'Carty with these things to wash.</p>

               <p>I had been to Covent Garden, and carried two loads for a gentleman in Red-Lion-square. I enquired after one Mrs. M'Carty, who owed me half a year's rent; I kept a house in Oxford-road; I was told she lived in Drury-lane; I went into the wrong house; I never meddled with any thing.</p>

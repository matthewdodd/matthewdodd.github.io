             deposed that the Prisoner lodg'd in her House, and did acknowledge her self to be with Child, and that she was 3 Months gone; that about the time aforesaid she complain'd she was ill , and she and some others suspecting she had been deliver'd taxed her with it; but she denyed it, and whereas some of the Neighbours suspected she had put it, into the Vault; telling her of it, the Prisoner reply'd, there was no more a Child in the Vault than she was in it. Other Evidences depos'd to the same purpose, so the Matter lay undiscovered till the 2d Day of May, when the House of Office being emptying, the Child was taken up in the second Bucket, with the Skull broke, which was suppos'd was done by the Bucket. Mrs. Beecham, a Midwife, deposed, that as far as she could see, to the belt of her Judgment the Child did appear to be at its full Time; but it was so wasted by lying so long in the Vault, she could say nothing to its having been born alive or not. Upon its being taken up the Prisoner did confess it to be her Child, and that she put it in; but said it was born dead, and that it was a Miscarriage, she having come before her Time. It did appear that she had owned her being with Child; and had provided some Linnen for it, but said she put it into the Vault being poor and not able to bear the expence of burying it.

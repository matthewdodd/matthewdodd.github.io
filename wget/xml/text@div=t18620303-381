                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these new coats? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were pawned in the name of John Goldson—I always understood that was his right name—I I have seen the prisoner once or twice—once he offered some things to pawn, and we did not take them in, because we could not agree about the advance—I cannot say the date of that—it was previous to the pawning of this last coat, I think—he said one was his own and the other was his brother's—I did not know him to be a master tailor, or a journeyman—I knew nothing of him or of his position—the two coats were not brought at the same time—if a man comes in with a new coat we ask if it is their own, and they always say it is—some men bring new coats on Monday morning to pledge—it is a daily occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Folkard, of Lambeth-walk, pawnbroker—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is quite new—it was pawned by the pri<lb></lb>soner, in the name of John Wells, on 18th December, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew nothing of him before, but I remembered this transaction, as soon as the coat was brought down to show to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What makes you remember it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the prisoner said that this was an ordered coat, and it was to go home the next day, for two guineas—he wanted it done up very carefully—I laid it up behind—he wanted me to take care of it, he was going to redeem it—either he, or somebody he knew, pawned a bed, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at our place—the constable has the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier of 19, Harrow-road—the prisoner was in my service as salesman—he came in September, and left in December—this coat which was pledged with Waller, is one of my coats—I had six of them made—these other two are also mine—a pair of trousers and a waist<lb></lb>coat, and several more things that were pledged were taken before the Magistrate—they are not here, the persons gave them up; they would not come here to prosecute—I received fourteen coats and some trousers, pledged by some one, I suspect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any private mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a private mark, but I pointed out to the Magistrate where the ticket was taken out—I had six of those coats made of a certain make, they cost me a certain price—none of them were sold—no other house makes up those coats—I get them from the country; they were made expressly for me—I do not think that there are many persons in London that deal with the same house—the peculiarity of these coats is the binding—I understood that the prisoner was in business himself as a clothier, but I did not know him as such—I am sure he did not deal with the same firm in the country; that party was not in business when he kept a shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Poplar—on 29th July, I was called to see the deceased—I found her in bed and almost insensible—she com<lb></lb>plained of pain in her head, and put her hand up to it—she gradually got worse, and died on 6th August—I afterwards opened the body—I found a considerable quantity of clotted blood on the right side of the head, between the membranes of the brain—that had caused insensibility and death—she was paralysed in consequence of the compression—those appearances were quite consistent with the fact of her having received an injury on 14th July—a violent fall with her head against the stairs on 14th July, might have produced the condition in which she was—her general health was good—I had known her for a long time—it is consistent with that state of things, that she might have walked about after receiving the injury; that is very usual.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> In consequence of what I was told, I went to the Wel<lb></lb>llington, and said to the deceased, "Mrs. Honan you should not hit an old man like that (meaning my father). She made mouths at me, and made use of some bad words, and I own I slapped her twice with my open hand, but I did not knock her down or kick her. Next day she took out a summons against me, and gave me four days—she was well and hearty then, and did not complain of her head. She had a row with a person a week after wards; she was a very quarrelsome woman. She used to keep a place to sell ginger beer, and had a jar of liquor to sell on the sly, when all the public-houses were shut up, and she used to have a lot of girls and young men there at all hours of the night. A week after this happened, a woman threw a milk can at her.</p>

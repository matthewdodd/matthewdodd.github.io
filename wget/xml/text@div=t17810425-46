               <p>On Saturday the 14th of this month, in the afternoon, about three or four o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop; they asked to look at same black silk handkerchiefs, which lay in the window; my brother bid me reach them; I reached them, and laid them upon several bundles of linen ones that lay upon the counter, and opened them; Clarke laid hold of the two opposite corners from me, and held them over the linen handkerchiefs, while I saw Smith's hand go under, and saw her draw it back again; when it came back, I saw a bundle of handkerchiefs in her hand, and saw her put them into her pocket; she observing that I suspected her, she shook her pocket, as if feeling for money; she took out some silver and a halfpenny or two, and counted it in her hand, and then put it into her pocket again; I said nothing about it then, because I thought she would drop the handkerchiefs, and then say they only dropped off the counter; I let them go out with them, and then told my brother of it; he went after them, and brought them back; I followed them into the shop, and picked up the bundle of handkerchiefs upon the step of the door; but I did not see them dropped.</p>

               <p>On Saturday in the afternoon, the 14th of April, I was out at my door; I saw Mr. Potticary overtake the prisoners; he said to them, I shall be glad if you will step back; I saw they rather changed countenance; Mr. Potticary seemed confused; I went towards Mr. Potticary's shop; I saw Smith go in first, Mr. Potticary followed her, and Clarke followed him; just as she was going into Mr. Potticary's shop, she dropped a parcel of handkerchiefs between the post on her right side and the step of the door; the brother immediately picked them up; the constable came; we took them into the back parlour, and my sister searched them; in one of Clark's pockets there was a remnant of ribband in a brown paper; I looked through the glass door the whole time, when she was stripped, as far as decency would allow; I desired my sister to look under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250052"></xptr> crown of her bonnet; Clarke did not seem agreeable to that. When my sister pulled off her bonnet, four whole pieces of ribband were taken out of the crown of her bonnet; one whole piece was taken out of her pocket, and another whole piece she dropped in the shop.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then it would be out of his duty, in the absence of any other person, to take money for goods? A. Quite so; he was not trusted to receive money.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember the transaction in question? A. Yes; the prisoner was in our shop that day, and intrusted with the shop at that time - there was nobody but him in the shop when I went up to dinner - it was his duty then to serve whatever was asked for, that he could serve, otherwise to call either the warehouseman, or myself - I was at home - I desired him, if I was wanted, to call me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told him he might serve without your presence? A. I had not; but he had done so previously, though he was not told by me to do so - I had not complained of that to him, because he never put the money in the till, but gave it to the shopman - I trusted him to receive money in the shop if any body called, and to pay it to the shopman, who was answerable - his duty was not to put it in the till, but to give it to the shopman - I went up to dinner about half-past one o'clock - before I went up, I counted the money in the till, and marked it - there was one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and one pound in silver - I left nobody but him in the shop - he was trusted with the till at that time - it was open - it was never locked.</p>

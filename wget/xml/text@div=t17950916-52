I went out of town the 2d of June, and I came back the 4th of August; I left her in charge of my house alone; when I came back I found my house in a very uncomfortable situation, exceedingly dirty. Afterwards when I came to examine, I found the windows were broke, table and chairs broke, that shewed there had been very disorderly behaviour in the house; I complained of the house being very dirty to receive me, and she fell a crying, and said, she had been a very bad girl, she said, she had kept very bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. This was exactly as it passed between you? - Exactly; I had not been two minutes in the house. She said she had bad connections, and had pawned a great many of my things. I said, you have used me very ill, who have you pawned them to? she said, to a young lady that was with me, whom I had brought out of the country with me, if she would come along with her she would shew her. The young lady said to me, ma'am, you need not go, for I have seen a little here that explains all; it was a letter that she had picked up in the kitchen. On which I said to the prisoner, tell me what you are after; says she, I will give you the duplicates. In consequence of that she gave me a great many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace the property by these duplicates? - Yes, at five pawnbrokers that are now in court.</p>

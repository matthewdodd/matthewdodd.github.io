            . I am a sawyer and work close by Adams's house. I saw the prisoner about nine o'clock in the morning of the 25th of September, and another lurking about, and I watched them - the prisoner was two doors from Adams's house, and the other in front of the gate; the other nodded his head, and in about three minutes I saw the prisoner going from Adams's with the coat under his arm. I called out</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with that coat;" he ran away and dropped it, and was stopped by a plaisterer and taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live with my father who is a bricklayer. I saw the prisoner running with the coat under his his right arm. I ran after him - May was crying Stop thief! I saw the other man - he ran round the sewer, the prisoner jumped across the sewer and dropped the coat in a hole in the field. I picked it up and gave it to May; when he was brought back he took out a wire from his coat and threw it away, May took it up and gave it to the constable.</p>

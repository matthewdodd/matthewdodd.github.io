Straghan, the baker, and another person came to my assistance - I left Taylor in their charge; I fetched a watchman, who took charge of him - he was taken to the station-house, searched there, and a crow-bar, some skeleton-keys, and I believe one picklock-key, and a fire-box found in his pocket - I saw him searched, and saw two slices of ham found in his pocket; we returned to my house, and found on the stairs a dark-lantern, and my clothes tied up in a bundle handkerchief, which was not mine; they were about half way up the stairs which the men came down; I searched the house over, and found the box from which my clothes had been taken open, and nothing but a handkerchief in it - it was in the back room first floor; I had seen it just at dusk - it was shut then; the Policeman has my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather a dark night? A.

            . I am a journeyman pork-butcher. On the 12th of August, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I stood by my brother's shop, and heard a cry of Watch! I crossed over the way, and saw Hobson's door open, and two men inside, scuffling; I saw the prisoner Allen come out of Hobson's door, and run away - I was about five yards from him or less; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! for about a quarter of a mile to Hoxton-square, and never lost sight of him; he ran - I pursued after him, and never lost sight of him; Smith, the watchman, took him- I am quite certain of him - I had not seen him before that night; I am certain he is the man - I was present when the Policeman searched him under the lamp-post, and found three false collars, a penknife, a silk handkerchief, and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was a dark night? A. Rather darkish; when the alarm was given I went towards the door - there was nobody between me and the person who came from the shop, not that I saw; I cannot recollect - there might be persons passing on the other side of the road, but I saw him run out, and immediately called Stop thief! I was crossing the road - nobody came out of the shop but him; I saw the door opened, and a scuffle ensued - nobody was between me and the person who came out; I looked at him, and not behind me - nobody was passing on the same side as the prosecutor's house I am certain: other people ran as well as me - the watchman came ahead of me, and took him; a man, who is not here, had hold of his collar first, and the watchman took hold of him next.</p>
               <p>Q. The person who came out of the shop was not the person scuffling? A. No - I ran after him immediately - there was nobody nearer to him than me, except the young man who took him and the watchman; the young man is an oilman, and lives in Shoreditch - he was not before the Magistrate; I followed close at the prisoner's heels, within three yards of him, and never lost sight of him - there are about two turnings in the space he ran, there may be more- I will not swear there are not six; I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You pursued within three yards of him, and never lost sight of him? A. No, and was close to him when the young man took him.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. On the night of the 12th of August I was alarmed by a cry of Stop thief! I was standing at the corner of Edward-street and saw the prisoner Allen running in a direct road from the prosecutor's house; I made a snatch at him as he came past me, but missed him, and pursued him - Smith was close behind him; he ran right up Edward-street - I might be two yards from him; a young man named Stone got before him in Hoxton-square - I saw him stop him, and received him in charge; three false-collars, a penknife, a silk handkerchief, and a few halfpence were found on him - he said the collars were his own; I went with him to the station-house, and he there said he had bought the collars that day in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe they sell collars there? A. I do not know - he was not out of my sight; Edward-street is about fifty yards from Hobson's - I will not swear it is not one hundred, but do not think it exceeds sixty; I ran before the last witness - I can only answer for myself: I did not lose sight of him; I swear I was not ten yards from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any turning from the corner of Edward-street to where he was taken? A. Yes, one; I was not more than four yards from him all the way: I made three or four attempts to take hold of his clothes.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in the Kingsland-road about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, and heard a cry of Watch! Police! Stop thief! I immediately ran to the corner of Edward-street - before I got to the corner I saw Allen running across Kingsland-road, and the two last witnesses pursuing him; I immediately followed him through Edward-street, and into Hoxton-square - there is a slight turning; I lost sight of him, but Smiths were before me close to the prisoner - I lost sight of him for half a minute, while I was going round the corner - I saw him again when I got round into the square; I swear he is the same man I saw running in Kingsland-road- I searched him, and found three shirt-collars, a handkerchief, a pen-knife, and a few halfpence on him; I took him to the station-house, returned to the prosecutor's, and went up stairs with him, and on the stairs found a dark-lantern and this bundle, containing a coat, waistcoat, trousers, and shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the Kingsland-road turn out of Edward-street? A. Edward-street turns out of Kingsland-road to Hoxton-square; there is a turning in the square, and a slant, which if you call it a turning makes two: I did not lose sight of him at the slant - he was taken in Hoxton-square; I ran on hearing the cry - both the Smiths were before me, but I was running a different way; I met them - they ran towards me, and passed within two or three yards of where I was, and I ran after them; Stone is not here - where he came from I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your sight of Allen intercepted except at the turning? A. No; I came across the road, and met him - I have shown the collars to the prosecutor.</p>

I went to the corner of Kingsland-road, and met Hobson alone - he took me back to where Taylor was in charge of some neighbours, and gave him in charge; I saw him searched, and a phosphorus-box, five skeleton-keys, a picklock-key, and a crow-bar were found on him; the Police have them.</p>

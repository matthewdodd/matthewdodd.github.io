               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The rupture occasioned his death? A. Yes - I think the injury alone would not have occasioned it; a portion of the last rib projected into his spleen - the breaking of the rib forced it into his spleen, ruptured it, and caused his death.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Providence-place, Brewer's-green, Westminster. I knew the deceased John Kemp Crow; he lived in Bell-street, Vincent-square - I saw him fighting at <placeName id="t18271025-89-crimeloc531">Old Oak-common</placeName>

               <p>Q. Why did you not give information of it, which would have saved his life? A. I was not aware of the consequences. I could not leave my work to go to see him on the Sunday; he was dead when I got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the deceased a stout man? A. Yes - he was stouter than Beard if any thing. I was not near enough to hear whether the seconds remonstrated against his continuing to fight - there was nothing at all unfair; there was no foul play - both seemed to be equally beaten about; Crow had called at my lodgings, and said Beard and him had had words, and were going to fight - it was not a prize-fight, but arose from a quarrel.</p>

I never saw any of the others before the fight; I went to Old Oak-common, and was there when it began; Beard and Crow fought: the other three acted as seconds; I saw the men go in and strip - they then shook hands, and commenced fighting; I saw no constable near: they fell down together at the last round - Crow was undermost; he seemed week, and much distressed - he was taken in a coach to the Green Man, in the Harrow-road; he was bled there, and afterwards taken to the hospital; I saw him next morning at the hospital, but not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had heard so early as Wednesday that he was going to fight? A. Yes - he said he had got Beard to fight him at last - those were his words; he had often expressed a wish to fight Beard - he said before, that he had done all he could two or three times to provoke him, but could not get him to fight; he spoke with joy when he said he had got him to fight; he came and shook hands with me in the morning, and said he was going to fight his man, and challenge another. I know he has before fought with a stone-mason, and beat him - the battle was quite fair. I had seen Beard before the fight - we all three belonged to the same club; I never exchanged a word with him, but always understood him to be a very good natured civil man.</p>

            . I keep an eating-house, in Cross-street, Carnaby-market. I did not see the fight, but know there was a quarrel between Beard and the deceased - the last quarrel I heard was on the Wednesday previous to the Monday - I have heard the deceased challenge Beard on different occasions, in the most provoking manner - and on the Wednesday evening I saw him get up, when Beard was sitting down quite peaceably; he called him a cur and a coward, and said he was no man, or he would fight him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he would spoil his face for him? A. He did; Beard bore his expressions much more quietly than any one could expect - I do not think I ever heard a man bear such language better; but after the language used on Wednesday night he jumped up, and said, "Well, I will not be insulted night after night in this way, but will fight you now, and then;" I have known Beard eight or nine months - he was the most peaceable man I ever knew; Crow said he would not fight him there, but would have him out to fight.</p>

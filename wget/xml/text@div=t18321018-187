               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw it safe at nine o'clock? A. Yes, On Wednesday, and missed it next morning, between eight and nine; I had been out all the day before - I had the keys in my possession; I left my husband in the room - we had the prisoner's brother taken up as well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the money secured? A. In a pocket-book, in a drawer; I am sure I locked it - next morning I went to put 5s. into the same pocket-book, and in trying to unlock the drawer, I found I could not turn the key - I found the pocket-book and money were gone; it must have been taken during my absence the day before; I had not returned till between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 12th of September, I was not out all day; my wife came home between nine and ten o'clock at night - I never left the shop and parlour all day; nobody could go into the room without my knowledge - in consequence of information, I went with Rose to the prisoner's sister, No. 2, Tothill-street, Gray's Inn-road; we got a light, and from under the tiles of the privy, the Policeman pulled out nine sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and one sixpence; I recognized two of the sovereigns, which I had marked - we took the sister to Hatton-garden next day, and we took his brother that night; the prisoner had been taken on the Thursday morning, before we found the money - nobody but the prisoner and his younger brother had been in the room; the brother dined with me that day - he never got up from the table, till he had done his dinner, and then he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They both lodged together? A. Yes; John came home to bed about half-past ten o'clock at night - my wife was in the room then; I was standing at the parlour door, and could see into the room - the prisoner came in, and asked for something to eat: I stood in the parlour with him, till somebody came for 2d. worth of oysters, about ten minutes after six o'clock - I was five or six minutes in the shop, opening them, and when I returned the prisoner was standing up against the bed, by the glass case, where this money was: I took up John because he told me where the money was - I took the sister up, and another girl who lodged with her.</p>

            . In consequence of information I went in search of the money, to Tothill-street, and found nine sovereigns and three half-sovereigns - I lived in the prisoner's house, on the first floor; I put the money into my pocketbook on the 21st of September, and on the 3rd of October I missed the pocket-book and money; they directly took me before a Magistrate, on suspicion of making away with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lodged there? A. About two months; I went just before the robbery -I placed the pocket-book under my mattress - there are several lodgers in the house; I was a Policeman, but have been discharged for being tipsy, as they said, but I was not so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was your room secured? A. There was a lock to the door, but I seldom locked it, as a person lived with me, and we had only one key - it was a woman lived with me; there was only one bed; I am married, but she was not my wife - I do not know that I ever told the prosecutor that she was; she passed as my wife.</p>

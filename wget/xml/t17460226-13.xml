Some Time after, this Woman came for a halfpenny Candle. My Wife miss'd some Candles that were hung upon the Pegs; upon which she found 6 lb. under her Apron. We ask'd her hour she came by them. She declar'd she bought them in St. John-Street.</p>

               <p>George. I am certain they were, they were fresh made Candles. The Prisoner's Husband was question'd about the Candles, and said, when we went to his House, if there were any Candles they were ours; where we found 4 lb. more Candles , which I knew to be ours .</p>

When I came home I miss'd several Pounds of Candles . I found the Prisoner in the Shop for a halfpenny Candle. I turn'd aside her Cloak, and found 6 lb. in her Apron.</p>
               <p>Negro, Constable. I took charge of her Saturday Night : When I came, the Candles were taken out of her Lap; which Mrs. George declar'd were her's .</p>

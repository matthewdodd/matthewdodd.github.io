               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you deal largely in clothes? A. Yes, I have four or five hundred in my shop: these coats were taken away in my absence; I know them to be the same; there were three drab, one green, and a blue.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Cox complained to me, and on Monday evening, the 28th of February, about five o'clock, I went to Cohen's with him, and found a drab coat hanging at the door for sale. Cohen was not at home; I left word for him to come to me; he came next morning, and said there were four more of the same lot, and brought them.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROLF. I sent for Jarman, who told me he bought them of the prisoner, whom I apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search for a man named Turpin? A. Yes, on the 1st of March, on which day I took the prisoner - I could not find him - I looked for him in consequence of what the prisoner said.</p>
               <p>MR. COX re-examined. I have endeavoured to find Turpin, but without effect. I lost about 100 l. worth of property; it was all safe at half-past eleven o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of Turpin, who lives at Westminster: I told the officer and Cox so, the morning they came to me; Turpin had sent his sister to me. I called on him, and said they did not suit me - he asked me to sell them for him, as he was in trouble. I showed them to Jarman, who offered 2 l. less than I was to ask. I said, they were not my own, but if the person would take the money, he should have them. I paid Turpin the money - Jarman paid me; he allowed me 1 l.</p>
               <p>JARMAN. I offered him less than he asked; he said, he could not take it, as they were not his own.</p>

            . I lodge in the prisoner's house. On the morning of the 10th of February, my child was taken ill; I heard the prisoner come home that evening a little before twelve o'clock, and lock the door. I went down stairs about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - he was in bed, I knocked at his door, and asked his wife for a few matches, as my child was sick. I was up and down all night - he could not go out without my knowledge. I unfastened the door myself at six o'clock in the morning; I know it was the 10th, for I have a duplicate of some things which I pawned that day to raise money, as my child was taken ill.</p>

            , a butcher, of Kingsland-road. On the 6th of January, in the evening, after candles were lighted, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Broker's shop door - he asked for master, who I called forward, and he said he had come to enquire whether he could kill twenty sheep - master said he could kill twenty or a hundred. On the 7th I saw twenty sheep there; I was not present when they came - the prisoner called the same day while they were there, and saw master; I was present: he went to the back premises, where the sheep were; he saw them, and asked why we had not began to kill them; master said he heard there was some thing wrong respecting them; the prisoner offered to give him a note of hand, to indemnify him that they were his; he went away; and on the 8th, in the evening, after candle light he came again (it was Saturday;) he asked me if I had got the key of the shed: I asked if he wanted to take the sheep away - he said Yes; I said I had not got the key, and if I had I could not let him take them: he then left the premises. I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he known to you before? A. I had not spoken to him before the Thursday, but had seen him before.

I saw him again on Friday, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and again on Saturday. Master lives near the first turnpike in the Kingsland-road.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Mr. Broker, of Kingsland-road. On Thursday night, the 6th of January, the prisoner came and asked my father if he could kill him twenty sheep; my father said, Yes, a hundred if he liked. The prisoner agreed to give him 1 s. a head, to kill, and send them to market, and book them in his (the prisoner's) name; he said his name was Bishop. They were to come on Friday; some man brought them about half-past eight o'clock on Friday morning; the prisoner did not bring them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did he come? A. About seven o'clock, I think - we light candles soon after dark, and it was soon after they were lighted. I let the sheep in at a quarter or half-past eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I produce two sheep skins, which I got from a shed at the back of Broker's house, in the presence of the last witness on the 14th; I brought away eighteen live sheep also.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURKITT re-examined. These are the skins of two of the sheep which I let in: the eighteen which Waters took away were the rest of the twenty.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROKER. I am a butcher, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 6th of January, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, my man called me out - I saw the prisoner - he asked if I could kill him twenty sheep - I said yes, a hundred - he asked what I should charge - I said twenty shillings to kill and take them to market, with my horse and cart - he said he would send them in, and perhaps he should buy twenty more to-morrow - he asked me to take something to drink - we each had 3 d. worth of brandy - I asked him when they would come - he said between 8 and 9 o'clock next morning - a short stiff man knocked me up about half-past six o'clock, but I did not see the sheep - he said they were round at the back door. I went out to market, and when I came home found twenty sheep in my shed - the back door is the way my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170056"></xptr>sheep always came in - two of them were afterward killed - I hung the skins up and the officer took them away - no other skins hung in the shed. The prisoner called on me about ten or half-past ten o'clock on Friday morning, and asked me the reason I had not began to kill them - I said I had heard they had not been properly come by, and there had been an officer to stop them. He said he would give me a note of band to indemnify me that they were his, and if I did not like to kill them he would get somebody else. I said I would set two men to kill them in the afternoon - he said very well, and asked me to go and take a pint of ale with him, which I did. I lent him 1 s. to pay for it, and never saw him again till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure about his person? A. Yes; I went to his house on Sunday with the officer. The last time I saw him was between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday night. I was not at home on Saturday till nine or ten at night. I did not go to make any communication to him either on Friday or Saturday. The first officer I told of it was on Friday. I told the prisoner on Friday that an officer had been about them. I sometimes kill twenty or thirty sheep a week - I killed the two on Monday afternoon by desire of the officer, as they were not likely to live an hour, being ill. I am positive of his person.</p>

I lost twenty (looking at the skins) - I know these positively to be the skins of two of my master's sheep - I saw eighteen live ones at Broker's, on the 13th of January - they were the rest of a score which I brought from Tottenham on the 31st of December. I had not seen them since - they were brought from Tottenham and turned out into the field at Islington - I came part of the way from Tottenham with them, with the servant who took them to Islington - I had seen them at Tottenham at different times, from the 13th of November, and know them very well - they were in my care at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many had you at Tottenham? A. Seventy-five or seventy-six. I know the skins by the ochre-mark, and by the face of the sheep - I swear to the live ones by their faces, and to the skins by the marks - all that flock had the same mark.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have been long acquainted with sheep? A. Yes, ever since I was eight years old - I speak with certainly to them.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES RHODES. I had a quantity of sheep at Islington - the last time I saw these was on the 5th of January, about twelve o'clock in the day, in my field at Islington - I knew the eighteen when they came back, but cannot swear to these skins - I did not miss them till I saw them advertised on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know these skins? A. I cannot say whether I should know them by the skins or not. I had sent Frith to pick them out at Tottenham - I should know all the seventy-five. I have no partner - my premises are about two miles from Kingsland-road - I do not see the sheep daily, and cannot say when they were stolen. My fields are at the back of York-place - there was plenty of grass for them.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When you saw the advertisement you missed them? A. Yes - I know them well - I bought them at Kingston fair on the 13th of November.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROKER re-examined. The prisoner said he had got more money, and perhaps he might buy twenty more to-morrow - he did not say how he came by these - I did not know him before - he did not tell me his name; but on Friday morning he told me to book them in his name (Bishop) - that was after I told him there was something wrong in it. The bargain about killing them was made on Thursday evening.</p>

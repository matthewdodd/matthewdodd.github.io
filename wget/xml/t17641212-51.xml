The prisoner came to my house, and said, she was going out of town, and desired me to lend her half a guinea; she said she had quarrelled with her sister, and could not get her money nor cloaths. I said she was a stranger to me, and I did not care to lend any thing without something for security. She said she had nothing, but she would get her things, and then she would pay me. I lent her half a guinea; this I believe was in November; she said she had lace and ribbons in pawn in King-street, Seven-dials, and if I would take them out, she would pay me: I sent and got them out.</p>

I said the prisoner gave them to me, and she had given me two yards and a half of lace: I shewed him that; he said his wife could swear to it, but he could not; upon which he sent for his wife. I took ten laced handkerchiefs out of a drawer, and bid her look over the lace; she did, and laid her hand on this handkerchief here produced, and said the lace upon it was her property, the same lace the prisoner gave to me.</p>

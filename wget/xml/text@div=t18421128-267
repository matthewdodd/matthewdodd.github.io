                  </hi>. I am master of the National School at Mortlake. On the 2nd of Nov. I had a little boy in the school named James Benham searched for a whistle—the boy who searched him took a purse from his pocket containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and two farthings—I kept Benham and the prisoner back after the rest of the boys were discharged—I then asked Benham</p>

               <p>where he obtained the money—he said of Purdue, and on questioning Purdue, he said he had taken it from Mr. Steel's till at different times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And was it in consequence of that, that this boy was taken up after Mr. Steel had forgiven him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may say yes—I do not recollect whether Mr. Steel said in the presence of several persons that he entirely forgave him—I was these all the time, and I recollect nothing of the kind—it might take place, and I not recollect it, from the agitation arising from the discovery of such a theft—I heard Mr. Steel tell him to go home and make out a state<lb></lb>ment of what he took and what he spent, and the prisoner brought the state<lb></lb>ment to me—I have kept the statement—I sent the officer to the minister—I think the prisoner was taken up on the 3rd—both him and Benham were taken at first—the Magistrate took bail for the prisoner's appearance—he has been several years in the school.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Mortlake—the prisoner lived with me as errand-boy—in consequence of receiving information from Mr. Gamble I sent for the prisoner—he came at once—Mr. Gamble questioned him in my presence respecting a purse of money which was found, and before any threat or promise was made the boy said he had taken it from my till—he had lived with me the last time for a month constantly—I knew him before I employed him, and had every reason to be satisfied with him—when he admitted taking the money, I again questioned him, and asked if he had not received it for any bills—he stated he had not, but he took it from the till at various times—I said unless he confessed the whole truth I would send for a policeman, as I thought he had accomplices, and I was willing to forgive him, as I thought him an honest boy—I desired him as well as Mr. Gamble to write it down, but previous to his leaving me I considered I had entirely forgiven him—I intended not to prosecute—I thought him penitent, and intended not to bring him before a court of justice—I thought by pardoning him I should do him more good—I did it from a feeling of humanity more than any thing else—I have no knowledge of this purse, and cannot swear to the money.</p>

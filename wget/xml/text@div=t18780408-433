                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 146, Central Street, St. Luke's—on 5th April, about 12.30 a.m., I heard a noise, got out of bed, looked out at the window, and saw a light in the back yard—I lit a lamp, and heard a door breaking open, and on rushing upstairs, I opened my bed<lb></lb>room door and saw the prisoner—I asked him what he was doing there—he said that there was a quarrel at the back, and he got in there out of the way—I called for assistance and my brother came down—I asked the prisoner again, and he said "I have been here since 10 o'clock, I came for a night's lodging, I am not a thief"—he pleaded very hard to be let go—I called a policeman and gave him into custody—I had left the kitchen door bolted securely, and when I went down I found it forced open and the window was open likewise—the window had been very insecurely fastened by a little drop latch, but I did not see it when I went to bed, only the door—I did not go into the kitchen, nor was there any one else who went in.</p>

I was called and found the prisoner being held—the kitchen window could only be opened by a knife—there wore no marks on it—I found on the prisoner six keys and a small candle and matches—he said that there was a disturbance and he got in there out of the way—he afterwards said that he had quarrelled with his landlord and got in there for the night.</p>

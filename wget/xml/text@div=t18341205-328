                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Quin, and lodge at Moriarty's. On Sunday morning, the 7th of December, I went to the cage to help to get bail for her husband—we got him bail, and then went and got something to drink—when we got home, we found the husband at home, and the prisoner was then sitting by the fire in the room—she got up, and went out, as I came in—she came back in the afternoon—I asked her what made her go out—she said she only went round the corner—she then went to bed in the same house, and got up in the morning and went away—she lodged in the house—she went out to get a bonnet on Monday morning, then came back, went out again, and did not return—there were people in the house—when I came back on Sunday the prisoner was in the house alone—the people had gone in with me—Moriarty had gone in with me—he was there when his wife came in—she had stopped outside, talking to the women in the street—the prisoner and an old lady, who is not here, were in the house—I did not see any body in the kitchen but the prisoner—I have not said that Moriarty was there when I went in—he went in with me—this is my mark on the depositions, but I cannot read—it was read over to me.</p>

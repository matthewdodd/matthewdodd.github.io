                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 274). On the morning of 21st December, at twenty minutes past 10, I stopped the prisoner in the Eltham-road, about a mile and a half from Mr. Grace's—I asked him what he had in his possession—he said he had got a Christmas dinner—I requested to know what his dinner was, and he said he had got a goose—I put my band in his jacket and found a goose with the feathers on, and quite warm—he said he gave four-shillings for it at 7 o'clock that morning of a man with a horse and cart at Eltham—I afterwards showed that goose to Mr. Grace—I found some footmarks on his premises, and took one of the prisoner's boots and made an impression with it, and it corresponded with the footmarks—they appeared to have been done within a very few hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Avory-hill, Eltham—my mother has a small farm there—on 21st December we had some geese—about half-past 7, I was shown one by the last witness—that was one of ours—I can identify it by its feathers and wings—I saw the prisoner once before the 21st, I think it was the day before, in the main road—I did not see this goose the night before, but my brother did.</p>

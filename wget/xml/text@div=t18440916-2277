                  </hi>. I am shopman to Rowland Hooper, a linen-draper, in Oxford-street. On the evening of the 26th of Aug. I was serving in the shop—I had a wrapper containing some silk dresses, which I was showing to a lady—the prisoner came in, and took a seat by the counter—I left the counter to go to take a piece of silk to the door to look at, and while I was gone five silk dresses were gone from the counter—the prisoner was near the place, standing about a yard and a half from the counter—there was a young woman serving, named Jane Page—I saw the prisoner walking towards her—she purchased something from her, and I saw her tender some money to her across the counter—Page went to the cashier's desk to get change—Henry Adcock came, and spoke to me—in consequence of what he said I gave directions to two or three persons in the shop to watch the prisoner—I saw she had some<lb></lb>thing under her cloak on the left hand side—I went up to her, opened her cloak, and said "What have you here?"—she said she had nothing—I saw three dresses had dropped from under her cloak, and I saw a fourth dress was dropping from her, and a fifth I took off her arm—I took them from her, placed them on the counter, and told her I should send for a policeman—she said she supposed that they must have fallen from the counter, she had not got them—she wanted to go out of the shop—I would not allow her to go, and told her I had seen her before on many occasions, and had suspected her before—she made no answer—I sent for an officer, and gave her into custody—these are the dresses—it is my master's dwelling-house.</p>

That is true—she was about a yard and a half from the counter when I saw the pieces of silk—she had the appearance of a person in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the prosecutor. On the evening of the 26th of August I was in the shop and saw the prisoner—I saw her served with some print and calico—I saw something under her cloak—Dugan opened her cloak, and I saw this silk falling to the ground from under her cloak—I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 76.) I was called, and the prisoner was given into my custody for stealing five pieces of silk—she said she knew nothing of it—she seemed to have been drinking but was not drunk—she denied stealing the silk—she said she lived at No. 10, Rupert-street, Hay<lb></lb>market—I went there and inquired, but they knew nothing of her—the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house is in the parish of St. Marylebone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married—I was in the shop in Oxford-street on Monday the 26th—I had an order for two bonnets—I went to match some silk—I saw the prisoner there with a mantle on—I am sure she is the person—I had never known her before—there was a young woman serving her with remnants of pink cotton—I saw a parcel of silks rolled up, and while the prisoner went to handle them I saw her open one and they fell to the ground—I saw her stoop to pick them up—when the shopman came round I could not see whether she had them in her hand or not—I saw her stoop—I heard the person who was serving her say to Du<lb></lb>gan, "I do not think she intended to steal them"—I saw the prisoner lay down a half-crown to pay for what she had bought.</p>

I said I was not the person he took me for: upon that he said, G - d blast my eyes, called me b - h, and took my cloak off my back, and gave it to the prisoners. There were four women together, and they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take from you besides?</p>
               <p>Harrison. They took a hat off my head, a cap and knot, knocked me down, and put me in fear of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you say you was sitting down at a door, did they knock you down there?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I run after them, and they returned, knocked me down, and dragged me along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go after them?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I run after them about half a quarter of a mile.</p>

Cobb took her cloak off and run away, and we all run after him up Prince's street. We turned about again, knocked her down, gave her a slap on the face, and cut her head, tho' I did not see the cut, and took her hat and cap, then we run to Peg Kirby's mother's. We thought they were but trifles to pawn or sell, so we gave the cloak, hat, and cap, to Peg Kirby's mother; and I had the ribbon. We went out again the next night with the same intent; but did not do any more since that. The cloak is to be produced, but I don't know any thing of the hat and cap. This is the cloak I am sure, Mrs. Harrison had not much about her, but it was all God have mercy to us.</p>

            . As I was coming down Barbican the 24th of February, on a Sabbath day, a little turned of 9 o'clock, I saw a woman sitting upon a step next door to a Stationers: I asked her what she sat there for; she said she had been at Cripplegate lecture, and was not very well: I bid her not sit there, for there were many troublesom people about. I saw 3 or 4 women, and a man together. Moll Whaley and the man came up to her, and the man put his hand into the prosecutrix's bosom; and I said, don't meddle with the woman, for she is not well; he smiled at me, and then he began to search her gown; I said to

            , let us go, for I am sure he will rob the woman before he leaves her; and he took her cloak off, and gave it to Moll Whaley; who she gave it to afterwards, I can't tell, and they all run up Prince's street by the Crown and Cushion: the prosecutrix run after them, and cried out stop thieves, and they said, blast your eyes, or d - n your eyes, do you follow us? The fellow knocked her down, and the prisoners came up and took her hat and cap off, and she desired Caton and I to lead her to the Red Cross door. The prosecutrix came afterwards to our house, and desired us to speak the truth of what we saw, or I never would have come after them.</p>

I happened to be coming out of my own court on a Sunday night about 9 o'clock, and heard swearing and sad wicked oaths, vast blasphemous oaths, and there was a riot, which made me afraid. I stepped to the chandler's shop for a candle, and saw a man take the cloak off the prosecutrix's shoulders, and then they all run away. I went with the candle to see the woman, her hair was over her eyes, and her head very bloody; and then I went back to my own room. I don't know any thing of the three prisoners, but this

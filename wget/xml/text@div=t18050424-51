            : On the 19th of April, about half past eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner come in at the gate, and I asked him who he wanted; he made me no answer; he was looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240043"></xptr>at the names on the doors of persons who have accompting-houses there; he went up stairs, and made me no answer. Not hearing him knock, I stood and listened, and heard him coming down the garret stairs, (I live in the kitchen, and sleep in the garret), I ran up stairs, and met him; I went into the garret, and missed my cloak; I called out immediately to the gentlemen to stop him; I said, he has got my cloak; they stopped him, and took the cloak from his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- SURMUDO sworn. - I heard Mrs. Peters call out, stop him, he has got my cloak; I immediately jumped from my desk, and asked the prisoner what he wanted, I saw that he had a bundle; he turned round, and was walking down stairs; I laid hold of him, and pulled out the cloak from his breast.</p>
               <p>(The cloak produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, with permission I will make bold to speak, to acquaint your Lordship that an old ship mate of mine told me there was a merchant lived there, who wanted a cook to go out with him; I will tell you my Lord, that I went into the gateway, there was a woman coming out, and I saw that bundle lay on one side of the door; accordingly I picked it up, but never opened it; I went up stairs, and came down again; I do not know whether that is the woman, or not, but a woman halloaed out, they have got it; I picked it up at the door. I am a seaman bred and born; I have been in his Majesty's navy fifty-four years, and have received several wounds in his Majesty's navy; in the wars I have stood in my blood, and lost my flesh, and lost the use of my arms; I have failed round the globe, and have been in every action at sea almost for fifty-five years; I could not go before the mast now, but I would endeavour to go as cook, as old as I am; I was seventy-seven years of age last Christmas-day; I am not able now to hand a top-sail, or reef a top-mast, but I could cook for all hands; I have spilt my blood against all usurpers and tyrants, like Buonaparte; I was at the Nile with Admiral Nelson, when he took, sunk, and destroyed the French; I call God to witness that is the way I came by it; I found it at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Peters.) Was your cloak down stairs at all? - A. No, it was up in the three pair of stairs room; I found the drawer open when I went up stairs.</p>

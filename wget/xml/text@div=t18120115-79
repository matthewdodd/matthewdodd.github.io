            , JUN. I am a weaver, I live in Bethnal green, I was at the Adam and Eve, a woman came in along with the prosecutor, they were both intoxicated in liquor, he had a bundle with him, there was an old coat in it, one bid six-pence for it, others a pot of beer, in the mean time he said he had been robbed, I will take my oath the prisoner was not in the tap-room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle. - A. I do not know, the room was full of people, and I was sitting on the opposite side.</p>

            , I am a weaver, I went to indulge myself with a pint of beer, I had not been long there, before I saw this gentleman come in, he came in in a very funny character waving his hand; a woman came in with him; I then thought it was his wife, but I do not think it was his wife now, and after talking, he danced up and down the tap-room, to the best of my recollection the young man was not in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. We had not got that before. - A. One said he would give sixpence for it, another a pot of beer, I saw no parcel,</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor.) Were you drunk or sober. - A. Perfectly sober.</p>

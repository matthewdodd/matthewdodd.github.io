                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker, and live at Plumstead-common. On the 17th of Dec. the prisoner came to my house, about half-past twelve o'clock—I bad a dress in the back parlour—she was not in that room to my knowledge—I did not miss it till the evening—about two o'clock I was making her a black cap—she went into the back place, to get some ribbon, and exclaimed that she was frightened, that she saw a man go out at the garden gate—she did not go out then—I said the gate was locked—I looked at it, and it was not locked—about three o'clock she went into the garden, and would then have an opportunity of going into the back room—she left about half-past five—I missed the gown about a quarter of an hour after she went—this now produced is it—it is nearly new, and is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave her some tea before she went.</p>

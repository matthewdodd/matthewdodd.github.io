                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of 21, Union-street, Spitafields. On 24th Nov., about 10 minutes or a quarter past 6 o'clock, the prisoner Edwards, who I have known for many years, but did not know where he lived, came with these books open in his hand, and said that they were samples—I asked if they were his property; he said, "No," but he had them to sell, that there were a great quantity of them, and some large ones among them—he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and said that they were to be seen in John's-row, St. Luke's, and the party they belonged to wished to sell them immediately—from the peculiar marbling of them, and from information having been previously left at my house, I asked him who the party was who had got them—he said that a man was waiting outside—I said, "Well, I will put my coat on and go with him"—I went out of the shop with Edwards, and saw the prisoner Francis looking in at my window—I had the books in my hand, and said, "Are these your property?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have got a quantity of them, have you not?"—he said, "Yes, there are a large quantity"—I said, "Well, what do you want for them?"—he said, "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Where are they to be seen?"—he said, "In John's row, Old-street-road"—Edwards heard all the conversation—I then accompanied them, as they expected, to go and look at the books, but met with no officer—on the road Francis said, "Whatever bargain you make, you must allow Edwards something for his trouble"—I said, "Oh, very well!"—we walked on to the corner of Chiswell-street—I was then walking between the prisoners—I called, "Police! I want you;" and that very instant Francis took to his heels—I ran and kept within a few paces of him—he was stopped by a young man about 300 yards off, and I immediately laid hold of him—he said, "What right have you to stop me, and lay hold of my coat and tear it?"—I said, "I shall detain you till an officer comes up, for these books are part of some property which was stolen, and if you had done nothing, why did you run away?"—an officer came up, and</p>

About a quarter past 6 o'clock, on 6th Nov., I was called by the last witness, who had two men with him; one of whom ran away, and Palmer followed him—I went up to the other, Edwards, and asked what was the matter—he said that he did not know, he was merely passing by—I said, "I think you must know something about it, as from what I saw., the man intended to give both into custody: you had better remain—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You had better remain a short time, and see if they come back"—I heard that the other one had been taken to the station, and said to Edwards, "You must go to the station with me"—going along I said to him, "Do you know who that man is that called met?"—he said, "Yes, I know him very well"—I asked his name—he said, "Palmer," and that he lived in Union-street—I said, "Then you must know something about what he wants the police for"—he said that it was something about some books, but he had nothing to do with it—at the station he said that he had been called on by some one to look at some books, but they did not suit him, and he thought he could get a customer—I asked him if there were many—he said, "Yes, as they want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—I said, "Can you show me where the books are?"—he said, "Yes, I think I can"—in fact he said that he knew the place in John's-row—I asked him if he could show me the house—he said, "I think I can"—I went to Hull's-place, John's row, with him—he took the to the house, and I found a quantity of books, of which these produced are a portion, the others are at the police station; there were about 350 of them—I asked Edwards where he lived—he said, "At No. 4, King-street Old-street-road"—I went there, and found that it was correct—I found a quantity of reading books, but not books of this sort, and these two boards—they were in the front room, ground floor—it is a private house—there was a bed and bedstead in the room—a great part of the books were piled in a heap by the side of the bed, but the greater portion were strewed about under the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, in Fenchurch-street. I remember the prisoner coming to my counting house in Nov.: I think it was on the 14th—he asked me if I had got the Nos. complete of a work I was taking in, the "Illustrated Atlas"—I had seen him at my office, and I believe it was to bring some of the Nos.—he asked me if I had got them complete, if I wished to have them bound, as Tallis and Co. were binding the work, and as they were binding a large quantity they could do them very cheap for me—he told me the cost would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him forty-two Nos. of the "Atlas"—I handed him a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of paper, and he gave me an acknowledgement—this is it—he said I should have the books in about a fortnight's time—I did not see him afterwards till he was brought to my office in custody of a police officer named Thane—I had seen the prisoner several times before—he brought me some of the Nos.—I think it was always about the same books—he came to my office about six weeks previous to the time when I delivered these Nos., and asked if I had got the work complete—it was not complete at that time—he told me it wanted two more Nos. to complete it, and he said he would send them—they were delivered a short time after that by another party, not by himself—I delivered them to him to have them bound.</p>

Tallis and Co., but not during the time that I have been superintendent—I know that because I was a canvasser myself then—it was his duty to deliver works—certainly ha has not delivered Nos. for the last twelve months—those forty-two Nos. never came in from Mr. Browne—the prisoner bad no authority from the firm to obtain those works from him.</p>

On Saturday, 28th Feb., I saw the prisoner in the Queen's Arms—I naked him if his name was William Payne—he said it was—I asked if he had been employed in the firm of Tallis and Co., publishers—he said he bad, but it was some time ago—I said some person had been going about collecting a work called the "Atlas," amongst the customers under the pretence of getting it bound—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I said, "Well, you answer the description, and to exonerate yourself, will you have any objection to go round to the customers?"—he said he would go about 10 o'clock—I said, "Now is the time"—I took him to Mr. Browne, and he said, "That is the man that took my books"—the prisoner said, "I know nothing about them"—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kensington gravel-pits. I am an omnibus<lb></lb>proprietor and driver—the prisoner used to mind my horses for a few minutes, sometimes—I had a coachman, named William Rose, who was generally called Capt. Ross—he ran against another omnibus, and broke it, and was locked up at Lambeth-street—while he was there, the prisoner came to me and said Capt. Ross wanted 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get him out of trouble—I gave it to him—I owed Ross that money, and I thought he might want it—I gave it the prisoner, because he said Capt. Ross had sent him.</p>

After I gave him the money, he said something about the bail-bond, but I gave it him, thinking he came from Capt. Ross, and to get him out of trouble.</p>

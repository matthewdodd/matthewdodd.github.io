                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and lodge in Essex-street, Commercial-road. I was going home on the 1st of May, and saw White—she said she would treat me with a pint of beer if I would go to a public-house—I did, and she treated me with a pint of beer—after that I went home with her, and gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Sarah Neale was in the house—I did not see John at all—I went to bed, and after I got to bed White whispered to Sarah Neale, and White afterwards came to bed—I did not hear what she said—I put my jacket and trowsers under my head—I had a knife in my inside jacket pocket—I had no money—about four o'clock in the morning I was awoke by my pillow moving, and I saw Sarah near the door, with a jacket in her hand—I looked under my pillow, and my jacket was gone—I got out of bed, and went to the door—it was shut—I could not open it—I went back to White, who was in bed, pulled her, and told her my jacket was taken away, and she hallooed out something, I think "Murder"—John Neale then came in, and struck me on the face—we had a scuffle, and he tore my shirt—then Sarah Neale and John pushed me out—White had started off while the others were in the room—they shut the door—I put my foot to it, and told them to give me my jacket—John then came out, and we had a scuffle outside—he threw me down—this is my jacket and knife—I did not give it to either of them.</p>

About five o'clock on this morning I was on duty—I saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, opposite the door of Neale's house—he had blood on his face—I knew the prisoners lived there—the prosecutor complained that he had lost his jacket—I went into the house, and saw Sarah Neale—I asked her for the jacket—she said White had run out with it—Nicholls went after her—I went into the back yard, and saw John Neale washing the blood off his arm—I asked how he came to ill-use the man—he said he had a right to defend himself—I said I must take him—he took up a poker, and said he would lose his bl—y life before he would come out with us—I told him he had better come, and he did.</p>

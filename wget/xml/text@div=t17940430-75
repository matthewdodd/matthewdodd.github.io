I asked him who they belonged to? I am not sure whether he said his name was Miller, or whether he came from Mr. Miller, I told him that I thought Mr. Miller was not in a situation to part with tea spoons, and should send there, and I sent to Mr. Miller; when Mr. Miller came he said that the tea spoons had been offered to him, and he refused to buy them; when Mr. Miller came he said they were his own, and he bought them at Brighton, and that he was not accustomed with pledging, and he had been with Mr. Mortimer, an auctioneer, who had sold a number of things for him, and Mr. Mortimer told him he might pledge them in what name he liked; he said he had exchanged the spoons at Brighton for a watch; I told him he might come honesty by them for what I knew, but I should detain the spoons, till I had further proof, how he came by them; and he said he would bring Mr. Mortimer, the auctioneer, to prove the spoons were come honestly by; about ten o'clock in the evening he came back again, and said that Mr. Mortimer was busy, and could not come, and he would come the next day; he came the next day, and he said, Mr. Mortimer was still busy, and that I might deliver the spoons; the day after he got an affidavit at Bow-street, that the spoons were his own, and brought a very good tradesman with him, and we delivered up the spoons to him, and have never seen them since.</p>

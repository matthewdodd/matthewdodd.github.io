               <p>Q. How soon after the death of Mr. Storey had you any conversation with the prisoner, with regard to the funds of the deceased, in discharge of the legacies? - A. I suppose it might be near three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appoint him to act for you in town, in such matters as were to be transacted in regard to the estate here? - A. Yes; he offered his services, and I accepted them.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what conversation you had with Mr. Cock respecting the property of the deceased; and particularly, whether you had any respecting the five per Cent Annuities? - A. Yes, we had; because we calculated what the profits of the three and four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280017"></xptr>per Cents would produce, and what the amount of the legacies would be.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Storey had stock in the three and four per Cents as well as in the five per Cents? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. You calculated them, and had conversation with respect to the five per cents? - A. We had.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. That is would be better to postpone receiving the dividends on the five per Cents.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any objection? - A. I did; because the testator ordered the legacies to be paid within three months.</p>

               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether he communicated to you that it was all exhausted and gone? - A. He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of making calculations - look at this, and tell me whether it is the writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he copied this from a similar account which I drew out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any statement respecting the supposed 7000l. five per Cent Annuities? - A. Yes there is.</p>
               <p>Q. He making no observation to induce to believe it was not standing there, copied that paper, and took it by way of direction for his conduct, for the manner in which he was to act, making no observation that there was no such fund to act upon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter and tell me if it is your writing? - A. Yes; except the copy of a letter from John Storey, which was copied by my direction.</p>

               <p>"Respecting the payment of the pecuniary legacies to the legatees, I have duly considered, and the best opinion I can form of the subject is, that they should, agreeable to the will of the testator, be paid immediately to all, as well to the residuary legatees as to the others; it was proposed to leave the legacies to the residuary legatees unpaid until the final share was made, but as that will, from necessity, be some time first, and as the proposed forbearance was on account of interest, I think they had better be discharged at once; the legacies given to the residuary legatees are various in amount, and consequently will be intitled to have a proportion of the accumulated interest; and it would puzzle and perplex much to make such division of the whole, to pay each alike would be unfair; and to pay the whole, at present, each would reap the benefit arising from the legacy in proportion to the worth; if interest was my motive, for this advice I should enjoy that interest; by forsaking my plan, therefore, that cannot interfere; I have no other wish but to do what is right, and simplify the accounts; I wish, therefore, with the approbation of your brother, and Sir

               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of that employment, receive any sum of money for dividends upon any stock? - A. I received 175l. at different periods.</p>
               <p>Q. From what time did you begin to receive 1751.? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.Endeavour to recollect? - A. About four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether your commencing the receipt was in the beginning of the year 1797? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.Endeavour to recollect as near as you can? A. It is impossible to recollect that immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. At what periods did you received those payments? - A. At no precise times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they yearly or half yearly payments? A. Half yearly generally, but there was no precise time.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he pay you them as half yearly payments? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. You acted upon them as such? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue, from the time you first began to receive the same sum annually, to go on receiving it at stated periods, or was there any intervention? - A. At times the payments used to vary.</p>
               <p>Q.Though the time was not precise, was the sum always the same, amounting to twice 1751. annually? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you continued to receive it down to the time of Captain Storey's death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive the 175l. for dividend, after Capt. Storey's death? - A. I found in the banker's book 175l.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with your brother about it? - A. It was passed to my account without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jeffereys.) Is that the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. It is. (Check read.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordships, Gentlemen of the Jury, very little capable at any time of addressing a Jury of my country, I am much less able to do so upon an awful occasion like the present, yet I confess to you my feelings have been considerably relieved by the extreme, liberal and candid manner, in which the Gentlemen have conducted themselves towards me this day, and I am the better enabled to address you, because the result of this enquiry is so different from that which has gone forth to the world, and is so inconsistent, that I humbly look with confidence to an honourable acquittal, and towards being restored by your verdict to Society.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have an important duty to perform; you have either to restore an individual to society, or to send him to certain death; I may say certain death, because we all know that you are the dernier resort, from your verdict there lies no appeal, and I am confident you will weigh it with judgment and with mercy, peculiarly in a case of this sort, where there is no ulterior resort whatever.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I should not have the presumption to address you, if the law of the land had not prevented the learned Gentleman, who has paid such unremitted attention to the case, from doing it for me, he could do me justice in much stronger terms than I can myself; but when I look to the noble Lord, who presides, and to you, Gentlemen, I have nothing to fear; I trust you will allow for the inaccuracies of my speech, and that you will look at the case in all its bearings, and if you are convinced, upon the evidence that has been adduced against me, I am guilty, let me be consigned over to the laws of my country; but if the whole tenor of my life has been according to the rule of right; if I have continued to act upon the principles of honour and honesty, and if the evidence, as far as it has gone, has been consistent with that character which has been gone into, then, Gentlemen, I feel confident in the event of your verdict.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I did think, on the part of the prosecution, there would have been a clear consistent statement before you; I should have thought charging me to have forged this power of attorney, that they would have begun at the foundation of the crime to shew that that power of attorney was forged; they have shewn no such thing, or attempted it; they ought to have gone on, and to have shewn you that the power of attorney, in October, 1800, was a forgery; that they have not done. What is it we then come to? the power of attorney in April, which is charged to be the forgery, and we will go to the evidence on which it is founded. There is one thing before that, because the Gentleman has been pleased to say, that it afforded some strong presumption, and I admit that suspicious circumstances have been laid before you, but unfortunately I have not the opportunity, by evidence, of compleatly elucidating them, but will say, it is bare statement; there is not positive evidence against me. I shall pass over all the different witnesses which have been called as to the entries in the Bank-books for form's fake, and will admit that there was such a sum as 5000l. sold out; the only questions you have to try, are, first, whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280021"></xptr>under a forged instrument, and, in the next place, whether, if it was a forged instrument, I was the perpetrator of it, or uttered it, knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the first material circumstance, I shall observe upon, is this, I take it in all cases, it certainly is not possible to shew the perpetrator of the act; in this case they cannot, for it is impossible to shew the perpetration of the deed; in order to be convinced that an instrument of this fort is a forgery, you will first look to the signature of the party himself, and next to those of the attesting witnesses; what is the evidence, taking the signatures first, I think it is clear, that I was in the habit of confidence sufficient to be intitled to receive under it; I think the gentlemen have produced to you a power of attorney, authorizing me to receive dividends upon the then stock, therefore you have it before you on the shewing of the prosecution, that I was in the confidence of the testator, and was allowed to receive his dividends; was it inconsistent, therefore, that he should allow me to sell it out when necessary? and here I must make an observation upon the evidence of Mr. Packham, who said I had received the dividends on his stock, implying that stock was gone, though it will be found through the whole transaction, his confidence had not been broken in upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is but justice, if it will assist you, to say, that respecting the servants of Mr. Storey's, you conducted yourself with great fidelity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I thank you for correction me, I may have mistaken the evidence. Gentlemen, you have the evidence before you of Mr. Jeffereys, that this hand-writing is not, in his opinion, the hand-writing of Mr. Storey; there is not one single other witness, nor is there an iota of evidence before you that it is my hand-writing. I will now resort to the attesting witnesses - the first is 
               <persName id="t18020428-18-person167">
                  Robert

            , he is called, and from his appearance, he is little conversant in hand-writing; he however denies that he attested it; you will recollect, that it is required at the foot of instruments of this sort, the parties should not merely subscribe their names, but their residence and prosessions; these forms have been complied with, and I should like to know if it is not the handwriting of Packham, why they have not brought you other evidence to shew whose it is; it is not the mere signature of 
               <persName id="t18020428-18-person168">
                  Robert

            , and is it possible for you to conceive if they were written by me, that they would not have got persons to prove it was my writing? They ought to have gone to that point, and shewn to you that it was not merely suspected to be a forgery, but that it was a forgery created by my hand; they have attempted to effect it out of Court, but they failed in effecting it in Court.</p>

             living at Rochester; he tells you there was not. I am not disposed to quarrel with that - but the solicitors who conduct this prosecution were, so soon as the circuit was over, required to give me the names of the witnesses, which was refused, and which, if it had been complied with, I would not have been contented with calling a single tax-gatherer - I should not have stopped there; I should have sent down persons of diligence and activity, and if I found it was impossible to discover them, I should have put One Hundred Pounds Reward in as large figures as they put for my apprehension, and called upon them, for the sake of public justice, to come and speak before you. On this part of the question, I think they have gone a very little way; they have given us very flight evidence indeed, and it merely depends upon the opinion of Mr. Jeffereys, that this is not the hand-writing of Mr. Story, who was a man afflicted with the gout, eighty years of age, and liable to an hundred variations in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The greater part of this case has been occupied by inquiring not so much whether it is a forgery or not, but with reading the correspondence between me and the executors, subsequent to the death of Mr. Storey, all tending to shew most unquestionably that there existed, at the period of Mr. Storey's death, 7000l. stock. I do not mean to deny those representations, they are proved; I would have admitted them, if my Counsel would have permitted me; it is unquestionably true, I have constantly admitted to the executors that 7000l. was there, and have acted upon it as such, and if the thing had remained undiscovered till this moment, I should have continued to do so, but does that prove the charge? The question is, Whether it be a forgery or not? Whether their confidence was broken in upon by the conduct I pursued, and not giving me an opportunity of replacing the money which I acknowledge is converted, but I say there is no proof of forgery, and you have a right to infer from the confidence placed in me by Mr. Storey, with respect to his own dealings, that I might be authorized to transfer any of the stock, and I might have gone on representing it as still standing in the books, whereas it was not; for I wished to keep the deception up, and I did keep it up to the testator till his death.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If there was any idea in my mind that I should be placed in this tremendous situation, is it probable, that on the 19th of August I should be at the Parsonage-house, and every where to be found, and my papers liable to be inspected by every body who chose - is it not more likely, that, after the death of Mr. Storey, I should have gone off with those sands which Mr. Jeffereys intrusted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280022"></xptr>me with? The fact is this, and you ought to try that fact, Whether it be most consistent with my representation, or with the representation made by the prosecution, then you ought to pause, and consider whether it is a forgery, and whether I am the perpetrator of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The probate of the will was produced to you, and I apprehend it may be read in evidence; I defy them to shew that any sum of 7000l. 5 per Cents. is taken notice of by the testator by any one letter or declaration of the testator, that he had such stock, because it does not exist; they cannot prove it - they cannot shew it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There is another thing: When one of the witnesses was asked as to the testator's handwriting to this instrument, the learned Judge was pleased to ask whether he spoke with as much certainly as the subject was capable of? Most undoubtedly, the witness did say, I speak with as much certainly as the subject is capable of.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now given you a few observations, not with that ability with which they would have been given by my Counsel, but in the best manner I am able, considering the agitation of my mind. Hasty, crude, and undigested as they are, arising from my unfortunate situation, I trust you will give such weight to them as you think they deserve. The correspondence between me and Mr. Storey is destroyed, and it is utterly impossible to shew his directions to me; you will give the due weight to me observations I have made, and it only remains for me to address you upon my character - that character has been in part given to and I slatter myslef, those who will be seen here to-day, will not diminsh that which I have received; on that, I am willing to go to a Jury of my country, trussing my life in their hands, and to the law, perfectly satisfied that whatever they do, they will neither injure the one, or sacrifice the other.</p>

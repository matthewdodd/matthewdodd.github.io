            . I was in Princes-street, and saw the prosecutor either fall, or knocked down, but suppose he fell from intoxication - I saw the prisoner go to him, as I supposed, to get him up; and in a minute or two, I saw the watch flying up in the air; the prisoner then left him, and went towards Crown-court, putting something into his pocket - I could not see what it was - I followed him to Crown-court, and took him into a shop; he denied it - I seat for a constable; he then took the watch from his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060074"></xptr>pocket, laid it on the counter, and said he hoped I would let him go - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You think the man fell from intoxication? A. I think so; he was very tipsy; the prisoner said he picked it up.</p>

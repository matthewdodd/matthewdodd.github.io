On the evening of the 2d of August, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner take three large flags out of the street, when the men were gone home; he put them into the yard, under my bed-room window - next morning I heard a noise, and saw him take seven others, and put them with the other three. I gave information at the office, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And was he not bailed? A. I believe he was - I had lodged six or seven months with him; he never gave me notice to quit his premises; he employed a broker to distrain on me after this charge, and he held his fist up at me at the door, and said, he would send his fist through me, because I told about these stones; he did not distrain before this business - I told the gentlemen of it directly it was done, and they told me to go to Mr. Johnson's - I swear he did not distrain before I made the charge - I went and told the gentlemen about this, and then he put the broker in - I did not owe him a farthing; he never employed a broker but once, and that was after I gave the information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not obliged to employ a constable to protect himself? A. I do not know - I never saw a constable; my six children were turned into the street - I was outside in the street - I did not break his window-shutters down, or any thing of the sort; my husband is not here; my daughter is here, who saw the stones taken - I went to make the complaint to an officer in the course of the same day, as he took them - I met the officer in the street, and he told me to go to Mr. Winkfield's - I know Ann Byrne - I never told her the poor Irishman would suffer for the stones which were brought into his yard, nor any body else - nor did I ever say to her, "What a nice lot of stones there is in that yard - the poor Irishmen will suffer for this."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any dispute with the prisoner about rent, or any thing else, till after you told about the stones? A. No - I went to Johnson that day, and by his direction, went to Marlborough-street, and was taken over the way to Mr. Winkfield's office.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the paving of St. James', Westminster. Mr. Joseph Stevenson is one of the paving committee - Queen-street was being paved in August last, and many loose stones were there - I saw Kinsley, and in consequence of what she said, I went to the prisoner's house, and in his back-yard, found eight Yorkshire, and two Berwick stones - I did not see the prisoner there - I saw him at the office - I could not swear to the stones; what passed at the office, was not taken down, I am certain; the prisoner stated there, that the workmen had given him these stones; they had no right to do so; they were of the same quantity and description as those in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. About what value are they? A. Nine shillings; it is not an open yard; there are several lodgers there - I believe many of them are Irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner gone personally to the office to object to something about the paving rate? A. Yes, and there this charge was made; it was the latter end of July I saw Kinsley, and on the 2d of August I saw the stones.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he been summoned for the rate? A. Yes, by the collector, and attended, to show cause against it; he is a slater.</p>

            . I know Kinsley well; she told me there was a nice lot of stones in the yard, and the poor Irishman would be a sufferer for it - I will be on my oath to that - I live in the house; there are six or eight families there: this was the morning after the stones were brought in - I saw a labouring man bring some in, and there were some there before.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were stones often brought there? A. There were some before - I cannot say when they were brought in - the stones were brought in three weeks or a month before the words occurred between the prisoner and Kinsley - I have lived there above twelve months - these stones were brought from his other house, at Westminster - I cannot say where the last were brought from - it was not the prisoner who brought them in - he was taken up three weeks or a month afterwards - the man who brought them never called for them - the broker came in before the last stones were brought - I live in the kitchen - a knock came to the door, and I answered it when the stones came.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She made no complaint for three weeks after they were brought? A. No; they quarrelled on Tuesday - the broker came in on Wednesday - and next day she went to the office.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came you here? A. Merely from curiosity - Byrne was not with me when I heard this - I was in Kinsley's back kitchen - I do not visit such creatures as her; but she called me in, and told me that.</p>

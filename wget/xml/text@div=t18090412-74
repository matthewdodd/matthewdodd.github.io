On the 8th of April the prisoner came to me with some black-lead to sell; I bought the black lead of her; the bacon was on the counter, I observed her take the bacon and put it into her handkerchief; she had a quartern loaf, a candle, and a pipe of tobacco; she bundled the things up and went out of the shop; I followed her, and charged her with having stolen my bacon; when I brought her back she declared she did not know any thing at all of it; it was two pounds of bacon; I sell it for a shilling a pound.</p>

I went into this gentleman's shop, I asked him to buy seven pounds of black lead, I told him it was eight pence a pound; he agreed to give me eight pence a pound; after he had weighed it he emptied it into his drawer and put me down three shillings and sixpence, he said that was plenty, he thought, perhaps I might have stolen it. I never saw the bacon till he came after me; he said you have a bit of bacon of mine; I said I did not know any thing about it; he stooped down and picked up the bacon and called me a thieving whore.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness, the prisoner and another woman came into my mistress's shop to buy a yard of ribband, the other woman bought a yard and the prisoner stole this; I saw her pocket it, she denied it, I said I would search her; she took it out of her pocket and put it upon the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ribband?</p>
               <p>M. Blaney. It was in a drawer that stood upon the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged her with taking the ribband what did she say?</p>
               <p>M. Blaney. She said she was going to pay for the other ribband, and that she did not intend to take it; afterwards she said she would never do so any more, if we would let her go. I found several pieces dropt upon the ground from her go. I saw her put them in her pocket.</p>

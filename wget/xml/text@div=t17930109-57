             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the Bow-street office. I am constable at St. Clement's; he said he had got a warrant, but he could get nobody to serve it; he and I went up to a public house in Lewkener's lane, and he was smoaking a pipe, the first public house down, the sign I don't know; we went in first and the man was not there, about ten or eleven o'clock we went there again, in about an hour and a half after, and then the man was there smoaking his pipe; I told him after the first time he had better go his rounds and cry his clothes and then we would go up again; we went again, and there the man was smoaking his pipe. I knew him the moment I went into the house as soon as I came into the house, the prisoner was there, I told him to put his pipe down he must go with me; he was in the room at the edge of the bar, rather more in the tap room than in the passage; the room was full of men and women; I told him to put down that pipe and go with me; that was the first thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - Three or four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090087"></xptr>Q. Where was the prosecutor? - The prosecutor was just gone in before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you are the man I want, or was it the prosecutor pointed out the man to you? - The prosecutor went in first, and when I went in I said, you are the man I want; I took him on the prosecutor's description.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor point him out to you, or had he given you such a description of him as you could have taken him without? - No, I could not have taken him without his description. He put his pipe down and came directly very quietly, he dropped it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor make any charge of what he had done? - Not to the best of my knowledge; he never said a word, he came as quietly as a lamb; I brought him down to Bow-street, and there I searched him, and I found a sixpence, a penny, two farthings, a knife, an old ragged handkerchief, it had been a neck handkerchief, two leather gloves and a woollen one; the prosecutor knew not of them; the prosecutor had said what kind of a man he was; but I should not have known him except he had been with me; he said, he had been very ill used by a man in a striped coat and green baize apron; he told me this before he saw him; when I saw him at first in the morning his face was red just under his eyes, where the blow had been; he said he had been ill used by a man in a green striped coat and a green baize apron; he said, it would be a charity to serve the warrant for him, for he had not a farthing in the world to bless himself with; but I understood it to be for an assault, and not for a robbery, he said nothing about the robbery till I got to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you understood the man to say that he had been ill used and assaulted, and you did not understand him to speak of the robbery? - I did not, he gave an account of his being ill used at Sir Sampson Wright's door, about ten o'clock Tuesday morning; I did not understand it to be a robbery the first time, he mentioned it the second time that I went to the house for the prisoner, but I cannot swear he did the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to take him the first time you went to take him for an assault? - I did; I never had the warrant in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time what did you know of it? - I thought it was for the same till I got the warrant out into my hand; the warrant was for a robbery. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole of the time you was with him had you no talk about a reward? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this man has been in Court before? - I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether the gentleman did not come and take me out of Parker's-lane, the Bleeding heart? - It was in Lewkener's-lane the first public house in the lane that I took him, on the left hand, the sign I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You went twice into this public house? - I did, it was the first turning in Great Queen-street on the right hand and the public house is the first on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Your warrant I see expresses

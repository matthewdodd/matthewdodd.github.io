I lost three shifts from a lodging house, I brought them home on the 3d of June; on the 4th of June I went out to work, and when I came home, I laid me down on the side of my bed; the prisoner was distressed, had no home nor habitation; I thought she would be an assistant to me, to help my little girl to take care of the children. When I awoke in the morning I missed her out of the room, on the 5th of June I awaked myself, about nine o'clock in the morning. I go out to work, I found her in the necessary, and she had a quartern of butter in her apron; she came in and sat down, and had her breakfast with me; it missed with rain, I said to her, I think I will go and buy me an handkerchief; but it rained, I did not; I heard her say to my little girl, if you don't go for some coals, I will lick you;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260064"></xptr>in the mean while I laid down again, and she took three shifts and three shillings and six-pence out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the shifts in the room when you awoke at nine o'clock? - I did; I had them in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get out of bed? - Yes, I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you lay down again? - I believe about half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your pocket? - Inside of the bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asleep when she took out the pocket? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was three shillings and six-pence in? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take it, nor awake till she got out of the room? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you awake again? - About one o'clock; and she was gone, and three shifts, and three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else access to the room? - Nobody but a child of three years old; he was paddling about the room, and was in the room when I awoke; I found two shifts on the same day, the 5th of June, I found her in Lukener's-lane, and at No. 5, she had got both these shifts on. one on the top of the other. I never found the third nor the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them shifts, and tell us how you know them. - I know them too perfectly well to my sorrow, they are marked.</p>

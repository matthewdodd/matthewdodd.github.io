                  </hi>. In 1866, and part of 1867, I was managing clerk to Mr. Cooper, a solicitor, of Lincoln's Inn Fields—there was at that time a matter in his office of "McGrady v. McCullum"—I produce the record in that action—it was an action on an indenture of July, 1857—I also produce the Judge's order to inspect this indenture—as far as I believe, this is the indenture I inspected, and upon which I instituted the proceedings com<lb></lb>prised in this record—the action was not tried, it was entered for trial in Hilary Term, 1867, and a proposition was mode to settle it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a release signed by McGrady, and witnessed by Mr. Cooper and Mr. Brandon's clerk, the solicitor prosecuting the case—I had several inter<lb></lb>views with McGrady, and told him we were about settling the offer made by Mr. Brandon—I said, "You offered 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full discharge of any claim that he had then, or might have?"—he would not then come to any arrang<lb></lb>ment, but said he would leave and consult his wife—he came back and said that he ought to have a little more, and two days afterwards he agreed to take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his full claim was 1881.—at that time a commission was pending in Bordeaux—the prisoner's son was at Poonah, in India—the prisoner agreed to accept that money, and he signed the release—I read it over to him, and explained that he would have no claim upon any future action against Mr. McCullum—I was compelled to be very particular with him, because he cannot read—it was read over several times to him—I met him twice, the first time was in May, three or four days previous to swearing the affidavit—it was in May, I cannot fix the date—I said, "McGrady, I understand you are going on with McCullum again"—he said, "Yes, I mean to have 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of him"—I said, "You had better be very careful, you know you have signed a release, and you know you have no claim on Mr. McCullum"—he said, "Never mind, I am told that I have, and I shall make the affidavit"—with that he weat with the affidavit into a public-house—that</p>

Brandon, would have the documents—Williamson was occasionally em-ployed in our office to serve writs, he was never a clerk there—I did not swear at Bow Street that he was a clerk—I know that he was charged with perjury as a clerk to Mr. Cooper, and I was a witness on his behalf—you were the prosecuting counsel, and you made a mistake—we prosecuted another clerk in our office, who has been sentenced to penal servitude—I was afterwards instructed by Mr. Cooper to issue a writ against one of the witnesses in the case, for conspiring maliciously to prosecute, and I did so—I was never a clown at a theatre—I have been employed at nearly all the theatres in London as harlequin—after that I went to an attorney, Mr. Newton Charles Wright—Mr. Levy was the last attorney I was with before I went to Mr. Cooper—I have been six yean with Mr. Cooper, on and off—I had a brother named Edward Lewis—I did not personate him at the Bankruptcy Court—he is twice the size of me—I never signed his name there.</p>

LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a commission agent, where are your offices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have none—I carry on my business at various places—I have got a public-house to carry it on at—I do not mean that I am a publican—I do commission business at several public-houses—one is 23,</p>

               <p>Veer Street—I pay no rent for the use of the room—there are several public-houses where I meet my various customers, and I have apartments over the water on the first floor back—my customers call there and make appointments, but have not done so lately—I pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the room—I have only a bed room there—I did business in Vern Street yesterday—I have plenty of books over the water—I kept a kind of diary, but not in an extensive way—I have no banker's book—I knew that McGrady had signed a paper, on his statement—he came after me to this very house in Vere Street, the Crown—I was going to do this transaction on cominission—he paid me nothing for the last affair—my commission was to be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cent, on whatever he recovered—I told Nash that a paper had been signed in reference to the first action—I do not know of my own knowledge what that paper was, but I believed McGrady—I explained to him that he was entitled to bring a fresh action under the agreement between him and McCullum—he showed me a copy of it—it was filed in the Common Pleas Office—I saw by the indenture that it expired in 1867—I told him that he had a right of action upon it after it expired, and I think so—I consider that all the time McCullum kept his boy away from him he was to pay him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I think the affidavit was drawn up at the Mitre Tavern, which is convenient to the Law Courts, and a number of respectable solicitors go there—I will not swear it was drawn up in a public-house—I had nothing to do with drawing it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">WOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At any rate you have served processes for Mr. Cooper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and made his briefs, and conducted cases from beginning to end—I was bound over by the prosecution to attend this trial.</p>

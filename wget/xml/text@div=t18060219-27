             sworn. I am an officer of Worship street office: I produce some snuffer stands, tobacco boxes, patty pans and two tin cannisters; I found them in company with Vickery the officer, in the prisoner's lodgings, on the 13th of this month; the prisoner had been taken up, and brought to the office before the room was searched; I found the articles under the sacking of the bed on the ground.</p>
               <p>- VICKERY sworn. Q. Were you present when Armstrong made the search. - A. I was, they were found under the bed; I produce another tobacco box I found on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mills) Look at these articles. - A. There is a mark on this patty pan, I marked 8 to denote that eight came out of a plate.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they were not sold to somebody. - A. That I cannot say; there is a mark on this paper belonging to the snuffer trays, which we know them by, the tobacco boxes have no mark, they are articles that we make and deal in; I believe them to be the property of Messrs. Howards, I have seen them in the warehouse from time to time; Mr. Howard had information that the prisoner was in the habit of going into Rosemary-lane, and disposing of articles under value; he was asked by the master if he would face the parties, he said he had no objection, he went with my master and me to the office, and when he came to the office he owned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know which way these things came to my lodgings.</p>

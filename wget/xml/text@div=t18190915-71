            . I am a waiter at the Saracen's Head, Snowhill. On the 5th of August Mrs. Stent came there by the Liverpool coach, I shewed her into a room. I wrote a letter for her, which was sent to the post by a porter. She remained in the house all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming that evening - A. Yes; he came and inquired for a young woman who had arrived by the Liverpool coach, I introduced him into the room to the last witness - nobody else was there - she got up to meet him, and I immediately withdrew; not a word was spoken while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any noise - A. In about ten minutes I heard the shriek of a woman, and immediately went into the room; on entering I perceived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150021"></xptr>the prosecutrix lying on her back, the prisoner stood close by her. Turner and Pithouse were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing in his hand - A. A knife laid on the floor - it had blood upon it. I discovered that she was wounded, and went for an officer. I heard her say to him, that she hoped no harm would happen to him for what he had done, for she had been a very base wife, and he was one of the best of husbands. I left the room, and fetched an officer.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Saracen's Head. I remember the prosecutrix coming by the Liverpool coach - she remained there - I did not see the prisoner come. About half-past six I was in the passage, heard the shriek of a woman, and almost instantly another shriek - it came from what we call the large parlour; I and Turner went immediately to the room, found the prosecutrix on her back, and the prisoner with his knees, apparently on her body, or on her side. Turner spoke. I looked, and saw the prisoner had a knife (looks at one), this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing with it - A. I believe it was in his right hand, I saw him stab her in the neck with it, striking it downward; I immediately attempted to take it from him, but missed my hold, dropped it, and picked it up again. After he struck the blow he turned the knife up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have accomplished my purpose, and wish for nothing more but to suffer for it, and I know I shall." She exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"You have, you have, Henry! and I freely forgive you; I hope the law will take no hold of you, and no harm will come to you." She said,</p>
               <p>"Kiss me, pray do, I freely forgive you." He kissed her twice, she returned it, and said he was the best of husbands, and she the worst of wives. She repeated this several times, and said she highly deserved all she had met with. I took her to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her saying any thing as you entered the room - A. She said,</p>
               <p>"Take him away, take him away, or he will murder me." This was after the fourth shriek.</p>

            . I am porter at the Saracen's Head. On the 5th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the passage, and heard the shriek of a female; I went to the room, and was the first who entered, I saw Mrs. Stent on her back - the prisoner had his knees on her stomach, I believe both his knees. He rose as I advanced, I then perceived a knife in his hand, I started back about a yard, and saw him stab her after that in front of her neck; he then said he had accomplished his purpose, and dropped the knife. I desired Pithouse to take care of it, and I would hinder him from escaping. He said he had no wish to escape. I desired Pithouse to send for a surgeon. King then entered the room, and an officer was sent for. I turned to the prisoner, and told him he was a rash man to be guilty of the act he had done, and that in all probability he had signed his own death-warrant; he said that he had cause sufficient, for she had been a base woman to him. She immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, indeed I have been a base woman to one of the best of husbands." She requested to be rose up. I rose her up between my knees, she requested him to take her hand, which he did, and that he would kiss her, which he did, twice. I believe she said she freely forgave him, and hoped her fate would be a warning to all bad wives, or women. The officer arrived, and took him into custody. I took her to the hospital.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the evening of the 5th of August Mrs. Stent was brought there, she was very cold and faint - she had one wound on the lower part of her neck, which penetrated the windpipe - such wounds are attended with danger - it might have caused her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose she had not had surgical assistance - A. I think, considering she was in good health, it might have done well without a surgeon, it is possible, and even probable.</p>
               <p>Q. What other wounds had she - A. A cut in front of the chest - it was a superficial cut; she had a stab in the right breast, about an eighth of an inch deep; she had one wound in the right side, which was a considerable depth, it had passed between the ribs, and had wounded the right lung - this was, most certainly, a dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any discharge of blood from that - A. She had lost and did lose a considerable quantity of blood from it afterwards. She had a trifling wound in her right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one, or all of these wounds together, likely to occasion her death - A. Certainly, that in the lungs was likely of itself to cause her death, I think none of the others were. That which penetrated the wind-pipe would. I think, occasion greater danger than the one on the lungs. I considered her in danger for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a knife as that produced inflict these wounds - A. Yes.</p>

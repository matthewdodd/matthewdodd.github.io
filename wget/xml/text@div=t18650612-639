                  </hi>. I live at 21, Denton-street, King's-cross—on 4th April, prisoner and deceased came to lodge with me—on Friday morning, 5th May, I was with the deceased—between 9 and 10 o'clock the prisoner came in and threw something at deceased—he took hold of her by her throat and hair, and pushed his knee into her stomach, called her a d——bitch, and said he would murder her—she cried "murder," and I did so too, and called my husband—after I had left the room I heard the deceased cry, "Oh, pray don't; pray don't"—my husband went up and tried to get into the room, but the prisoner would not let him—he told him not to kill his wife, and prisoner said he should do what he liked, it was no odds to him, it was only a family quarrel—when the policeman came the deceased would not give the prisoner in charge, she said she only wanted protection—pri<lb></lb>soner went out, and I went into deceased's room, her hair was hanging over her shoulders, and she was crying very much—she had been ill before from his ill-usage—there was some hair lying about the room, and a broken comb.</p>

I live at 20, Denton-street, next door to where the deceased lodged—on the 5th of May I heard great confusion and screaming and groaning, and afterwards I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I could not tell who it was screaming—it was a female's voice—I went into the house where deceased lodged, and went to her room—the door was fastened—the prisoner opened it—I said, "What do you call this? do you mean to murder your wife?"—he said, "I have a right to chastise my wife when she is gossiping"—her hair was all down, and on the floor was a piece of comb with hair on it—she was crying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields. I have been separated from him three years, and have only seen him once since, which was on the 20th of May, two years ago, at the burial of my child—when we were together we lived in Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane—I left him and went to lodge in Prescot-street—last Monday evening three weeks he came up to my room—I was quite alone and was doing nothing, as it was the first day of our new year, which is a holiday—the door was just on the close—he pushed it open, came in, and stood before me, with his coat open, and his hands under his coat—I had two lights burning on the table—he said, "I want some victuals," and not having seen him so long I was rather startled at seeing him—I said, "How can you come on such a night as this, to ask me for victuals, when neither I nor my family have had a dry crust from you these three years?"—he then took a knife and held it towards me—I took my right-hand and grasped the blade, and he tried to draw it from me, but I firmly held it—he then rushed on me with another knife, which he had also under his coat, and knocked down the lights, and I was in the dark—he cut me on the chin with that knife—I was still holding the other knife fast—my right-hand was cut and bled very much, with holding the knife—I saw the second knife coming towards me before I was cut on the chin—I still held the first knife in my hand and screamed loudly—MRS. Holland came to my assistance with a light, and then Mepham came—they caught hold of him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190054"></xptr>
               <p>and brought him out on the landing-place—I was so frightened, I believe I still held the first knife in my hand when the other was taken from him, and I said, "O my God, are there two knives?"—he still had one knife grasped in his hand when I said that—I had never seen either of the knives before—there were none on the table when he came in—there was a cloth on the table; in honour to our holidays and sabbaths, we never keep a table uncovered—I struggled with him before any one came in, I think for about a quarter of an hour, or very likely not so much, but it appeared to me a great age—I had had tea about six o'clock—this was after that—my daughter had tea with me—she is, I believe, thirty years of age—she was not with me when this happened—she had left about a quarter of an hour, to go on a message into the next street—there had been no quarrel between me and the prisoner since I saw him two years ago—I never met with him and never spoke to him—I had never sent any messages to him, or received any—he never resented my leaving him—we had lived middling happy before I left him.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not I bring up the children for thirty-one years, and provide for you in respectability, and with hard work and honesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not like to say—you did, but in what manner I am almost ashamed to say—about fourteen years back you left me in my confinement, with a baby a month old, and six children—the children's education never cost you a penny—they were trained by the free-school—when I left you did not support me—I went out into the street, and stood in frost and snow with fruit to support my children—I supported them—what you sent me would not keep the baby at the breast—you did not help to teach the children different trades—you never would study for the children—it was me that lived in the greatest poverty, to strive for them, to get them what they know—I had no money to give you—I did not run away from you three years ago and strip the place—I took away what belonged to my eldest daughter, what she bought—I have not a thing but what my children have purchased between them—I have five children living—I have lost one—the four children are able to support me and their little brother by their in<lb></lb>dustry and my little assistance—you told me if I would leave you I might go, for you would not keep me, and you would keep the two boys—I was only gone one night, when you sent a neighbour with the little boy, with a message, that you would pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for him, but I never received a farthing—the other boy you kept for twelve months, and then you were taken very ill, and went to the hospital, the boy came to me, and I have kept him ever since, till I got him into an asylum, about eight months back—I did not encourage the boy to rob you while he was with you—when you asked me for a bit of victuals, I said, "How can you come and ask me on such a night as this for victuals?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said, "How do you know I have got any?"—I said "Because I know you have had some of my money given to you"—you said, "Before I give you any victuals I will stick that knife into your guts." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never used such a word in ray life—the young man that courted my daughter, never came at unseasonable hours in the night, for you would not allow the door to be opened after eleven o'clock—he never kept us up till three o'clock in the morning—he never came later than eleven o'clock—he brought her home one night at eleven o'clock—you said, "If you come at this hour again I will charge the police with you"—he is a very respectable young man—you applied to the High-Priest for a divorce, but he would not give it you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as Mrs. Moss—I heard her crying out "Murder," and went to her room—MRS. Holland had got there before me—I passed her at the room-door, and on looking into the roam, Mrs. Holland held a light up—I looked under her arm, and saw the prisoner's arm raised above his head, and saw the blade of the knife—I then rushed in on him, and took hold of the wrist of his right hand, which he had the knife in—I took him by the neck with my left hand, and took the knife from him—MRS. Moss was crying "Murder, murder; don't let him go," and I detained him on the landing till the police came—she complained of being cut in the chin and in the hand—the prisoner said, "Give me in charge," two or three times—he did not give any explana<lb></lb>tion of what had taken place—MRS. Moss did not say in his presence how it had happened—I saw another knife, either in Mrs. Moss's hand or Mrs. Holland's—they were small table-knives—the prisoner stood with his back towards me when I first saw him, and his arm raised, and the knife above his head—he was close to the prosecutrix—they had hold of one another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to the prosecutrix's room, and saw the prisoner there, and several other persons—MRS. Moss said, in his presence, that he had brought two knives to murder her—she was bleeding from the hand and chin, and said her husband had done it—she handed me the two knives, and said they were what her husband cut her with—I asked the prisoner if they were his knives—he said no—I asked him no more questions—I asked Mrs. Moss if she gave him into custody—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if the knives belonged to her—she said "No"—I took him into custody—he did not speak all the way to the station—house—when he got there be complained of a small cut in his fin<lb></lb>ger, which he said was done in the scuffle—there was blood on one of the knives—when Mrs. Moss charged him with the act, I do not recollect that he made any answer to it.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner made a long defence, the same in substance as his cross-ex<lb></lb>animation of the prosecutrix, and stated that the knives were both upon her table, that she made a thrust at him with one, and in struggling to get it from her, it touched her chin—that they both cried murder, and assistance came.</hi>)</p>

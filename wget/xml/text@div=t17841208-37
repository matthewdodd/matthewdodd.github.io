I said no; then he went out, and came back again; says he, I will leave the message with you; the parlour door was locked, I could not go in there, so I went up stairs, and he wrote on a paper, and he chucked it to me, there says he, can you read that, yes, says I, and he put his apron over my eyes, and he said, Charles come up; with that I tried to get the apron from over my face, and I just saw the glimpse of his coat, but I did not see him to know who he was; then they put me into the cellar, and told me if I spoke a word, so that any body could hear me, they would cut my throat for me, and while they were committing the robbery, Warner came down and asked me where my master was, I told him he was gone into Bishopsgate-street, and would be back in a quarter of an hour; I did not say he was gone to church; they took some table spoons and tea spoons, and a silver pepper box, and six china plates, and three table cloths, and seven dozen movements, they were in the shop up stairs, the others were in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>About eleven o'clock, the little boy came to my lodgings, which were in Aldersgate-street, and said there were thieves in the house; I ran after him, and he shut the street door after him, and I got in at one of the parlour windows and looked round, and the dining room had been forced, and a piece had been cut out, the back shop was broke open, because that was always locked, I had locked it myself, that door was stove open the door had been forced, and the staple fallen out; by this time the boy returned with the constable; I asked him if he knew any thing of that door being open, he said no; the people went, and I staid with the boy till Mr. Noakes came in; I ran up stairs into the shop, and I missed a deal box, and looking on the board, I saw some articles which I knew; I have a very perfect knowledge of all the movements; I immediately wrote them down on a piece of paper, and gave them to Mr. Noakes: I went the Wednesday morning to Warner's lodgings with the constable, and there was the very deal box found; it is my master's property, and which I left in the shop; locked up, on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Did you hear either of the prisoners say any thing when they were taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to them? - Not as I know of; Warner was examined by himself first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles: I believe Warner asked the Justice if his evidence would clear him? - The Justice said he could make no promises; he said he would give very satisfactory answers to every question he asked, and the Justice asked him about the things, where they were sold, he told immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080110"></xptr> that they were sold to one Levy, a Jew, and the movements for one guinea and a half, he had received a guinea, and was to go for the rest: I was at the first examination of Johnson, but he denied every thing.</p>
               <p>Do you know the value of these movements? - They were valued at twenty pounds fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. What led to any suspicion against Warner? - Johnson was taken up on the Tuesday evening, and Warner was well known as a companion of Johnson's.</p>
               <p>Nothing was found but the deal box? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. You was at your master's house on Saturday night? - Yes, and I locked up the room, and laid the key on a table in the passage.</p>
               <p>Whether your master opened the door or not, between the Saturday and the Sunday, and removed those movements, you cannot tell? - No.</p>

               <p>I am master to the two last witnesses; about half after ten, my wife and me went out, I took the key.</p>
               <p>Was all safe when you went out? - I do not know, I did not go up stairs; nobody could go in, I had the key in my own room; I immediately ran up stairs, and saw the box that we used to keep some unfinished work in, was taken away, and the movements gone; the value of them was twenty pounds fourteen shillings. The prisoner Johnson had been with me upwards of three years, he was with me an errand boy before I bound him; I never saw the other boy: I saw the box at Warner's lodgings, and owned it immediately. The prisoner Johnson, upon being first charged, boldly denied it, and again he denied it before the Magistrate, at last, in consequence of what Warner had said, that he had sold the coffee pot, he then says, now you know all, I may as well tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Was this confession taken down in writing? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Warner, before this confession? - No, I never spoke a word to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warner. I am not guilty of the fact, they told me I should be sure of being cleared, if I spoke the truth; I said that he and I did this robbery.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Poole said, lad, I would have you confess the whole before the Justice, and you will find mercy in the Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I shall sum up the case independent of the confession.</p>

               <p>I am quite innocent, I never was nigh the place, I had not been that way before for three weeks; when I was brought before Justice Blackborough, they persuaded me to own it, says they, if you know any thing, speak; says, I I am quite innocent of the robbery, I never was nigh the place.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Warner called one more witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 15th of November, the prisoner Warner came to our house, either to have a screw wheel changed, or to ask for one, he said, it was for one of Mr. Jackson's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080111"></xptr> watches; he came in with his hat in his hand, I took particular notice of him, as he was dressed very genteel, he had on a blue coat, with yellow buttons; I asked him the number of teeth, I remember what sort of wheel I gave him, and he went away: the coffee-pot was not missed till the Saturday following, the spoons were missed before.</p>

               <p>We generally have coffee on Sunday morning for breakfast, but the coffee-pot was put in a particular part of the closet, where any body might go twenty times and not see it; we did not know what day it was gone, but by the confession of one of the prisoners; Johnson said, the coffee-pot was knocked to pieces; he said, I dare say the plate is all knocked to pieces, for I saw the coffee-pot was all knocked to pieces, but I can get some of the movements.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Johnson. Why should he tell such a falsity.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. What I said is truth; he said, he had sold it, it weighed sixteen ounces at four shillings an ounce; and he said, he would knock it to pieces before his face.</p>
               <p>- POOLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present when the prisoner Johnson said, before the magistrate, that he saw the coffee-pot knocked to pieces, it weighed sixteen ounces, at four shillings an ounce, Warner and he were both together with the plate; Mr. Levy was taken into custody, we found nothing at Levy's.</p>
               <p>- PALMER sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Johnson say any thing about this matter? - I was sent for by the Magistrate, and he desired me to go to the person, and he granted a search warrant, I heard Johnson say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Johnson. I never had the coffee-pot, nor ever said these words that were repeated.</p>

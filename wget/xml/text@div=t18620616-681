                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, carrying on business at 110, Wood-street, Cheapside—the prisoner was in my service as a porter, and had been so for about four years—in March last I was in Germany, and during that time it was the prisoner's duty to superintend my business—he was empowered to make sales and receive money—he had not to keep my books; merely if a parcel was sold it was his duty to enter it—the amount entered on 26th March is 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of the cheque is 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 28th there is an entry of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for velvet—I had given the prisoner special directions not to sell that velvet at less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—when I came back I inquired about it—there are two amounts of this other invoice of 2d April, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., altogether 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. consists of three items, it. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find no entry on 3d April of those amounts—I returned about the 27th, and missed two pieces of velvet—I asked the prisoner about them, and he told me that Mr. Davis had bought two pieces of green, to which he called my attention, and he had sent the others on memorandum—I inquired at what price, and he said "A shilling per yard"—I desired him to go and fetch them back that same day, and he brought me word the next morning that it was too late, and then made an entry of one piece of fifty-four yards, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard; that is the same thing that is charged 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the invoice; as to the other amount in April for the second piece he said he was not to have an answer for two or three days—on the morning of 9th April he brought me word that the second piece was kept, and handed me the money, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was for thirty-four yards at a shilling, that is all I have received—the amount charged was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the invoice—the cheques were never handed over to me—this signature is not mine; it is the prisoner's handwriting—I never gave him authority to endorse any cheques.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he made sales for you in your absence, what was he to do with the money that he so received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hand it over to my friend who was in the warehouse, while I was away, Mr. Whitehouse—he is not here—the cheques made payable to order were to be kept till I returned, and the money paid into my bankers'—I keep a bankers' book—I have not got it here.</p>

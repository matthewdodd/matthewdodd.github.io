On the 26th of June, I was called up about half-past twelve, or near one o'clock in the night. I opened my window and saw a man outside who desired me to come down stairs - the prisoner at that time was struggling with the police - I went down and found three shutters removed, and a square of glass broken in the window, there had been a great many brass cocks in my window, within the reach of the broken glass - the house had been quite secured the night before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner an entire stranger to you? A. Quite.</p>
               <p>- MORRIS. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Whitechapel, and in going down Whitechapel-road, I turned my head, looked across the road and observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040042"></xptr>Mr. Norbury's shutters down. I stood still a second or two, and heard glass fall on the pavement; I walked across and saw the prisoner accompanied by two women, standing close to Mr. Norbury's window, where the shutters had been removed; I saw him take something out of the window and give it to the women - I could not see what it was- I immediately took him into custody; he made dreadful resistance, but I never lost sight of him.</p>

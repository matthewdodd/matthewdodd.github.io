                  </hi>. I live at 9, Mint-street, Southwark. On 6th Jan., about half-past one o'clock in the night, I went to the King's Arms, in Mint-street, with my brother-in-law, Joseph Evans, who is not here, to get my supper—I went in front of the' bar—I saw the prisoner, and three more young men—they called one another <hi rend="italic">Walley, Buffer.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goosey</hi>—the prisoner was with them—he had nothing in his hand then—I called for half a quartern of rum for me and my brother-in-law—I heard one of the men, I do not know which, say, "<hi rend="italic">Buz;</hi>" and instantly the prisoner seized me, and struck me three times on the head with a pint-pot, which caused me to fall to the ground—we had not spoken a word to either of them—I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket, and screamed out, "Murder!" but nobody came—I held his arm—we struggled on the ground—one of his accomplices caught bold of my throat, so that I could not scream, while the prisoner escaped—I had never seen him before—I bad six half<lb></lb>crowns, fourteen shillings, and four sixpences in my right trowsers pocket—it was all gone—I got up, ran out, and screamed, "Police!"—I met the police—as I ran out I met Ellen Moor, my servant, but I did not stop to bear what she had to say—I went to surgeon Downes—my head was bleeding most violently—I went before a Magistrate next day—my brother-in-law was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Squibb's service. I went to the public-house to fetch him home on this morning, between one and two o'clock—I heard no words, but just as I got inside I saw the prisoner strike Mr. Squibb with a pint pot, as he stood at the bar with his brother-in-law—I saw three other men there—my master instantly fell to the ground; a mob surrounded him—the prisoner had a pint pot in one hand, covered with blood—my master held him by the band, and screamed out, "Police"—one of the mob caught hold of him by the throat, and the prisoner got away—they then let my matter loose; he got up, ran out,</p>

               <p>and called for the police—his head was pouring in blood—the other men fled—I saw the prisoner next morning at Stone's-end police-station—I saw the prisoner throw the pot into the street; a boy picked it up; there was blood on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 6th Jan., between one and two o'clock in the night, Squibb came to the house with three females and a male—the females called for rum, and paid me for it, and then afterwards he called for a quartern of rum—I drew it—he did not pay—I asked him to do so, and he said he had no money in his pocket, but he had plenty at home<lb></lb>he requested Mrs. Evans, who was there, to pay for it—she refused—Squibb's wife was there, I took a pint pot out of her hand, because I saw her strike some person on the head—they were all very tipsy—they were in front of the bar, and I was behind it—I could see everything that went on, and can say positively that the prisoner did not strike any one—no one went away before this affray—they all left direetly the policeman came—he turned them all out together, but the prisoner left by himself—I heard some party say he had lost his money and his watch—I think it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but another person said 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was only one complaint of money being lost—I heard no other observations made by anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Squibb; between one and two o'clock on this morning, I was standing in front of the bar of the King's Arms—I was there all day; I was in the bar-parlour—Squibb came in after one, or between one and two; there were some women with him—I cannot say whether he had a jug in his hand; I believe he had not—they were stand<lb></lb>ing at the bar, drinking when a man named Evans, who I believe is a rela<lb></lb>tion of Squibb's, came in and stood conversing with Squibb and the women some short time—he said, "I have got a little account, or a little business to settle," or some words to that effect; and immediately took off his hat, gave it to a person to hold, and knocked a man down who was standing by the side of the beer-engine—an altercation took place immediately, and Squibb and these women immediately commenced an attack on him while he was on the ground—the landlord came immediately from behind the bar, and I with his assistance parted them—an altercation occurred again immediately; the prisoner came in at that time, and seeing the man down, lent him assistance so as he should not be ill-used—the prisoner did not strike him, he was immediately knocked down himself—Squibb and the women who were with him ill-used him as much as they possibly could, till the landlord was obliged to call in the police to quell the disturbance, and a general fight took place; they were all fighting then—Squibb said nothing then about his loosing his watch and money; not in my hearing—</p>

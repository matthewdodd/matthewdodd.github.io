                  </hi>. I am a malt factor, and live in Queenside. On the afternoon of the 27th of October I was in Thames-street, opposite Laurence Pountney-lane—I felt something at my pocket—I turned round, and missed my pocket-handkerchief—I saw the prisoner close to me on my right hand—I charged him with taking it, and took hold of him instantly—I found his hand in his right-hand jacket pocket, and found my hand-kerchief in his pocket, with his hand on it—I gave him in charge—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. On the 27th of October the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody—I asked how he came to take the handkerchief—he said he was going to Billingsgate to meet his sister—that this was the first time, and that a boy had given it to him.</p>

On 15th Oct this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to the counter by the prisoner, about half past 11 o'clock—it had been previously stopped by Lady Shaw, and I asked him where he brought it from; he rather hesitated, and said that some person had given it to him to get changed—he was taken into an inner room, and Lady Shaw, who happened to be there at the time, gave him into custody.</p>

I drew this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Tuesday, 13th Oct., before I left Brighton, intending to change it if I wanted it, but I did not—it was in my porte-monnaie, where I had a half sovereign and some silver—on the Wednesday I went to Messrs. Hoare's, as I was going out of town next day, and got change for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there Were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I put them, in their house, into a small worsted purse, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi>—the cheque was then safe, for I took it in my fingers—I also had a penny piece, and I put them all into my pocket together, at a little before 1 o'clock—I walked up Chancery Lane to a friend's house in Bedford Place, and have no impression of anything touching me during that walk—I went in the evening to a meeting about the Indian sufferers, and when I came home I missed my money.</p>

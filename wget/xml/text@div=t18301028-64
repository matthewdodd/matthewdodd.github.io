I took the prisoner out of the workhouse - he has been with me about seven years - I discharged him once, and he applied to me again; I then gave him 12s. a week - I knew I was being robbed, but I did not suspect him till the time in question, which was on Saturday evening, the 2nd of October; I saw this shaving-pot on a shelf where some cast-iron goods were set - I knew it had no business there, unless some person meant to carry it away; I sent the prisoner to get the beer, and said I would see the place set to rights, and either in going up stairs or coming down, he took this article away- a person came after he was gone for an article; I turned my eye to the shelf, and missed this article - I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and asked where he was; they said in the wash-house - I went and told him I missed something from my warehouse; he said "I know nothing of it"- I then told him what it was, and he said it was in his hat; I took the hat, and found a cabbage-leaf, and under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280033"></xptr>it this shaving-pot - I then found another leaf, and under it these other articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you not a good opinion of him? A. Yes; I have somethimes eight persons or more in my manufactory; there is no private-mark on this pot - it is not my manufacture; I sell a great many at times - they are worth about 1s. 6d.; I always paid him regularly till lately, when I found if I paid him on Saturday night he had none on Monday; I then let him have 6s. or 7s., and draw the rest in the week - he had no goods in lien of money; I had paid him 8s. that night - I now owe him 4s.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner, and in going to the lock-up house he requested to walk by my side, which he did - we crossed some ruins, and when we got near the station he started off; I pursued him - his hat fell off, and he was taken by a Police-officer - I found this kaleidoscope in his pocket; this cash-box was in his box at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. HAYLTON. These are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath, had you not contracted to sell the prisoner these very things for 1s. 6d.? A. No, Sir - he asked me the price of them, and I said 1s. 6d., which he said was too dear.</p>

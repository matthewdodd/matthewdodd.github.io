            . I know the prisoner, and know his wife. I was out with the deceased all the afternoon of Monday the 6th of March. I don't know the name of the street where we were, but it was near Clare Market: we returned home to Orchard Street, Westminster, about eight at night, we ate a bit of supper, and I parted with her just at ten o'clock at night, her husband was not at home then: after we came home I went out to see for him, but could not find him; when I returned, the deceased told: me, he had been at home, and was gone to Tottlefields to the Three Gardeners. At ten o'clock I left the deceased alone, she was in liquor, she had drank several glasses of brandy and gin, she was apt to he in liquor, and was very quarrelsome when she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she use to quarrel with?</p>
               <p>Coster. Chiefly her husband, I believe any body that came in the way.</p>

               <p>Q. Was her husband apt to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Coster. Not very often, as ever I heard; I never heard that he behaved amiss to her, I never heard that they lived unhappily: I was frequently with them.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination. she said, that she heard the prisoner say, that the deceased struck him first, and that when she was in liquor she would strike any body that affrented her: the witness said, that she has seen the deceased take up the poker, and offer to strike him; and that she was very passionate</p>

            . I keep the sign of the Wheat Sheaf, in New Tottle Street. I have known the prisoner five or six years. He came to my house on Monday the 6th of March, about six at night as near as I can recollect, he staid till near eleven, he drank some gin and water, but not a great deal. About eleven o'clock I got up to shut the windows, while I was shutting the windows, the deceased came in, and asked him to go home, and they went home together. I could see Beets had been drinking, he was what we call half and half, he was rather concerned in liquor: I cannot say how the deceased was, I did but just see her. In about the space of ten minutes the deceased returned, and asked if her husband had been at my house again. I told her he had not, and asked her, whether he had out-run her, or some such word. She said, he was gone some where or other, that he was a little in his airs. I believe the prisoner to be a very honest man; he was not a quarrelsome man; he was as quiet a man as ever I was in company with in my life; he was so far from being quarrelsome he would rather endeavour to unite people together who had any words.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear when she came the second time?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I cannot give any account of her, I thought her quite sober, I just passed two or three words with her.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Orchard Street, Westminster. On Monday the 6th of March, as I was calling the hour of twelve by the prisoner's door, I saw a serjeant, (I believe it was the prisoner, I am not much acquainted with him) on the steps, he knocked at the door once or twice; I believe somebody answered, I did not hear them, I supposed so, by what he said: he said, d - n you for a bitch, I will be your butcher, or, will butcher you, one or the other, I cannot say which; then the door was opened, he went in, and shut it. I came back, after I had been my beat, and listened at the door, for fear there should be any words, but I heard nothing.</p>

            . I am wife to serjeant Mackey; we lodge in the fore parlour of the prisoner's house. On Monday the 6th of March, about eleven at night, I heard the deceased go out: she came in again in about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes by herself: about twelve o'clock I heard the prisoner come home, I did not hear him knock at the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260038"></xptr>Q. How do you know that he came home at that time?</p>
               <p>Mackey. I heard Mrs. Beets speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that when he was in the house, or out of the house?</p>
               <p>Mackey. In the house, I heard his foot come in, to the best of my knowledge. I heard Mrs. Beets in the passage say, God rot you, I will heave all that is on the table in your face. I heard her desire him to bolt the street door. He said, he would not, or did not mean that, I don't know which was the words. Then Mrs. Beets said, God rot you, if you don't shut the parlour door, I will throw all the things on the table in your face. Mr. Beets said, God d - n your drunken soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be quarrelling together.</p>
               <p>Mackey. I heard no more, I heard the back parlour door shut directly; about a quarter of an hour after. I heard a foot go down the kitchen stairs, I don't know whether it was a man or woman's, in about two minutes after I heard the other go down, I did not know who they were, they came up both together, I heard no words at that time: when they came up the cellar stairs, I heard one go towards the street door and the other towards the parlour door; I heard the one that went towards the parlour door go afterwards towards the street door; then I heard Mr. Beets ask Mrs. Beets to come in; she was got without the street door, and the door pulled to after her; she said, I won't, I did not hear him make any answer to that; but I heard the flap of a hand three or four times, as if upon the back of another person; I could not distinguish whether it was the husband upon the wife, of the wife upon the husband, I heard only the found; then they both came in together, I heard the found of both their feet together; they went into the parlour and shut the door, I did not hear any thing more pass between them; not one word; about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I heard a foot come out of the parlour, and go down the kitchen stairs; it did not stay long below; I cannot be sure how long I was a-bed at this time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was an hour, or less than an hour.</p>
               <p>Mackey. It was not a quarter of an hour, I heard the person come up again and go into the parlour it staid near ten minutes, then I heard a foot go out at the street door and pull the door after them; I could not distinguish by the tread whether it was man or woman; I heard no noise, no words, nor blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have heard them if there had been any.</p>
               <p>Mackey. I don't know: I have lived two years in the house, I never heard any words between them, I have seen her in liquor sometimes, I don't know any thing of her behaviour, she used to pass and repass me, I cannot say whether she was quarrelsome at those times.</p>

I belong to Mr. Jordan, I went with him to this house on the morning the woman was found dead, I believe it was on a Tuesday morning, I do not know the day, about half after nine we heard of it at our office; when I went into the house, I saw a woman that lay dead in a gore of blood, she lay on her left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her right arm?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot positively say, her leg was drawn up, there was a great quantity of blood, she was quite stone dead, quite cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the blood?</p>
               <p>Jones. By her face and all round.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in any other part of the room?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, round the bed: the prisoner was not at home, there were my master and I and a concourse of people, we went into the kitchen where the soldiers ammunition was kept, and I found these things, (producing a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, two pair of stockings, one pair of shoes and a hanger in a Sheath) they are bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you draw the hanger?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, it was smeer'd and there was a spot of blood upon it, it had been wiped there has nothing at all been done to it since.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the regiment, I have known the prisoner ten years; he behaved extraordinary well, in my opinion, I was with him shooting that very afternoon: we parted about a quarter before nine. I have been at his house, he treated his wife very well; she was a woman of a very haughty temper, I have seen her in liquor; I never saw any quarrel between them. I look upon him to be achumane a man as any in the army.</p>
               <p>Q. To Armstrong and Lees. Did you know the woman?</p>
               <p>Both. Yes, we looked upon it they lived upon good terms: she was a little given to drinking.</p>

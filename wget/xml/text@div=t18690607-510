                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and have chambers at 11, King's Bench Walk, Temple; the prisoner has been laundress at my chambers for some years—I had occasion to discharge her in December—I had missed a great quantity of articles—I have looked at the things produced, and believe them to be mine—the sheets have my name written on them in full—I never save the prisoner any authority to pawn them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never intended stealing these things; I merely pat them away because I was in distress at the time, and required a little money. I fully intended to return them. I asked Mr. Brickwood several tunes when he wished to discharge me to allow me to remain, and I would return the things; he said he would see me d—d to hell first. On another occasion, he said if I did not leave the house he would kick me out, or get a policeman to turn me out, and the sooner I left the house the better. He might have given me in charge then. I told him I would have the law of him, and he said, "Burn the law, and you too; I know plenty of law that will finish you."</p>

                  </hi> I am a hawker, and a bricklayer and plasterer, and live at Uxbridge. On the 13th of Sept. it was raining—I was standing under la tree in the Uxbridge-road—the prisoner came to me—we went to a beer-shop; the Prince of Wales—I took a piece of brown Holland from my pocket, with thirteen sovereigns and a half in it, tied up with a bit of twine—I put it into the same pocket again—the prisoner sat in the chimney-corner—she saw me take money out of the same pocket to pay my reckoning—I stopped there through the evening with the rest of the company—at night I went up stairs to bed—the prisoner followed me up—I told her she had better go about her business, I did not want her there—I undressed my-self, and I packed my clothes under my head—I do not know that she was there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200018"></xptr>
               <p>then, but she was there very soon afterwards—she told me she should come to bed too—I had told her before that I did not want her there—I had seen her whispering to a man that she called cousin—she laid on the bed—she had taken off part of her things—I put the candle out—I went to bed be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven o'clock—I went to sleep, and awoke about three in the morning—I then missed my clothes from under my head—the prisoner was gone, and the window open—it is twelve feet or more from the ground—a shaw! was torn in half, and one of her aprons was torn, and fastened round a wooden spout on the top of the window—I had seen that apron on the pri<lb></lb>soner—I rang for the landlord, and found my clothes under the bed—I could not find the piece of Holland that the sovereigns were in—we got a police-man, went after the prisoner, and found her very much intoxicated in a gin<lb></lb>shop at Paddington—she had some silver in her hand, and was waving it about, and said she did not care—she saw me, and went to another door—the officer brought her out—she declared she never saw me before—she called me William, and she said, "Feel in your waistcoat pocket, and you will find a penny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> and a half-sovereign; I took it from the servants; you will find it there"—we took her to Uxbridge—she said she was very sorry she robbed me, that she would not bring anybody else into it; and if she was allowed to go with me, she would show me the man she gave it to, to take care of—a sovereign was found on her—she cried very much, and said she hoped I would forgive her, and if she had known I meant to take a policeman after her she would have taken every penny I had, and I should not have had a thing to put on my back—I did not know her before.</p>

               <p>three days—I put them into the cloth at Marlow, where I sold the last of the herrings—I had not been drinking a good deal that evening—I did not have above four pints of beer the whole evening and afternoon—I had not taken anything to drink before two o'clock, except some coffee.</p>

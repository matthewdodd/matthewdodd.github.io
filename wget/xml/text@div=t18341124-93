                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, John Richards' Mary Davis was in our employ to purchase old phials, and to wash and guage phials—she had been with us six or seven years—on the 21st of November, about half-past she o'clock in the evening, I placed myself in a gateway, where I could have a view of the prisoner Haxton, who I saw waiting about at the corner of Dorset-street, opposite our warehouse—she went to the warehouse door, and knocked three times—the door was imme<lb></lb>diately opened by Davis, who handed out a bundle, which Haxton took hold of—I jumped upon her, and said, "I have caught you at last"—she quitted the bundle, and Davis took it back—I pushed Hoxton into the room, and Davis fell on her knees and said, "Oh, my God! my God! Mr. James; I am very sorry"—Haxton said, "You cannot hurt me; you did not see the phials in my hand"—the bundle had not then been opened—she afterwards asked me what I thought the magistrate would do so her—there is a bell to that warehouse door, which should ring when it is opened, but it did not ring—a person inside could prevent it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he strike him. - A. He struck him on the head.</p>
               <p>A. Who struck him. - A. This Adams struck Lee on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it was that man, a man came running out of the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That man that came running out of the house struck Mr. Lee. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him. - A. Yes, he gave him two blows, I think; it was with an iron instrument; after he struck Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee fell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he lodged it at his side. - A. He drawed the instrument from his side, and struck Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the weapon in his hand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by lodging it on his side. - A. He hauled his hand from his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he listed up his hand with a weapon, and struck Mr. Lee, is that what you mean. - A. Yes; he struck Mr. Lee and he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Now describe the weapon as well as you can. - A. It was a square weapon, a square bar about three feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it square the whole way up, the whole length. - A. All the way up.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was square the whole way up, it was the same thickness the whole way up, what was the colour of it. - A. It appeared to be black.</p>
               <p>Q. After he brought Lee to the ground what did this person do. - A. Then he began upon me and struck me upon several places upon the head; there is the dent upon my hat; he struck me upon my head several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you to the ground. - A. I ran, and he ran after me, beating me about my back, about three hundred yards, till I was so hurt by the beating in my loins, I was obliged to drop from the blows I received.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you at all judge what this weapon was made of. A. Iron.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he struck you upon the head, what effect did it produce upon your head. - A. One cut, of about two inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were confined by reason of the blows some time. - A. About a couple of months; Mr. Tatem attended me, Mr. Maxfield's assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you cut on any other part of your body besides your head. - A. I was bruised, not cut; this is the hat I had on, it is cut in two or three places by the blows I received from the man (The hat shown to the court and jury.)</p>

               <p>Court. You said there were more cuts than one, I do not see more than one. - A. There is one cut just below of the same side where the other cut is; one cut is near to the crown, it is cut right through, and the other cut is near the band.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did these blows render you senseless. A Yes, for a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in where his happened. - A.In the parish of Stepney in the hamlet of Poplar</p>
               <p>Court. I understood from you that this appeared to you to be done by a square bar of iron. - A. Yes. This is the handkerchief I had on and this is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your head was cut. - A. The right side of my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did the person say any thing to you at the time. - A. Not a word; only repeating them words, d - your eyes I will learn you to come this way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the cut in your head occasioned by the blow that made that hole through your hat. - A. Yes, it was the upper blow in the hat that occasioned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Do you know who that woman was. A. I never saw the woman before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he is the man that can swear I did it or not.</p>
               <p>Court. He has not said it, that depends upon other evidence.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEE. Q. You are headborough of Poplar. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty on the 19th of June last in company with Mr. Barret. - A. Yes, I went with him on that night to Noble-street, about the hour of twelve; we met a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you got there. - A.We went up Noble-street; the second time I was at the left hand of Mr. Barret; there was a woman standing facing of Mr. Barret and me, on the other side of the way; Mr. Barret said, good woman what business have you in the street at this time of night, I desire you will dispatch and go to your lodgings; she said she had none; then instantly this Adams rushed out from the side of her, ran by her, and crossed over to him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Adams. - A. He came and rushed from the side of the woman; then he struck me with some weapon that he had in his hand, I cannot justly say what it was, although it was moonlight; he carried it by the side of him.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was moon light. - A. Yes, but not perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. That I understand you to say it was moon light. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But not very clear. - A. Not perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there light enough for you to distinguish his person and to be sure of it. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130041"></xptr>Q. He struck you you say. - A. He struck me twice the second blow I fell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weapon he struck you with. - A. I cannot justly say, it was something that was very heavy and sharp; with all he cut my head on the side. I was under the surgeon's care for two months and three weeks of the two wounds I received.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be an iron bar. - A. It was something very heavy, it cut so; it was about the length of two foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what shape it was. - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say the second blow brought you to the ground. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike you any more. - A. I do not remember he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to Mr. Barrett. - A. Yes, after I recoverd myself from the ground, I made into the street, I heard Mr. Barrett cry for mercy repeatedly, several times. I was at the distance of twenty yards from them; I said to Adams are you murdering this man; he looked over his shoulder and said if I have not it was my intention.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time were you at the distance of twenty yards from him. - A. When I came to them; when I first heard Mr. Barrett I was more than a hundred yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon hearing Mr. Barrett crying for mercy did you go towards Mr. Barrett. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you get to him. - A. I was at the distance of twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him. - Q. I did, I said you scoundrel are you murdering the man; he said, if he had not done it, it was his intention.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had said that what did he do. - A. Then he ran strait down Poplar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understood you, you never got nearer to him than twenty yards after he knocked you down. A.No, I do not think I was, I was about the distance of twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. When he first came out of the alley towards the woman, was his face towards you or his back. - A. His face was not towards me, in a strait and proper direction, he turned and spoke to the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When Adams spoke to the woman, was his face towards you. - A. Exactly then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the alley out of which he came. - A. About nine yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he come out of an alley. - A. Yes, the house was facing of us up an alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer my question - I asked about the alley not about any house in the alley - how far was the woman from the alley. - A. She stood in an alley and Adams rushed by her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far where you from the place where the woman stood at the time he rushed by her. - A. I was more than nine yards, I have measured it since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing him, before he struck you. - A. Not half a minute, we will say, he dashed across and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole opportunity of your observing his face was at the time of rushing from the alley and striking, was that the half minute. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, was the only time you had of observing his face. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see him so as to distinguish who he was when you called to him, when he was twenty yards off. - A. Yes, perfectly, because the moon light was clear, then I could see more perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen him without Mr. Barrett being there should you have known him at the distance of twenty yards. - A. Yes, perfectly well, because he is bare of hair upon his crown.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was beating of Barrett you were twenty yards from him there was light enough for you to know him. - A. I am very sure of that, I am very clear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Do you know the woman, have you ever seen her since. - A. I cannot say; did I ever see her afterwards, did you say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that woman since. - A. Yes, it is a woman that goes for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the woman that lives with him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity before had you of seeing him, you said you saw him before in the watchhouse, how many times had you seen him before. - A.Several different times; if I was to say ten or fifteen times I should not speak out of compass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lived. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you make search for him. - A. At his house at the time Mr. Barrett was dressing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house. - A. Noble-street.</p>
               <p>Court. It is in this alley. - A. It is at the corner of this alley, it opens in the alley, from where he come out of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. In what state did you find Mr. Barrett when you came up to him, was he standing, sitting or laying. - A. Laying. I thought absolutely he was dead; I lifted him up, he tell with his head doubled, he had no life at all, as I thought; we took him to a neighbour and rested him against a door, we could not call them up at last we took him to Mr. Greaves; when we got a light we saw he had a cut on his head, there was a cut on his head about two inches and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. The surgeon is the best judge of that - when did you afterwards see Adams. - A. I saw him at Hicks's Hall, Clerkenwell; I knew him directly, in a moment, as soon as ever I saw him. I was perfectly sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw him at Hicks's Hall. - A. Last sessions, on the Friday in the sessions week.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of seeing him there. - A. I had got a warrant with me at the time, that I took out in June last; I desired

               <p>Q. Did you accompany Robertson to execute it. - A. He did not stand his trial that day, it was Monday he took his trial, he was acquitted; I was with Robertson to execute that warrant, I stood upon the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Adams. - A. I did not; when he went out they said Adams was out. Robertson went after him; after he had taken him. I met them in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he know whether I am the man that struck him or not. On the 19th of June last there were two men came to my wife, she had occasion to be up, having a sick child.</p>
               <p>Court. That is your defence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he can swear I am the man that struck him positively. - A. I have sworn it.</p>

               <p>Q. He cannot swear that it was me that struck him. - A. I can with propriety.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw me with your eyes before. - A. You are the man, and the man only.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see him before. - A. Several times; I have seen him in custody several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in custody at the watchhouse more than once. - A. I cannot say that he was; he has been there for misdemeanors; he was there all night once at the watchhouse he was brought in about eight o'clock in the evening and remained there till eleven o'clock the next day, till he went to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to the magistrate the next day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the same part of the watch-house with you, so as to give you an opportunity of knowing his face. - A. I suppose for the course of an hour; they were talking to him, they let him out of the lock-up place for an hour, to know how he could be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was in the same room with you. - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him that night. - A. Not any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. None in the least. Mr. Greaves conversed with him; he will be a witness against him by-and-by upon this very thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between him and Greaves. - A. I cannot say I did; I was on particular business; I observed his hair was gone from the top of his head; I many times have been called up to turn him out of public houses for rioting.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was in the watchhouse in the same room as you was. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he conversing with. - A. The headborough; I did not give any head to what he was talking of, because Adams was in liquor; he ran out of one thing into another; I dare say he was more than an hour, rather more than less.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon, I believe. - A. I am assistant to Mr. Maxfield, surgeon and apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the 19th of June called to Mr. Barret. - A. I was; about three o'clock in the morning; he was in bed at his own house, I found him nearly in an insensible state; he had been partly dressed by another surgeon; upon taking it off I discovered that some plaisters had been applied over the wound; they had been separated by bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this wound. - A. It was on the back part of the head; it might be two inches in length.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had it penetrated. - A. I penetrated the integumen through the scull, but there was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he in as to danger. - A. In this case it is not possible to discover immediately; he appeared insensible; when he was moved he did not seem sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this wound occasioned by. - A. By some weapon; there was a great contusion, it was what we call a contused lacerated wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Not what is called inscised wound. - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not what we call a cut, but rather a bruise; this wound had been made by a blunt instrument. - A. This wound had been made by a piece of wood or iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you understand by a cut, a wound made by a sharp instrument. - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How then, I ask you this; when we speak of a cut, or when a thing is said to be cut that wound is made by a sharp instrument. - A. Not in general; it may be cut with a blunt instrument, not particularly sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. A wound being made by an edged instrument, is called a cut; you may have a cut with a hatchet - does not the cut of a wound imply it being done with an edged instrument. - A. My lord, I have seen cuts from a stick, not particularly sharp; I have seen a cut with the knuckle or falling on a piece of timber; that is the distinction we make; a cut with a knife, that is called an incised wound, and a cut with a stick it is called lacerated.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it that the separation of the flesh by a sharp instrument is called a cut; in common language it is called a cut; when a person has fallen on a piece of timber and hurt their hand, they say I have torn my hand or bruised it; lacerated is a harder word. Suppose you pound a piece of flesh with a pestle, would you say you cut it. - A. I should say it was bruised.</p>
               <p>Court. So I should think.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, he was a tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he during the time this accident happened. - A. Yes, in a little house near Noble-street; the house is in an alley close to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in common with others hear the affray on the 19th of June. - A. Yes, on the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of hearing it, say any thing to Adams about it. - A. Yes on the Sunday morning after, as this happened an the Friday night, I told him there was a fine piece of work; that I understood he was the man that hurt the officers; he said he knew nothing of the matter, and so did his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you. - A. He added that he knew something about it; that somebody had done it. On the Tuesday following I was standing at the butcher's shop; I collect rents about that neighbourhood. He came by me, I said, here is a fine piece work, you dressed pretty well most of our officers that night; he said d - n me, I did, and I would do so again, if they come to my house, he said; but I did not know they were officers; then he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time go with Mr. Lee, in search after him. - A. I went with Lee about half an hour afterwards to the house, and the house was locked up; I never saw him in Poplar afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Lee apply to you at any time and where, to take Adams in custody. - A. On the 4th of December last he applied to me to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Adams at that time. - A. He was at the bar in the sessions house, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. He was acquitted of the charge. - A. He was; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130043"></xptr>found it was going in his favour. I then went to the door, I desired one of the constables to assist me if there was occasion; when Adams came out he turned his coat up under his arm, and ran as fast as he could about a mile from the sessions house; I came up to him, I said to him, I have got you; he said you have. I said, suppose you know for what, yes, he replied, I suppose it is for that business at Poplar, it is said I. I then secured him, and brought him down to Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, with the greatest respect, I most humbly solicit your goodness to condescend to hear this my defence. The prosecutors on the 19th of June came to my house, between twelve and one o'clock, my wife having a sick child was the cause of her being up at that late hour; I was a bed and asleep with my other children, my wife went out to fasten the window shutters; when the prosecutors asked my wife to give them a lodging; she desired them to go about their business; they began to use her ill. she got in doors, they followed her, and when they got in they put the candle out and began to behave indecent; she called me to give her assistance. When I got up I thought the house was on fire, she called to me and said, dear husband, here is two men ill using me; upon which one of them run out of the door; I expected them to be thieves. I caught hold of a broomstick and struck one of them; one of them says d - n your eyes, whip it into him; they then ran down the lane, one run against the post and fell backwards, which I suppose to be the shortest of the two; I did not go out of the door, as I had nothing on but my shirt. On the next day I told my wife to go and get a warrant; the magistrate would not, they being parish constables, when they got a warrant against me, the magistrate told the clerk to make it a common assault, and desired me to get bail; when I was brought up for the next examination they brought a shirt stained with blood, upon which I was committed. I am a poor labouring man; I never was in any trouble in my life.</p>

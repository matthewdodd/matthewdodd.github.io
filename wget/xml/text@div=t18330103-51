The prisoner lodged nearly three weeks with me - he came on the 5th of December; I make it a rule every fortnight to look over my room, and on the 22nd I asked him to let me look over the room; he said he had made use of my bed-clothing for want - he said he would get them back by eight o'clock in the evening, but he did not, and I sent for an officer - he was not in any employ.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Baxter, pawnbroker, Snow-hill. The prisoner pawned at our shop three blankets, one on the 13th of December, for 1s. 6d., one on the 10th, for 1s. 6d., and one on the 8th, for 1s. - on the 17th of December he pawned a pillow - he pawned a looking-glass and frame, but fearing it would get broken, I did not bring that; I advanced him 2s. on that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you knew him well? A. Not before he began to pledge; I gave him almost the full value - the blankets were not worth more than 1s. 6d. each; I do not think they would fetch a farthing more than I advanced - I have been nine months with my employer.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

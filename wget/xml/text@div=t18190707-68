            . On the 8th of March, I loaded 100 quarters of wheat out of the Eyre Coote ship into my master's barge, and left her between five and six o'clock in the evening, afloat - she was moored to the ship; about forty quarters more remained in the ship. Next day, about six o'clock, I missed the barge, and found her a ground about two or three hundred yards from the ship. About two o'clock in the afternoon, I went with White and Evans to the prisoner, Shave's mill - the barge was forty or fifty yards from the mill. I saw some wheat spilt in a coal-barge, which lay alongside; it appeared to be white wheat out of our barge; I saw some wheat which Hemmings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181907070024"></xptr>took out of the hopper of the mill. It was white wheat - there was some red on the top.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors. On the 9th of March, between one and two o'clock, I went to the barge which had been moved to the ship again, then went to the mill with White and Nash - Dickers and Smith came there. I told them we had lost wheat, and suspected it was there. I saw a parcel of white wheat on the floor, which came from our warehouse the day before, for Mr. White, of Holborn. We went up stairs to the hopper, and there found some red and white wheat mixed together - we went further up stairs, and found some red wheat in the bin, about a foot deep, and under that was more white wheat, about ten quarters altogether, red and white - most of it was white; I took a sample of it, but it has since been destroyed. About five days after, I gave the officer a sample of the wheat which was in the barge. I took it from the bulk which was in our warehouse, but it was the same wheat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you take any steps, or go before the Justice before the 1st of June - A. It was about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to search the mill, did not Dickers say</p>
               <p>"There is no wheat here but what belongs to Mr. White, and I am ready to take fifty oaths of it" - A. He said there was none, but what belonged to Mr. White - the mill was not at work.</p>
               <p>Q. On the first examination did Dickers produce a sample of the wheat from the mill - A. No; he did at the second.</p>

            . I am watchman of Millwall and Poplar. On the 9th of March, about one o'clock in the morning, I was passing Shave's mill, and saw a light; I looked through a hole in the shutter, and saw Shave sweeping the floor. I asked him if he was going to work to night? he said he wanted to load some corn in a hurry - I left him. About two o'clock I returned, looked through the same hole, and saw two or three sacks of wheat shot down in a heap where he had been sweeping. I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What makes you remember the date - A. I was asked about it the next day. I did not go to the Police Office for two months after - it is a common thing to see a light in the mill at night. There was no wind to work the mill.</p>

             also worked for him. I went to the door about a quarter before six o'clock, and rang the bell; Shave came out, and asked who was there before he opened the door? I said it was me. He then unlocked the door, and I went in. He said,</p>
               <p>"Lock the door after you, for I expect the Police here every minute." I asked him what he had been doing? he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been up all night; me and Smith have worked twenty quarters of wheat out of the barge during the night." I asked whose barge it was? he said he did not know, it was a barge that had drifted ashore. I asked him where the wheat was? he said it was hoisted, and stored in the bin, which is at the top of the mill. I went up with him, and said,</p>
               <p>"There is not twenty quarters here, nor half twenty? he said,</p>
               <p>"I think there is more than that, we will go and take some wheat out of White's barge, and store it in the granary as quick as we can." We went to White's barge, got three sacks, and stored them in the granary, which is by the side of the mill - Shave took some of it, and strewed it from the dock to the mill. About eight o'clock William Smith came - I had not seen him before, and asked me how much wheat there was in the mill? I said I dare say there were eight or nine quarters.

               <p>Q. Did you not go to him for the purpose of asking him if it was true that he had offered a reward of 20 l. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the mill was searched, you said you would swear there was no wheat there but White's - A. No. I said the wheat in the mill was White's. I did not tell them what had passed between me and Shave.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Kelly applied to me respecting his porter, and with some difficulty I apprehended him; he was denied in the forepart of the day. I went to his lodgings again at half after ten at night; a friend watched him in; when I knocked at the door they denied him; I said I was sure he had returned. I went up stairs, I found him concealed in the garret; Mr. Kelly gave charge of him. I found nothing on his person but a small comb, the brushes were all found in a box; the long broom was behind the door, or else in the passage. I marked them.</p>

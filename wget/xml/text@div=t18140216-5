            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about a quarter past eight on Sunday evening the 6th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Elbow-place from Aylesbury-street - A. About half a mile; he had the appearance as if coming from some place at a distance; he was walking quickly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAYHEW. I am a conductor of patrols. I was present when the prisoner was stopped; it being dark I took him into a public-house. Before I opened the bundle the prisoner had, I said, what does this bundle consist of; he said, my own wearing apparel; it consisted of shirts, stockings, and handkerchiefs. I asked him where he lodged; he said just by. It was a remarkable cold night; he was all in perspiration. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at these things - A. The whole of the articles are mine; I know them; I made them all myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Hoxton on Sunday evening. In Goswell-street I picked this bundle up.</p>

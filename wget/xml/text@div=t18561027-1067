                  </hi>. I am taskmaster at the workhouse of St. Mary, Lambeth. I know the prisoner perfectly well—he has been in and out of the house during the time I have been there, about nine months—on the morning of 27th Sept. I went to the place where the prisoner slept about half past 5 o'clock—he was in bed—I told him to get up—he said he should not get up then—I visited him again about half an hour afterwards—I again found him in bed, and told him to get up—he said he would see me b—first—I visited him a third time, about 8 o'clock, I think—he still persisted that he would not get up, and made use of bad language—I told him I should call the attention of the master to it, which I did—Mr. Jones, the assistant master, and myself then went to him, and we pulled the clothes off him—with that he got on to the ground with his feet—he was sitting, and he rose up and struck Mr. Jones on the chest with his foot—he made use of bad language and swearing—I do not recollect what—he ordered Mr. Jones out of the room—Mr. Jones refused to go, and he said, "You b——, if you don't go, I have got something here will make you"—with that he went to a bed in the further end of the room, and drew from under the bed this bar of iron, and he came back, and gave a slashing cut with it towards Mr. Jones's head—it was a violent blow, and I saw the blood flow immediately afterwards—Mr. Jones did not strike him from first to last, but after he struck, Mr. Jones closed in with him, and I took the bar from him—this is a protection bar of the window guard—I had seen it in its proper place about 7 o'clock the evening before—it was attached to the window—it had been fastened with screws, and it had been unscrewed—this is only half the bar—the other half was under the bed—when I saw it the evening before, it was one long bar attached to the window—I cannot say that I had ever heard the prisoner use any threats towards Mr. Jones—he was a man that used very violent language—he was placed in that ward by order of the guardians, the night before, for his misconduct—it is not a worse ward than the others, only they do more labour in it—it is a ward for casual paupers—the whole of the inmates of the workhouse got up at half past 5 o'clock at that time—Mr. Jones did not strike the prisoner from first to last—till he had been struck by the bar, he did not lay hand on him—I did not touch him till I took the iron out of his hand—neither Mr. Jones nor I had any bludgeon or staff, or anything in our hands—neither of us threatened to strike him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant master of Lambeth workhouse. On 27th Sept., my attention was called to the prisoner by Mr. Church—I went at about a quarter before 9 o'clock, and found him in bed—I told him to get up and go to his work the same as the other inmates—we had then about 940 in the house—he said, "I will see you b——first"—we caught hold of the clothes, and took them off him—directly he was out of bed he made a blow at my neck—I kept him off—he struck me with his foot, and</p>

               <p>said, "Go out of the ward"—I declined going out, and he stepped back from the bed he was on, about two or three paces, and said, "I have got some<lb></lb>thing here for you"—he stepped back to another bed, and said, "You b——, I have got something here for you"—he took this iron from under the bed, and came up to me with full force with the iron—I parried it off as well as I could, but it just caught my forehead—he struck me a violent blow—I caught some of it on my arm—the cut was just over my eye; the blood came all down about the room—I was attended by the surgeon—I was confined a fortnight, or close upon it—I was not fit for duty for some time—I did not strike him at all—I pushed him off when he struck me—I did not strike him, to call striking—I pushed him away when he struck me in the face—I warded off the blow—after he struck me I closed with him, and Church took the iron out of his hand—I had him secured—he was given into custody, and taken before a magistrate the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Kennington-place, and am surgeon of Lambeth workhouse. I was called in to see Mr. Jones—before that my assistant had placed some slight dressing on his head, which I removed—I found a small wound on his head, about half an inch in length—I con<lb></lb>sidered it an incised wound—there was slight contusion round the edges—it extended to the bone—it was just over the left temple against the eye—I have continued to attend him ever since—he did favourably, so far as the wound was considered, but his nervous system received a severe shock.</p>

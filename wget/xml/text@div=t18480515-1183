                  </hi> I am a master boot and shoemaker. On 25th April I received intimation that a Judge's warrant was issued against the prisoner—knowing him well, I got a copy of the warrant—on the Thursday night I went with an officer to take the prisoner in Green-street, Twig Folly—we took him along Bethnal-green-road and Shoreditch—there was a cry that a Chartist leader was taken, and of, "Knife the b—rs"—we were in an awful predicament—I called out lustily—we took the prisoner to Worship-street—he was taken before Mr. Justice Maule, in Chancery-lane, while waiting for the Judge coming, the prisoner said, "You b—r, I will do for you?"—I was unprepared, and he hit me an awful blow on the head with his stick—I have suffered ever since—my forehead was deeply cut—I was obliged to go to a surgeon, I am now under his care—I have been able to do very little work since.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think since 1835—your employer has served me with tally-bills—you have collected of me for a person in Hatton-garden—you offered to walk quietly with us, but we knew you too well—I put my hand on you, and said, "We have a Judge's warrant against you"—you said, "Produce your authority, you d—d thief."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I summoned this man two or three times, and put him in the Palace Court for debts due to my employer—I am sorry I struck him, but I was aggravated—he has a great spite against me,</p>

                  </hi> I was present at the assault at Mr. Pearce's, the Mitre—words arose—they were calling "Swindlers," and so on, and the prisoner said to Harrison, "If you call me that again, I will strike you with the stick"—he said, "You are a swindler," and struck him—blood flowed—I took him to a surgeon, and had his head dressed—he lost a deal of blood.</p>

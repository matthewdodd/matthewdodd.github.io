                  </hi>. I live at 17, James-street, Limehouse, and am a marine store-dealer—on the evening of 22d August, I was in a public-house, in High-street, Whitechapel, from 8 o'clock till half-past 11; afterwards I was in another public-house, bidding a friend good-night—I went back again to the public-house in High-street, and ultimately left that public-house with Cooper, at about half-past 12—while I had been in the public-house I had seen the prisoners West, King, and McDonald—I went with Cooper to her house, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I had 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bag, in a cash-pocket inside the band of my trousers, and I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, in a pocket-book, in the breast-pocket of my coat—she asked me for another shilling, and I pulled out my purse with the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give another shilling, and placed it on the table; she saw the whole of it—while I was putting it in my pocket she went out, leaving me for, I should think, eight or nine minutes, and when I went from the outer door into the street, I was seized by King, the tallest woman, who came and put her arm round my throat—McDonald, I think, seized my right hand, and West held my left, and Cooper cut my pocket open, as it is now, and took out every penny of my money; I could feel her taking it—the pocket-book was also taken at the same time as the bag—I fell into a pool of water after they let go—I could not cry out; I was nearly strangled, because of the pressure on my throat by King—there was no other violence but that; no striking—they had been in front of the public-house, in High-street, Whitechapel, from the time I went into the house till half-past 11—I had been talking to them in front of the bar—I am sure these four are the four who attacked me—I should think I lay in the pool of water a quarter of an hour before I recovered myself; I could not get up—when I got up I ran to the end of the street, saw a policeman, and gave him some information—I afterwards went with him to No. 20, Princes-street—that was about three-quarters of an hour after I had been attacked—when I got inside I saw Cooper, West, Simes, and a man there—directly they saw the police, Cooper dropped some money on the floor—I said, "That is the woman that cut my pocket open"—I saw Cooper drop the money—she was in the act of handing it to West—I saw the constable pick it up, I do not know how much—I gave Cooper and West in custody—Simes was not taken then—Cooper said, when she was taken, "He gave</p>

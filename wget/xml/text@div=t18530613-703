                  </hi>. I am barman, at the Ship Tavern. On Sunday, 29th May, about half past 10 o'clock at night, I was serving there—the prisoner came to the house and asked for a pint of beer—I served him—he paid me with a bad shilling—I examined the shilling and broke it in two pieces—I gave the smaller piece to the prisoner; I then gave the larger piece to Mr. Dwyer, the manager, who was in the bar parlour—I did not say whether it was good or bad, I merely handed it to him—the prisoner said he was not aware it was a bad one—when I returned from giving the large piece to Mr. Dwyer, the prisoner was gone—I had seen him fling the small piece under the seat, and saw Mr. Dwyer pick it up the same night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Ship Tavern. I got a piece of a counterfeit shilling from the last witness—I went outside immediately, and followed the prisoner into the street—the last witness pointed him out to me; he was walking away—I went and asked him where he got the shilling from; he said, "Just down here"—there was a policeman there, and I said, "We will go and see where he got it"—the prisoner then said be got it at St. Albans; I then gave him into custody—as he was going to the station I followed closely, and just as we got to the corner of Windmill-street the prisoner made a gesture with his hand, and I heard something like the sound of a coin—I told the policeman to stop, and I picked up a shilling at the place where what I heard seemed to fall—it was two or three feet from the prisoner—I gave it to the policeman, and I said, "Here is another bad shilling"—the prisoner said it was one which I had brought with me, and dropped—I had received a piece of a counterfeit shilling from the last witness; I found the other piece—I gave them to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Magdalene-street, Norwich. I was present at the marriage of my sister Hannah Woolner Plumstead, at St Clement's Baptist Chapel, Norwich, on 28th March, About seventeen years ago—I do not remember the year—I signed the register book—I saw my sister yesterday month, before I came up last Session—my sister was married to the prisoner in the name of Silas Chapman—he and my sister lived together up to the last six years, when he left Norwich—I did not live near my sister the latter part of the time—they lived in the country—for the first five, or six, or seven years, they lived in Norwich—he left about six years ago, I am not able to say the month—after the marriage they lived in a house of Mr. Springfield's, in St. Martin's-lane, Norwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Britannia coffee house, Limehouse. On 30th March, 1853, I was married to the prisoner, at St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate—I lived with him after the marriage till about 13th May in the present year—he represented himself to me as a bachelor at the time of our marriage—I was at that time a widow—I received informa<lb></lb>tion respecting him several times, but I had no proof of it—before our mar<lb></lb>riage I did not hear anything from him as to a former wife—I questioned him about it—he said he was a bachelor, and gave me a note to that purport.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

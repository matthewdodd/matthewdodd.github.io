                  </hi>. I live at 42, Walton Street, Hans Place—I have no occupation—I am under age—in October last I was in the habit of visiting Mr. Couteau's shop, a hairdresser in Brompton Road—I had been there before the 31st October, 10 or a dozen timee—I have seen persons there not engaged—on the 31st October, between 8 and 9 p.m., I went there—the prisoner came and spoke to me when I had been there about half an hour—I did not know him—he told me he had met me before—he said "I want to speak to you"—I said "All right, directly"—a few minutes afterwards I went up to him and said "What is it?" he said "Oh, not now; come upstairs, and I will talk to you about it upstairs"—a few minutes afterwards he said to Mr. Couteau "I suppose we can have your room upstairs?" Mr. Couteau said "Yes, all right, I think there is a light"—I went upstairs—I do not recollect whether the gas was already lighted, but there was a light afterwards—it was nearly 10 o'clock—there was enough gaslight to see by—the prisoner said "You have borrowed some money, and you are paying very large interest for it; I will pay off the loan for you and let you have it at a cheaper rate of interest"—I said "No, I have managed my own affairs so far, and I do not care about that"—the prisoner had previously told me the person's name from whom I had borrowed the money—he said "Well, then, let me lend you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he had said "How much money have you got in the bank?"—I told him—I forget what the amount was; I think it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I do not want the money at present, when I want it I shall be very glad to come to you for it"—he said "You bank at the Union"—I do bank at the Union—he said "That money in the bank will not last you long, you had better have something"—I said "Well, let it be a small sum; I will have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, make it 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No, I will make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or nothing"—he said "Very good; I will run downstairs and get my cheque-book"—he had already said "I shall not take any interest for this first transaction, but when you come of age you can give me a d—good diamond pin"—he went downstairs, and returned with a cheque-book with a few cheques gone out of it—he then wrote me out this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Signed S. Bradley on the London and County Bank, Knightsbridge Branch, in favour of S. Robertson or order, and endorsed A. K. S. Robertson, dated 1st November</hi>)—he said "Do not present it till half-past 11 in the morning"—I asked him his reason—he said he always gave notice when he I presented a cheque over an amount which he mentioned, I forget what it was—I gave him three cheques, which he suggested I should do, on my own bank, two for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "You are under age, and I shall not take a bill from you"—I said "Why not give you a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?" I meaning a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I might be hard up and like to I discount one of these with my partner"——I had not my cheque-book with me—I wrote the cheques on blank paper—these are the cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">Dated 1st October</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">upon the Union Bank of London, Charing Cross Branch, signed by A. K. S. Robertson in favour of S. Bradley or order, and endorsed S.

               <p>subsequently wrote this document marked B: "122, Brompton Road—Dear Robertson, I have this evening received of you cheques for the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to discount, which I will hold you harmless against until the 18th of December, 1880, according to our arrangement.—S. Bradley to A. K. S. Robertson"—it is written "September," it should be "Deeember"—I retained the document—I then wrote this letter produced at his dictation (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "42, Walton Street, Hans Place.—Dear Sir,—I this day hand you my cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of discounting according to the arrange<lb></lb>ment we have made between us, which I am perfectly satisfied with.—Yours truly, A. K. S. Robertson. To S. Bradley, Esq." (<hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi>) "Received of S. Barnett the sum of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., G. Couteau"—the endorsement was not there when I wrote it—he took the letter and the three cheques—I was with the prisoner on this occasion about two hours—we then went downstairs—I remained there in the prisoner's and others company till about 1 a.m.—the prisoner came away with me, and went with me as far as my lodgings, about five minutes' walk—I said "I think I had better give you three cheques; I do not think the bank care much for pieces of paper"—he came in my room—he was there about three minutes—I found I could not give him cheques—he admired a silver match-box, which I gave him, and he went away—the following morning I went down to the London and County Bank at about 11.30—I presented this cheque for payment—it was returned marked, as it is now, "No account"—I took a cab, and went to the Union Bank, my own bank—the banker's clerk there made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went to Scotland Yard—I afterwards went to the Westminstar Police-station, and identified the prisoner from about eight or nine others as the person representing himself to be Samuel S. Bradley, and who gave me the cheque—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. One peculiarity in the prisoner is the bald place on his head—I had noticed that before—I knew nothing about his losing his father—he had a crape band on his hat—he also had a rough great-coat—I hare seen at Couteau's, besides hair-dressing, ratting and dog-fighting, not cock-fighting—I do not know anything about his arranging for meetings between the sexes—I have never availed myself of his services—I have always lived a moral life—I did nothing beyond going to a couple of rat matches there and a dog fight, and joining in conversation and talks generally—I never lost any money there—I once gave Couteau a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I called the next morning, gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and tore up the cheque—I believe Mr. Couteau has been subpænaed, but he has bolted—his shop is shut up, but I have heard he has been seen about the place—I had never seen Bradley write before this occasion—I did not wish to name the person who had lent me money; it was Mr. Robert Morris—I have only had one transaction with him—I gave Mr. Morris a bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was transacted through a third party—I got 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is payable on the 10th of July—the third party remitted a considerable sum for his own expenses—part of the proceeds of that bill was lying at my credit at my bank—I never knew Mr. Morris till yesterday—I got the money through Mr. Heritage—I had made his acquaintance about a year—the money was paid me in bank-notes at Mr. Heritage's office, 29, Nicholas Lane—I described the prisoner's whisker as mutton chop whiskers when I was before the Magistrate—the prisoner has shaved since all round the chin—I did not notice that he had black eyes—I drank two glasses of whisky that night—I had some from Edinburgh that day</p>

               <p>—I was not faint—the prisoner was not drunk—Couteau went out for the drink—I paid for it, and drank a portion—I have spent stout six months in London during the last two years.</p>

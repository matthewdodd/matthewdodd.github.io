               <p>I suspected Shears—I heard him tell the coachman at Vauzhall he was going to Ratcliff-cross—I went down there, made inquiries, and found him at Mr. Watson's—I said, "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, what brought you down here?"—I called him on one side and said, "I came down after these things of <hi rend="italic">Bill's"</hi>—he said, "What things?"—I said, "The watch"—Mr. Watson said, "If you have any thing to say, speak it out"—I said it was a private affair—the prisoner then told Watson to bring the watch—he took it down from a blue dish in the corner, and the prisoner gave it to me—I asked him again for the money—he said he had got no money—I said, "Yes, feel in your pockets like a good fellow"—no money was found.</p>

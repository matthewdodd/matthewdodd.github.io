               <p>The evidence was the same as on the last trial, with this difference only, that this prisoner was Sakey's porter, and was present in the shop, when Law delivered the watch to Sakey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys made some objections to Mr Dyson's competency, and made some observations respecting the watch being left as a deposit, and contended that there was not sufficient evidence, whether it was understood by Dyson and Sakey, that it was a deposit for the performance of the contract, or for one chest only; and as to the watch being delivered, it was not a material question on the trial of the cause.</p>
               <p>(The Court over-ruled the objection.)</p>

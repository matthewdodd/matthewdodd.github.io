             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. My father keeps the Crooked Billet, at Shadwell: On the 9th of October I saw the prisoner at the sign of the Captain Cook, in the parish of St. George's in the East: I saw him again the following evening at the same public-house by appointment, and he asked me if I wanted any more -</p>

               <p>Q. Any more what? - A. Bad gold; I told him to go and fetch three wholes, that is, business; three halves, that is, half-business; and three small ones, which were three seven-shilling pieces; he then went into the wash-house of the public-house, and took out three guineas, three half-guineas, and three seven-shillings pieces; he told me he supposed I would take them all; I told him I could not, as I had not enough about me to buy them; I then bought two half-guineas and two seven-shilling pieces; I gave two shillings and three-pence for each of the seven-shilling pieces, and three shillings and sixpence a-piece for the half-guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at those pieces? - A. These are the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the money again that you gave him, if you should see it? - A. I should; Rogers, the officer, was in waiting for a signal which I gave him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. On the 10th of October a warrant was issued from the Public-office; the money I have in my hand I found upon the prisoner in his breeches pocket; the good money that I found upon him is a half-crown piece, two shillings, and a seven-shilling piece, which I had previously marked and given to Mead for the purpose of purchasing bad money, about an hour before I apprehended him.(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Mead. This is the money that I gave the prisoner for the bad money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am entirely drawn into this snare by Rogers and Mead; they go about giving people money to trap others; I leave myself, my Lord and Gentlemen, to the mercy of the Court.</p>

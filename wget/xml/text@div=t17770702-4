               <p>On the 1st of June last, between 11 and 12 at night, as I was going to my lodgings at No. 11, in Castle Yard, I went through St. James's Park, I was rather intoxicated with liquor; I sat down on one of the benches and fell asleep; I felt somebody near me which waked me; I found a man had taken hold of my hand and put it into an indecent place in his breeches, I drew my hand away; there was only one person there at that time who was the prisoner Stride; it was not moon-light, but the stars shone bright; Stride said, you had better not sit here, you had better get up and walk with me; he said, he would shew me the way out at the Green Park; we went a little way together, Stride asked me for some money to drink a glass of gin; I said, I had got no halfpence; Stride said, I am sure you have got other money; I pulled out my purse, as soon as Stride saw the purse in my hand he struck me over the face with his fist, snatched the purse out of my hand, and ran away; I saw nobody present at that time but Stride; I believe there were about 13 guineas and about five shillings in my purse; I was frightened: Stride had a red great coat on with his regimentals under it, I ran after him and pushed him down, upon which two men came up and followed me, they rescued Stride from me and beat me; I cannot swear to those two men; the place where I overtook Stride and pushed him down was about ten yards from the place where he snatched the purse from my hand; I did not perceive the other two people till they fell upon me.</p>
               <p>From STRIDE. Did you not say that the man that robbed you had thick lips? - I did *.</p>
               <p>* Stride had thick lips.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant in the guards; the prosecutor came to the guardhouse about 12 at night, he appeared to be much beat, he had lost his hat, the blood ran out of his ears; he said he had been robbed of 13 guineas and some silver, and thought it was somebody that belonged to the guard; upon which we shut the door and searched the guard, and found every body there but the prisoner Stride, who is a drummer; Stride came to the guard door about two minutes after, he was then in his drummer's dress, I immediately charged him with having robbed the prosecutor; the prosecutor was present, and said, he would take his oath it was him; he had given a description of him before that he had thick lips, and had a red great coat on, which I suppose he pulled off before he came to the guard, for when he came there he had not the red great coat on; but his regimentals; I went and acquainted colonel Duberg, and he sent for Stride up; Stride denied it positively; but the fact appeared so clear to the colonel, that he ordered him to be made a prisoner of; next morning Stride confessed that he had robbed the prosecutor, and had given the money to Miles; I think the prosecutor was something in liquor when he came to the guard, yet he was capable of remembering and knowing what he did.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant in the guards; I was upon guard that night; Warren came to the guard room very bloody, he said, he had been robbed by a drummer with thick lips; we searched to see who was absent, Stride only was found absent; he came to the guard room in two or three minutes; the prosecutor directly charged him with robbing him; the next morning as they were going with Stride to Sir John Fielding's, Stride sent for me and said, he committed the robbery, that he snatched the purse out of the prosecutor's hand, and gave it to one Miles; he said two others were concerned with him; I asked Stride to go up to the colonel and acquaint him with this matter; the colonel said it was a weighty matter; then Stride went and shewed us Rudd in the Birdcage Walk; he was on duty as a drummer; he belongs to the Coldstream regiment; we took Rudd; he confessed he was with Stride when he robbed the foreigner, but said he had no part of the money; I went along with Stride, and by his direction to the two drummers in Burton-street, in order to seek for Miles; I asked the little girl who opened the door if Miles was there; she said, she believed he was, and in bed on the first floor; I went up; Stride followed me; we went into Miles's room; he said, this is the man that I gave the foreigner's money to; he was in a great surry; he denied it at first; I said, it would be very proper to return the money; Miles went into a back room; I followed him for fear he should attempt to get away; I saw him stoop down, and under an old chest he picked up some gold, which I guessed to be seven or eight guineas; while I was speaking to Miles, Stride came in and said, I think that is not all the money; Miles wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and put it in his waistcoat pocket; then I took them all three to the officer, one Gould, but Miles was not searched there, but was searched at Sir

               <p>I stood at the guard door the same night; at about 12 o'clock that this affair happened, a young woman came up and asked me if I could shew her where her husband, a soldier, was; I asked her his name; she told me; I said, I believed he was a centinel in the Park; I went and shewed her the box he stood centinel at; I turned back; this man had a stick in his hand; he knocked it against my arm; I turned my head to look at him; he beckoned me; he sat down upon a chair; I looked at him again, and he beckoned me again; I returned back to him, and sat down upon the chair; he said, it was a fine night, and that there were not many people walking about; then he got hold of my hand and tickled it, and put it upon his thigh; then he asked me to take a walk with him; I asked him for what? he could not make me any answer; he got up, and got hold of my arm; I went with him as far as the gate that goes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020006"></xptr> out at the Green Park; the gate was not open; he took hold of my hand and pulled me the other way; we went round by the queen's house; there was a place to get underneath to the Green Park; I went under with him; he kissed me, and behaved very indecent; I asked him what he meant; I took hold of his collar; I said, you shall go to the watch-house along with me, and I halloed out a S - e, a S - e; he took out some money, and said he would give it me to let him go; he gave me five guineas to let him go.</p>

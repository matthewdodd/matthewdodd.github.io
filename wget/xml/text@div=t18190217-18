            . My husband, whose name is Charles, keeps the Coopers' Arms. On the 10th of February Reed came with two other men, whom I do not know - I do not remember the prosecutor; they brought the chest and bag about eight o'clock in the morning, the chest was left in the passage, and the bag in the back-room. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the two prisoners came to fetch them - they were both very tipsey; I was at the bar; Reed asked me for them - Nutter was behind him. I told him to take them; Nutter took the chest, and Reed took the bag - Reed went out first, and Nutter followed. I thought they were Reed's.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldgate, the prosecutor brought Nutter to the watch-house about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and said he suspected he had robbed him; he said he found a paper on him which he kept as a journal of the ship, and that Nutter was looking at it in the public-house. I searched him, and found a draft, for 11 l., payable at ninety days on him, a pair of razors in a case, two duplicates, a piece of a broken sixpence, and a shaving-brush. He said he was employed by a person who he did not know to fetch the things from Poplar, and the man gave them to him - he could not tell where he took them to.</p>

               <p>REED'S Defence. We both left our things there; I was intoxicated, and went for my things - I do not know whether I brought more than my own away or not; I fell down with them, and lost them. Nutter took the box.</p>
               <p>NUTTER'S Defence. Reed said he had a chest and bag, and wanted a man to help him; I went with him, he took the bag, and I followed him with the chest. He told me to leave them at a house in Shadwell, and gave me these things for my trouble.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 23d of December I was at work in Pope-street, Hackney-road, and found these tools hidden under the floor of the next house - I was at the Olive Branch, public-house, the same night, and saw the prisoner - I asked him if these tools were his, or if he had put them there; he said he had put a plane and saw under the floor; I said, I had given them to Mr. Wheeler.</p>

            . I was working in Pope-street, Hackney-road. I went there on the 23d of December, and saw the prisoner, who was very dilatory about the premises - I asked if he was going to work - he said he was; I then went away, and in the evening I saw him again at the Olive Branch. Grant told me he had a saw and a trying-plane; when he went away I sent Grant to get them, and I took them away - the next morning the prisoner came, and said he wanted to go to work. I asked how he came by the tools he had yesterday - he said they were his own, and his father had given them to him two years ago; I then asked the prisoner where he had lodged - he said,"In John-street;" I went there, and found he had only slept there one night.</p>

Orrow, and Cheese<lb></lb>man, and Mr. Wood, the clerk to Messrs. Rixon were with me—I had not told Orrow before I took him to Rotherhithe that I was going to show him the man who drove the cart, I used no such expression—from the description I had of the prisoner's person from Orrow, I went to Rotherhithe, and took Orrow with me, but as I had been to the prisoner's master several times before respecting the iron, sent Mr. Wood down to see whether the prisoner was in the way, in order that there might be no suspicion about my going—the prisoner came back with him, and Orrow pointed him out as one of the men who took the iron—they both came upon the same side—there was man on the other side of the way—I had asked Orrow to look out and see if he saw any body coming up the street—he said, "Yes, that is the man that took the iron"—that was the prisoner—on my oath I had given him no reason to suppose that the man who was coming was the man who stole the iron—I had not pointed him out at all—he wore a sleeve waistcoat, short cord trowsers, and a cap.</p>

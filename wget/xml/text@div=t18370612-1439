                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joshua Crockford, and live in Litchfield-street, Soho. The prisoner came into our service on the 17th of May—on the 24th I had suspicions, and on moving her bundle I discover<lb></lb>ed some books, which led me to open it, and there I found the greater part of these things, and the others in her box—I had given her notice, and she was going away—she said she was sorry she had taken them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was cleaning the back room and took those things out—the prosecutrix called me down to go to Tottenham Court-road—I went into my bed room and took the things in my hand, and forgot where I laid them—there was nothing else that I know of in the bundle—she desired to see my box—but there was nothing there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. CROCKFORD</hi>. Yes; there was one shawl and the gloves in the box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took the shawls off the bed, and forgot where I laid them—I merely took the books to read—they were not in the bundle—I took them into my room when I went to change my gown, and had no idea of taking them out of the house—I did not know I was going to leave—she said I was not strong enough to do her work. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The, shawls were tied up in her gown, and the books were in the bundle with some of her things.</p>

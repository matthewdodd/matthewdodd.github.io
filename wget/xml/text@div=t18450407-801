                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames division of police; On the 11th of March, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw a boat pulling towards King Edward-stairs, with two persons in her—there was a coal-barge just alongside the stairs—I heard a splash in the water—the persons who were in the boat got ashore—I examined the boat they left; it was called the <hi rend="italic">Self Defence</hi>—I found this part of a copper funnel in the bottom of the boat, which I found out was stolen from the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>—I left</p>

               <p>Marsden where I heard the splash, and he produced to roe, when the tide was down, several portions of a copper funnel, part of which fitted that found in the boat belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, and two pieces of a green funnel belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Antioch</hi>—I could not swear that the prisoner was one of the men—it was dark.</p>

I went down to King Edward-stairs by Judge's directions—I waited till the tide left the shore a little way, and found some pieces of copper funnel lying in the mud—I noticed the prisoner standing at King Edward-stairs, near the boat, as I was bringing them to the office—I went ashore, and asked him if his name was Collins—he said yes—I told him I wanted him to go up to the office with me—I took him into our boat—he said, "Oh, I don't know anything about these funnels"—they were in the boat at the time—he could see them—it was a boat that I had borrowed to get the funnels—they laid in the mud—I delivered the pieces to Mr. Judge—it was about half-past eight o'clock when I took him.</p>

On Monday night, the 10th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and another man named Warren, come down with a pair of sculls—I did not see them go away—between one and two o'clock I was rowing across the water, coming back from taking a fare, I shot from Mill-hole third tier, and they shot from the upper tier—they were head down, and I was head up—they rowed in to the head of the tier off King Edward-stairs—the police-boat was lying at the stairs—Mr. Judge said, "Who's there?"—I said, "Collins and Warren"—they made haste after them, and they got over a coal-barge, and both got away—I can swear the pri<lb></lb>soner was one of those persons; I saw him as I rowed in—he was rowing—the other was sitting aft.</p>

I had about 25 or 26 s. in my Right-hand Breeches Pocket, and upon feeling for my Money, I miss'd four Half-Crowns and a Shilling. I tax'd her with taking it; she deny'd it; - but I found a Half-Crown and a Shilling upon her myself, and the Napkin and Handkerchief were taken from her at the Watch-house. I never saw the Prisoner before the Night she robb'd me; but upon her asking me how I did, I stood and talk'd with her, but what Discourse happen'd between us I really can't tell, - for I have forgot it. When I first charg'd her with robbing me, she told me I had robb'd her; but upon searching her at the Watch-house, the other three Half-Crowns were found in her Pocket, and as they were stripping her, the Handkerchief and the Napkin dropp'd from her.</p>

            , Constable. About One o'Clock that Morning I had been with a Prisoner to the Compter; when I came back I found the Prosecutor and the Prisoner at the Watch-house. He charg'd her with picking his Pocket, and told me he had lost 11 s. but he had taken Half a Crown and a Shilling from her, and the other three Half-Crowns, he was sure, she had still somewhere about her. I (knowing her to be a Woman of the Town) expostulated with her, and desired her, - if she had done so, - to give him his Money again, - and I reprimanded her, and told her, our Watchmen must search her. Accordingly I carry'd her into my Kitchen, adjoining to the Watch-house, and a Woman coming in, we search'd her. I pull'd her Gown open, and search'd her Pocket, in which I found this Handkerchief, (which the Prosecutor own'd) and in the Bosom of her Shift I found these three Half-Crowns. The Napkin dropp'd from her on the Ground.</p>

            : He is a Watchman in Fenchurch street. On Saturday Night, about five Weeks ago, my Landlady sent me with 3 s. and 6 d. to her Husband at the Watch-house, that he might buy some Meat for Sunday's Dinner. As I was going along, I kick'd against something like Linnen, which I took up and put in my Pocket. At the Pump by Aldgate I met this Man: My dear (says he) where are you going? Why, I don't know you, says I, and I am in haste; but he gave me a Pull, and asked me to drink, telling me he intended no Harm; so I went with him into Crouched Fryars, and stood talking with him in the Street: He wanted to be rude, and told me, - perhaps I might want Money; I said I was not given that Way, but he put three Half-Crowns down my Bosom; and afterward, - when he found I would not agree with him, he put his Hand into my Pocket, and took out a Half-Crown and a new King George's Shilling, which I was carrying to my Landlord. <rs id="t17391017-17-verdict76" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Mr. Wilmot's. I had a warrant against the prisoner, Walker, for an assault. On the 19th of December, I went to <placeName id="t17890114-24-crimeloc118">Leg-alley, Shoreditch</placeName>

I went up one pair of stairs, and tried the latch of the door: it was fast locked seemingly. I knocked at the door, and a voice answered in the room, Who is there? I said it was Armstrong; and in a minute the door was unlocked; there was a little sort of jingling as appeared to me, to my ear, while I was on the landing-place: when I came into the room, the prisoner, Walker, was sitting on a chair by the fire, and Grace by the side of him; there was in the room a woman and a girl besides. I then acquainted the prisoner, Walker, I had a warrant against him for an assault, I smelt an odd kind of smell in the room; and I asked Walker when it would suit him to come to the office; he said to-morrow, at eleven. I left the prisoners in the room, and ran back to the office as fast as I could; when I came there, I found Harper and Shakeshaft; we returned to the room as soon as we could; we went up stairs as softly as we could; the door was on the latch; I lifted it up softly, and in we all three went to the room; I says, there is the money in the chair; at that time, Grace, the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140043"></xptr>was by the side of Walker, and he moved his hand by his side; and at that time, some base pieces fell from his hand. There was some money in the chair; and as Walker got up, some fell from his lap; it was picked up, and here it is; ten pieces. Here is a piece of black stuff, I do not know the name of it. Some of these pieces were on the chair, and some fell from his lap; but in securing the prisoner, it was all mixt together; that that was in the chair, and that that fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did you take up that money which you saw fall from Grace, when you got into the room? - Mr. Shakeshaft picked up that; the other officer picked up some other things; the two prisoners and the woman were taken before the magistrate; the child was discharged. I found 12 s. but one by accident has been melted; this one was part of them that were on the ground. It was tried on a shovel this morning, and was made the colour of brass; it was then put by Mr. Vines into some aqua-fortis; he made it boil, and afterwards rubbed it with a little sand; and it then turned as white as ever. I saw nothing else; but the ashes appeared to be wet; with what I cannot tell.

               <p>I went with the other officers. We went up the stairs softly. Armstrong got to the door; he tried the door; he rather looked back. The door was opened, and we all rushed in, in a moment; Walker was sitting down by the fire, and Grace was standing up; and Armstrong said, there is the money in the chair; Walker got up, and as he got up, some of the money fell down on the floor; Grace had some in his hands, which he threw away; this, I believe to be the money he threw away. I found it wide from the other, in the way that he threw it. When I went down to fetch the woman, I found this bottle; I smelt the bottle, and I smelt a sulphurous smell. I knew the smell of aqua-fortis very well; I am certain, on my oath, there had been aqua-fortis in it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any cork in it? - None. It had been rinsed out; and I put it at my nose, and it burnt the end of my nose; I afterwards gave it to Armstrong to smell. It had been rinsed with water. The woman was washing close by the fire. There had been a bit of string round the neck of it, and it pulled to pieces like tinder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Is it now in the state you found it? - There were some little drainings in it.</p>
               <p>In what part of the room was the woman washing? - Quite close by them; by the fire side.</p>

               <p>Do you say you had a doubt when you was examined before? - Yes, Sir; I thought I heard him say to Grace, here is the aqua-fortis. I did not see him do and thing with it.

               <p>You say there was no money coloured, that you saw, in the room? - None, that I saw.</p>

               <p>You was taken up first as a party concerned in this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards admitted an evidence? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have not you had a conversation with Walker since he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him, that you was compelled to say something against him, and threatened if you did not? - Yes; I said I must tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you was threatened to say what you should say? - I did say, one told me one story, and another told me another story. One told me I should be hanged, and another, I should be burnt. Several told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you mean to say, that what you have said now, and said at the Justice's, is not truth? - What I have said now, is the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Walker. Did not you say, that Armstrong threatned you, with a stick to your head, when he was left with you in the room, if you did not say so? - They told me I should be hanged and burnt, if I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140045"></xptr>not say so; they did not hold a stick up to my head.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Walker so? - I do not know whether I did or no; I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Court. When the liquor; whatever it was, was poured into the bason, what was done with it afterwards? - I did not see; I believe it was thrown under the grate.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the money was or was not put into the bason? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Walker. Please to ask her, whether she has not now a person under sentence of transportation that cohabited with her? The woman is of a very foul character; her evidence is hardly worth taking.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you had better ask Armstrong that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Armstrong. You hear what he says, that this woman has been in custody for other crimes before, and that a person she cohabited with is now under sentence of transportation? - I apprehended her upon a charge, and she was discharged before the magistrate, without fee or reward on my part; and Mr. Vernon himself took this examination. I then said to him, in the face of the magistrate, before this woman; Sir, says I, I asked her if any one officer has said one word to her; I beg, Sir, that you, as a gentleman, will do that; and it was put to her, and she said No.</p>

               <p>Did you learn from them what the use was? - I believe Walker mentioned, the first time he came, that he was liable to take bad silver, and it was to try the silver, whether it was good or bad.</p>
               <p>Was it this kind of bottle? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Then aqua-fortis may be applied to know whether money is good or bad? - We make use of it daily for that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. By what process could you distinguish it? - If it is bad, it turns green on the surface, and if it is good, it turns black.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say now, as a chymist, that aqua-fortis turns brass green? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a partner with Mr. Vernon, the Sollicitor for the Mint. I tried this piece. I burnt it black, and took it out, and put it into cold water and rubbed it with sand; that turns it to this colour; and this black stuff deadens the white, which makes it look like old money. We put it into aqua-fortis, that makes it black; then it is rubbed with sand, that makes it too white to pass; and then that white is deadened by the blacking. Here is one I tried. I restored it to the brass colour, then I put it into aqua-fortis, and afterwards in water; then I rubbed it with sand, and then I rubbed it with that black stuff.</p>

               <p>PRISONER GRACE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at a publick-house along with Mrs. Humphries. She told me she had a coat to pledge, and asked me to carry it: while I was up in the room, Armstrong came up, and said he had a warrant against Walker; Walker begged of him to put it off; Armstrong was gone down about five minutes. I stood by the side of Walker, and they all rushed in. We were doing nothing.</p>

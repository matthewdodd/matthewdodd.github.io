            . I am servant to Captain Simmons - he is a customer to Mr. Dakin; I paid the prisoner the weekly bills, and he has receipted them; here is one for 3s. 4 1/2d., another 3s. 6 1/2d., and another 4s. 8 1/2d.; I paid them all to the prisoner - the last date is the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH DAKIN. Q. Did the prisoner ever pay you any of these bills? A. No. On the 29th I sent another servant to Captain Simmons, and I told the prisoner he had brought back word that Captain Simmons did not owe me a farthing - he said he had received them, but had lost a sovereign, and did not like to tell me; that the sovereign was one of his own, and he had kept the sovereign which he had received from the customer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you charged him with receiving this money from Captain Simmons, did he not admit that he had received it? A. Yes; I owed him about a fortnight's wages: I have since had the money from his mother.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and asked if he knew what his master accused him of - he said Yes; I said, "Then, you understand you are charged with receiving 1l. 3s. 6d.;" he said Yes; I searched him, and found a sovereign, which he said he had just got from his mother; his master said, "You have not been out;" he said, "Yes, I went out while you was out:" he then said he had kept the money back in consequence of having lost a sovereign of his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of taking money for Mr. Dakin; Mrs. Freeman did not always pay me weekly - sometimes it went two or three weeks, when I received part; I did not give it my master till I received the whole. I lost a sovereign, and went and asked my mother to lend me one - she had not got one, and I did not like to say anything till I got it. The day my master found it out, I had been and got a sovereign of my mother, and just as I came back, my master got the officer and took me.</p>

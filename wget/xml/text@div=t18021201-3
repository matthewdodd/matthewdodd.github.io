               <p>Q. Do you not know she was upon the town?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The infamy of the question is its own answer. Is it not a question to be put, and I am sure your Lordship will not suffer such a question to be put by a man who has married a woman, whether she was ever upon the town or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have as much right to put those questions in as they have against me.</p>
               <p>Court. You may prove any facts yourself, but you must not put questions in an irregular way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This crime which I have committed, I was totally drawn into. This first wife of mine which I married, I lived ten years happy with; I used her well, till I had the misfortune to be confined 18 months in the Marshalsea Prison, and this girl was brought there for a mantua-maker's bill; she there used all the insinuating manners that a girl of her description could possibly, and I resisted it; she was upon the town a twelvemonth and more; after this girl had been there a month, she wrote to her plaintiff to make it up with her; she made it up, and I had the misfortune likewise to join in a note with her for that debt, and she got out upon that, and in the course of a month after I got out myself; but while I was in the Marshalsea, and she was out, I used to have letters from her every day, and in all these letters she extolled every thing that was good of myself, and that was bad of my wife, and said she wondered I could live with such a dirty drab; that she herself was an accomplished girl of family, and had given up the first company, that of the Prince of Wales, Duke of Clarence, and Marquis of Hertford, upon my account. To all this I always resisted. I told her she knew that I was married, for in fact my wife was along with me when I came out. I did not go to her, but she found me out, and when she found me out, she got me to her, and after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010005"></xptr>that I was one day from her, she used to send six or seven people after me with messages continually. Soon after this the mother came to town, and took her to Edgware road; the girl sent to me to come there; I went there, and she said I must marry her; I told her it was impossible for me to marry her, for she well knew, as she had seen the certificate of my wife's marriage, that I was married; I told her it was impossible that I could marry her; she was there about a week in the Edgware-road, and after that she went to Chelsea, where I saw the mother; on the Sauturday evening I received a note by Captain 
               <persName id="t18021201-3-person73">Brien</persName>
            's servant to come and drink tea on Sunday afternoon; accordingly I went; when I came there the mother asked me the questions that I have asked her, which I declined; the first question her mother asked me was, what were my pursuts in life? - I told her my circumstances; that I came from the Marshalsea; I was very poor when I came out, and my income could not exceed 150l. a year; she said that was very little to main tain a wife; I told her it was, but the girl had represented me to be a merchant of 800l. a year. I told her it was not such thing, and she said she had a very strong, affection for me; I told her I wished her very well; but as to marrying her, that was impossible, the narrowness of my circumstances would not allow it; after that she said she would consult some friends of her's, and would let me know further about it; on Monday I received a letter, saying she had consulted a male friend, and I was to call at Captain 
               <persName id="t18021201-3-person74">Brien</persName>
            's, in Baker-street, in the evening, where she would meet me; I sent her letter that a lodged at such a place at Islington, where I should be very happy to see any male friend of her's; that was on Monday; or Tuesday night, about eight o'clock, with I went home a cartage alighed at she door, with two footmen; the mother was there, with two other persons, and asked me of there was a possibility of my income being increased; I told her the girl was not a sit person for me; I persuaded her to send her to her friends; she might perhaps come round, and be virtuous once more, but they would not take that answer; then she said she would send to Dr. Drought, at Bath, a relation of her father's; she said she had left her father twelve years ago; they were to try if they could not make a fortune for me; Captain Brien said they could not do less than 50l. a year at any rate; about a week after that I received a letter from Mrs. Drought, saying she had received a letter from Dr. Drought, at Bath, declining having any thing to do with it, and she wished me to settle it as soon as possible; she desired me to get a licence the next day; I hesitated at that, but did not say immediately I would not; but the next night I went and told her I could not get the licence, and then they proposed to have the banns published; I said they might do as they liked about it, and they had the banns published; I desired the girl to inform her mother I was a married man; she laid it was nothning to her two or three times, declining coming near her; but she insisted upon my coming; when the day came I did not go; I was determined to find out my wife; she was in service somewhere; I meant to send her to the girl and the mother, and let her tell them herself; I went in the evening, and told the mother I was ill was the reason of my not attending; I took her into another room, and begged of her to tell her mother I was married, she said her mother knew it as well as herself, and desired me to come the next day; I did not go till eleven o'clock; I was in hopes that would he too late, but they took care to catch me then. Mr Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I must throw myself upon your mercy; this girl was a girl of illfame; she even told my wife she had deluded a better man than ever I was from his wife; that I was not the first, not should not be the last.</p>

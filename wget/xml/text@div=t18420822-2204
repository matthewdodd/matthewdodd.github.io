                  </hi>. I am manager of the Nag's Head, James-street, Covent-garden. On the 12th of July, at a quarter before six o'clock in the morning—a stranger came up to the counter, and put down half-a-Crown for payment of a pot of porter—I put down one shilling and two sixpences in change, and was going to give 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—the prisoner took three halfpence from his pocket, put it over the shilling and two six<lb></lb>pences, drew it away, and put it into his right hand jacket pocket—I told him it was not his change, and desired him to give it to the man that gave me the half-crown—he said he had not got it—I took hold of him, and sent for a policeman, who came and took him—he then said, "I have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, but it is my own money"—one shilling and two sixpences were taken out of his pocket at the station—I did not know him before.</p>

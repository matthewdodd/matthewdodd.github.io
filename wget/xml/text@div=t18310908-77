               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it a dark night? A. Yes, but light in that neighbourhood with the lamps; there were a great many persons about; I said at the office that I would not swear the prisoner had robbed me; I do not recollect the Policeman telling me not to be afraid, but to swear positively - I did not tell the prisoner's mother that the Policeman desired me to swear to him; but the prisoner stood before me, and I laid hold of him instantly: when I first took hold of him he had a hat on certainly; whether it was off afterwards or not I cannot tell, but mine was.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty, and saw a gang of fifteen young men; the prosecutor was going on, and the ladies following him - the gang separated, and part of them surrounded the prosecutor: I stood next to the prisoner, when I heard the prosecutor exclaim to the crowd around, "You have got my watch?" the prisoner was the nearest person to him - he did not know that I was an officer: the instant the prosecutor called out, I seized the prisoner's two hands, and lifted them up - I saw a ribbon and a key attached to it, in his possession; this was all the work of a moment; there was an attempt at rescue, and I was very ill-used with blows and kicks - I secured the prisoner, with three others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had any one else hold of the prisoner at that time? A. Yes, the prosecutor and two gentlemen, who are not here - I had counted the fifteen persons in the gang; there were thousands of persons in the street- I took fast hold of the prisoner's hands, and held them up, but in the attempt at rescue the key and ribbon might be taken from him without my seeing it - the ribbon appeared a dark colour; I saw no seal, only a key.</p>

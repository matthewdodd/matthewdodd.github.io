               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where were you? A.About one hundred yards behind the cart - I had been acquainted with Brotherhood before that; there were no hedges between me and them - it is a turnpike road; the cart had no tilt over it - when the cart was stopped I was gone for the constable; Brotherhood was not laying drunk in the bottom of the cart.</p>

            . I have a field near the spot described. I lost some oats in the straw from it - I afterwards saw some of the same description, and I believe they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You received information of their being taken? A. Yes, and went to the cart; Brotherhood was there, laying in the cart asleep - that was a mile and a half from my field; I aroused him; he was asleep, but I do not think he was drunk -I asked what he had in his cart; he made an answer not fit to be repeated; I made them an offer to take the oats back to the field, which they refused - they followed me; I said I should give charge of them; Brotherhood then took the reins out of Thomas' hand, and they turned and drove off - I gave them both into custody of the patrol, but I said that if he felt disposed to let Brotherhood out for the Sunday he might; Thomas remained in custody -Brotherhood went away, and appeared next day; the Magistrate let him out on bail, by my wish - I always considered him a man of credit - I think he had had some liquor; he called on me the same evening, to know what was the matter - I told him I had nothing to do with it; I had given it up to other hands.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in pursuit of the cart - I took the two prisoners; Thomas said his master knew nothing about it, and he was the only person who had stolen the oats, while his master was asleep- he was not asleep when I found him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was Brotherhood sober? A. I thought him in liquor.</p>
               <p>Brotherhood's Defence.

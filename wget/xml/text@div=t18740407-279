Pynot—the signature to this letter, signed "Debreville for Blumberg" is in the same writing as the signature to the translations, but I cannot say as to the body—I cannot tell whether the person signing wrote the letters, because it is a quaint signature, but the bodies are in the same writing, and the signatures are in the same writing—I believe this signature "Larrys &amp; Co." to be in the same writing as this Debreville—this paper found in the key-hole, signed Brunneau, is also in the same writing—I believe the prisoner wrote this signature and also this for "Blumberg &amp; Co."—and I have no doubt that this Debreville is his—I could form a better opinion if I sat down and inspected it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Stratford of 10, Belvedere Crescent, Lambeth—I knew the prisoner from March to August, 1873—he spoke good English; another man came with him who only spoke French and who acted as interpreter—the other man took my front kitchen at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week and gave mo a card, in consequence of which I went to 3, Grafton Street, where I saw the man who was afterwards my lodger, and I inferred from the card that his name was Blumberg—the prisoner did not</p>

               <p>tell me his name, he did not pretend to engage the room himself—the room was hired as a workshop, but used as a warehouse—no workmen were there—the prisoner came to see the man, but I never heard him address him as Blumberg—when he had been there about a month my lodger asked me for a rent-book, and gave me his name as Roberts; I questioned the prisoner about it, as I thought my lodger's name was Blumberg, and he said that Messrs. Blumberg &amp; Co. were at Grafton Street, and that Mr. Blumberg was another gentleman and not my lodger—Roberts was about 5 feet 6 inches high, rather high-shouldered, pale-faced, and he had hair down here—he was about thirty-three or thirty-six years old, I don't think he was forty—his hair was rather dark—I saw a great many clocks brought to my place, they always came in private vans, never by Parcels' Delivery; some of them were taken away daily, hundreds or more have been there at a time—I certainly did buy one of Mr. Roberts, he was leaving and had not paid his rent, he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I allowed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the clock and paid him the difference—it had a black case with ornaments—the prisoner was never present when any transaction about clocks took place—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears my lodger's signature, but it was not signed in my presence—the prisoner was present once or twice when clocks came, and assisted to unpack them.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker of Ryder's Court, Leicester Square—eleven clock movements were pawned with me, not by the prisoner, but by a man who gave the name of Godin—there were seven on 10th February and four on 9th February, 1874—he signed the book in my presence, but I see no similarity to his writing in this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

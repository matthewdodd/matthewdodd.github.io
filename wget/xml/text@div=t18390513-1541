                  </hi>. I am a grocer and tea-dealer. I have a shop in Shoreditch, and on Saturday the 13th of April I opened another shop in Whitechapel-road—I hired the prisoner to be one of my shop men for that day—it was</p>

               <p>his duty to serve the customers, take money, and put the silver in the sil<lb></lb>ver till, and the gold in the gold till, which were at different parts of the counter—the gold till was about five feet and a half from where he stood—between nine and ten o'clock that evening he was in the shop serving, and I was at the end of the counter, about six yards from him—there was no one between me and him—I saw a half-sovereign put down for goods—he gave the change from the till opposite where he was—I saw him take up the half-sovereign and put it to his mouth—I saw it in his hand distinctly—he was five feet and a half from the gold till—it was on the same side of the counter as he was, and between me and him—he never went to the gold till—he never moved, I am quite sure he could not reach the gold till from where he stood—I cannot say that I saw his hand come down from his mouth without the half-sovereign, but I saw his tongue move after his hand left his mouth, as if he were putting something on one side—he had just began to serve another customer—I went and took hold of him and told him I wanted him—I charged him with taking a half-sovereign and putting it into his month—he said I was mistaken—I took him to the end of the shop and sent out for the policeman—I kept the prisoner in sight till he was searched—I saw his mouth opened—there was nothing in it—I saw his pockets searched, and three sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and some silver was found on him.</p>

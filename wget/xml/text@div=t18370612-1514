                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Parsons, and lire in Spencer-place, Somers-town—I am a laundress. On the night of the 6th of June, between eight and nine o'clock, I met the prisoner in my passage, and asked who she wanted—she said Mrs. somebody—I cannot recollect what name—I asked what she did—she said she went out washing—I said there was a person next door who went out washing—she turned to go out of the street door, and I saw a silk handkerchief dragging on the floor under her gown—I took it up, and found it was one of my own, which had been hanging on the banisters—I followed the prisoner, and asked her to give me the things she had taken—I held her by her gown—she dropped herself down, and five handkerchiefs rolled from her gown—my street door hid been left open.</p>

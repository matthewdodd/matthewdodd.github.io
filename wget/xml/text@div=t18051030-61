            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's: Three of the watchmen brought the prisoner into the watch-house, with that bag, containing four parcels, and that was one of them; that was on the 19th of September between one and two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What did the prisoner say when he was brought in? - A. I asked him what he had got in the bag; he said, he had been at Brentford, and coming down Monmouth-street he picked it up, and he was going to Edmonton; I opened the bag and broke open this parcel, and in the parcel I found the bill of parcel, which led to a discovery of the owner, and the next morning I went to whom it belonged to.</p>

On the morning of the 19th of September, about twenty minutes before two o'clock, the prisoner was in West Smithfield, he passed by me as I was in my box; I followed him, as he wished to shun me as much as possible, and when I came up to him I felt the bag; I asked him, what he had got in there; he replied, what is that to you; I said where are you going to; he said, Edmonton; I said, you are too late for the fair now; he then said, he would give me sixpence to let him go; I said, I cannot let you go; in the mean time my partner came up, and we conducted him to the watch-house. That is the bag we took off his shoulder, I delivered it to Tilner at the watch-house. (The property identified by Tugwell.)</p>

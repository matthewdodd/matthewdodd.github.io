I went into a room at No. 5, at three o'clock in the morning, on the 4th of December, to get the money which Ken<lb></lb>nedy had received during the night—I did not see the prisoner there—I sat down in a chair and fell asleep—there was no one there—when I went to sleep I had in my pocket five shillings, two sixpences, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cop<lb></lb>per, and a foreign coin of Louis XVI.—my niece awoke me and said I was robbed—the prisoner ran out of the room as I awoke, and said, "Come out, you will get plenty of gin"—my money was gone, and part of my pocket—the remainder of my pocket was attached to my side—he had cut my pocket and my gown also—here is the gown he cut—the money was found on him—this is the French piece—I keep it as a remembrance of my husband's age—I have had it four years.</p>

I had been driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and received different fares; I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my different pockets. I left off work about midnight; I met a girl as I was coming home, who asked me to treat her; I took her to two public-houses, and treated her; she then wanted some<lb></lb>thing to eat, and took me to a little shop in St. Giles's; and every body of experience must know the infamy and notoriety of St. Giles's. Well, I went; she had some soup, I had some bread and cheese; I then sent out for gin and beer; the old woman, Kennedy, came in, and had some; I felt a little stupified, and went out; the woman I had been with came after me, embraced me, and put her hand into my pocket; she then ran into a house over the way; I followed her, and there were three or four women in the passage, who pulled me about; I then went out, and thought perhaps I had only lost a shilling or two. I was going on, and these people seized me again. The money in my coat-pocket was my master's, as I can prove: the money in my fob was my own, which I had saved up. I hope you will recollect that this deceiver is worse than one of old: he could read the superscription, but this deceiver cannot. I hope you will "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's."</p>

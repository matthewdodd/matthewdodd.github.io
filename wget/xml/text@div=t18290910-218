            . I am the wife of Jacob Munday - we live in Burn's-place, Edgware-road; I can see from my bed-room into Mrs. Allen's house. I saw the prisoner on Mrs. Allen's fence on the 27th of July - the fence broke, and she went over into another garden - she then stood upon the fence some time - I called to her, but she did not answer me; she then went into Mr. Burke's wash-house, got on the files, and into the loft of Mrs. Allen's house - I waited about an hour and a half; she did not come out - I then went to bed; I told Mrs. Allen of it on the Friday evening.</p>

            . On the Sunday night, the 26th, I tried a little room by the side of my bed-room, and found it locked - I thought my niece had taken the key; in the morning, when she came, I said, "Why did you lock that door?" she said. I did not;" she opened the door, we went in, and missed her bonnet, a cornelian necklace, a pair of ear-rings, two brooches, a silver knife, two shirt-pins, and a great many other things, which I have never seen since - I had seen them safe on the Saturday or Sunday, in the bureau; I know the bureau was fast on the Sunday - whoever took the things must have secreted themselves in the house; the bureau was wrenched all to pieces - the prisoner knew the bureau; and in her father's life time, if we had a little money, it was always put there - I went to Mrs. Pratt's house, and saw the box which my daughter had brought there; I saw a great many things of mine there, and a great number of duplicates - the officer took her; I do not recollect that she said any thing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court and my mother.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. ALLEN Q. Did you turn your daughter out of doors? A. No; she has been robbing me these five years successively - I have seen her but once since her father's death, and then she was in a situation.</p>

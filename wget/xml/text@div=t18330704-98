            . I live with my brother at the George and Crown, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; the prosecutor and the prisoner came there on the day stated, and had two pints of porter, which the prosecutor paid for, he then fell asleep; the prisoner sat by his side - when the prosecutor came in he had a hat on, and when he awoke he complained of the loss of his hat and his money, and the pin out of his shirt - I saw the prisoner again at five o'clock the next morning, and he offered to change a good hat with any person in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear him say he wanted some money? A. No, I only saw the prosecutor asleep and the prisoner there, and no one entered the box while they were there.</p>

             (police-constable E 141). The prisoner was given in charge to me by the prosecutor, for taking his hat and other things the day before - the prisoner said he was drunk and did not know what he was about - I was going to the office with the prisoner, and I was asking the prosecutor some questions - the prisoner said I had no right to ask any questions; I said, I knew my duty, I had a right to ask the prosecutor any questions, but the prisoner none - I found nothing on the prisoner but a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>- YOUNG. I am the prisoner's mother. On the 19th of June he had a very good hat on, he had had it new about three weeks - he had no older one at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know where he bought it? A. No; I believe he bought it of a Jew - he never told me where he bought it - it was not a particularly good one, but it was new - it did not exactly fit him, and that was why he wanted to change it; he wanted to get a shilling, or 1s. 6d. for it, and an old hat.</p>
               <p>- Dixon, a hackney-coachman, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

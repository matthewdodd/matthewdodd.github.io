            . I work for Mr. Hale. On the 9th of June, about a quarter past six in the morning, I met Gudger with the bag upon his shoulder; I did not see Colley; then Gudger was in the adjoining field to Mr. Hale's house, across the road; I thought I knew the bag; I walked by him and I thought I saw the hinges in the bag, they were hinges that dropt off a five bar gate; we had put them in a bag. I examined the house, I found they were gone, I pursued Gudger to the third field, I came up to Colley, he had them upon his shoulder; Gudger was about thirty yards a head, I put my hand upon the bag I told him to stop, he said for what; I said he had my property, Colley immediately put the bag down, and stood along side of it; I ran up to Gudger, and catched hold of his shoulder, he said what is the matter; I told him he should go along with me, and just as he came up to Colley, he began to cry, and said he hoped I would not hurt him; I told him I would not hurt him no more than the law would allow: I would hang him if I could, for we had been robbed so many times before; he said he had taken them out of the house, between three and four in the morning; I told Colley to take the iron up, and follow me; Colley said Gudger was to give him a pint of beer to carry it; Gudger said he was the only person that took it; he was to give Colley some beer for carrying it.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Gudger said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses's to character.</p>

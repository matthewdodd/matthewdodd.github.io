            , one of my clerks. The prisoner slept out of my house. On the next morning I placed myself in a situation that he should not observe me where I had a full view of the counter and the till.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did the prisoner come the next morning - A. About seven o'clock. When he came in he immediately went to the till; he took a key out of his pocket and opened the till; I saw him take out some money; he then shut it. In about half a minute he came to it the second time and took some more money. I sent for an officer of Bow-street. When the officer came I charged the prisoner with having robbed me; he first denied it, but when I gave Mr. Bacon an order to search him he confessed it; he said he had robbed the till but once, and begged I would forgive him; I told him it was too late now, the law must take its course. I charged him with having robbed the till twice; he said he only opened it once; he begged pardon, said he would not do it again; he pretended to be very ill, and fainting, and very much agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you afterwards went to his lodgings - A. Yes; in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane; we took the prisoner with us; there I found a variety of articles that had come from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find among other things a picture - A. Yes; which belonged to me.</p>
               <p>- BACON. I am an officer. On the 20th of May, in the morning. I went to Mr. Akerman's, when I got there the prisoner was sent for from below. When he came up Mr. Akerman said he had lost some money, together with a key which opened Mr. Akerman's till. He begged for mercy; I took the prisoner to his lodgings; Mr. Akerman followed. In his lodgings I found these things.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

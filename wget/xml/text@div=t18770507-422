                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Hovenden and Sons, wholesale perfumers, of the City Road; on 24th March eight dozen boxes of Blair's pills were sold to my firm, but not to me; and on 5th April six dozen, and on 12th April twelve dozen—I communicated with Messrs. Prout, and gave certain directions, and last Thursday week Robinson called with another parcel of goods—I said "Can you <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me any information who you got these from?"—he said "From a man named Goodwin"—I asked him where he obtained Blair's pills; he produced a piece of paper from his pocket with the name of Billett on it, who he said was an advertising agent, and that he got the goods in payment for advertisements—he went with me Steadman's, and on returning he said that he was well known to Serjeant Moss, the City Police officer—I went with him there the same day to the Old Jewry, and Moss took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 26th April, Mr. Hovenden came to me at 26, Old Jewry, with Robinson—I said to Robinson "You have sold a large quantity of Blair's pills, from whom did you receive them?"—he said From a man named Billet"—I said "Where does Billet live?"—he said "I cannot tell you"—I said "Do you know where he carries busi<lb></lb>ness?"—he said "No"—I told him the account he gave was not satisfactory, and I should have to charge him with the unlawful possession of the goods—he said that he had been to Prout's, in the Strand, and referred me to Mr. Prout; he said "If you go to Prout's you will see a little man behind the counter, who will be able to give you some information who Billet is"—I then went to Robinson's residence, and found seven boxes of Blair's pills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705070019"></xptr>
               <p>and otter articles—he said that he had got a portion of them from Billett and a portion from a man named Goodwin, who he hed seen that morning and received the goods from him, that he had an appointment to meet him at 2 o'clock that day, but he did not know where he lived—it was then past 3 o'clock—I went to Prout's next day with Downes, and saw Newman—I told him we were City detective officers, that I had a man named Robinson in custody charged with the unlawful possession of a quantity of drugs, that he had been selling a large quantity of pills, and had referred me to him; I asked if he knew such a person, and if he knew Billett—he said "Billett is not his right name; his name is William Kennett" (that is the other pri<lb></lb>soner)—he said that Kensett was formerly employed there, and lived—at 188, High Holborn, that he had been induced by Kennett to steal the pills, and had been taking about three—quarters of a pound of those pills three times a week, and he generally came there about 9.5 a.m.—Robinson was remanded twice that inquiries might be made about Goodwin, and then he was dis<lb></lb>charged—I saw the three in the dock at Bow Street—a quantity of pills was found at Kennett's married sister's.</p>

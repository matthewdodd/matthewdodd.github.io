                  </hi>. I am a paper-stainer, and live at No. 173, Shoreditch. On the 23rd of March I gave certain directions for tying up pieces of paper ready for Thursday, which was the day after the fast-day—this paper produced is mine—it is a registered pattern—no one else can print it—we had never sold any of it in London before—there is a registered mark on it—the stamp is here which made that mark—I did not see it after it was packed—a policeman called on me in the following week, and asked me if I had lost any paper.</p>

On the 10th of April I followed Martin (the last prisoner) into the prisoner Sharpe's house, 6, Plough-court or Plough-square—when they had taken Martin away, the prisoner came over, and asked me what all this was about, and told me there was a man going to bring some paper, and told me if he was wanted he should be over in his other shop, meaning his barber's shop—nothing was said then as to who the house belonged to—Child returned in a short time, and the prisoner followed him from his other shop—I told him what it was about, and asked him if it was agreeable to him for us to search his house—he said, "No"—I waited below—Child and Sharpe went over the house, not the barber's shop, but the lodging-house—we found no paper there—Sharpe brought some paper down from No. 5, next to the lodging-house—that is not the barber's shop—I believe it his own house—when we got to the station I asked him whether he had any invoice or bill to show—he said he would answer that question somewhere else—the paper on the ceiling of the shop was of the same pattern as that produced.</p>

I went to the prisoner's shop, and saw some paper which was there of this pattern—it looked as if it was recently put up.</p>

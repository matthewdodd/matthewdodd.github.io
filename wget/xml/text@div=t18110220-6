On the night of the 13th of February, about a quarter before 12 o'clock at night, I went to bed, I was the last person up, the house was fast as usual, the doors and windows, I fastened them myself. About half past three o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the corporal and serjeant on guard I got up, there is a guard at the Canteen to protect my property. When I looked out of the window, they told me to come down. When I came down, they asked me if I had lost any thing out of my bar, I told them I could not tell, if they would lend me a light, I would examine it. I examined my bar, I found the bar-door open, it is a half hatch door, I had bolted it inside, I found it unbolted and left open. In one of the drawers that we always put copper in, I found five pound fifteen shillings had been taken away out of six pound fifteen shillings. We found ten shillings in the drawer, five shillings on the dresser, and five shillings on the floor, all the halfpence I had tied up in five shillings in paper the evening before. The serjeant of the guards told me, that he had got two pounds fifteen shillings, and the prisoner was in the custody of the corporal and the serjeant in the guardroom.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the guard-room from your house. - A, About thirty-five or thirty-six yards. I went to the guard-room, I saw some of my halfpence in his foraging cap on the guard-room table. The prisoner was in custody in the guard-room. The whole the we found of my property was two pounds fifteen shillings, they were part loose, and part tied up. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200008"></xptr>were all tied up when taken away, I knew them in particular by the tie, and they are folded particularly, they are not tied up as others are. I lost about two quarts of rum, and some return tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your house afterwards. - A. I did, the person that got in, got in by the tap-room window, we could see the footsteps by the sawdust on the window-bench and on the window-ledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, of your own knowledge, know that that tap-room window was fast when you went to bed. - A. Yes, I fastened it the last thing myself before I went to bed. There were three parts of a pint pot of gin and peppermint that was not there when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is any person concerned with you in keeping the Canteen. - A. No person whatever.</p>

               <p>JAMES WATSON. I am a drum-major. On the morning of the 14th of February, I heard a noise on the landing of the room where I sleep. I sleep in the barracks, it is about sixty yards from the Canteens, I got up, and heard some one run down the stairs of the landing, into the barrack yard. I got up and put my great coat on, and went down stairs into the back yard, and there I saw the prisoner in custody of the centinel

I immediately took him to the guard-room and made him a prisoner there. I delivered the three papers of halfpence that I took from him to Serjeant Jones, they e then taken out of the foraging cap, and put on form in the guard-room, I then went to bed.</p>

About a quarter after three o'clock I heard a noise; some person came down the stairs very fast of the contrary side where I was posted centinel, he was crossing the barrack yard, and going on to the barrack stairs where I was centinel.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stairs from which he came near the Canteen. - A. No, I heard the drum-major talking from his window, I asked him what was the matter, he said he did not know, I soon after seized the prisoner about two minutes after I heard the noise. I kept him till Watson came up, I asked him what he had been doing, he said, nothing, but if I would not split, he would give me half of what he had got, and on his hearing the drum-major come up, he strove very hard to go to the privy. I held him fast, the drum-major came up and said,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 113). On 1st September, about a quarter to 6 in the evening, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, and was called into the Running Horse public-house—I found the prisoner there drunk and riotous—I ordered him to go quietly out of the house—he said he should not go out—he continued very violent—I then called New, a police constable who was outside—he came in—police constable Keenan and another constable came in in the meantime—Wore New came in, Keenan and I had hold of the prisoner—I had hold of his left hand with my right—he had thrown himself on the ground, and was kicking very violently—I heard New say, "He has kicked me in the private parts"—he appeared very ill, very pale—he had not got hold of the prisoner—he was behind me—Keenan was on my left, on the other side of the prisoner, assisting in getting him out—we succeeded in getting him out into the street with the assistance of Waterman—he resisted very much—we had to carry him the greatest part of the way to the station—he kicked very violently in the house, and also outside—on the road to the station he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280016"></xptr>
               <p>he would go quietly—we let him go, and he made a kick at me, and his foot came in contact with the lamp-post—we got him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police-constable—I am 28 years old—on 1st September I was called by Wiltshire to the Running Horse public-house, Harrow-road, about half past 6 in the evening—Wiltshire was in the house before I went in—when I went in I saw the prisoner there—he had no coat on, his shirt sleeves were turned up—he was standing by the bar—Wiltshire asked him to go out, and he would not go—Wiltshire took him by the hand, and he immediately threw himself on his back—while he was lying on his back Wiltshire was at his head, and the other constable was at his head, with his back towards me—the prisoner violently kicked me in the testicles, and I fell back against the form—I had not taken hold of him before he kicked me—he did not say anything or call out anything before he kicked me—he could see me very well where I was standing at the time he kicked me—his head was laid against the bar, and his heels against a little door that lead into the parlour or tap room—I was towards his feet—when he kicked me his feet were close to my heels, and as he lay on his back he threw his feet up—he could see me at the time he kicked me—I have done no duty from that day to this—I have been under the care of the surgeon—I was in the hospital six weeks—other constables came and took the prisoner into custody, and I was assisted home.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the D division—on 1st September, in the evening, I was called upon to see the constable New—I found that he had an injury of the testicles, and a general shake to the system, and it sub<lb></lb>sequently appeared that he had an injury to the spine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear to have been a strong man before this injury was inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing to indicate the contrary—I believe he was in perfect health when the injury was inflicted—his life was for some time in danger from this injury, and I cannot say at present that it is wholly out of danger—he is not likely ever to be able again to do duty as a policeman—the injury to the spine is likely to be more or less permanent—that was inflicted by the fall against the bench or form—there is no doubt that the whole injury is fairly accounted for by the statement made of what occurred at the moment—a mil backwards against a form or bench would have produced that.</p>

On Wednesday morning I found the prisoner close to the house; I am sure the prisoner is the woman that tore off my pocket: I never saw her before: no money was found on her to my knowledge.</p>

I was in Brick-lane when she picked me up; and she asked me for some liquor, but we had none: I had not been in the house two minutes before she tore my pocket off: there were four other women in the house when we went in. The prisoner and me went up two pair of stairs, and she cried out murder; and up came three girls and a man, who took me by the throat: as soon as I could I ran out of the house, and told the constable I had been robbed; we could not get into the house. I did not say any thing to the people that came up stairs. The next morning I took her. I lost four guineas and half a crown; I received the money the same day, but none of the money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

I know the prisoner; she was not the girl the prosecutor went with. I went after the half hour into a publick-house, and there I saw the prisoner dancing a reel: I staid with the prisoner till eight o'clock.</p>

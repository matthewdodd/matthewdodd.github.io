               <p>Q. Are you sure before they hustled you, that you had your watch in your pocket? - A. Yes, I am well assured of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen it? - A. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss your watch? - A. In a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Smith and Ennis were two of these persons? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q.Did you ever see these men before? - A. I have seen their persons in the street.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the last time you saw them before this happened? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time that you had seen them before, take any particular notice of them? - A. No, only when I see a press-gang it is natural to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. One press-gang is not like another then, I suppose? - A. No, no more than other men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever taken particular notice of the countenances of these men? - A. Yes, I am clear I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you know the countenances of all the press-gangs you ever saw? - A. By no means; but I had seen these two before, and knew them again.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you cannot tell us at what time you had seen them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was this offence committed? - A. Almost half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it not? - A. Yes, very dark.</p>
               <p>Q.From what reason can you swear that these two men were the identical persons that robbed you? - A.When I saw them at Dr. Morgan's door with a candle at the door, I saw them between me and the candle, and am sure they are the same men.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What do you mean by their being between you and the candle? - A. So that the candle shone upon their faces.</p>

Yes, he was in company with me and the other officers; he pointed out Ennis and Smith from five other men; I searched them, and found upon Smith, who was the master of the gang, a paper,(producing it;) he said he was authorised by Mr. Whiteway to press men; he stands upon Towerhill to get all the seamen he can.</p>
               <p>Q. A crimp, I suppose? - A. Yes; I apprehended them, and took them before the Magistrates at Shadwell; and there the prosecutor swore positively to Ennis and Smith; he never had the least doubt about them; the watch has never been found.</p>
               <p>JOHN WOOD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was called to the assistance of the prosecutor: On Wednesday the 26th of February, about half past ten o'clock, I received in charge from him a stout man, apparently an Irishman, and he went with me a little way, and then he got from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, all of them; two I know particularly, Ennis and Brewer, I saw them in the street that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020034"></xptr>might; I was knocked down by three or four men, and the man that was delivered to me got away, but when I self upon the ground, I saw Ennis and Brewer run away; Ennis made a reply to his other comrades, come up this place, that was White's-yard; upon that I went to the watch-house and gave information; when the prosecutor gave me charge of the first man, I told him what gang they were, they used to go a pressing of a night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant at Swansea for myself, and also act as agent for other firms—on 11th April I received by post this letter dated 10th April, signed John Harvey, 1, Marion Villas, Lansdowne Road, Dalston, asking the price of coals for his nephew at Dieppe—I sent an answer giving the prices, and on 14th April received this letter dated the 13th, signed in the same way—I wrote to him on the 16th, stating the terms for cash—other letters passed between us, I asking for cash and he proposing bills—on 20th April I received this letter dated the 19th. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed the names of Messrs. Poore &amp; Co. and Messrs. W. Thompson &amp; Co., of</hi> 61, <hi rend="italic">Watling Street, as references.</hi>) I wrote to Thompson &amp; Co., and got this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd April, stating that they had had many transactions with Mr. Harvey, and whatever business was entered into with him</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">would meet with punctuality.</hi> I then agreed to ship the cargo, but I never agreed to take bills—they offered me bills, but I declined them—on 9th May he enclosed a draft from Mr. James Standing at two months, dated 1st May—Standing was described as an engineer, of 49, Northampton Row, London, and Buckhurst Hill, Essex—I retained the bill, but advised Harvey that the captain would not accept it in part payment of freight—I proposed a meeting, and ultimately, on 17th May, met John Garner, who called him<lb></lb>self Johnson, at Kennan's Hotel—he brought this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated, "Whatever arrangement you make will be binding on my part</hi>"—<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HARVEY</hi>.) That "John Harvey" is in the same writing as a previous letter—I declined to give up the bills of lading without the money—he said that I had better take them back—I said that if he was prepared to give me good bills I would take them in payment—ten or fifteen minutes passed, and he said that he had some bills of exchange at home, and though he had no authority from Harvey to part with them, he would do so, as the vessel was probably at her destination—he also produced a cheque, and said "I wish I could endorse it to you"—he left me, and in the course of an hour came again, and produced these two bills of exchange, and afterwards one other was drawn—I returned the one drawn on Standing—it was arranged that those four bills should be held by me as collateral security—I saw Johnson sign this bill in the name of John Harvey, and it struck me that the writing was the same as the letters I received—I said "I have got a letter con<lb></lb>firming our arrangement," and he wrote this letter in my presence—I said "I am astonished to see your writing so much like John Harvey's"—he said "My brother-in-law is a self-raised man, he is unable to write, and I do the whole of his correspondence; he is a very respectable man, and very well off"—he accepted the bill, payable at the Bank of England; he said, "All Harvey's bills are payable at the Bank of England; everything is paid there"—I asked him the name of his nephew at Rouen; he said "John Harvey," and then I made a pencil memorandum—I told him I did not know either of the names on those bills, and asked for a reference—he said "I don't know that they would care about having their names hawked about, they are very respectable people; but if they do not pay, John Harvey is quite capable of paying," and I did not write to them—he said that Henry Pool was an iron and steel factor, and that these bills were given for iron and steel, and were regular trade bills; that Freeman was a Government con<lb></lb>tractor, and a very respectable man, and John Harvey had dealings with him, and all his bills were met—after that conversation I kept the bills, and endorsed the bill of lading over to him—the ship had left two or three days previously—here is the bill of lading which we endorsed—I paid the bills to our banker, and in consequence of what he said I came up and put myself in communication with the police, and wrote to say that I should be at Kennan's Hotel on the following Monday—I received this letter from a person signing the name of Buckley—I went with Sergeant Peck to Kennan's Hotel, and met a person who called himself William Buckley, who said he had full authority from Johnson and Harvey to enter into business with me; that one of them was at Hull and the other at Sunderland—he said that he was a coal factor, doing business at King's Cross and Chalk Farm—we had some conversation about coal, and I proposed to telegraph to Johnson to come up and see me—he went away with that intention, and I went off to Dieppe the same evening, where I found the vessel with the coals on board, minus 10 tons out of 330—that was 24th May, I think—I saw the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190005"></xptr>
               <p>bill of lading; it was endorsed first by myself to Harvey, and from Harvey to John Hart—the Harts are large brokers and merchants at Dieppe—I sold the coal at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the invoice came to 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the coal was sold by Hart for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than the cost price—after some conversation with Hart, I went to Hilton's Hotel, Dieppe, and, after some conversation with the landlord, I found John Garner in bed there, though Hart had told me he had left for Rouen—I had some difficulty in waking him, until I put a candle to his nose—I then told him that he had better not leave for 24 hours at least, my object being that he should leave—I went on board the boat for England a few hours afterwards, thinking he was on board, but he was too sharp for me, and two days afterwards I found him in custody in London—I am satisfied that he is the person who called himself Johnson—William Garner was also taken; he is the man who came to me as Buckley.</p>

Q.</hi> How long ago did you take my bill of exchange? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 17th May, the same day as the others—the ship started on 12th May, and I received your bill on the 11th from Johnson—she had sailed two days when I saw Mr. Garner in the City—a bill was sent in advance on account of freight a week before, as the charter-party states that one-third is to be paid before starting—I had written that the vessel was loading, and that I should be glad to receive a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I telegraphed to ask for the money, but it was not forthcoming—I came up to London on the Sunday to get my money before the ship started, and went to Kennan's Hotel—I went to Mr. Harvey, at Lansdowne Terrace, and saw a lady, who opened the door; that was about 7th or 8th May—I called at Mr. Harvey's house twice the same morning—I do not know whether the ship had sailed when I went back home, and saw Johnson at Swansea; he gave me your bill of exchange—I only saw him once there; the second time was at Dieppe, in bed—I had nothing to do with you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I would not have parted with the cargo if I had not believed the names to be genuine; I believed them to be trade bills—I have been to his place; there is no appearance of steel or of any business being carried on; it is merely a common cottage in the Hackney Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I know the prisoners, and have often seen them together—I do not know Hart—on 27th May I received instructions, went to Kennan's Hotel, and saw William Garner; he gave</p>

               <p>the name of Buckley—I went with Mr. Vivian to Dieppe, and on 31st May I received a communication from Mr. Vivian, at Swansea, in consequence of which I took John Garner in the Hackney Road—the warrant was in the name of Harvey—he said "I am not Harvey, and never have been"—I said "I know that perfectly well"—I went to his house, 1, Lansdowne Villas, Dalston, and found a quantity of letters, telegrams, and papers, and three pawn-tickets in the names of Garner, Gardner, and Garnett—I found some mining shares and some Spanish bonds in his pocket; I also found some letters and telegrams relating to this matter—I went to the Globe public-house, Hackney Road, and saw Poore, William Garner, a man named Standing, and another man, together there—it was 10 or 11 o'clock in the evening—I went into the next compartment, and heard them talking about the arrest of John Garner; Poore said "They can't do anything with <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—there was a good deal of noise, and I could not catch much of the con<lb></lb>versation—I then went to the compartment where they were, and told Poore he must consider himself in custody on a warrant—I called him by name; he said 'Yes, that is me"—I addressed William Garner; he said "Yes, how do you know my name?"—I said "I have known you some time"—I showed him the letters signed "Harvey" and "Buckley," and he said "Those are in my writing"—Standing gave his address 49, North<lb></lb>ampton Road, Clerkenwell—Poore gave his address, at the station, 2, Eleanor Row, Hackney, and William Garner gave his address 19, St. Philip's Road, Dalston—I went there; it is a small house—Poore's was a small house; there was no appearance of an iron or steel factory—William Garner took some papers out of his coat pocket as he was standing against the counter, and tried to pass them to another man—I found, on Poore, some papers, and a letter addressed "Mr. Standing, 49, Northampton Road," also a paper with "<hi rend="largeCaps">F. E</hi>. Vivian, Coal Merchant, Swansea," on it—the name "John Harvey" has been bracketed with it, but it is torn—here are two letters, one addressed "H. Burnett, Esq., 2, Eleanor Road, Hack<lb></lb>ney," and the other "Mr. H. Barnett"—the packet of papers I took from William Garner includes a card with the name of "William Buckley, 6, Clinton Road, Mile End Road," on it, I think, but it is in pencil, and almost illegible—I also found some bonds and coupons of a Spanish bank (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a letter addressed to Garner, and a piece of paper ad<lb></lb>dressed "Mr. John Hart, at Mr. Hilton's, Hotel d'Angleterre, Dieppe"—I have made inquiries at 9, Hewlett Road, for a person named Freeman, the other acceptor of the bill, but cannot find hi; a statement was made about him, which I believe to be false—Standing occupied one furnished room, without any appearance of business—I have not been able to find Mr. Thompson, or Mr. Hart—there was another piece of paper, on which was written "Henry Davey, Swansea," and below, "Mr. <hi rend="largeCaps">H. E</hi>. Vivian, 1, Mount Street, Swansea."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">William Garner produced a written defence, stating that he wrote the two letters at the request of Mrs. John Garner, and signed them in the name of Buckley; that he also, at her request, her husband being absent, met Mr. Vivian at Kennan's Hotel, but that he never had any trade transactions with John Garner, who never allowed him to know anything about his business.</hi>

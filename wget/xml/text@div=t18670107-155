                  </hi>. I reside at 7, John's Place, Stepney, and am an unfortunate woman—on the night of the 27th December, about half-past twelve, I was going into the Clyde public-house to have some beer—I saw the prisoner there, as I looked in at the door he took hold of my nose and twisted it—there were two more persons behind him, and the prosecutor was standing by the side of them—he came out first, and they followed him to the watering-place—the prosecutor said, "I am too artful for you,"—they shoved him into the watering-place—they stood there about two minutes, and came out again—there were four of them and a little boy—when they came out the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "We will see you home," and they got him into Nelson Street, on the left-hand side—I followed them—they put Mr. Watson on his back, and the prisoner knelt on his chest while the other two robbed him and got away—I saw their hands about his person—I was there because I wanted to give the prisoner in charge for twisting my nose—he stopped there till the two men got away, and then he went—I followed him, and when he got outside Nelson Street I held him by the tail of his coat and hallooed out, "Policeman," and a policeman came and took him back to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Alma Road—I went to the Clyde public-house on the 21st December, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I went to receive some money in Richard Street opposite—I had been backwards and forwards before that, but when I went at three I stopped there—I came out to make water—I then had five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in a purse, and some loose silver in my pocket—I know the prisoner—I had been several times with him in the afternoon—he had seen me come to fetch some drink for some friends—that was about twelve minutes or a quarter past twelve—he was in front of the bar, and he followed me out to the watering-place with two other men—I saw one of</p>

               <p>them last night—they took me from there into Nelson Street, and then threw me down and got the purse out of my pocket—the person I saw last night was the person who took the purse from my pocket while I was on the ground—I took hold of the purse and got it away, and they bent my thumb back and got it back again—the whole of the money was taken away, and the pocket hung loose—in the afternoon I had taken a sovereign out and changed it, and they gave me half a sovereign out—I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket at first in the afternoon—they kept me on the ground several minutes, and I screamed "Murder" and "Police" as well as I was able—I cannot say I saw anything further until I saw the prisoner in custody—I was bruised about by the struggle—a policeman came up to me in Nelson Street and took me to the station-house, and there I found the prisoner.</p>

On the morning of the 21st December, between twelve and one, I was on duty in Nelson Street, Commercial Road, within about sixty yards of the Clyde public-house—I heard a cry of "Police" and "Murder"—I ran up Nelson Street and saw the prosecutor lying on the pavement on his back—I saw the witness Moss running after the prisoner—I followed and took him back—I found the prosecutor in about the same spot where I had left him—he said the prisoner was one of the three that had robbed him—I took him to the Clyde, and asked the barman in his presence if the prisoner had been there with the prosecutor—he said yes, he had, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "I have been here these two or three hours"—the prose<lb></lb>cutor's pocket was hanging out, torn from his trousers—he had two half-sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about him, and a florin I found on the ground close to where he was lying.</p>

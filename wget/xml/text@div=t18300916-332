               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time was this? A. I was a little intoxicated; I think it must have been between seven o'clock and ten - I was not so drunk I could not stand up; the woman was not drunk; I called an officer, and gave her into custody with two men - there was a person named Hardy there; I think I had been in three public-houses after I received my money - I will not swear I had not been in six; I had but one girl with me; there were three other girls in company; I had been twelve or thirteen days living at the prisoner's house, and owed him money, which I intended to pay when I got up; I owed him a bill of 6l. 12s. - it is still due to him; no one was in the room with me but the girl - I found the prisoner in the passage, and Hardy with him; I gave the girl in charge, and then then the two men as fast as I could speak - after the girl was in custody she said the prisoner had it; I do not remember seeing any money fall - I heard a woman say to the girl, "If you have got the money why don't you give it to him?" the girl was crying, and said she had not - she did not say she bad money, but not mine - this was in the room; I remember her going on her knees, and protesting she had not the money.</p>

            . I was living with the prosecutor at the prisoner's house - he came from the India-house, and said he had a 5l. note and a sovereign; he went on the bed to lay down with me between four and five o'clock; the prisoner asked him to pay him - he said he would as soon as he got sober; the prisoner then left the room, and came in a little afterwards, while the prosecutor was asleep, and felt in his left pocket, took a pocket-book out, and a paper out of it - he then felt in his right-hand pocket, and took out a sovereign.</p>

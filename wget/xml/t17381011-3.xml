When I came out, I found Mr. Jarvis (the next Witness) and the Prisoner in the Shop, and saw him take one or two Parcels, (I can't tell which) out of the Prisoner's Hands; but Mr. Jarvis charged him with taking 2 Parcels, which were both opened; in one of them were 3 pair, and in the other 2 pair of Boys yarn Hose, which I know were Mr. Farrow's Property, and were worth about 3 s. 3 d. He fell down upon his Knees, and begged he might be let go, and said it was the first Fact.</p>

I saw the Prisoner go into Mr. Farrow's Shop, and take 2 Papers of Stockings off the Shelf, and was going away with them, but I ran in and stopp'd him, and took the two Parcels from him; in both Papers were 5 pair of Stockings. He fell upon his Knees, and promised if I would let him go, he would never do so any more.</p>

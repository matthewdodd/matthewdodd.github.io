                  </hi>. I live in Holy well-street, Milbank. On the 20th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Battersea-fields—I saw a young man struck down by a horse—I approached the crowd, and I had not remained above a minute or two before I felt some<lb></lb>thing at my pocket—I turned, and saw a lad with my handkerchief in his hand—I endeavoured to recover it from him, but in doing so he dropped it and got away—I gave an alarm—I am sure it was my handkerchief—I could not swear it was the prisoner who dropped it—I had only a glance at his face—I believe he is the person—he was exactly like him in size and clothing.</p>

I was in the crowd, and saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief between me and Mr. Gray—I am sure it was the prisoner—he stood behind me and Mr. Gray—I saw his hand draw from between me and Mr. Gray—the prisoner turned round, and Mr. Gray turned and laid hold of him by the cuff of his coat—I saw the handkerchief drop from the prisoner—I am sure it dropped from him, and he ran away.</p>

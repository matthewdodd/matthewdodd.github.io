On the 14th of May, I was on service in the house—about ten minutes before five o'clock in the morning the prisoners came in at the frotit-door with a female—they had a quartern of gin, and staid but a short time—they then all went out toge<lb></lb>ther—the prisoners returned in about twenty minutes, and asked if I had seen the female—I said I had not, she went out with them—they then went away—Chatter don afterwards came back alone in better than half-an-hour—he went through a door into a private part of the bar, which is only</p>

I was at the Nag's Head on the 14th of May, about five minutes before five in the morning—I saw Chatter don there—he went into a part called the " bottle department"—Davis came in two or three minutes afterwards—they had some gin to drink—Davis was at the bar playing with some girls—Chatter don was in the bottle department, and I saw him put his left arm across the bar, and with his left hand take the decanter of wine—Davis was at that time playing with the girls, attracting the bar-man's attention to the right-hand part of the bar—when Chatter don took the de<lb></lb>canter, Davis immediately went to him, and closed the door of the bottle department—Davis left first, and Chatter don afterwards—as he left I saw part of the decanter protruding from his pocket—I pursued him down Hart-street—he looked round, saw me, and ran off.</p>

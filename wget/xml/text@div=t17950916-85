The prisoner at the bar was smoaking his pipe in the parlour at the same time; he had used that house for a month before that, and never was out of it. When I was going home I asked the taylor where was the coat; and he put his hand behind him and did not find it, and there was nobody missed out of the room but the prisoner at the bar; we could not hear of him any more that night not the next day. I staid about an hour afterwards, but the coat was missed from about five minutes after he went out of the room; he never returned to the house; I never see him till last Monday week when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were you at the Brick-layers Arms? - Saturday, the 15th of August, about eight o'clock at night. He was taken up in St. Giles's. The people that were in the room knew that he stole the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coat ever found? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any people here that live in that public house? - No. When he was apprehended I told him if he would give me the duplicate of the coat, I would let him go about his business; he told me that he had sold it for four shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he never said he had sold it till you told him it would be better for him to do so? - No.</p>

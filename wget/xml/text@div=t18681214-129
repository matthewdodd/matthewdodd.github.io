                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen Street, Whitechapel—on 28th November, about 7 o'clock, I fastened up my house—I was in the under<lb></lb>ground kitchen at I o'clock, and heard a noise as of a shutter breaking—I went up into the room over, looked out at the window, and saw a man at the dead wall nearly opposite—I went into the parlour and saw the shutter bolt lying on the floor, and a pane of glass broken—the shutters open out<lb></lb>wards—they are outside the glass—they have the usual fastening, and a little catch at the side—the pane could not have been broken without breaking the shutter first—the window was not opened—they had not time to do that—I looked out for my son, and saw the man who went to the dead wall join two other men—I am quite sure of that—I then saw my son, and spoke to him—he went up to the three men—I kept my eye on them—he brought a policeman, who I told what had occurred—I then returned to my own door, and left my son to watch.</p>

I live with my mother, the last witness—I came up the street with my brother, about 1.30, and saw my mother—she spoke to me, and in consequence of what she said I called a policeman—I saw three men at the top of the street—the prisoners are two of them—I saw the other man run away—I went and had a look at the two men who were standing under a lamp post—they came half across the road, and I asked them what they wanted—they said, "Mr. Simmonds, of 1, Mount Street"—I said, "This is 1, Green Street"—they said that they lived at No. 8—I said, "Then you must know No. 1, and you must know something of this"—he said, "If you say so I will punch your head," and Robinson knocked me known—he was outside the shutters then—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men—Robinson was taken at the time, and Egly the following night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Robinson taken for the burglary, or for the assault? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For the burglary—they would not take him for the assault, because the policeman did not see him strike me.</p>

I was in Green Street, and saw the prisoners, the prosecutor, and his mother, who made a communication to me, and I went after the prisoners up the street, about 50 yards from the house—I went up to Robinson, and told him he was charged with breaking into No. 1, Green Street—he said that he knew nothing about it, and tripped me up—I took him into custody; Egly ran away.</p>

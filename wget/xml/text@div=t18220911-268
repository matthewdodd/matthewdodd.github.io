            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 1st of August the prisoner Phillips came to my shop, in Compton-street, and offered to pawn this silver watch. I told him it was stolen; he said that could not be, for he had had it a month; then he said he had had it three weeks, and he would go and fetch the exact time that he had had it. He and my apprentice went to fetch the prosecutor, but he was not at home. Phillips was let go, but came again in the morning. I told him I should take the watch to the office, which I did; the Magistrate told me to tell him to come there on Wednesday, which he did, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is of very trifling value - A. I would not give above 10 s. for it. I have known Phillips since June - he could have gone off if he liked.</p>
               <p>MRS. GARNER. Gibbs had come up to see me about four o'clock that afternoon. I had been asleep in the room; she saw the watch, and said that it was old

I get up early, and in the afternoon generally go to sleep, and at the time she came up, I awoke; she made some trifling excuse, and went away soon after - she told me my watch was wrong. I missed it the moment she was gone - she had told me she lived at No. 8, Belton-street, Long-acre, which I found was not true. I went and found her drinking with two girls, and asked her for my watch; she said she knew nothing about it. It was safe when she came into the room.</p>

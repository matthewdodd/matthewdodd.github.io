               <p>Q. You sell, I suppose, by retail - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a shop as well as a warehouse - A. Yes, a haberdasher's shop. On the 30th of last March, a quarter before eight at night, I saw three women come into the shop, and I came out of the parlour to serve them as I thought; the prisoners are two of the three women. When I came out of the parlour the other woman, who is not here, said she wished to purchase a straw bonnet; I called one of my workwomen out of the parlour to fetch one down; I had suspicion of the women, they all appeared to be in liquor. We had bonnets in the shop, as well as in the room up stairs, but they were old ones for shew. When the bonnets were brought down the woman who is not here wanted to purchase one of those that were brought down, they looked at several.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman try the bonnet on - A. Yes, and these two women stood by at the time, they appeared to know each other by their Christian names;

This one that was in her pocket was one of those brought down stairs; she told the other that is not present to put on her bonnet and come along.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw some part of it before you took it from her - A. Yes; I saw the ribbon over her arm and part of the bonnet in the pocket hole; it was the other woman pulling the shawl over her arm that made me suspect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not completely cover it by pulling the shawl - A. No, not quite. She put her bonnet on, and told the other woman to come along.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed - A. The other woman put her bonnet on, and went out,

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. James; the bonnets and hats were delivered into my care at the watchhouse, by Mrs. Dunn's son.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at the bonnets and hats - A. This is the bonnet I took from her, it is one of the bonnets that my work-woman brought down to shew them; the shop-mark is upon it. This is the brown beaver hat I picked up in the street, it is a child's hat, I know it is mine; there has been lamp oil spilt on the crown by accident. This is the black beaver hat that the man picked up in the street, with the gold band, I know that hat, it is finished in a particular manner that many hats are not. This old bonnet was in my care to be altered, I had the altering of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all these - A. At the lowest rate, I value them at one guinea, which is considerably under the value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your work-woman stay in the shop while the women were examining the things - A. No, she waited to see whether I wanted her to fetch any more, she returned to the parlour, when I told her I did not want any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very positive that you did not see her in the act of taking the bonnet - A. I saw her do nothing until the other woman, who was trying on the bonnet pulled the shawl over Burn's arm.</p>

             stand next to that woman - A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before the woman pulled the shawl over her arm you had not perceived the bonnet - A. No, and then I perceived it, and upon my perceiving this I turned the shawl back, part of the bonnet was in the pocket-hole of her gown.</p>
               <p>Burn's Defence. I had been to the fair on Easter Monday, and as I was coming home I met the young woman who is not here, and this young woman with her; the other said she was going to buy a bonnet, and was going to Greenwich the next day; she asked me to go with her, which I did. We went into the shop, she tried on several bonnets, I did not try on any, she tried that one on, and gave it to me to hold, she said she liked it the best of any. I had not it in my hands many minutes till she laid down another bonnet that the prosecutrix gave her to try on; and the two bonnets that fell upon the floor, I pointed them out to the lady. There were a good many bonnets on the counter, I did not take any of them myself. And the bonnets that were found at the door, the woman that went out was as likely to have them as me.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was coming down Titchbourne street, I met the woman that is not here; she said she was going to buy a bonnet to go to Greenwich fair on the next day. About a year and a half ago she lived next door to me, that is how I came to know her, she asked me to go into the shop with her to buy a bonnet and I went in. I saw nothing of the transaction, but the gentlewoman stopped me coming out of the shop, that is all I know, I did not take any thing.</p>

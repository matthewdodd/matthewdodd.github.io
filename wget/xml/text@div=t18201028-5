            . On the 3d of October I received a letter at my house in James-street, Westminster, by the two-penny post, it is signed B. B. B., and dated the 2d of October - (producing it.) I have not the least knowledge of the hand-writing, and know nobody answering to the name B. B. B. I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge, except at the police office. On receipt of the letter I sent for Pace, an officer of Queen-square, and in consequence of his advice I wrote a letter and took a copy of it; I sealed it myself, and gave it to the officer; and on the evening of the 12th or 13th I received another letter with the same initials.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you married - A. I am, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of the prisoner's relations to your knowledge - A. Not till I saw his father at the office; but at the office I found that his aunt washed my family's clothes, but I do not believe I ever saw her. She only fetches the linen, she does not wash in the house. I never saw the prisoner about my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you think you never saw the prisoner about your house with his aunt - A. Not to my knowledge. I am seldom at home when the linen is fetched. I did not know the letter came from him till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter gave you no alarm - A. I certainly thought if there was a report of that kind it must come from my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280006"></xptr>servants, and wished to find it out - it gave me considerable uneasiness. Mrs. Rodber was at Weybridge at the time I received it.</p>

            . I went to the coffee-shop with Pace on the 3d of October, and on the 13th, after he was conveyed from the office to the watch-house, I had some conversation with him. Neither of us held him out threat or inducement. I asked him how he came to write Mr. Rodber such a letter as he had? he said he had been attending the House of Lords, and there he met a young man who asked him to write a letter for him, and he being out of a situation at the time was very willing to do so. I then asked him whether he wrote the letter signed</p>
               <p>"B. B. B." addressed to Mr. Rodber, James-street; he said he had written it. I asked if he had received any answer at the Caledonian coffee-house to the letter directed</p>
               <p>"B. B. B." he said he had. I told him I thought it a very unlikely story that he should enquire for an answer to the letter he wrote for another person? he made no reply.</p>

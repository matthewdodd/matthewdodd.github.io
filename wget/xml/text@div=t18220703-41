            . I am patrol of Whitechapel. On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I heard a cry of Stop thief! ran across, and found Williams in the hands of Deacon, the patrol. I saw Norris standing close by him; he said it was merely a lark, that it was just a cry of Stop thief! among themselves - I took him to the watch-house; he resisted, but very little. I searched them both, but found nothing on them.</p>

I gave him to the person who was pursuing him.

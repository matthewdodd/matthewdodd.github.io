               <p>Prisoner. He was very tipsy, and asked me to come and keep him company; he had several glasses of gin and porter, and went out several times - he came in, and said he would take a nap, told me to take his money out of his pocket, and take care of it for him, which I did; this was at four - I sat at his side till seven o'clock; I then awoke him - he said he was robbed; I said, "No, you gave me your money." Witness. I never gave him the money, nor did he say so.</p>

            . I live at this house; Barry came in about twelve o'clock, and the prisoner about one; Barry treated him with some porter - he went to sleep, being rather in liquor. I did not see any money taken from him; I saw Barry's money about four; when he awoke the prisoner asked him to treat him; he felt for his money, and said he was robbed; the prisoner said he had not robbed him, but a rat-catcher had, and they had shared the money among them all; he pulled out 1s. 9d., and said the ratcatcher gave it him as his share.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took him in the house. I found one crown piece, five shillings, and a needle-case in his pocket, and two shillings in his hand; as he went to the watch-house he said he had the money from government - that he had a pension of 1s. a day; he seemed rather in liquor.</p>

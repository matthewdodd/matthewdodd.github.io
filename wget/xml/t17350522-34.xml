One rid by me, and when the others came up, they parted, one on each file of me. The Prisoner said Dame, what do you sell? Butter, Sir, says I, and I have but two Pound left, and you shall have it for sixteen Pence - I'll have it says he, and carry it to my Sister; but can you change half a Guinea. I said, Yes. I took out 9 s. 6 d. Then he said to his Friend, Do you pay for it, and then I need not change; the other Man came and took five Shillings and six Pence out of my Lap - Then the Prisoner gave me this Shilling for the Butter. I had received just such a Shilling at Hampstead for Eggs, and had taken particular notice of it. for I doubted the Goodness of it, and I thought this Shilling to be the same; and I was confirmed in it by missing the five and six Pence.</p>

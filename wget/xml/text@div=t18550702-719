                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Cabban. On Saturday, 22nd June, about 2 o'clock, I was serving in the shop, and the prisoners came in together—Mason asked me to show them some silk for dresses; I did so, and they selected a dress and some lining, and then wished to see some shawls—they purchased one, and wished me to make out a bill, which I did, and told them the amount, which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mason put down 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said that she would call for the goods in half an hour—they then went away—I waited about half an hour, they did not come, and Mr. Cabban and I vent into the street, and saw Mason some distance off, outside Mr. Smith, the pawnbroker's, shop—I went into Mr. Smith's, and found Wright with a shawl on the counter—I asked Mason if she was not in Mr. Cabban's shop buying goods; she said, "Yes"—I asked Wright the same, and she said, "Yes"—I looked at the shawl, and believe it to be one of those which I had shown them—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a policeman came in, and they were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen draper of Stock well-street, Green wick On Saturday afternoon, 23rd June, I went into my shop, and saw the prisoners there—my shopman, Sharpe, was just handing them the account—I looked at it; it was for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was handed to Mason, and she gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, remarking that she would call for the goods with the remainder of the money in half an hour, and they immediately left the shop—I had some suspicion, and went out; perhaps five minutes might have elapsed—I went to Mr. Delaney, the pawnbroker, but learned nothing there—I went on to another pawnbroker's 100 yards off, and found Wright offering this shawl in pledge—Mason was on the footpath just in front of the pawnbroker's door—I recognised her, but said nothing to her—I recog<lb></lb>nised the shawl as being in my stock not an hour previous to their coming in—I afterwards, examined my stock, and found that it was missing—I said to Mason, "You have been to my shop;"—she said, "I know I have"—I said, "You have selected some goods;"—she said, "Yes, I have looked out a shawl"—I said, "Yes, but not this shawl; this is another from my stock"—I sent for a policeman, and gave her into custody, left her with the policeman, and went back to my premises to get my young man to identify her, as the party who was with Moore—I recognised Moore immediately—Sharpe came and recognised Wright—on my return, I asked Mason whether she had been to my shop; she said, "Yes," and that she had looked out some goods—I wished her to accompany me to the pawnbroker's, and she did so—I am positive that this is one of my shawls, and that it was in my stock not an hour previous.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was my clerk—it was his duty to collect and receive money on my account—in December some goods were sold to Messrs. Graham—an entry was made in the ledger of the sale, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's handwriting—I have it here—they amount altogether to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—credit is given for two parcels out of three—the entries are 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; these entries are in the prisoner's handwriting—on the 1st of January he has entered, "Received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount"—that is the whole of the entry of money as received on the 1st of January—on the 22nd of December, there is a debit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the prisoner's writing—there is no corresponding entry on the credit side of the account—there appears by the account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. still owing—the two first items are ruled off, which denotes that it is settled so far—it was his duty to make entries in the rough cash-book—on the 1st or 2nd of February, I had occasion to leave town, and the following day I inquired for the cash-book, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—it was not to be found—I asked the prisoner for it—he said he supposed it was in the counting-house—I said I wanted to see it—he came back to me, and said he could not find it—it has never been found—it was his duty to take care of it—he had the custody of it—that is the book in which he should make the entry on the day he received the money—he then went to receive a cheque in St. Paul's Church-yard, and did not return at all afterwards, I believe—certainly not that day—he did not embezzle that cheque—I have our collecting book here—there is an entry in his handwriting referring to the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is a memorandum to receive on the first Thursday of Graham &amp; Co. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are no dates in the book—this would apply to the first Thursday in February—I mean the time for it to be received—the entry was made in January.</p>

               <p>body might go to it—the prisoner had had a month's notice to leave, a fort<lb></lb>night of that time had elapsed—I had no reason to suppose he would not return when he went to receive the cheque—I had told him if he could meet with another situation, I would liberate him at any hour—the cheque he went to collect was not brought to me in due course, for I stopped the payment—it was sent to me next day—I am not aware of any other book being missing—I missed another book about a fortnight after that, which has been found since—the book extends from the beginning of last year to the day that the prisoner left me—he was the last who wrote in it—any body who received money wrote in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there another person who received money, about whom you had some investigation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; I believe part of that account is contained in that book—that person's accounts were investigated by an ac<lb></lb>countant—this book was in use during that investigation—that affair is so far settled that I have not proceeded in it, but I can at any time—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not due—the entry in the ledger is brought from the day-book and rough cash-book—I took the prisoner before the Alderman within a week of this circumstance—he was allowed to go, on his promise to attend—I made no objection to it—he returned on the day appointed, and was allowed to go again on a similar promise and attended again—the third time the case was opened before the Magistrate—he appeared twice without any recognizance—he came immediately after he went from the Magistrate to the warehouse, and looked where he thought proper for the book—his house was searched—his wife gave every facility to the search, and broke open a box.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after he left you was the box broken open to look for the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three weeks afterwards—the entry must have been made after the 1st of January, or it would have compre<lb></lb>hended the full amount—it was stated before the Magistrate that we hoped the cash-book would be forthcoming.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner left on the 3rd of February, about twelve o'clock—on the Monday before, which was the day before he left, I saw him writing in the rough cash-book, at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

It was my business to lock the books up at night sometimes, and put them into the iron safe, and give toe key to Mr. Green—I remember doing so the night before the prisoner went away, near upon eight o'clock—I gave the key to Mr. Green before he went away that night.</p>

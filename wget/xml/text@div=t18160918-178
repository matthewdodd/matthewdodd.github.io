               <p>WILLIAM SAVAGE. I got up early in the morning of the 2nd of August, and left the prisoner in bed; he had been a lodger of mine for a week. I left him in bed while I was at work. I had left my breeches under my pillow with this money in my pocket. I was up at work, and the prisoner was still in bed. He got up about a quarter past six, and left the house; and after he was gone, I felt in my pockets, and my money was gone, I went after the prisoner, and I found him about two hundred yards from my house; I charged him with having taken my money, and he denied it. I said I would send for an officer, and while the officer was gone for, he delivered the money up.</p>

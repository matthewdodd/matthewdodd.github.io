                  </hi>. I am a dealer in jewellery and watches, and live at 9, Granby Place, Drury Lane—the boy at the bar is my son—he lived with me—I travel about London with my jewellery, calling at different shop, and he used to carry the bag for me with the jewellery in it—on 31st Janu<lb></lb>ary I put my stock in the bag to try and do some business, calling at different shops—my son told me to put the things in the bag, but I did not think anything of that—I went to Skinner Street, Snowhill, and went into the shop of Mr. Lindsay, leaving my boy outside with the bag, con<lb></lb>taining twenty silver watches, four gold watches, one metal watch, eight or more gold Alberts, a quantity of gold lockets, rings, studs, brooches, and other articles, of the value of 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was in the shop about ten minutes—when I came out my son was gone—I found out that he had been</p>

               <p>in the habit of playing with the prisoner Smith's boys nearly a month before, but he was acquainted with them fifteen or eighteen months before, when they lived in our street—I went and called at Smith's house, I think on Sunday evening, 10th February—I saw Mrs. Smith, and asked if she had seen my son anywhere about there—she said she had not seen him for six weeks, and the last time she saw him he had a black bag with him, that he shook hands with them, and said he was going off to America—I told her I thought she was mistaken, for he never carried a black bag, except when he was along with me, till he had robbed me the Thursday before—I said, "If you can possibly find where he is, and send him home to me, I will reward you"—she said she would if she could—I did not say any more to her, as she was not well—I came away, and as I was coming from the house I saw Mr. Smith—I asked him if he had seen anything of my son—he said he was there on the Thursday evening, I think, before he came home from work, and that he went away on the Sunday follow<lb></lb>ing, and he carried his bag down to the railway station, and the boy went off to Ayrshire, in Scotland—I took him into a public-house, and called for some ale, and told him I was very sorry for what had occurred, and I wondered he did not send word to me, seeing he was but a young boy—he said he did not know my address—he said if I would come in with him he would give me some things, that he saw a great deal of jewellery knocking about, and he was very sorry to see it—I went with him, and he gave me a gold watch and a letter from Ayr<lb></lb>shire to Mr. Smith, written by the boy's uncle, as he cannot write himself—the watch had been in my bag—I told him, if he had any pawn tickets or other goods, to give them to me—he said if there was anything they would give it up, and he asked Mrs. Smith to bring them—she said the boy had taken the tickets and all the things with him to Scotland, and she had nothing but the watch—I told her that her two boys knew my address, and it was a pity they did not send to me—next morning the officer and I went to Mrs. Smith's again—she said her husband was not in, and she thought perhaps he might have some pawn tickets—we then went down to Mr. Smith, and he delivered up to us four or five; I also received four or five from a young man, who is a witness—I don't re<lb></lb>member receiving any from Mrs. Smith—we said to her, "If you have not got the tickets tell us where you pledged the articles, that we may re<lb></lb>cover them"—I think she said she pawned a string of beads at Mr. Folkard's, a brooch, a coral snap, and earrings—I have recovered about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of my property—my son is just turned fifteen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and an married. On the 16th of June, about three o'clock in the day, I fell in with the prisoner in a street in Somers Town—I hardly know what street it was—I was not drunk nor sober—I did not know her before; we got in chat together, and we went to two public-houses—we went to Mr. Dobell's at last, in Gray's Inn-lane, about five o'clock—I had a watch and seals in my fob—I sat down and drank on a seat before the bar—I spent the afternoon with her—I did not give her my watch—I recollect the landlord showing me my watch—I had not missed it—I was sober enough to know I did not give it to her.</p>

I was at Mr. Dobell's between six and seven o'clock on the 16th of June—the prosecutor and the prisoner sat there—the prosecutor fell asleep—I saw the prisoner draw the watch and put it behind her, as she was pulling him about, and then I told Mr. Dobell I was an officer in plain clothes—I took her.</p>

In consequence of losing vast quantities of leather, I was led to Hatton Garden for assistance; and, by the activity of the officers, I found some of my property in various parts of the town. I found some buck and doe skins at Mr. Claxton's, Bethnall Green; and some morocco skins, all of which I know is my property. The prisoner lived with me about three years and a half ago; I found some skins at Brown's, and some at Pike's; I knew that my porter was in possession of them goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your porter. - A. The witness Partridge, who was brought from the Nore. I found this property was sold by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>MR. CLAXTON. I am a pocket book maker; I live at No. 4, Paradise Row, Bethnall Green. I have known the prisoner between six and seven years. I first knew him by dealing with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy these skins of him. - A. About three months back, I bought three dozen of green skivers, and a dozen of yellow morocco; I gave nine shillings and six pence each for the yellow morocco.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them all. - A. To the amount of ten pound one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give a piece for the morocco skins. - A. I had nine skins of red morocco; I gave four pound for them. The green skivers I have worked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner very well. - A. I have known Mr. Fraile between six and seven years; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180049"></xptr> dealt with his father. I considered him an honest young man.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a leather dresser; I worked for Mr. Briant. About a year ago Mr. Fraile came from Birmingham, and was put into Gilspur street Compter. I hearing that he was there went to see him; nothing particular passed at that moment. One time when I was going to his father with the cart for Mr. Briant, he asked me whether I could get any skins; I said I would try; he said he would give me a pair of braces the first opportunity, if I could get him a black skin, a red, and a blue skin. It went on with that, and he gave me a pair of braces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never in Mr. Briant's house to take any of these things; what I received came through the hands of Partridge that stands before you.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Partridge) Did he ever go in the house with you. - A. He went up and down by the side of the house, and took these things from me. I was in the house, I slept in the house, and he was waiting to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember these doe skins. - A. I remember there were some doe skins, and some yellow morocco skins delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never went into the house, nor near the house, he brought the skins to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These things I know to be mine; the bulk had not been broke of these; I can identify them, there is a mark upon the neck. I cannot swear to the whole. I believe the prisoner was a very honest lad while he lived with me; Since that there have been eight men living upon me; I have been robbed of above a thousand pounds. I do not look upon the prisoner Fraile equal in guilt with Partridge, whom I supported; we found the property was sold by Fraile; the magistrate admitted Partridge an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the owner of the house. - A. Yes, I did not lodge in the house at the time the skins were taken out; it was made use of principally as a warehouse then. This Partridge was my porter, he laid there; I had about six or seven thousand pounds worth of property in it. I lived within fifteen doors of it; it is a very respectable house; I had recently bought the lease; I went into it myself as soon as it was repaired. I inhabit it now.</p>

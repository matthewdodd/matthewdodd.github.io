I am the wife of Walter Henry Chapman, carver and gilder, of No. 1, Florence Terrace, Kingston Vale; our shop is also the post office—on Saturday evening, 25th October, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was in my shop—Terrett came in for two 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamps—I gave them to him, and he paid for them and went out—he came in again and asked if a letter would be delivered that night in London—I said, "No, not before Monday morning"—whilst I was speaking to him a man came in with a mask on—it was dark—it was moonlight outside, and the oil light indoors—the man with the mask presented 'a pistol at me—he said nothing at the time—I became alarmed and moved up and down the counter—he held the pistol as if it were to my breast, pointed at me—I said to Terrett, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "No, I have never seen him before"—the man still came near to me, and I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "Money or your life"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Money"—I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "Money or your life, quick"—Terrett was standing in the shop at the time only looking at him—I said, "If it is money you want, spare me," and I ran into the parlour and locked the door, and jumped down 12 steps into the kitchen—I ran out into the yard and called, "Murder"—there Were some flower-pots there, and I threw them at the neighbours' doors to call their attention—some people came to my assistance, and I returned to the shop, and found that the two men had gone—the postman was coming for the 8.15 to take the delivery, and I got him to go with me to see if the post-office cash box was all right—I looked at it and found it was all right—I then examined my private till—I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in it, some coppers, pence, halfpence, and farthings—I 'don't know to what amount—I had seen that safe before the man came in, and I found it was all gone except three farthings, a penny, and a halfpenny—this mask produced by Inspector Shaw is the kind of mask that the man had on—the man was about the height of the prisoner Smith.</p>

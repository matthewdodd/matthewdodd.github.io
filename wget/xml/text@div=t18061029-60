             sworn. Q. You are a patrol to the public office, Bow street. - A. Yes; on the 17th of October I went into a public house in the Strand, I cannot recollect what day of the week it was, it was about seven o'clock in the evening; on the 17th of October I apprehended him at the Blackmoor's Head, Exeter-street, Strand, I received information from Price the landlord; I found all the property here; he had got the hat upon his head, he was wearing the coat, waistcoat, shirt, small clothes, and stockings; I found another shirt tied up with the gloves and the braces; I produce them, I have had them ever since, except the small clothes, those he wore when he went to Tothil fields bridewell; he has made away with them by some means.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor). Jenkins, look at these articles, you have examined these articles. - A. Yes, they were the things that were in my bundle, I know them all, I know the hat by the stamp.</p>

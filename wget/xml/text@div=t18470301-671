                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bailey, a tobacconist, of London-wall. On Wednesday, the 17th of Feb., the prisoner came to the shop—he bought some tobacco, and gave me a shilling in payment—I kept it in my hand—he did not stay in the shop a minute after I gave him change—I looked at the shilling after he was gone—I thought it was a bad one, and put it on the shelf—it was the only shilling I had there at that time—I left it there till my husband came in in about half an hour—I gave it to him—on the 19th of Feb., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came again for some tobacco—I served him—he gave me a shilling—he placed it on the counter—he got his change and went out directly—I examined the shilling, and it was bad—I recollected his having been in the shop before—I knew him to be the same person—I did not tell him of it—I thought he would come again, and I thought my husband would accuse him if he came again—I took the shilling to give him an opportunity of coming another time, when my husband might be at home—I saw the prisoner next outside Guildhall, on the 24th—I knew him directly I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 7, Bow-street, Covent-garden. On Thursday morning. the 20th of May, I went to No. 9, Upper Wellington-street, Covent-garden—I found the female prisoner there—I had not known her previously—I ascertained that she had been delivered of a male child—I saw the child—it appeared quite healthy and well—I occasionally visited the mother and child until the following day—the last period at which I saw the child alive was at twelve o'clock on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing—it was then quite healthy, with the exception of a little inflammation and a small discharge from the eyes—that was not in the least of a dangerous nature—about six o'clock the same evening, I saw the child dead—it was then cold, the face was suffused, the nostrils dilated, there was a protro<lb></lb>sion of the eye, the hands were clenched, the extremities of the fingers and the nails livid, and the legs drawn up towards the body—those appearances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140129"></xptr>
               <p>did not then indicate the death the child had come to—I had no suspicion then; but from a subsequent knowledge that I had of the affair, I had sus<lb></lb>picion, and I went to the police—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Saturday morning, at five o'clock, from which I thought the child had not died a natural death—the body of the child was natural—we first examined the lungs, we found the right lung considerably congested, the left lung was much more so, with three distinct extravasated spots—the heard was come pletely empty—the liver was much congested—all the other viscera were quite healthy—we examined the brain—the left side of the brain, corre<lb></lb>ponding with the lung, was much congested, with extravasation—the conclusion at which I arrived from those appearances, was, that the child had died from suffocation—the external appearances that I saw on the Friday, at six o'clock; would be the natural appearances of suffocation—Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Canton, and Mr. Echlin, were also present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Guthrie performed the examination in my presence.</p>

SERJEANT ALLEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were not the first person that had attended her during her confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my brother was the first person that went—he is here—she was delivered on Wednesday, at four o'clock—I first saw her on Thursday, at twelve—there were no appearances of inflammation in the child's eyes on the Thursday—I had seen the child before I saw the mother—it was brought to my hours by the wet-nurse, a woman named Barber—I did not pay particular attention as to how it was dressed—I think it was dressed in the usual way in which infants are—it had a shawl on, I think—it had infant's clothes on—I remem<lb></lb>ber seeing some peculiarity about the navel—it was stripped to show me, and I remember a towel was wrapped round it—that was all the nurse di<lb></lb>rected my attention to—the navel did not appear to be broken or torn—it appeared as if there was a little extra inflammation—I cannot recollect whe<lb></lb>ther the child had a cap on—I did not pay that attention to it—I remember a shawl being over the child, and that the towel was removed to show me the navel—that is all I distinctly remember—children are usually bandaged—the towel was placed round the bowels—I cannot tell whether the shawl was a thick woolen shawl—my attention was only called to the circumstance, that there was something the matter with the navel of the child—the nurse said the child was quite healthy—I did not then inquire into the circumstance of the birth—I heard from my brother that the child was safely delivered, and well, and so on—I saw the child again on Friday morning, at twelve, when I called at the wet-nurse's house, the nurse having been previously to my house, begging I would call, as there was some little inflammation about the child's eyes—I then perceived some inflammation about the eyes—it extended to both eyes—there was also a secretion from the mucus membrane—it was not running from the nostrils, but from the eyes—the mucus membrane was slightly inflamed—it must have been inflamed slightly to have caused the dis<lb></lb>charge—it was a slight discharge, that would arise from a cold—that is the general cause—I beg distinctly to say that there was no discharge from the nose, it was entirely confined to the eyes—I examined to see whether there had been a discharge from the nose—I opened the eyes, and saw what it was, which is a thing very common in infants—it is a certain discharge from the eyes, consequent upon sudden exposure to light and cold—it is possible that a running from the nose might proceed from the same cold that caused the inflammation of the eyes, but I am doubtful whether matter would run from the same opening; tears might—I think the manner of feeding the child would not have anything to do with it—if the cold was first taken, and the child was afterwards fed upon too strong food, that would have a tendency to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140132"></xptr>
               <p>increase the consequences of that cold; but the child had had a teaspoonful of castor-oil on the previous evening, and one in the morning, which was sufficient to reduce any inflammation that might have ensured—that would have tendency to decrease the symptoms—it would be a natural effect that the inflammation should go on if the child was fed on unwholesome food, anything that would derange the current of the blood would increase the inflammation—if there is any inherent tendency to inflammation on a child, the effect of unwholesome or too strong food would be to increase that—I never remember a case where similar effects have been exhibited in the shape of inflammation, where there has been pressure on the head, from an irregular birth—I have not seen such a case—it is very common to see inflammation with that suppuration of the eye, but I never saw it resulting from difficult labour—I do not know that pressure on the head during birth would exhibit any particular symptoms—it would exhibit no external symptoms, and the only internal injury that could exist would be congestion of the brain—I think that would not afterwards develop itself in a discharge from the nose—the con<lb></lb>sequence would be entirely internal, not external at all—inflammation of the membranes of the brain is the consequence of consequence—the effect of congestion would be internal inflammation—I found the mother as a good many usually are after lobour—I merely asked the usual questions which medical men ask after the delivery of a child, and they were answered satis<lb></lb>factorily to me—she had no particular after-pains, and everything was going on very favourably indeed; I conceived that she was a person in good general health—I have never expressed an opinion that she was then labouring under a liver complaint, or disease of the lungs—she did not appear to be in a weaker state than persons would be usually under the same circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the appearance of the child on the Friday night, you say it was from something you had heard that you were induced to believe the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was from something I heard previously that induced me to act in the manner I did, and to give immediate information to the Police—I was sent for in a great hurry at six o'clock on Friday—the eyes at that time were protruding, although the sockets were not opened, both eyes were very prominent—those circumstances did not then lead me to form any opinion as to the cause of death, because from other circumstances I had determined to enter more minutely into the case—there were no external symptoms that I could judge by—I had heard something before—I had heard nothing between the Friday when I saw the child, and the Saturday when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem examination</hi>—I immediately went to the Police, saw the inspector, and went to Mr. Guthrie—I never saw a case where a child had died from being overlaid—I have not been in practice more than two years—my experience in these cases is rather limited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of last witness, and am a medical man. I have been residing in the country for my health, but have lately been residing with my brother—I delivered the female prisoner, at No. 9, Welling<lb></lb>ton-street—I first saw her on the Wednesday evening, between four and five o'clock—when I got there she was in string labour—the child was born between three and four minutes after I got into the room, with my assistance—there was no difficulty whatever in the parturition—when I first examined the child it was as perfectly healthy a child as I ever remember to have seen—I continued with the mother very nearly an hour—I delivered the child to a woman named Barber—I never saw it again, not the mother either—my brother then attended.</p>

               <p>had not received any previous intimation that my services would be required by the prisoner, it was entirely accidental—I was sent for about a quarter-past four on the Wednesday afternoon—when I arrived she was in strong labour, I mean the child was being, or about being, expelled from the womb—the child being born about three minutes after I was there, would certainly indicate strong labour—that operation was performed by my assistance—I rendered no other than the ordinary assistance, merely by grasping the head—I should say nature had very nearly completed the whole of the operation before I arrived—the head of the child protruded when I arrived—it was then that I found it necessary to give some manual assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find that the head was stationary in its partial expulsion from the womb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It generally remains so—it is usual in these cases that the head should remain stationary for a time, until a successive pain comes, and then the child generally, with the slightest assistance, is brought into the world, or without assistance—this was not a case of difficult labour—I believe it is always usual when the head is presented, for the medical man to take hold of it with his right hand, and gradually to assist—that is not always the case—sometimes the child is expelled without the slightest assistance—my assistance in this case was very slight—the more we leave things to nature of course the better—it is the ordinary practice to do so; but when a pain came on, I did as medical men generally do, assisted nature so far as to give relief to the mother as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there was, in your judgment, occasion, at all events, for the use of the hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could hardly tell when I arrived there, how long the child had been in that position, it might have been one, two, or three minutes, I could not tell; at all events, the assistance I rendered was so slight, that I might say it was a pure effort of nature; in fact, it was merely the act of taking the child by the head—as far as taking the child by the head with my hand, I certainly did render the ordinary assistance—I should have done so under ordinary circumstances, in any case—I required no particular reason for doing so on this occasion, because it is so usual—I did not know how long the child had been in that position, with the head partially excluded from the womb—I should say it had certainly not been so many minutes—it might have been two or three minutes—I should say it could only have been from the time I was first called, the distance from 7, Bow-street to 9, Wellington-street, which is very short, and the time it would take a person to come and me to go back—I should say that would not occupy above five minutes—it is between 200 and 300 yards, or it may be a trifle more—I should say it could not have occupied more than five minutes, for I was on the point of leaving the house at the time, and I merely received the message, and went directly—when the child was born, I delivered it to Mr. Barber, who sat close by me—there was nothing to place the child in, at least, nothing that is usual, no flannel, or anything of that sort, to place the child in, in the first instance—I asked for flannel, and there was none—subsequently a small strip was produced, but not sufficient—afterwards, at the suggestion of some one, I do not know whether it was of myself, a woman present brought her flannel petticoat, and the child was enveloped in that—very likely a thick woolen shawl might also have been produced, but I do not know—the child was not removed while I was there—I left first—I attended to the proper ex<lb></lb>amination of the navel—I saw that the child was quite right, because I always make a point of doing so—I examined it at the time of its birth—I handed it immediately from where it was born to the nurse—it was immediately wrapped up in something—I left, and never saw it again</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon, and have been in practice between ten and eleven years—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the child—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Brooking, at to the appearances—the left lung was very much gorged, and there were several spots of ex<lb></lb>travasation—I found the appearances generally very much as they have been described by Mr. Brooking—the brain was not so gorged, it was more vas<lb></lb>cular than usual—from the appearances I saw, which have been mentioned by Mr. Brooking, I came to the conclusion that the child had died from suf<lb></lb>focation—I have not the slightest doubt of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the children were dead when they were produced, or that they died in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they died in my own presence, because the mothers had seen them alive not above a minute or two before, and when they were taken from under the clothes to be produced, they were dead—I never knew a child to be suffocated by the mother permitting the breast to hang over the child when suckling it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT ALLEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the ages of those infants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not exactly remember, but they were very young—a few days old—they were both suffering from the same complaint of the eyes that this child had—that had nothing to do with their death—the complaint of the eyes was not in the slightest degree dangerous—the hospital is an ophthalmic hospital, and they were brought there on account of their eyes—it is a common complaint—there are thousands at the hospital every year—hundreds certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, did you observe whether there was any inflammation of the mucus membrane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was slight inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the mucus membrane, not leading in the slightest degree to the now—that inflammation would not cause any discharge through the nose—if the child had any discharges through the nose, it would be from some other cause, not immediately referable to the discharge from the eyes.</p>

               <p>no opinion on that subject—the discharge from the eyes would occasion slight redness of the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva</hi>—it would not occasion the extravasation of the lungs, or the inflammation of the brain, nor have any connexion with it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and sleep of a night at No. 7, Lei<lb></lb>cester-street. I formerly lived with the female prisoner, in Wellington-street—I had been living there about ten days before her confinement—I knew she was in the family way—I had been in the house about three days when the first conversation took place between myself, Mr. Cleveland, and several others—she said she had not provided any clothes, as she knew the child would not live—I made no remark on that—I should think she has made the same observation a dozen times, with us all in the kitchen—on the morning she was confined she said to me, "Harriet, will you go to Mr. Gliddon's, at the cigar divan, next to the Pizzas, and ask there if Mr. H. has been there?"—I knew who Mr. H. was—Mr. Harry was the name we knew the gentle<lb></lb>man by—I knew who she meant—we were told to call him "Mr. Harry" by Mr. Cleveland; but this morning she told me to go and see if Mr. H. had been there—she said nothing then about being in the family way—she told me to tell him to come directly—she did not say why—the male prisoner is not Mr. Harry—I went to Mr. Gliddon's—I came back, and told her that the gentleman said that Mr. H. had not been there at all—I stopped in the room a short time with her after that—she got very much worse, and said, "Harriet, you take some money off the mantel-piece, take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and go either to No. 57. (or 75, I do not know which,) in Great Titchfield-street, and inquire for Dr. Hartnell"—I went, that same morning—I knew this Dr. Hartnell to be Mr. Harry—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> set me down at his door—it is a place called the Portland-chambers—I found Dr. Hartnell was not at home—I came back, went straight up into Mr. Cleveland's bed-room, and told her that Dr. Hartnell was not at home—I found her on the sofa, where I had left her.</p>

               <p>baby—after we had dressed it we put it into Ellen's lap—the baby was well then—I saw it again in Thursday afternoon, about half past four or five o'clock, Mr. Barber brought it into the kitchen—she took the shawl off, and said, "Look at the baby, Harriet"—I looked at it, and saw that its features were very much distorted—there was a discharge from the nose, and it looked very much altered from the time I left it on Wednesday night, I remarked to Mr. Barber what a change there was—the face was swollen—on the Friday evening, about five or ten minutes after six o'clock, I remember hearing Mr. Cleveland's bed-room bell ring—I was then in the kitchen—I went up stairs, and found the child in front of several persons who had got there several minutes before me—they told me that the child was dead—I was sent for the doctor—I brought Mr. Brooking—I went into Mr. Cleveland's room once or twice in the course of that evening, and on one occasion Mr. Cleveland said to me, "Harriet, I expect <hi rend="italic">he</hi> in about dark"—I knew who she meant, it was the male prisoner, because we had to wait on him, and we had her directions—she said, "I expect him in about dark, and I will give you gold, or a sovereign, if you will go and meet him, and tell him there is a brother about the child; and if Mr. Harry and him meet it will be the ruin of me"—I had known the male prisoner before—he used to be at the house, and I have every reason to believe that he slept there, but I cannot say that, for certainty—he has been there very late at night, and I have seen him there very early in the morning—I have seen him coming out of Mr. Cleveland's room, the first<lb></lb>floor front room, the room she was confined in—it was his room—I served him with his breakfast on the Friday morning in question in that room—the child was not there then, Mr. Cleveland was—I had taken her up a cup of tea first, about nine o'clock, or a quarter-past—I do not think it could have been much later than half-past nine when I took his up—I served him then, and saw him—I saw no more of him that day until he was in custody, in the evening—I have seen Dr. Hartnell come to the house—on the Friday morning, when Mr. Cleveland told me to bring her up a cup of tea, she told me to bring a piece of dry toast for the gentleman that was with her, Mr. Dolly, as I call him—she did not say "for Mr. Dolly," but that was the name we called him—I do not think I saw her again.</p>

I now live at No. 51, Hart-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden—I know the house, No. 9, Wellington-street, and was in the habit of washing the lodgers of that house—I recollect the female prisoner being confined—about six weeks before that, she asked me about taking the baby to dry-nurse—about a week before her confinement, I asked her if she had clothes sufficient for the baby—she said she had plenty of flannel and calico in the house to make some, but she would give me money, and get me to go and buy her a thing of a sort, and I did so—that was quite sufficient preparation for the child—she told me she understood the baby would not be born alive—she said she thought that would be quite sufficient for the present, and if the child lived, she would not spare any expense whatever—I continued to see her up to the day of her confinement, which was on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 19th of March—I was sent for about ten o'clock on that morn<lb></lb>ing—I left the house once, and returned again about eleven o'clock in the evening—I staid with her till she was confined, and till about nine o'clock in the evening—she had told me that Mr. Harry Hartnell was to confine her—she said nothing else about him—I met Mr. Hartnell on the stairs when I went to the house in the morning, about ten o'clock—it was not in her presence—he was coming away—we returned to the parlour together—I saw him again at nine o'clock in the evening—I saw nothing of the male prisoner that day—I never saw him till he was taken into custody—Mr. Hartnell was not there in time to confine Mr. Cleveland, and I sent for Mr. Brooking by Mr. Cleveland's wish—I saw deliver the child, and he immediately gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, May 21, I was living at No. 9, Upper Wel<lb></lb>lington-street—on the afternoon of that day, about three or four o'clock, as near as I can judge, I took some arrow-root up into the female prisoner's bed-room—she then desired I would not come to the door till the bell rang, nor let any one come near it, for she had get a very bad headache, and she wanted to go to sleep—about six o'clock I heard the bell ring, and went up stairs into the room—Mr. Barber afterwards came into the room while I was there—I asked her to let me kiss the baby before it went home to Mr. Bar<lb></lb>ber's—she was going to take it home—Mr. Cleveland told me not to disturb the baby, for it was asleep—I afterwards saw Mr. Barber take it out of the bed—I was in the room, by the side of Mr. Cleveland—it had a light shawl on—I did not hear her say anything about the baby then, until she took it up, and—I kissed the baby—when Mr. Barber said the baby was dead, Mr. Cleveland said, God send she had not let the baby out of her bed—she then fainted—I gave her some water—I saw the baby's hands; they were clenched, and I opened one hand our—I had been servant in the house very nearly three weeks, I had seen the male prisoner there during that time—he came in and out—I had seen him there on the day before, Thursday, but not on the Friday—it was before Mr. Barber brought the child, on the Thursday, that he was there—I saw him in Mr. Cleveland's room—I cannot say how long it was before Mr. Barber came—I did not notice the time.</p>

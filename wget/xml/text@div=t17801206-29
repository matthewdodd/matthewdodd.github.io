               <p>The prisoner brought two baskets of wood to my house on the 26th of October, about a quarter after five in the evening; he brought them into the front room and set them down; about three or four minutes after he was gone out of the house my wife called me down stairs. I missed two silver watch cases and one tortoiseshell with silver edges, which had been lying upon the dresser. They have never been found.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to our house with wood on the 26th of October, I let him in. Immediately after he went I missed the watch cases; I had them in my hand when I was cheapening the wood, and had laid them down on the corner of the dresser. I missed the cases before any other person came into the house; when he was in the room with the wood I turned my back to go to the bottom of the stairs, but I was never out of the room while he was there. I went to the prisoner's house and waited for his coming home. Upon being charged with this matter he persisted in his innocence.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called several witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

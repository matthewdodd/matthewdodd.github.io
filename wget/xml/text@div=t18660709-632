                  </hi>. I am quarter-master of the 17 th Regiment of Bengal Infantry, and live at 179, Globe Road—on the afternoon of 21st May, about five o'clock, I was in the Grove Road Archway, Bethnal Green, near Victoria Park—I saw two vans coming along the road, each drawn by two horses—they were racing and galloping—they were coming in the same direction—Cobb was driving the advance van—I saw the little boy who was afterwards killed cross the road with his sister—when I first saw him he was on the side of the road where there were some stalls—the little girl had hold of his hand—she let go his hand and ran across the road—the boy was about following when the near horse or the near wheel of the van driven by Cobb struck the child, and it stumbled and fell forwards, and both the wheels of the other van driven by Clark went over it—the drivers galloped on through the archway up the hill forty good yards before I could get them to stop—when they stopped Clark's van was close to the kerb, and the other one was jammed close to it—they could not pass one another—the constable came up—I explained to him what had happened—I then went back and saw the child being taken to the doctor's, and I saw it die about five minutes afterwards.</p>

I live at 36, London Street, Stepney—I am guard to a van—I saw the two prisoners driving two vans in the Grove Road—I was on the pavement, the same side as the nut stalls—both vans were going one way—I have been used to horses about sixteen months—they were galloping—the last time I was up at the Court I said they were going at thirteen miles an hour—I saw the little boy who was run over, with his sister—they were on the pavement walking along when I first saw them, going to run across the road—the little girl ran across, and just as she got off the kerb she let go of the little boy's hand, and Cobb's near horse knocked the child down—both near wheels of Clark's van ran over him—I picked him up and took him to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in New Street, Lime-house—I was in the Grove Road on the afternoon of this accident—there were a great many persons in the road—there were a number of stalls, some underneath the railway arch, and some on each side of it—I saw two vans coming in the direction of Victoria Park, on the near side, they were going at the regular pace, between five and six miles an hour I reckon, trotting—I saw the little girl crossing the road with the child—I saw Cobb try to pull up his van, which was first, when the people hallooed for him—I can't say exactly how far he was then from the child, because they ran across the road—the little girl had hold of the little boy by the hand, and if she had kept hold of his hand she might have saved him—she saved herself, but she let go, and the near horse kicked the child, and knocked it down—I picked it up—in my opinion the driver could not have pulled up in time to prevent the accident—it was not possible for the vans to be galloping, from the thronged state of the road—if they had been galloping they must have done more injury than they did.</p>

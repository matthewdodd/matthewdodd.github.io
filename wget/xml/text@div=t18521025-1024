On 21st Sept, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for half a quartern of gin—he threw down half a crown—I took it up, bent it in the detector, and said, "This won't do for me"—he took it up, and threw down two pence—he waited a few minutes, and then left without taking the gin—he was not. tipsy, he was aware what he was doing—about half an hour after he came again, called for half a pint of beer, and threw down a penny—after that he was leaning on the bar, and had the half crown which he had offered me in his hand, and some shillings—he dropped a quantity of base shillings on the floor from his hand, and the half crown on the counter—I had mentioned about the half crown to a policeman—he was waiting outside, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I saw the policeman pick up the half crown from, the counter, and the money from the floor.</p>

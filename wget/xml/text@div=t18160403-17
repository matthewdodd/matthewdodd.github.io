On the 6th of February last, I went to my landlord house, Mr. Butler, at No. 8, Hackney-road-terrace, to pay my rent, at about half past two in the afternoon; he not being at home, I went thence to the Dover coffee-house, in Bond-street, where I staid three hours, or more, with a person; it was nearly ten o'clock when I left that; it was a little after eleven when I got into Shoreditch, almost facing where I live; just as I was turning into <placeName id="t18160403-17-crimeloc103">Fleur-de-lis-court</placeName>

They struck me with their fists, and cut me in several places with a knife, or some other sharp instrument; they cut me here, and here, (on the right thumb, and over the left eye,) they called me had names; they tore my left hand side pocket away; they took a pocket-book, which contained seventeen one-pound bank of England notes; also a pair of silver mounted spectacles, which were in my left hand side pocket, where the pocket-book was; they took one pound six shillings and sixpence from my breeches pocket, and a new hat from my head; I called out as well as I could murder, several times; I was lying in the kennel. I had an umbrella in my hand, and one man wanted to wrench it out of my hand. The watchman and my daughter came in a moment, and he threw it away. All the men appeared to be about the age of the prisoner; but two taller, and one a little bulkier; I can't swear to the prisoner; nor to the persons of any of them; I could not observe their dress, except that they had long coats.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. My daughter and the watchman are here. It was rather a light-some night; I did not look at the state of the moon; there was plenty of light from the lamps for me to see the party coming against me. I totally deny ever having said that I could swear to the prisoner; I always gave the same account of this transaction. I know nothing about a reward; I do not come here for any such purpose.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness; I shall be thirteen the 16th of this month. I heard the cry of murder when I was outside with our servant, putting up the shutters; I knew it was my father's voice; I went to the place whence the voice proceeded, and found my father laying under the scaffold in Fleur-de-lis-court; there was a man on the top of him trying to take the umbrella from him. When I hallooed out father, the man ran away, and threw the umbrella away; three men and three women also ran away. The prisoner was the person who was on the top of my father, and who took the umbrella away; I had an opportunity of seeing his person, and knowing him again; he had a brown coat on; I had seen him before in Wheeler-street; Wheeler-street is near Fleur-de-lis-court; I had seen him on the day before; Fleur-de-lis-court leads into Wheeler-street. My father appeared to be much hurt, and bled a great deal. I got up before the watchman; he had just passed our door, which is in Pearl-street; he ran after the prisoner. I saw another watchman, that my mother called, as she stood at the door; but he did not come up. There was only one watchman named Patrick Duff, who came up, and he ran after the people.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the night of the 6th of February; I saw the prisoner that night at about eleven o'clock; he was in company with three young men and three young women; they were all at the corner of Fleurde-lis-court, making a noise, and singing; their making a noise and singing, attracted my notice; I had seen the prisoner before that time, and knew his person. I told them to move on, and they answered me in different words, such as damning my eyes, and the like, and they went down Shoreditch, and up Fleur-de-lis-court, In five or six minutes after they went up the court, I heard some noise, murder, murder, murder, was the noise I heard. Upon that, I ran towards were the noise of murder was cried; I saw the prisoner just drawing from the prosecutor. just about half a yard from him; there were three men stood three or four yards off, and three women to the left of me; as I went to lay hold of the prisoner, one of the young women laid hold of my coat, and I turned round, and struck her over the hand with a stick, to get loose. The prisoner ran, and I ran after him, leaving the others in the court; he ran away from them; he ran up the court towards Shoreditch; I ran after him, and left the others in the court. I followed the prisoner up Fleur-de-lis-court, across White Lion-street, into Spital-square, where he turned up a passage, and I lost him. I had a fair sight of him; all the way as I ran there was a light from the gas-lamps. When I saw him first, I could see him by the lamp at the corner of Fleur-de-lis-court, and by the light of my lanthorn. I had him in my sight about three or four minutes; I had known him before, and had seen him frequently; but did not know where he lived.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of this charge that is laid before me.</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

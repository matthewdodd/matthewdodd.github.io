On the 4th of March I missed two spoons. a desert spoon and a salt spoon; she had lived with me two or three days; I told her we were sure that she had taken them, if she had pawned them to give up the duplicates; she said she had lost the duplicates, she had pawned them at Mr. Mangar's in Brick lane.</p>

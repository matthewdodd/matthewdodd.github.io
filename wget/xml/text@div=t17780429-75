               <p>I met the prisoner accidentally on the 29th of March, between two and three o'clock, at the Black Boy in St. Catherine's Lane; I was in company with him about two hours and an half; there was no other company except the maid of the house, he seemed to know her pretty well; I drank about three pints of beer, he drank part of one pint with me.</p>

               <p>Was he in company with any body else besides you? - There was a young woman and two young men, I don't know who they were.</p>

               <p>Had they any other liquor, wine, or punch? - I cannot say; I did not see what liquor they had.</p>

               <p>September, I bought some flannel, and some cotton stockings, at a shop at Uxbridge—I met a female between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I had the things I had bought with me in a handkerchief—I went from a public-house to a place the girl took me to, in Chequer-yard—I remained there with her a little time—I had paid for my bed, and paid the woman—I was undressing, and some woman came into the house, and said she would not have such people in her house, and tried to turn me out—I said I would go out after a short time—she said she wanted the room for a lodger, and the prisoner came in at that time—there was a light in the house—I said I had paid for my lodging, and did not know whether I should go out—I went out at last—I had the bundle tied on my right hand, and the girl was on my left arm, as she said I could get another bed—I left the prisoner in the house—he had come in a second time—I saw him again down at the bottom of a court, a little way from the house; he came behind me, put his hand over my mouth, and puled me backwards—he and three more came up and held me down for ten minutes, and held my mouth while they robbed me—some got on my legs, and some on my head, and held their mouth—they took from me the bundle, twelve shillings, and a half-crown—the money was in my breeches pocket—the prisoner's face was close to my face when I went backwards—I am sure he is one of the men who was on me at the time I was robbed—I struggled a long time, and got their hands off my mouth, and nearly got them off, and said, "For God's sake do not murder me, if you rob me," and the prisoner said "B----his head, I will knock his head off—we shall not be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> for him," and he knocked me about the head—I had not had much to drink—this happened on the Friday night—I saw him again next morning as I came into the court—he was shoving up the window, and I said, "That is the man who robbed me."</p>

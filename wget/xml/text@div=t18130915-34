I waited some considerable time. After the person left it I went in and discovered some loose tea on the seat. I looked under the privy, and on the side under the seat was a gimblet, upon that gimblet hung two bags of tea. I went to Mr. Murdock and gave the information. I took the gimblet out and carried the bags of tea into the office. I examined the bags; one of the bags I am positive to be the same. After Mr. Murdock and Captain Saunders had examined them I hung them in the same place upon the gimblet again. I have not seen the bags since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Did you see the man that was in the privy come out - A. I did, that was not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Thames police officer. On the 21st of August I watched this privy; I observed the prisoner go there. I saw him come out of the privy and go into the caravan shed. I searched him before he went out of the dock; about an hour after I searched him upon his coming out; his nose-bags were hanging on the shafts of the waggon, and these three bags of tea in it, and some hay on the top. The bags contained six pounds of green tea. I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said he found it in the privy, and he wished to God that he had left it. He said the first time he saw it in the privy he was afraid of taking it for fear of being detected with it, but the second time he was determined to take it; and the first time he saw it there was only two bags, the second time there were three bags; he then took it; he was going out of the dock with it if I had not stopped him.</p>
               <p>Root. This is the bag I am positive to that was on the gimblet; which of these two I am not positive. I only saw two bags.</p>

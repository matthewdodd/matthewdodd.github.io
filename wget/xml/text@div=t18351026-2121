                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Gray's-inn-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the night of the 18th of October I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock—I was the last person up in the house—I fastened all the doors and windows—my wife awoke me about half-past one o'clock, and I got up in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, as I could not find the matches before—I went down stairs—I opened the door, looked in the court, and could see nobody—I went into the parlour and found</p>

               <p>the house broken open—somebody had got over a high wall into the yard, and taken a square of glass out of the parlour window—it was broken, and all the square taken out—there was then plenty of room for any body to get in—I missed a pair of top-boots, two caps, two pairs of shoes, a waist<lb></lb>coat, and a basket—I told the policeman of it—the prisoner was brought to me by; Goff, a policeman—I asked the prisoner how he got in—I neither threatened him nor made him any promise—he told me he took the square out, and got in, and took the things—the property was produced by the policeman.</p>

On the morning of the 19th of October I saw the prisoner in the Blackfriars'-road with a basket said some things belonging to his mate, and he brought them from Guay'-inn-lane—I asked where he was going to take them—he said to the Cus<lb></lb>tom-house—that his mate was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Columbine</hi> steam-ves<lb></lb>sel, and that he belonged to the same vessel—I took him to the station-house, and went with him to Gray'n-inn-lane, and there heard of this robbery—I took him to the prosecutor's, and as the prosecutor returned with us to the station-house, I heard the prisoner tell him that there was part of the pane of glass out before, and he took out the remainder—I produce the articles—the Magistrate ordered me to give up two pair of shoes—I have the boots and other things.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is the landlord of the house? - A. His name is Dempsey, he lives in the same street; I have the back-room on the ground-floor, a young woman, who is here, lodges in the front-room, the house is let out in tenements; I go out a washing, and take in washing; I went out about nine o'clock on the 8th of January, and left my door padlocked; I came home about eleven o'clock, and found the door locked as I left it, and the prisoner sitting upon the bed-side; the window-shutters were broke open, I suppose he got in that way, the window must have been shoved up, it is an inside shutter; there is a long passage from the street-door, and my room window looks into the backyard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No; I might have seen him, but I was not acquainted with him; the bed and bed clothes were entirely gone; I asked him how he came there, and he said, as he came through the yard, he thought it was some little out-house, where he could be till the morning, as he had no place to be in; I then called for assistance, but he got away, I did not see him again till the next night, between six and seven o'clock; I saw him just go by the door, and then I had him detained, while I sent for Rogers and Riley, two officers belonging to Shadwell-office.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of light had you in the room? - A. There was no light at all, the fire was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you know the man then? - A. Because, when I opened the door, I had got a light from the young woman in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes were you in the room with him? - A. Ten minutes or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw that that night? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things? - A. No, I cannot hear any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been dark when you saw him the night after? - A. Yes; but I knew him by his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a blue jacket and trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an uncommon dress in your part of the town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body else here who saw him the first night? - A. Yes;

             sworn. - I live at No. 18, Denmark-street; I saw the prisoner in the young woman's room when she opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him? - A. I am sure he is the same young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. I had seen him pass by the door before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity to see his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What light had you? - A. I gave the young woman a candle to light her to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing him? - A. I dare say, twenty minutes, for she asked him what business he had there, and he said, he thought it was an out-house, where he could sleep all night; the bed, blankets and bolsters were all gone.</p>

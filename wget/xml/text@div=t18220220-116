Stop thief! and his companions followed close behind; he turned to the right, and I gave up the pursuit, and went to Worship-street office, described his dress and appearance, and in half an hour I went with the officer to the George, public-house, in George-yard, Whitechapel; two went in the back way, and I and the other at the front; and as I entered, three persons were coming out; neither of them was him; and as I looked round the tap-room, the prisoner was brought in from the back premises, I immediately said,</p>

The prosecutors said the man had a brown coat on, and he believed he was a Jew. I went in first - the door is very low - I was obliged to stoop to get in, and nearly passed the prisoner as I was stooping, the place being dark. I have known him many years. I think he said, How do you do, I said.</p>
               <p>"How do you do." Atfield caught hold of him, and brought him into the tap-room. He was dressed in a brown coat. We found Garton and the prosecutor in the tap-room, and he said he was the man who robbed him - his description answered to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He only said he had a brown coat, and was a Jew - A. Yes, that he was shabbily dressed. There is a man about the neighbourhood like the prisoner. I heard no voice outside say, That is the man.</p>

            . I take in needle-work and washing. I was at my door in Flower and Dean-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a young lad of short stature, run by my door - he had a light-coloured pepper and salt coat on, and was very much pock-marked. He ran towards the end of Flower and Dean-street - nobody was running before him - the prosecutor was following him about six yards behind, calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the lad to say whether it was the prisoner or not - A. It was not I am positive. I saw no more of what passed till half-past one o'clock, when the prosecutor came back with two officers, and I, as well as many more neighbours, hallowed out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake you have got the wrong man;" it was the general cry. I went to Worship-street to tell what I knew about it, but some man said I must not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the man who was running before Atwood to be the thief - A. Yes; no other could be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was a young lad - A. Yes; he was not fair nor dark, nor so tall as the prisoner. It is impossible for any one to take the one for the other; he does not resemble him in the slightest degree. The prosecutor came down my street last Sunday afternoon - I was at the door - he asked me to tell him the name of the street; he said then that he had made a grand mistake, as he thought it was Thrall-street, and asked if I recollected his being robbed. I said, very well; but he had got the wrong person. He said he had not; and if he had, he had sworn to him, and must swear to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you knew the prisoner - Yes, I have known him as a neighbour for twelve years; he lived in Winfield-street, with his mother and father.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was not near the place at all - A. No one was near except the prosecutor and thief, neither behind or before - Mrs. Myers was also at her door. The lad was a stranger; he was crying out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window." He ran about a hundred yard up our street, and turned down Cale-street, which is the first turning. I have not seen him since. Mrs. Myers did not go to the office.</p>
               <p>JUDA MYERS. I live in Flower and Dean-street, at the the corner of Cale-street, three doors from Prior. I was cleaning my door, and all at once heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the thief running, and as he passed me he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window." He was a shortish chap, high-shouldered, and had a pepper-and-salt coat on. I think it was a dark one. I saw Atwood running after him; nobody else was running either before or behind; the chap turned down Cale-street, went up Thrall-street, and I went in doors. They passed me at half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell; and in about three quarters of an hour I saw the prosecutor pass our street again with two officers; all the neighbours cried out.</p>
               <p>"You have got the wrong man." They had the prisoner in charge. I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake you have got the wrong man, that is not the man you cried Stop thief! after." I did not go to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the officers - A. Atfield was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man's coat so dark that it might be mistaken for brown - A. I think so; it was a dark pepper-and-salt colour. I should think the man would not come up to the prisoner's ear in height. The prisoner is a much darker man than him, and he was very much pock-marked - the prisoner is a little so; he is quite a different man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for one to be taken for the other - A. It would be a great mistake, for he was quite a different man, he was stout and the prisoner is slim, and he was high-shouldered. I only know the prisoner by seeing him pass our street with his bag of clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200059"></xptr>SOLOMON JOSEPH. I am a clothes-man, and live in Winfield-street. I know the prisoner very well. I met him in Holborn this day four weeks, by Middle-row. It was on Friday the 1st of February I walked with him from there into Bishopsgate church-yard, talking about business, and when our sabbath came on. We got to the church at one o'clock, and I left him. I looked at Bishopsgate church clock, it was not five minutes under or over one. Flower and Dean-street is half a mile from the church.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How does he get his living - A. He carries clothes about, and had his bag at this time. He lives with his father in Wentworth-street. I left him at the church.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to to give evidence - A. My lodger came home about three or four o'clock, and said this man was fully committed for trial - I was surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you want to be home by any particular time - A. No; I always come home between one and two o'clock - our sabbath begins at half-past three in winter, and then it moves to four, and that day it moved to half-past four. I always look at the clock to see how long I am out.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was your reason for looking at the clock - A. I always want to know how long I am out. I had something to do in our church that day - he said sabbath began at four o'clock, and I said it was half-past. I do not know yet what he was taken up for. I would not believe my lodger, and so I asked his father what it was for; he said he did not know; and I said he walked with me from Holborn, and left me at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your lodger tell you what time the offence was committed, or what it was for - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to say he was with you at one o'clock - A. That was the time I left him.</p>

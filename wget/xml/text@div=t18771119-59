                  </hi>. I am a fireman on board ship—on 10th November, about 10 or 11 p.m., I was at the "Wallace public-house, at the corner of London Bridge, calling for a pot of beer, when the prisoner came in and drew a knife across my throat—I put my hand up to save my throat, and my hand was cut—he ran out of the house, and I was taken to the hos<lb></lb>pital—we had had a row at a coffer-stall about 9 o'clock—the coffee-man pushed him down, and he got up and blamed me for it, and we went down the steps to fight, but two policemen prevented it, and we went to public-house and had a pint of beer together, and when we came out he aid "I must' have a couple of punches at you"'—I said "I shall have one at you if you give me one;" so he hit me in the eye, and I knocked him down and left him on the ground and went home—he was not insensible, but he would not get up—after this I went to the public-house—two or three "chaps" were with me when I was stabbed—my clothes were saturated with blood—the wound was rather on my chin. Joshua Towns. I keep a coffer-stall at the corner of London Bridge—10th November the prisoner asked me for a pipe of tobacco—I did at know him—he got too close to me—I pushed him and he fell in the mud—he got up directly—Leak had done nothing to him; he was talking me—they went away to fight, and I missed my knife off my stall—this is it—my stall is 20 yards from the Wallace.</p>

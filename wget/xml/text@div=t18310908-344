               <p>JOHN CLAGG KAY. I live in Gower-place, Eustonsquare, and am a <rs id="t18310908-344-viclabel1771" type="occupation">medical-student</rs>

On the night of the 7th of September, I met the prisoner in company with another woman in the Strand, they went with me to a public-house and had something to drink; soon after I left the house and missed my watch - I was not aware that the prisoner had followed me out; when I missed it I charged her with stealing it - she ran away from me; I saw her throw the watch down in the street - I picked it up, and afterwards stopped her in a street which she turned down, and kept her till the Policeman took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. What time did you first meet her? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock -I called in Soho-square; I had been to Westminster Abbey; it was between three and four, that I was in Soho-square, I drank a pint of ale there; I did not dine at all - I had a pint of ale near the Abbey; I stopped several hours at Soho-square, playing at bagatelle - I was not at all inclined to be intoxicated before I went into the publichouse with her; I had two or three pots of ale there; I was not tipsy when I came out, but I was inclining that way; there were two coal-heavers in the house, and they took part of the ale with me - I was talking to them and the girls.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it likely you would have stopped in such company, if you had not been drunk? A. Very likely; it is just according to the humour I am in - I frequently associate with coal-heavers and women of the town, scores of times - she threw the watch down the moment I charged her with it; I was able to run - I did not fall till I ran against a stone.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where are you a student of medicine? A. At the London University; I have been often at publichouses with women of the town and coal-heavers.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 8th of September, about twelve or one o'clock at night, Mr. Kay gave the prisoner into my charge near the Adelphi - he produced a watch, which he charged her with having stolen - she denied it; the watch-glass was broken - the prosecutor was not in liquor, he knew what he was about; he might be getting a little hearty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When do you call a man drunk? A. When he reels about and cannot walk straight.</p>

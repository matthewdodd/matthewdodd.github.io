            . On the 17th of February I came to town in a fish cart, I got off the cart in Grace church-street, nigh seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to me he said, you are very heavy loaded, I said, I was not heavy loaded I was cold hungry and dry; he said, I will get you into a house, I was going into a passage into Leadenhall-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before - A. No; we went into a house and he picked up a woman by the way, I called for a pot of beer and some bread and cheese, I had a glass of rum and so had they; I said, I would shift myself, after I had shifted myself I said, I would buy goose to take home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shift yourself in the tap room - A. I put on a shirt and another pair of trowsers; I differed about the goose I bought a leg of pork, he went with me to buy the leg of pork and the woman went and bought this pocket book for me. The prisoner seemed to be a friend of mine as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober to do all this - A. I was as sober as I am now, having bought this leg of pork I went back to drink at this same house. I had my money in a belt that went twice round me in what they call a comforter, I had thirty five one pound notes, I received them at Portsmouth, on the 16th, they were all one pound bank of England notes. I was discharged from the Haughty, gun-brig.</p>
               <p>Q. Having come back to this public house this comforter had these notes in it - A. Yes; it was over my shirt and my waistcoat over that. The prisoner saw I had the notes in it at the public house, I took one out on purpose to pay for what I wanted, I had another pot of beer I said, I will go now, I was going to my sister in Jane Shore-alley, Shoreditch. I called a coach and he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110020"></xptr>along with me in it. The woman did not go in the coach with us she came out of the public house with us. The coach put me down at the corner of Union-street, the woman was there, she followed us in to buy a handkerchief there, I bought her a pair of gloves at the same time; the prisoner went into the shop with me, I made fast the belt in the linen drapers shop myself; I had the money then, I am sure, and I went along Norton Falgate to go to Shoreditch; I went past the turnpike between New Inn-yard, and Plumb-pudding-row; I missed the belt off me, I said, to the prisoner you have got my money; I got your money said he, and he run away from me directly; I sung out stop thief, and run after him, I could not get up to him. He was stopped and taken into the

            , public house, and searched and nothing was found upon him. When I came up to him he said, Bill what a fool you must be, go along with me you shall have every farthing again. I lost my belt and all the notes; the belt went round my body twice, and I fastened it with two knots.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let me understand how he could get at this belt which you describe went twice round your body and was tied - A. It was worsted, it was always slipping, it was made to put round the neck, there was a little hole in the middle you could put a sixpence in it, it could not come out easy.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MERCHANT. I am a watchman at New Inn, Shoreditch. On the 17th of Feb. last when I was on my beat I heard the cry of stop thief, I came up, I saw the sailor with a leg of pork, he said he had been robbed of 35 one pound Bank notes. The prisoner was taken and brought to me by Ashton. The prisoner said to the sailor, what are you making this piece of fuss about, come along with me, and you shall have every farthing of your money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how the prosecutor's dress was at that time. -

            He had a short jacket on and trowsers, one side of the flap of his trowsers was unbuttoned, and his shirt was hanging out.</p>
               <p>JAMES ASHTON. I was coming home on Saturday the 17th of February, near 10 o'clock at night. I live in William-street, Curtain Road, and just as I had rung the bell I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner running, he seemed to be a great distance from any body that was pursuing him. I sprang from the door, and seized him by the collar with both hands; he made resistance, and said, let me pass, I have done nothing amiss; I said, if you have done nothing amiss, you shall go when they come up: several people came up, and said that is the man, he has robbed the sailor of 50 pounds; a young man laid hold of him by the collar, and took hold of his right hand; I took him by the left hand, and held his collar with the other; we took him to the

The prisoner says to him, have I robbed you, and took out one or two dollars and a few shillings from his breeches pocket, and said, that is all the money I have; he said, if you have lost your money you know who it is with, and if she has got it you will have it again, it is very safe. He was conveyed to the watch-house. I told the officer of the night what he had said; I said, officer, if you like, I and you will go and see if we can get the money for the poor man. The prisoner then said, no, he would not go, he would see us all b - r, we might do as we pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When you came out of this linen draper's shop, and went along Norton Falgate, who was with you. - A. The man, I never saw the woman after I came out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Dalton and Morgan, of 3, Budge-row, City, wholesale stationers—the prisoner was a traveller in their service, and had been so for twelve months—his duties were to collect orders for goods and bring them to me—I entered them in this book, and executed them—sometimes payments would be made to him by customers—it was then his duty to bring the amounts to me, and I would enter them in this book—he ought to have given the moneys over to me the next time he came to the warehouse—I entered them in this book and got the cashier to sign the items as I paid them over to him—I find no entry in this book of a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Edwards—the 17th is the next entry after the 15th—I find no entry on the 24th of a sum of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Edwards—there is no entry in the book after 28th March—there is no sum of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid by Mr. Homersham—the prisoner left about 28th March—I did not see him after that—he never accounted to me at any time for this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the money received would be copied from this book into the cash-book—this is the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is no entry here on 17th Feb. of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Edwards—there are no entries copied from any book on that day—there is no entry on 24th Feb. of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Edwards—there are a great number of entries made on that day; none from my book—the prisoner paid no money to me that</p>

Q.</hi> Can you tell me whether the prisoner paid over any<lb></lb>thing on 17th February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If so, it is written in there, I don't recollect—it would not appear in the prisoner's name, but in the name of the person from whom he received the money—there was nothing paid on the 17th of February to me, nor on 24th—the prisoner did not cease coming till 28th March—if I recollect correctly the order entered on 28th was sent by memor<lb></lb>andum by the prisoner—he did not come after that—he had been in the service about 11 or 12 months—the orders that he obtained in that time are entered up in weeks, our ledger-keeper can tell you, how many I really don't know—I should say another traveller was put on the prisoner's ground about ten days or a fortnight after 10th March—that would be a day or two before the prisoner left—we have regular collectors to collect money—the prisoner did not go round collecting money, it was only his duty to receive it if anybody paid him—he was paid a commission of 2½; per cent. on all sales—there was not a commission book kept for the prisoner—he was not allowed anything for travelling expenses to my knowledge—the bad debts the firm lost, but of course no commission was allowed on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Budge-row, with my partner—the prisoner was our traveller, he received 2½; per cent. commission on sales—we paid him that after he paid in moneys—he was not allowed to deduct any money whatever—he drew on account so much a week—when he received money it was his duty to hand it over to Robinson the next time of his visiting the warehouse after receiving the money—Robinson would then carry it into the counting-house and hand it to the cashier, after entering it in this book—the sums entered in this book are posted into the cash-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell me how much the prisoner obtained in orders during the 12 months he was with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 3, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount of his sales, I think—I have a partner, he takes an active part in the business—the prisoner asked me to allow him something on account of horse hire—he had to pay his own expenses—I agreed to allow it to him contingent on the amount of the business done; the profit and character of the business done; no amount was agreed to be allowed—he said it was necessary to drive round some days in the weeks when his round was a long one—I thought it a reasonable request—he said something about having to give our customers Christmas boxes—we did not refuse to make him any allowance—we gave him something—half-a-crown to one, and half-a-crown to another—that is usual in the trade—if he made a bad debt he would receive no commission upon it.</p>

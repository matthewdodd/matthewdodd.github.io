                  </hi> 113.) On the 23rd of May I was on duty, and from information I received, I went to the top of the house, No. Chancery Lane, and from the window of that house, I saw the prisoner, apparently at work, moving something at the back of the house, No. 3, Crown-court, which is rented by him—he was on the top of the bouse—in opening the window further, it made a sort of noise; he got up, and looked up at me—I knew his face, and placed my brother constable to watch, while I went round to the other end of Whites-alley, to see if I could see any thing farther—we then went up the house, and on the 2nd floor I saw the lead I now produce, on the stairs—a room rented by the prisoner was burst open, and the door hung by the padlock—we heard a noise, and I asked who was there—we entered and could see nothing—I was going away, but returned again to the window which looked to No. 3, Crown-court, Whites-alley, and saw the prisoner come from a back house up stairs—he said, "What do you want here?" I said, "Do you live here?"—he said, "My father does "—I then took him into custody—4 afterwards went on the roof of the house, and found another piece of lead on the roof and a knife—I took a small piece of lead off the large piece and could not fit it.</p>

I was called to No. SB, Charncery lane, to see a person on the house—I went in, and Braddick was there looking out of window—he told me to remain there while he went to get assistance to we if he could take him—while I was there I saw the prisoner very busily at work, doing something on the roof, and I saw him take the lead up and throw it into a trap door—he then went in himself—I am sure he is the man</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, A</hi>). The prisoner held an appointment in the Police, as inspector of common lodging houses in the K division—it was his duty to inspect daily, or nightly, the common lodging-houses in that district—his travelling expenses were allowed him, and certain other expenses when away from home—he sent in his account weekly to me, and if it was correct, it was my duty to sign it previous to the money being received—in his expenses for June I discovered an overcharge, and sent for him specially, having known him some time, and knowing that he had a wife and family—I told him I must caution him that it must not be repeated again, or I should be obliged to lay it before the Commissioners—on Monday, 18th July, I found an overcharge in his account, and on the 20th, when he came, I sent for him, and told him I should be obliged to lay the complaint before Captain Hay, and I did so that day, and afterwards told the prisoner that he would stand suspended from that day till the next day, when he would have to appear before Captain Hay—I was particularly careful to speak mildly to the pri<lb></lb>soner; I said, If you please, you will have to attend"—this took place in the Old Palace Court, Scotland-yard—the lodging house place is three houses further on—I went to the lodging-house office, and about eight or ten minutes afterwards, as I was standing with my back partly towards the door and my face to the window, paying some expenses, received two blows, from whom I cannot say, but I had beard the door open before that, saw the prisoner come in, and then resumed my position, with my back towards him, and about a minute afterwards I received the blows; the first was on my shoulder, and the second on my temple; I put up my hand and missed my eye—I said, "My eye is gone," and I ran out of the room, and was taken to the hospital—I am still under medical attendance.</p>

On 20th July, I was at the common lodging house office, and saw the prisoner come in at about 20 minutes to 1 o'clock; Inspector Reason was standing at the further end of the room with his face to the window; the prisoner went behind him and levelled a blow at his head with a truncheon, which he drew from his pocket; he followed up the blow two or three times—I called to the inspector who was sitting between me and him, and he assisted in securing the prisoner—Price took the truncheon from his hand, and he said he had had his revenge, and said, "Do what you like with me, I shall get justice."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at Charing-cross Hospital.

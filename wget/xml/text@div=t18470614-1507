                  </hi>. My mother is a window, and keeps the house No. 5, New-street, Bishopsgate, in the parish of St. Botolph Without, Bishops<lb></lb>gate; Landsberg lodged in the first floor front room, Cohen at the back, and the prisoner on the third floor. On the 25th of May, about six o'clock, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Cohen went out together—after they had been gone about five minutes the prisoner returned—I opened the door—he went into the parlour—I went in, then left him there, and went down stairs—he then went up stairs and opened Mr. Landsberg's room—the door makes a noise when it is opened; it bursts—when I heard the door I spoke to my mother, and she went up stairs—there was no other person in the house but a lady on the second floor—my mother was up stairs three or four minutes—the prisoner then went out—he turned to the left, and I could not see him as I looked to the right—I heard somebody go out—the lady was not out all that day—there was one gentleman lived in the house—he came in twice, and went out twice—I let him in once, and let him out once, and my mother let him in once, and out once—he had got nothing with him—another gentleman came once, and let himself in—he had nothing with him, and I let him out—neither of them could have had a bag or box without my seeing it.</p>

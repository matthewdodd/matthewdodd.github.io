               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had had too much ale and stout. I gave the woman a shilling and she said that it was bad. I sat down on a door-step and some unfortunate woman asked me to treat her and I did so; she told me that a man had been following her for the last half-hour, and I asked Hockam what he was following her for. He did not say anything about bad money or about my being in his house, I merely struck him because he told a falsehood. As to swallowing anything, my mouth was bleeding because the witness struck me, and I might have wiped my mouth with my hand. I was in the yard a quarter of an hour, and could have made away with any<lb></lb>thing while I was alone; is it likely that I should have let them see me put my hand to my mouth if I wanted to make away with anything, should not I have made away with the part of a bad shilling which was in my pocket. Of course I struggled when I was seized by the throat. The 3rd of March is eight months ago, I was then at work at Mr. Gelding's, coach builders, at Reading. Consider how easily a man' may come into the possession of a bad shilling. I may have wiped blood from my mouth, but it was impossible for a man to see anything go down my throat with a stick in my mouth.</p>

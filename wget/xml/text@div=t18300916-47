The prisoner and I are cousins - she slept in the same room when out of place; on Sunday, the 8th of August, I wore my watch - when I returned in the evening I put it into my box; we slept together that night - I locked the box and put the key into my pocket, which I put on the bed.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I took in this watch of the prisoner in the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Monday morning, at one o'clock, the watch laid by the side of the bed; she asked how I got on last night - I said very bad, I met with no success; she lent me her watch to get money on, and said I must let her have it in a week - I thought of meeting a gentleman on Thursday that I should have half a sovereign from; we are both unfortunate women - on this Sunday she asked if I had got the watch; I said No, but she should have it in the week - we had some words, and she said, "You b-h, I will do for you before the week is out," and she got the landlady, who turned me out of the room; I was going down the Strand, and met her with the Policeman, but I had not the duplicate to give her.</p>

             re-examined. I have been a flower-maker, but trade has been slack, and I have been dependent on my mother; I have never had a bad character in my life - she went by the name of Squill when with me; I have had a deal of trouble with her - I have occasionally sent her to pawn small articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We are brother and sisters' children - I was brought up in an orphan school; she has been my ruin - when I have had money she has welcomed me, and when I had not I was turned out.</p>

I am a cabdriver—I made the prisoner's acquaint<lb></lb>ance a little over seven years ago—she was then walking St. James's Street—we have lived together nearly six years, in two different places—I continued cabdriving, and brought her home the money to maintain her—I had separated from her for 13 months, but saw her several times in the meantime—on Thursday night, 7th October, at a little after 8, I met her outside the Aquarium—I was still on friendly terms with her—I went with her to 14, Ohurton Place, Pimlico, where she was living, took off my jacket in her bedroom, and laid down on the bed and went to sleep—she was not on the bed—I awoke in about half an hour—I was</p>

George's Hospital—I was an in-patient till yesterday week, and am still an out-patient—by causing her to do it, I suppose she meant my leaving her—I left her 13 or 14 months ago, but she had not threatened me the meantime—she had asked me some time previously to return and live with her, but I said "No".</p>

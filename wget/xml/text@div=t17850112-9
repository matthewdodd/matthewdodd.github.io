               <p>I am servant to Mr. Pellet, in St. John Street, he is an Ironmonger, this screw which Mr. Barnes calls his property, I bought of Mr. Abrahams, with a quantity of iron. (The screw produced) it was a fortnight or three weeks before this Gentleman owned it, that I bought it, it lay at our shop to sell, I bought it as old iron in a quantity; Mr. Abrahams deal in old iron, and collects it all over the town, wherever he can, and gets his living that way as I understand; the prisoner brought this in a cart, he has dealt with my master three or four years, I bought it altogether at twelve pence a hundred, he has always dealt fair with us, there never was any thing claimed at our place before, I bought it of him as old iron, and looked upon it as such, there was no nut to it when I bought it.</p>
               <p>(The screw deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. This screw without a nut is incompleat and strictly old iron? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It came in an open way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If any body else had brought it, you would have bought it, equally the same? I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit here is no evidence to put this man on his defence.</p>

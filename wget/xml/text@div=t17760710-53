               <p>Was the lock broke? - No; I found the lock safe when I came.</p>
               <p>Mr. VERBRUGGEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am master founder at Woolwich: we have a particular art of boring cannon out of the solid with a particular tool that is not known in the kingdom; we weighed the borings and found a deficiency of 200 pound weight and half within a few pounds.</p>
               <p>How do you know the quantity that was in that chest? - Knowing that this was the boring of ten three pounders, we know that it should produce ten hundred pound weight, that is to a certainty within five, six, or seven pounds; it is done so exact, we can always speak to a few pounds; there was near 200 pound weight and a half deficient in this chest.</p>
               <p>Should you know these borings again if you were to see them? - By the shape and the metal: I have brought some on purpose that we bored afterwards to compare them.</p>
               <p>You can tell by the metal, and likewise by the form of it? - Yes; it is my own.</p>
               <p>When you call it your own, is it your property? - His Majesty furnishes us with the metal, it is only under our charge: the prisoner has been working with us upwards of three years and a half; he worked nineteen months in this room; he was a smith, we took him from Woolwich: the prisoner took his discharge in November.</p>
               <p>Mr. AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a brass founder at Hoxton: on the 21st of last month a Mr. Hall that lives in White Horse-street, Stepney, brought me 215 pound weight of this metal; he is a man of reputation, I have dealt with him some time, I bought them of him; I heard afterwards that the royal foundry at Woolwich had been robbed; I sent to Mr. Verbruggen to let him know that I believed I had some of the metal which had been stole from the royal foundry, and would give him all the information I could: this is part of the metal I bought (producing it); we make pot metal of it; I never saw any of that sort nor in that form before.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see any such metal before? - No.</p>

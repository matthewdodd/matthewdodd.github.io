(Produces a dirty bedgown.) She desired to go into the same room where the man prisoner went, to put on some things, and in that room were some halfpence, which corresponded with the die; I did not see them fitted; a young woman, a visitor, was discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners counsel. What was her name? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know her name was Jackson? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that the man was there for fear of being arested? - I never heard that.</p>
               <p>Do not you think the woman is his wife? - I have reason to think otherwise; this is a dark cellar; there were no candles burning, but there were two that were warm, as if lately burnt out, but we could not observe the snuffs; they were by the side of the press.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this woman goes by the name of the man? - That is the name she gave in at the office.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe she is not his wife? - By what I have been told.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officers, on the 12th of May last, to No. 9, Britannia-row; Armstrong went into the garden first, I surveyed the premises; when we first went into the house, I found in the cellar a press complete for coining, and an halfpenny between the dies that I have here; there was a quantity of halfpence about, some stamped, and some blanks; in the kitchen were boiling a large quantity of halfpence in a net; it was a complete press for stamping, there were candles fixed, the snuffs were out, they were out, but the closeness of the place might make them warm; after they were in custody by the other officers, I went up to the one pair of stairs, the left hand side where Mr. Bridgen was putting on his clothes, there I found a sack with some saw dust in it, and in it a piece of halfpence, that is thirty shillings worth, made up, which corresponds with the die; and in a basket in the same room were some loose, not made up into a piece, corresponding with the dies; I found a very dirty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310087"></xptr> shirt in the room where the prisoner was found; I did not see the woman till they were both in custody.</p>

               <p>Are any of these tower halfpence? - They are not; they are boiled with brimstone to make them black; here appears to be a flaw, that appears to be struck with this die; with respect to this halfpenny found between the die, it has received a blow, but not the impression, it seems as if these halfpence were not struck by this die with the flaw.</p>

               <p>Mrs. BEACH sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 9, Britannia-gardens; I know the two prisoners, they were my lodgers; they had one side of the house, and this cellar was on that side; I never was in the cellar; the prisoners had the parlour, bed room, and a garret; they passed for man and wife; I never knew any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is become of Johnson? - I do not know him, I never saw him but once, after he took the lodging.</p>
               <p>Then it was Johnson that took the lodging? - It was; he said he took it for his sister and her husband; he said, he should be there himself likewise.</p>
               <p>I believe this poor man was afraid of being arrested? - That was what Mr. Johnson told me, that he came there because it was retired.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know the woman prisoner go by the name of Jackson? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion that the woman is entitled under this evidence to the benefit of a married woman.</p>

                  </hi> I am cook to Mr. Secundus Bancroft White Butterfield, who lives in York-place, City-road. I know the prisoner Harris—he was in service there, and then went by the name of Hewish—he left on the 30th of March—he has called there since—the last time he came was on Thursday, the 10th of June—he then called about five o'clock, to see the servants—he did not remain long—I know this spoon and fork produced—they are my master's property—there is a crest on them—I am in the habit of seeing them—I do not knew when they were missed—I did not know they were missed till the policeman brought them, on the 12th of June—the spoons and forks were then counted, and these two were missed.</p>

The prisoner Trude came to my shop on the 11th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and asked if we bought old silver—I asked what it consisted of—he said, "Spoons and forks"—he asked what price we gave for it—I said it depended on what it consisted of—he said a friend of his had some outside—he then left the shop and returned with a spoon and fork—no one returned with him—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—I desired the policeman to accompany him to the person outside—he brought both the prisoners back—I asked Harris his name—he said it was Thomas Harris, and that he lived at No. 23, Earl-street, Edgware-road—he said the spoon and fork were his mother's, who lived in some part of Devonshire—the prisoners were both given into custody</p>

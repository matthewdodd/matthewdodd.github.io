                  </hi>. I live in Great Castle-street, and am a jeweller. I was leaving my brother's house on the 17th of February, between one and two o'clock in the morning, in Greek-street, Soho, and was going to Great Castle-street—within twenty or thirty yards of it I fell down—I cannot say whether I was knocked down—I had been drinking—I was not drunk—I was insensible for two or three hours, and one of the teeth of my lower jaw was broken—I lost this handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 68.) A little before two o'clock on Friday morning, the 17th of February, I found Mr. Flower on the pavement—I hastened up and saw the prisoner and another man standing not far from him—they said, "Here is a dead man"—I called a brother constable, and we took him to the hospital, and got his face washed and his wounds dressed, and the men went with us—the prisoner offered to assist us in taking the prosecutor home—we refused, and in a little while Wilson said to me, "Hold Mr. Flower fast"—I turned my head and saw him take out of the prisoner's hand a handkerchief, which I believe to be this.</p>

I found the prosecutor in the hospital—I went and saw the prisoner and another person—we were taking Mr. Flower home, and the prisoner followed us with another—they stopped a little way behind, and overtook us again in Titchfield-street—the prisoner aid, "Have you not got him home yet?"—he went a little further, and got hold of his arm—I said, "Let him alone"—we walked a pace or two further, and I saw the prisoner's hand in Mr. Flower's pocket, and he drew out this handkerchief—I said, "What are you at there?" and caught his hand—he said, "Oh, here is his handkerchief"—I then took him into custody—in going along he said, "I am only a poor servant; let me go;</p>

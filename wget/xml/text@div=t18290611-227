On the morning of the 11th of May I went to settle with the prisoner and another of my men - there was only 1s. coming to him - I then went to my clothes in my box, and went away leaving the prisoner in the room - I had left my money in the box on the Saturday night, and when I went out that day, I left the key of the box on the bed - before I returned, word was sent after me that the money was gone; I came home and missed four half-crowns, some shillings, and sixpences - the prisoner had seen the box - it was where I kept my clothes - I was advised to go to Mr. Spooner, who told me to go in quest of the prisoner - I found him in a public-house intoxicated: I sent for an officer, who took him - I then went to Mr. Phillips, and then to a baker's where he had left part of the money - he had left his own old hat at Mr. Phillips; this is it.</p>

               <p>PATRICK BURK. I lodge at the prosecutor's. On the 11th of May, I was going up to my bed-room, and saw his door open, about eleven o'clock, and the prisoner with his keys in his hand, locking or unlocking the box.</p>


               <p>Cross- examined. Q. Did you say before the Magistrate that he had the keys in his hand? A. Yes; I did not see him take any thing out.</p>

               <p>JOHN SPOONER. I keep a chandler's-shop on Saffronhill. On the 11th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner came and asked me to give him a sovereign for a sovereign's worth of silver - he had three or four half-crowns in his hand - I said I had not any gold.</p>

            . I sell hats on Saffron-hill. On the 11th of May, the prisoner came about twelve in the morning, and purchased a hat for 3s. 6d. - he paid for it with a half-crown and a shilling - he pulled out a bit of paper, and I saw a sovereign in it - he said he had been going to throw it away to light his pipe with - I advised him, as he was in liquor, to get it changed into silver. as then, if he lost part of it, he might not lose it all - I gave him eight half-crowns for it - he went away, and left his old hat, which the prosecutor had the next day.</p>

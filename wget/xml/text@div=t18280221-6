I came out to go home about nine o'clock, and when I had got into the middle of the street, about twenty yards from the door, the prisoner came behind me, struck me in the back of the neck with his fist, and knocked me down; he must have followed me out; I saw him drag the bundle out of my hand - I kept it; when I was down he forced it from me, and ran away; I saw him by the light of the lamps, and am certain of him; I sung out Watch! the watchman came up, followed, and brought him back in about half an hour; I am sure he is the man. I had bought the caps, and was taking them home to my wife; he only knocked me down on my knees - I got up directly.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the 28th of January, at nine o'clock, and heard Kelly sing out for a watchman; I went up, and he complained to me- I saw nobody run from him; I saw a good many people running after a person - I followed, but did not get up to them. In consequence of information I took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor had not described him to me, but the publican had - I met him going into the Cock public-house, George-street, in about half an hour, and took him: I heard him tell the prosecutor at the first examination, that he and his mother would make it up to him, if he did not prosecute him; I did not hear him say any thing about returning the property. I have known him nearly two years - the prosecutor had made no offer to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KELLY re-examined. Q. When I was at the office I said nothing to induce him to offer to settle it; his mother, who stood by me, said if I would not prosecute, they would get me my bundle, and pay me for my time; the prisoner heard that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left work, and went to the Cock, to have some beer, and this gentleman took me; I did not know what it was about till morning, when the prosecutor said if my mother would give him 10s. he would make it up.</p>

            . I have known Kelly eight years - he came to me about six o'clock, and we drank nine quarterns of gin, to our ownselves; this was on Monday week - I do not know the day of the month; I cannot read - we were together from six to eleven o'clock that night, at a public-house in George-street, kept by Kennedy; we drank nine quarterns of gin, and, to the best of my opinion, six quarts of beer, between us two - he had no more money, and asked me to go out and sell the caps for half-a-crown - I went out, and could only get 1s. 6d.; I returned, and gave them to him - he went out, and was so drunk he could hardly walk; I went to the pastry-cook's, to wait for some pies, and as I returned I saw two watchmen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210009"></xptr>dragging Kelly to the watch-house, and hitting him, he was so drunk; that was at a quarter-past eleven o'clock; I did not leave him from six o'clock till eleven, except to sell the caps; it was about three weeks ago: he returned after being at the watch-house, and stopped in the same house till twelve o'clock.</p>

I saw this man dragged to the watch-house, very drunk; I had come out to look for my husband, who was drinking; it was last Monday three weeks; two watchmen were lodging him at St. Giles' watch-house - they struck him several times: it was after eleven o'clock.

               <p> - MUSTOW. I am the prisoner's mother. I was at the office, and asked Mr. Kelly what property he had lost; he said it was of no great consequence, but at last said three caps - I asked the value; he said, "I don't want to lose my day's work - if you will give me 10s. before he goes in, it shall be settled;" I said I had not ten farthings, but if he would come with me to Mr. Kennedy, I thought he would pay it; he said he did not know him; the watchman said I had better go and get it myself; I said I was afraid he would be brought in before I returned - he said he would not, but in ten minutes he was taken in- nothing was said about the bundle being returned.</p>

               <p>Was nobody near you? - No, it was about ten; there was nobody that I knew, I called to the watchman, he did not appear, there were people came, but I did not know them; one gentleman said, hold her fast, and I will go for the watchman, but he did not return.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you pick up two girls in Turnmill-street, a tall girl, and a short one? - No, I had no girl at all with me from the time I left my wife, till I returned to her again; I live within two hundred yards of where I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is this true? - No, it is the girl that took my watch, I never let her go out of my sight; I asked her at the watch-house to tell me who the other girl was; and she said no, she would go to bloody Newgate before she would tell me, and there was no other woman that I saw at the time but them two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had people here attending yesterday to give me a character, but I did not know when I should be tried.</p>

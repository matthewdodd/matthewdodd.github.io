                  </hi>. I live in Old Gravel-lane, in the parish of St. George in the East. I live in the house myself, and take in lodgers by the week to board and lodge—I know the prisoner—he had lodged in my house two or three days previous to the time he broke in—I had desired him to go—on Thursday night, the 22nd of September, the house was all fastened up when I went to bed—I did not examine it myself—I was called up by one of my lodgers about half-past four o'clock in the morning and came down stairs—it was daylight at that time—directly I came down I saw the prisoner in the yard—my lodgers had got him there—I saw him searched when the policeman came—the policeman was sent for immediately—I did not see any thing taken from him myself—a pair of stockings was shown to me afterwards by the policeman—they were William Birch's stockings—he was one of my lodgers at that time—I am positive they are his—I washed them for him on the Tuesday previous—they are cotton—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230047"></xptr>
               <p>I saw them hanging on a line in my back kitchen after I washed them on the Wednesday—I cannot exactly say at what time—the prisoner had left my house at that time—I think it was on the Tuesday that he left—I can lot exactly say whether it was on the Monday or Tuesday, but I saw the I stockings after he was out of ray house, I am sure—I also saw a jacket in the policeman's possession—that was the property of John Thomas, who was a lodger in my house at that time.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> What did you do with my jacket, which you took off my back before you turned me out of your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took the jacket off himself—it is in my house now—he owes me a good deal of money—he took the jacket off his back, and I turned him out—I have got the jacket to pay for out of my pocket—I made myself liable to the person he bought it of, and have got it to pay for—his watch is in my house but he owes me about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that is all I have of his in my possession</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN LORD</hi>. I was a lodger in Mrs. Hall's house; I am a sailor. On be morning of the 23rd, (I do not know the day of the week,) I came down stairs a little after four o'clock—I opened the window, and then the shutter, and looked into the yard and saw the outer door of the back kitchen open, and saw the prisoner get over the paling into the next yard—I got upon the paling myself, and saw him in the yard—I spoke to him, for he could not get further there, and was obliged to stand—it was just light enough to discern him—the houses prevented his getting further—I called him by name, and said that was him—he made no answer—I immediately went in doors and gave an alarm—I went round the house to see if he would come out round at the back—during that time he was secured—I saw him next in the house, in custody of some of the lodgers, Daley and Thomas, who are both gone to sea—I fetched a policeman, and then went into the yard where I had seen the prisoner, and there found a jacket belonging to John Thomas—I know it was his—I did not hear Thomas say any thing about it in the prisoner's presence—I saw the back door open I had secured it myself the night before—I do not know whether the house had been broken in in any way—there was sufficient room for him to get through a window in the middle of the house, which had three squires of glass broken by accident—that window looks into the yard—I think he might get through that window without breaking any part of it—I bad seen Thomas's jacket the night previous—I had it in my hand before I secured the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called by Lord about half past four o'clock on the 13th of September—I went into the house and found the prisoner in custody of Thomas and some others, and Lord and somebody handed to me this jacket—the prisoner was present at the foe. and it was stated to me that the jacket was found in the yard which the prisoner tried to make his escape into—the prisoner made no reply—I the searched him, and found in his pocket a pair of stockings, which I now produce—William Birch, who is now absent, said they were his—the prisoner heard that, but said nothing—north further was said—I have to jacket and stockings here.</p>

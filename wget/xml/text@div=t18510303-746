                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Edward-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford. About 10th April, 1850, the prisoner came to me, and took a lodging—he said he was a baker—I asked where he worked—he said he had been three years in a situation in Fenchurch-street, but had heard of a situation at Deptford, and was going to work that evening—I forget what name he said—he said he wished to come in in the morning, and sleep in the day, as he worked at night—he came at eight o'clock next morning, and I showed him the room, which was a top one, at the back of the house—I asked what time he wished to get up, and he said about four in the afternoon—he came down about half-past three, and I said, "You are up earlier than you wished to be called"—he said he was awake, and thought he might as well get up—he asked for some boiling water, and went out to get a piece of bacon, but he never came back—I did not see him till he was in custody—my room is on the same floor as the one he occupied—I afterwards missed from my drawers there 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In money, a silver watch, gold pin, a brooch, watch-chain, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of stockings—the drawers had been unlocked and locked again—I left them safe at seven in the rooming—no one besides the prisoner was up-stairs, except a lady who lodged on the next floor, and who is still lodging a few doors off—she continued with me four months after this—the house is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford.</p>

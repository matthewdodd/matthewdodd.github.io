                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the employ of Messrs. Neville and others. The prisoner was one of their porters—it was his duty to bring a box of dust from the back kitchen, and carry it through the lower warehouse, about nine o'clock in the morning—I received information, and on the morning of the 26th of August I went into the upper warehouse, where I could watch what was going on without being seen—about half-past eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come through the warehouse with the dust-box, and come back to about the middle of the warehouse—he there opened a drawer, and took out a white paper parcel, then opened another drawer, and took out another white paper parcel—he then opened a third drawer, and took out a parcel in a blueish paper—he took the box and the parcels, went through the warehouse, and out of the door—I informed my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Benjamin Neville and others—I reside on their premises, in Maiden-lane, in the parish of St. John Zachary. In consequence of information from Fowler I went up to the prisoner's bed-room—(he slept on the premises)—I found him there, and charged him with having stolen three dozen of stockings—he denied it—another porter was then in the room—I desired him to leave, and I then told the prisoner it was no use his denying it, as I had a witness who saw him do it—he then said, if I would go down stairs, he would give them to me—I went with him to the back kitchen—he there put his hand into a box containing waste paper, took out two parcels, and gave them to me—one was in a white paper, and the other in a blueish paper—he said, "There they are sir"—I sent for an officer—these are the parcels—I can identify them by the marks on the wrappers—they contain silk stockings.</p>

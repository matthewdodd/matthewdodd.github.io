               <p>Christopher Richards. I was coming home to my lodgings in White-Friars, on a Monday morning about two o'clock, five weeks ago. I met with the two prisoners in <placeName id="t17560528-6-crimeloc29">Fleet-Street</placeName>

             pick'd my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do it?</p>
               <p>Richards. I can't say I saw her. I saw her hand come from my pocket; but can't say what she took out, for I did not know how much money I had in my pocket; her hand was clinch'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take so much as a shillings from you?</p>
               <p>Richards. I know it was something above a shillings. I can swear I lost that. Then I went out and call'd the watchman, and he came. I went back with him to the door, which I found lock'd. I put my foot against it, and broke it open; there sat the 2 prisoners. I gave the watchman charge of them, he took them into custody, and they were sent to the compter. The next morning they were carried before my Lord-mayor, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Richards. No, they pretended over-night that I had cut off their capuchines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them to go with you, or did they ask you ?</p>
               <p>Richards. I believe we were all consenting.</p>

            . I am constable. About 2 o'clock that Monday morning the watchman came to me, and said there was a man rob'd. I went and found the prosecutor. He charged me with the 2 prisoners, and they charged him; and I went with him to his house in Salisbury-court, where he took out his key and unlock'd the door; so I let him go to bed on his appearing in the morning.</p>

            . I live with my father in Brook-street, Ratcliff; he is a labouring man in a rope ground; my mother is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at service?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Currell. About a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any acquaintance with him?</p>
               <p>Currell. No further than taking milk of him: he <rs id="t17710220-14-deflabel82" type="occupation">served the neighbours with milk</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17710220-14-defend178 t17710220-14-deflabel82"></join>. I know him no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he offered you the injury?</p>
               <p>Currell. I forget the day of the month; my father can tell, I cannot: it was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it ago?</p>
               <p>Currell. It is going on a month. I had known him a fortnight before this happened. I live in Brook-street. About twelve at noon I was going from Brook-street to Norton-Falgate work-house. I met the prisoner upon the road a going from Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an open road?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, not up the road; none along the road. I met him in the road talking to another man. He turn'd round and saw me, and said, How do you do young woman, how do you do, my dear? he asked me, where I was going; I said, to Norton Falgate: he made his obeisance to the man, and the man to him, and they parted; and he made up to me directly. He asked me again where I was going to; I said, to Norton Falgate work-house: he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200014"></xptr> said he was going past there, and he would shew me the way: I had said I did not know the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him so?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; I never was there before in my life. I said I was obliged to him: When I came to Whitechapel, there was a turning on the right hand, that was the turning my father bid me turn down. He said that was not the right way, he knew a nearer way, and he would shew me. I told him I was obliged to him; I went with him; he took me from house to house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he carried you to first? Had you been into any house before this?</p>
               <p>Currell. He asked me coming up the road to drink, and said he was cold; I said I would rather not: he at last persuaded me to go to a house, and have a pint of two-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. At the King of Prussia, up the road, from Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any other house before you came into this turning?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I walked a good way; I did not know the houses we went into afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went into the second house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it pretty late in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sign?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you there?</p>
               <p>Currell. A pint of two-penny; and then we went out and walked on a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the road, or how?</p>
               <p>Currell. Through roads, streets and turnings; then we went into another house, he went to the bar, and called for some gin, and he drank a glass of it; then while the woman was pouring out another, he said, How do you do, madam? She looked at him. and said, How do you do again? He then asked me to have some, I would not, I went out; he also asked the woman to drink, she said no, she had rather not, and poured it back again; then he took up his money; we went in at one door, and out at another.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where that house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No; he crossed a street, and went down another turning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it by this time?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been walking with him?</p>
               <p>Currell. From the other house to this I believe about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been in walking from Brook-street to the first house?</p>
               <p>Currell. About half an hour; not quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. About an hour and a half in all?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Currell. Then we kept walking along; he went into another house, and had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cannot tell; then we walked a good way further. I was taken very sick as I walked, all at once: he asked what was the matter with me. I said I was taken very sick: I said I had sat up on Monday night all night, to give my father a sweat, and being without victuals all night and all day made me sick. He said, he should come to a house where he was known, and would get something warm: then we came to a publick-house. I did not know the publick-house; there he had something to drink. I did not touch it: I was very sick: I puked in a corner of the house: the maid of the house brought me a little piece of beef-stake upon a piece of bread, and prayed me to eat it. I pulled off my hat and laid it on the table; the maid took it backwards. I said, Where is my hat, when I came to. She said, she had carried it into the kitchen: she fetched it to me, and asked me to go backwards into the kitchen. I said, I could not stay. Clark said, We must go. We stayed sometime in that house. I cannot tell rightly how long we staid; I fancy full two hours and a half: then we went out again and walked a good way, till we came to an old broken house where we went in; he went first, as he did all along; I followed him and thought it a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know now where it is?</p>
               <p>Currell. No: I thought it was a thoroughfare; when he went in he said, Come along; then he turned himself round, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200015"></xptr> put one hand round my waist, with the other hand he flung off my hat, and flung me down with main force among the bricks and stones and nastiness, and flung himself on me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was almost dusk; I was crying out Lord have mercy on me! Christ have mercy on me! I am ruined! He said, in the mean time. Humph! G - d d - n me, is there no entering into your body. Still I kept crying out, Lord have mercy on me, Christ have mercy on me! I am ruined! nobody came to my assistance. He put up; then I got up and stood at a broken place like a window, till I came to.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by, till you came to?</p>
               <p>Currell. I was in such pain and agony I did not know how to come to. I went with him down a road and up a street to a house in a court: there was a woman there said, how do you do Mr. Clark? he said, Mrs. Clark how do you do and your husband? she said, he was indifferent but was not come home. He said, will you take care of this young woman for all night? she said yes she would.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite dark by this time?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was between seven and eight; it wa s quite dark: afterwards he said good night; I made answer in my fright, pray are not you a coming in again? he said, no; you will know where to find me in the morning. I said, how shall I know where to find you? he said, very well: he bid me and Mrs. Clark good night; and went out; and they had some potatoes and butter and milk; they asked me to eat. I said I was obliged to her I could not touch any thing; she put two potatoes in the fire, and asked me to eat them. I said I could not. She said she would make me some toast and butter if I could eat it; I told her I could touch nothing: she asked me afterwards if I would go to bed? I told her no: then she asked me again, I said in a minute or two; in the mean time I sat see-sawing in the chair in great agony, wringing my hands, and stamping my feet, and crying. I told her in the morning how I had been used; she said she durst say nothing on account of her husband: then I went to bed, I fancy between nine and ten o'clock. About three in the morning I mentioned it to her; I was ashamed to mention it before her father and her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not mention her father and husband before.</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, I did. About three o'clock her husband, her children and father were fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the husband and wife lie in the same bed?</p>
               <p>Currell. No; I lay with the wife. I told her how I had been used in every shape. I cried; the woman said he had been a great blackguard, for if it had been her own husband she would not have took his part. Between seven and eight in the morning I got up and came to my cousin's at Norton Falgate workhouse, where I had been going on Wednesday morning. My cousin came with me to this woman's house where I was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. In Duke's Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your cousin's name?</p>
               <p>Currell. Currell. She and I went to Mrs. Beslington's brouse. She lives in Webb's Court. She desired us to go to this woman's to enquire after this man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is Webb's Court to where this Mrs. Clark lives?</p>
               <p>Currell. About a quarter of a mile. She did not go with us; she was dressing her husband's dinner. We were to go to Clark's to enquire the character of the prisoner; when we came there my cousin said, How do you do ma'm? she asked in what form I was brought in? whether I was in liquor? she said no; I was over-frightened; for I had been used very ill. My cousin asked her is he was a single or married man? she said a married man; and had a wife and three or four children. My cousin asked where he lived? she said somewhere about Whitechapel, she did not know where. This woman told my cousin how I see-sawed in the chair, wrung my hands, stamped my feet, and cried. She told my cousin when she went to bed to me the bed shook under me, and she never saw a poor creature tremble as I did. I told her in the mean time what I had lost in endeavouring to get from him. I lost a double flounced silk handkerchief, a silk and cotton handkerchief, and a pair of gloves; then my cousin went home and went to her sister's; this man had been to this Mrs. Clark's to enquire after me about ten o'clock that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200016"></xptr> morning; this was Tuesday night; he came, as I was informed, on Wednesday morning; he said he would go to the publick house facing the workhouse, and see if he could see me, when he went to my father's; my cousin said she would go to him to know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>
               <p>Currell. To know what he meant by taking me out of my road.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it not to know if he would make you any satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; we did not see him; then we went back to my cousin's house; he went to my father's, and said he wanted to make me amends to marry me. My father asked him what terms he came upon, and what he meant? he said he wanted to marry me and make me amends. Then my father said I do not know what you mean by making amends; what have you done to my child? my father did not know but what he had killed me. My cousin sent him a letter on Wednesday night. He had it on Thursday in the evening. My father was so lame he could not come to me; he sent a neighbour that lives opposite us; she was coming to Whitechapel; she came to my cousin's and told me I could not tell her more than she had heard; he had told all over the place how he had been with me. My father said, if you have done my child any harm how can you make her amends when you have a wife and three or four children? He came to my father's several times with two or three friends. He could not rest till he saw me. I saw my father on Thursday when I came home.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell your father what had happened to you?</p>
               <p>Currell. No. The woman told my father. I was ashamed to tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to your father?</p>
               <p>Currell. This was on Tuesday. He came on Wednesday morning about ten o'clock; he kept coming all the day. He came on Wednesday and Thursday till he did see me. A neighbour went with my cousin and me the second time: when we came she told the very same how I had been ill used in every shape. The prisoner was in my father's house when I came home; which was on Thursday night; I came home with this neighbour, Mrs. Bevington. I found the prisoner at my father's. I was low spirited. I fell a crying. I went into a neighbour's house to endeavour to see my father: before I came in I was informed the prisoner was in my father's house. I did not like to see him for his ill usage to me. I staid a little in the neighbour's house. I went into my father's house; he was a coming in. I went and kissed my father and fell a crying immediately. The prisoner said, Don't cry my dear; I will marry you and make you amends; do not take on. I said, how can you marry me when you have a wife and three or four children? a man with him said, before God he has no wife or chick or child; he is no more married than I am married. This man and he went away; he came next morning; but before he came he sent a letter to me, appointing to meet at the Black boy at Stepney. I said, where is he? why don't he come himself? what does he mean by sending his letters to me? why don't he come to my father? the man made answer again and said, he is somewhere about the neighbourhood, he is not far off; one of my brothers came in in the mean time; the man that brought the letter said, we two will go and see for him; he is not far off: while they were gone to seek for him

             came in. My father was gone to Shadwell. He sat till the officer came and said to me he wanted to speak a word or two a-side. I was against it; but however Mrs. Wetherall said, you may hear what he has to say; just go into my house: she said it is a town talk already; you need not make it more public. I went into the house, and he went with me; her house joined to my father's: when he went in he said, Well; I hope you will not be hard hearted; I hope you will make it up; and said, I am very sorry that I have ill used you so bad as I have. I said, you have been very cruel to me; and used me in a very bad manner: he could not deny it. I said, every thing you have done, you have done by main force, and all against my will. He could not deny it; all his cry was, he would marry me and make me amends. The officer came and took him; he was not in the house above three minutes before the officer came. They went into a public house. While he was there, he ask'd my father to make it up. My father said, it was out of his power, as he had been before the justice. We went to the justice on Thursday night, and had a warrant granted to take him. The officer went after him that night, but could not find him. He took him on Friday morning: he put his hands together, and told the justice he never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200017"></xptr> had chick nor child: he was sent to prison, and this Clark, where I laid all night, was sent for by the justice; she told the justice the same thing as she told my cousin: the justice asked her twice whether I was not in liquor when I was brought in: she said, no. The justice asked why I did not come home. I told him I was in such a pickle that I was ashamed to come home.</p>

               <p>Currell. It may be a mile from Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out whether the man is married?</p>
               <p>Currell. His wife and four children came down to my father's.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not been married, I suppose you would have accepted of that satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Currell. I should not, because of his ill usage.</p>

               <p>Currell. No, nothing but two or three dishes of tea in the morning: I had not had a bit of bread in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pints of beer did you drink part of?</p>
               <p>Currell. About three pints of two-penny, and one pint of beer: there were two publick-houses I did not taste any at.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you used to drink two-penny?</p>
               <p>Currell. I am not used to drink at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what was the matter with you when you turned so sick?</p>
               <p>Currell. I thought being without victuals, and drinking a little two-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, when you sat out, did not you, how far it was from Stepney to Norton-Falgate work-house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew your cousin lived there?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, but did not know the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they tell you how far it was?</p>
               <p>Currell. They told me which turning to turn down.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked for a long while before you got into the second public-house?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you begin to doubt whether he was carrying you the right way?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had not the least suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Not till you got to that ruinous house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had not the least suspicion even then.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave to you upon the road; did he offer you no civilities?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, he did not even brush my cloaths: he only said. Come along, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never kiss you?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, he did not offer to touch me.</p>
               <p>Q. I wonder you should go with a man you knew so little of, to so many public-houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. I did not know that he had any wicked thoughts any more than I had. I did not think but he was going to carry me right.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out where this house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other houses near this house?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was a lone house. After I came out of it there were some white rails on the left-hand side, that is all I can tell of it: it was in a sort of a road.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you suppose that was a thorough-fare, an old ruinous house on a road.</p>
               <p>Currell. I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the truth of the matter this, that this beer had got into your head?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot think that a modest young girl would have gone about with this man if she was sober. I should think this beer had got into your head?</p>
               <p>Currell. I don't remember it did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have forgot. Have you found out any of these houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, I found out one; the Barking Dogs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the people here?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not subpoena'd Mrs. Clark?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Basington here?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Wetheral, who is she?</p>
               <p>Currell. The woman that fetched me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. I did not press her to give any particular account of her usage till I heard the general out-lines of her story. If you chuse it I will now ask her as to the particular part.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200018"></xptr>Q. from Jury. You say he went first all the way, you followed him?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this old house from Mrs. Clark's?</p>
               <p>Currell. We were about half an hour going there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get there?</p>
               <p>Currell. He turned round and asked me to lay hold of his arm. I said, I was greatly obliged to him: I did take hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know this Mrs. Clark before?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it a little extraordinary to be left in the house of Mrs. Clark, a woman you never saw before, all night?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him if he was coming back again?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had not had a wife and children, would not you have married him?</p>
               <p>Currell. I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nobody pass nor repass, in the course of the time you went from this ruinous house, to Mrs. Clark's?</p>
               <p>Currell. I recollect there were two or three women walking along that called, and said, I should lose something: my white handkerchief was unpinned. I took and pinned it: they said, I should loose something that was hanging behind me, so I pinned my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you he was going to after he brought you out of this ruinous house?</p>
               <p>Currell. He said nothing to me. I thought he was going to my cousin at Norton-Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to agree to stay at Mrs. Clark's that night; you did not know but you might be used ill by this man again, if he came back?</p>

               <p>Currell. I was not capable of walking any where, I was in such pain and agony, and my cloaths were so black and dirty.</p>
               <p>Court. This was night you know: had you any money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had but one six-pence in the last public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do you any injury?</p>
               <p>Currell. He took up my petticoats. When he was forcing me against my will he cried, humbh.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is meant by carnally knowing a woman?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You must. let me know what he did to you; you say he forced you against your will: how and in what manner. Did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, a minute or two after he had spoke those words.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been served in this manner by any other man?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever examined after this by any surgeon, or any woman?</p>
               <p>Currell. My cousin Besington saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider what you are swearing: I very much doubt whether you was quite sober. Are you able to swear he entered your body?</p>
               <p>Currell. That I am very sensible of.</p>
               <p>Q. What resistance did you make?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cried, Lord have mercy on me, am ruined, and Christ have mercy on me; ruined. I did endeavour to get from him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hands were at liberty, wy not?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, and I endeavoured with him off, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your cousin Currell?</p>
               <p>Currell. In the work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was she not here?</p>
               <p>Currell. I did not know she would be wanted.</p>

I sent a letter to her father, in which I desired him to come to me and I would let him know particulars: he could not come, so he sent a neighbour next day. He did not receive the letter till the next day. It was sent by the penny post. I went with them to Mrs. Clark's house: I asked her whether she was in liquor, and how she behaved. Mrs. Clark said, No, She was frightened; that she trembled and wrung her hards, and shook so, that she was sorry to see her, and that when she went to bed the bed shook under her. I asked her if she had told her how things were. She said, Not till she went to bed. Then she told her the prisoner had used her very ill: shsaid she was as cold as death.</p>

He said he was in liquor, and she was in liquor, and he could not tell whether he had done any thing to her or not; but he would shew her where her sister was, for he had left her in Duke's Court, at one Mrs. Clark's. He came to the father, and all his cry was, Father, where is your daughter? Her father said, he could nor tell, he ought to know best. I went to the house, and found her in a striped bed-gown, wringing her hands, and walking about the room. The woman was making the bed. This was on Thursday. On Friday he was taken up. He came to the father's house about nine o'clock: he was talking about marrying her, and sat down close by her; she said she could not consent, because he had used her so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only objection?</p>
               <p>Wetherall. Yes, the only one that I know of; and not only so, but she heard he had a wife and children. He wanted to speak with her: she went to the entry with him. I went into our house with her; he would say nothing while I was there. I went up stairs: she said to him, You know you have used me very cruelly, and I did not consent till the last minute, nor that minute neither.</p>

She said she would treat me with another pint of beer there; we had another pint of beer there. I said, that was Norton Falgate. She said she would follow me, and go along with me. She followed me; I could not get rid of her; she laid hold of me, and put her hand in my breeches; and she followed me at night again: there I left her. She would follow me at every place. As to using her ill, I did not.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Sodoway's, the Barking Dogs, in Tabernacle Walk, Moorfields. The prisoner and this girl came into our house together; they went into the back parlour. The woman was very fond of the man; she put her hand in his right bosom, and after that she asked for a lodgin g. We told her we had none. She fell asleep, and hit her head two or three times. The prisoner jostled her, to awake her. I said, he would make her sick. He said, No, he wanted her to get up, to go with her friends.</p>

            . The prisoner and the prosecutor this day month came into the Angel at Hoxton, and called for a pint of beer. The woman fell into a sit; when she came to, she called for her husband; she offered me a shilling for a bed: she got one hand round his neck, the other in his breeches. She was very much in liquor; he told the woman that he had a wife and four children.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to the prisoner. He brought this woman to my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening; she was very much in liquor. She seem'd to be very fond of him. When he came in he held the door in his hand; she wanted him to sit down; he went away. She went to bed about seven o'clock; she fell asleep while she was eating. She slept all night, from seven o'clock till seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she awake you at three o'clock, and tell you how she had been used by this man?</p>

               <p>Clark. No, not a word. She said in the morning she had an aunt at Norton Falgate workhouse that she went to see. She told me that she had a great regard for Clark, and that her father had given her a holiday, and she chose to spend it in his company. She said she had a great liking to him, on account of his crying milk so prettily. About three o'clock in the afternoon a woman came with her that she called her aunt; her aunt told me more than she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell her aunt that she was very sober when she came to your house?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say she was very much frightened?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, she told me next morning that she was more frightened than in liquor; but I did not tell her aunt so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her aunt that as soon as your husband and father were asleep, she told you how she had been used?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not. They came and brought some purl.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not make you in liquor, did they?</p>
               <p>Clark. Very nigh; I believe I might drink almost a pot of purl to myself.</p>

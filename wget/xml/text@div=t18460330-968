                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Richard Croggon, of Cottage-green, Camberwell. The prisoner has been in my service seven weeks—on the 26th of March I missed a brooch, a locket, and a ring, from my looking-glass drawer—I did not miss it till my daughter did—I knew it was there, because she kept it there—that was where I expected it to be—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she said she had seen it there some days before; she did not know where it was—I proceeded to search her box—she was present, and took the things out herself—it was not locked—I found a variety of articles in it—I found a child's spencer, and a shawl pinned up is the sleeves of her dress—they were all my husband's property—the prisoner said she picked them up in the dust-hole—they certainly would not have found their way to the dust-hole unless she put them there—I proposed to her to undress—she resisted—Mr. Croggon said he would send for a policeman—she then undressed in my presence, and I found round her waist a small worsted comforter, which was stuffed full of different articles—there were some muslin collars and a small silk handkerchief—she said she found them in the dust-hole—a policeman was sent for, and she was given into custody—I know these articles—they were found about her person and in her box—this brooch, gilt chain, silver thimble, and pen-knife, are the property of Mr. Croggon.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 19th of February, I was there, and was the last person up, and saw that the house was fastened up carefully. About seven o'clock next morning the servants, White, and Bye, called me up; I examined the premises and found somebody must have got down the grating where the coals are let into the cellar; it was lifted up - they had then got into the cellar, and cut away the wood work of the kitchen door, and undone the bolt; they had undone the kitchen window, and got out that way. I missed a table clock from the parlour, two volumes of a folio Bible, two great coats, and a body coat, an umbrella, a cloak, and a table cloth - my keys were taken out of my body coat with my pocket book, and left behind on a table. I also missed a tea caddy, which had been filled with tea a day or two before, and a silver caddy spoon in it. I went to town immediately, had hand bills printed, and distributed at the pawnbrokers, and on Friday, the 21st, I had information, and went to Mr. Button's a pawnbroker, Battle-bridge, and saw my great coat and the tea-caddy, still locked, and the spoon in it. The prisoner was a servant of mine; he had left me about nine months, and had been in a situation at Ponder's-end - he lived in Edmonton; I saw him on the Thursday evening after the robbery on the top of the Edmonton coach, at the

I went home on getting to Edmonton, and had him taken into custody at his lodgings - he was searched, and four knives found upon him, and some tinder in a paper, and a file - one knife appears to fit the place in the door, where the wood is cut off; the constable fitted it. We found the feet of the stockings which he had on were muddy, as if he had been walking without shoes. I saw footsteps by the house in the morning, but did not notice them.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Houghton sent for me about eight o'clock in the morning. I saw some candle grease outside the kitchen window where the person had got out, and the print of a footmark on the flower border, which appeared to have been made by a person without a shoe; some more footmarks were on the gravel, at a greater distance from the house, these had shoemarks, and the appearance of a piece of leather having been put on at the toe, fastened on with four nails, the marks of which were visible. When I took the prisoner into custody, there was a piece of leather on his shoe with four nails - I said,</p>
               <p>"Barnes, you ought to have put the leather here the contrary way;" it corresponded in appearance with the marks on the ground, I did not fit it. I went to his lodging to enquire for him about nine o'clock that morning, but did not find him - I was in search of him all the day, and in the evening took him. I found some pieces of wood at the house, and in his lodging three knives, and one in his waistcoat pocket, with the tinder and file. I fitted the blade of the knife to the piece of wood, it appeared to correspond with the impression; a piece had been broken out at the point of the knife, and there was a notch left in the door where it did not cut, and one piece of wood has the mark of the broken part. I asked where he had been all day; he said he had been at work at Tottenham, and said nothing about coming to town on the stage. Mr. Houghton was not with me. The file was in the paper with the tinder.</p>

When I got up in the morning, I thought it was five o'clock; the moon shone so bright into the room. I tried to get work at Tottenham, but could not, and went to town, and in crossing the fields to Newington, I overtook a man, who asked me to pawn the caddy and coat for him, and said he would give me some bread and cheese, and beer, and 1 s. - he came to Battle-bridge with me; I asked what name I should pawn them in; he said Tayley, and when we had had refreshment we parted. He said he might see me at Edmonton. This man has been brought into prison since, and put into the same ward as me - I got the Governor to move me as I did not like to be with him.</p>

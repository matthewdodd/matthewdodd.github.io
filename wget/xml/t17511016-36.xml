I turned about, and laid hold on the person next to me, which was the prisoner. Mr. Torin and I were arm in arm. The prisoner seemed to be cramming the handkerchief into his breeches. I took it out of his hand. I was going to let him go; but it happening to be opposite the constable's house, he came over immediately, and took him to the Compter.</p>

            . We were just turning round the Mansion-house, arm in arm, when I found somebody busy about us; I turned round, and catched the prisoner by the collar, saying, I believed he was going to pick my pocket, being as close to me behind as he could. Mr. Harley put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief, so he also laid hold of him. I saw the handkerchief taken out of his hand; he had his hat before it.</p>

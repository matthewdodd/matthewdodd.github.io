                  </hi>. I live at Bishop Stortford, in Hertfordshire. On the Wednesday before the 20th of February I was at Epping—I stopped there at Mrs. Clarke's, at the White Lion, and had my dinner, and then came on to London—I was alone, and had a bundle with me—about nine o'clock the prisoner overtook me—he said nothing to me, but hit me on the left side of my head—he had been at the public-house—I had left him there, and had got above a mile from the public-house before he overtook me—he had not spoken to me in the public-house, nor I to him—I had stopped at another public-house before he came up, and had half-a-pint of beer; I then went on my way—when the prisoner came up, he passed me and went into a public-house—I passed that house, and he overtook me, and gave me a blow on the head—I fell into the ditch—I got up, and went and rang at a gentleman's house—he did nothing else to me, only took the bundle—I did not see his face—he had a blue coat, black trow<lb></lb>sears, low shoes, white stockings, and a paper cap—I had a gown, shawl, three pocket-handkerchiefs, and a letter, wrapped up in a buff handker<lb></lb>chief, cross-barred—I saw the prisoner running away when I was getting out of the ditch—I saw he had a paper cap when I was in the public-house—I saw him the next day at Lambeth-street, before the Magistrate; and the articles were produced to me there—I was coming to London to see my father and mother.</p>

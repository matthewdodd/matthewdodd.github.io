               <p>WILLIAM BARROW. I live in Tothill Fields, Westminster. I keep a place for slaughtering horses. I know no more of the prisoner than when he came to my place, which was on the 15th of March, he brought a brown gelding; he said he brought it from a gentleman of the name of Mardimore, a bookseller, in Bond-street, to be killed. He told me, that his master thought the horse was glandered. I examined it, and found the horse was a sound horse. I told him I should not kill it, unless I had better authority; and he told me then, that he must take it back to his master; I told him I could afford to give his master more money, than the killing would bring. He said he would not leave the horse, unless he saw it dead. I told him he should ride one of my horses up to his master's, and one of my boys should go with him, to know if his master would sell the horse. Accordingly while we were putting a bridle on another horse, the prisoner rode out of the yard with his horse. My lad went with him, but he ran off. The horse was brought back by my son to my yard, in a quarter of an hour afterwards. The prisoner did not come back with him; it is the same gelding; Nightingale has seen him this morning again, over the way. I saw the prisoner at Dyson's the next time, in Park-lane. It was on the next day after the horse was brought back by my son. He con-confessed about it in Mr. Dyson's stable; he confessed he stole it from his old master, Sir

            . I am the son of the last witness; I remember the prisoner coming to our place with the horse; it was a brown gelding. I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030016"></xptr>him say he brought it to be killed, from a bookseller in Bond-street; he said it belonged to a gentleman of the name of Mardimore; my father would not slaughter it for him. When I overtook him, it was in the Broad-way, Westminster; he wanted me to ride on first, or his master would be gone to the city, and my horse could go the fastest. I did not ride on, but staid with him. I rode with him until we came to Dartmouth-street, Westminster. He then jumpped off his horse, and told me to take it back to our yard, and tie it up. He said he would walk up himself; for if he took the horse up, he should get into s piece of work. I took the horse back to our yard and tied him up, and left him there. After that I rode to Bond-street, and could find no such person as he stated was there. I enquired for the name of Mardimore, but could no where hear any thing of any person of that name. The prisoner had said it was No. 35. I don't exactly knew when he was taken up; he is the same man I am sure.</p>

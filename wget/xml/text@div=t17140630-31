Another, That he was at a distance, and saw the Deceas'd parrying with his Cane against the Prisoner's Sword, who was pushing at him; and then he drew, and after some Thrusts fell down, and the Prisoner thrust once or twice as he lay; and that he got up again, and they fought till the Deaceas'd was disabled by a Wound in his Sword-wrist. There was another who swore the Prisoner thrust the Deceas'd whilst he was down. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That having found how ungentlemanlike the Deceas'd had us'd himin the Commissaries Office, and meeting him immediately in the Parade, ask'd him if he had a Commission in Stanhope's Regiment, he bid him come along with him, and he should see it; and that accordingly he went with him near the end of the <placeName id="t17140630-31-crimeloc164">Mall</placeName>

He had several Witnesses who swore, That they saw him go up to the deceas'd in a very civil Manner, and that they walk'd together till the Prisoner receiv'd a Blow upon the Head, and then  they both drew, but could not tell which drew first. A Gentleman swore, That he saw the Action, and the Deceas'd fell, but that he was up again immediately, and receiv'd no Wound when he was down, and he believ'd he receiv'd the Wound in his Back by turning round to get away; the Prisoner then making so full a thrust at him, that if he had not turn'd, he had run him through the Body.

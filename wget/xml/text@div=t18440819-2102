                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Robt. Garrard and two partners. The prisoner was their journeyman—I had occasionally missed some cuttings—on Tuesday evening, July 30th, I marked some cuttings with a sort of notch, and weighed them—the next morning I received information from Stedman about half-past seven o'clock—I then weighed them again, and missed loz. and 10dwts.—it was the prisoner's business to leave the premises to go to break<lb></lb>fast at half-past eight o'clock—I placed myself in the hall, but he did not come down till ten minutes to nine—he then came running down with a hurried step, and as he got to the door—I said, "Hodges, you must come back; you have been in my weighing-room this morning"—he said "I have not"—I said, "You have got property of your employers"—he said, "I have not"—he appeared agitated, down went his hand, and down went the silver on the stone floor—I saw it fall at his feet—I took it up and showed it to him—it has the mark that I put on it the night before—this is it—it does not pre<lb></lb>cisely correspond with the weight I missed.</p>

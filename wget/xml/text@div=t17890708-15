               <p>I am Surveyor to the Chelsea waterworks Company.</p>
               <p>How do you make it appear that these are a Company? - They are a body corporate; they are known by repute, to be the Governor and Co. of the Chelsea waterworks; this lead was lost on the 10th of June, I was sent for and informed the two prisoners were in custody for stealing of lead; I never saw them till I saw them at the Public office. I first saw the lead at St. George's work-house, it had a day or two before been taken off some iron railling that I had surveyed, which was round a bason in <placeName id="t17890708-15-crimeloc75">Hyde park</placeName>

               <p>When you last saw it, was it separated from the railing or not? - It was quite separate from the railing; taken and put in a stable. I believe I saw it the day before; I did not see it on the prisoner; I can safely swear it belongs to the Chelsea water works, it was cut off in a particular manner; there is no particular stamp, I should have known it at York.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square; the corner of Park-street; I stopped the prisoner Delany, at half past four in the morning, on the 10th of June; I perceived him coming from the top of Park-lane, which is a very little distance from where the lead was brought, very near the stables, he had it on his back, he did not perceive me, I let him come up to me, I was standing against a post, then I crossed and met him; I said, my friend, you are heavy loaded; yes, said he; says I, what have you there? he said it was immaterial, it did not signify; says I, it does signify to me, I insist on stopping you; he seemed very much agitated; he said if I would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080023"></xptr>back with him, he would convince me, that such a gentleman gave it him: meaning Mr. Bonniface, collector of the water tax; then again he deviated from that, and mentioned the turn-cock, whose name is Waddingham; I took him to the watch-house, and fetched the other prisoner from his master's house, the Collector's house; I understood he was a hired servant, there was no lead upon him, but I saw it in the stable, I offered to serve Delany the prisoner, to go to any friend to assist him, in my power; by that, he desired me to go into the Park, to stand against the rails, and to call John the Trunk-man; I thought this person might be an accomplice; I went into the Park, it was early between four and five in the morning; I saw a gentleman fishing at the bason, and I enquired for John the Trunk-man; I received intelligence of him. I called, he did not answer; presently I saw the stable door open, and he was sweeping the stable, this was about a quarter of an hour after I took the lead from the other prisoner; I called him by the name of John the Trunkman; he answered by that name. I am upon my oath, and I trust I know what the nature of an oath is. Mr. Bonniface lives in the house, the prisoner did not acknowledge he was a servant of his; I cannot say I ever saw him act as such.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is Lilley a house-keeper? - Yes, he is; I asked Lilley to come with me to the watch house, he went then, when I was shewing him down stairs to Delany, and coming to the place where he was generally confined, he drew back, and said you want to lock me up; Delany called me up, I cannot recollect the conversation; but he said before the watch-house keeper, he gave me leave to take a little bit; upon that the watch-house keeper thought fit to lock him up; Mr. Bonniface asked the prisoners how they could do such a thing; and they said it was the first time, and they hoped he would forgive them.</p>
               <p>Had you offered them any favour? - No, none, he only said, they must take the course of Justice.</p>

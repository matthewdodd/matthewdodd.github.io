             sworn. On the 8th of February, near one o'clock in the day, I was standing at my parlour window, I saw the prisoner look to and fro, and then she walked into the yard, the gown and table-cloth hung on a line in the yard, she unpinned them, and then left the yard without taking any thing; in about two minutes she returned back again into the yard; the first thing that she took out was the table-cloth, which she put into the front of her gown, she then knocked at the street-door, I supposed the street-door to be opened, by a boy that I saw come out: she went into the passage again, took the counterpane from the line, and in the passage she put it into her gown, upon which she came out and went towards Pye-street; I instantly gave the alarm to the prosecutrix, and then I followed her to her lodgings, where she went, and after denying it strongly a great while, she offered them to me; an officer was sent for, to whom she delivered the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Record Office, and live at 11, Rochester Terrace—on Saturday night, 10th July, all my doors and win<lb></lb>dows were safe at 10.30—I was called up at about 4.15 by the police, and found the house in disorder—some articles of plate had been removed from their position—this cruet-stand, toast-rack, and other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they were prepared to be taken away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). About 2.30 on Sunday morning, 11th July, I was with Denton, in Rochester Row, and stopped the three prisoners—I asked where they were going—they said that they had been to Hounslow, across the fields—there had been a heavy dew, and I looked at their boots and found them perfectly dry—I found this knife in Dawes pocket, and took him in custody—I went out, made inquiries, and found that Mr. Fenwick's house had been broken into; the coal-cellar flap was wrenched open, and the bolt lying in the garden—the inner kitchen door was found open, and the socket broken, and part of the wall broken away—the sideboard was wrenched open, and articles of plate were lying in front of it—a pair of sugar tongs in the cupboard were bent straight—the con<lb></lb>tents of a box of wearing apparel, down stairs, were scattered about the kitchen—an old pair of boots were upon the floor, which I took to the station, and said, "Whose boots are these?"—Dawes said, "Give them to me, they are mine"—the boots he had on, Mr. Fenwick identified—Payne was wearing thin coat over his own; the prosecutor identified it, and I made him take it off—I found this piece of silver in his pocket, and this white handled knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pearce's Defence.</hi> I saw the cellar flap open, and found this coat with a piece of silver in the pocket. We met the sergeant, who said, "What have you got about you?" I said, "Nothing that I am ashamed of," and he took me to the station.</p>

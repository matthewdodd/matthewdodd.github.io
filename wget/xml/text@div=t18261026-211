            . I am an officer. On the 7th of October, between-nine and ten o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street; I saw the two prisoners together - Gawthorne said to Smith, "To-morrow, mind; ten o'clock;" I said to Gawthorne, "What have you got there?" he said,"Some leather" - I asked him where he got it; he said, from Mr. Allen, of Green-arbour-court, Old Bailey, and that Mr. Armstrong had given him 30s. to fetch it and pay for it - I said, "You are not fetching it for yourself;" he said, No. I brought him to Giltspur-street.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. George Waite, a currier, of No. 16, Gray's-inn-lane. This is the same leather I saw at the examination, but I have seen so many pieces, I should not like to swear to them - I did swear to this piece, but there is no mark upon it; there was a piece of cordovan missing like this, but all shoulders are alike; I said this piece was my master's property, but I had no more reason for knowing it then than I have now - I have seen so many pieces like it since, that it makes me doubtful. Here is a mark on those other six pieces; I have no doubt but they were my master's; but the same person who marked these works for other shops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say in your deposition, "One of these seven pieces of leather, being a neck of cordovan, I saw on my master's premises, and I know it to be his property, and form the marks on the other pieces, I believe them to be his property" - what is your belief now? A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have stated that you swore to one piece of leather; is there your master's mark on it? A. No, my master never marks leather - here is the tanner's mark on it; there was a finger-mark on this piece which I swore to, but it is not here now - I only believe them to be his, and cannot say they have not been sold.</p>

            . I believe these seven pieces of leather to be mine; I have no doubt of it - I cannot say I never sold them, but I believe not. The prisoner was my apprentice, and had access to it (looking at his deposition) - I swore positively to them before the Magistrate, as that was my impression; there are marks on it made by a person who is now dead.</p>

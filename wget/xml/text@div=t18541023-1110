                  </hi>. I live in Coleman-street, Camberwell On 22nd Sept, I was passing over London-bridge, about 7 o'clock in the evening—there was a crowd there—I had a watch in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I had seen it last when I was in Wood-street, Cheapside, about ten minutes before—it was attached to a silver chain round my neck—I went into a crowd, and felt a pull at my watch; I put my hand down, and caught hold of the prisoner's wrist at my pocket—the chain was not injured—the watch had gone out—I caught his wrist, and he put his hand behind him with something—there were three or four young men behind him, about his own age—I seized him by the collar, called a policeman, and said to him, "He has got my watch"—the prisoner said, "No, I have not."</p>

On Saturday evening, 22nd Sept., a little after 7 o'clock, I was on London-bridge and saw a crowd—I stopped, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting his hand behind him—I heard him say twice, "There! there!"—I could not see what was in his hand.</p>

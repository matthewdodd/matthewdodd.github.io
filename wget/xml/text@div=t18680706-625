                  </hi>. I am one of the Sanitary Inspectors of the City of London—I was formerly a butcher—I have a knowledge of animals—it is part of my duty to visit Newgate Market—Mr. Fisher, the collector and inspector, is also engaged in a similar duty—on the morning of 6th May last, ray attention was drawn to two hampers outside the shop of Mr. Coward,</p>

               <p>a meat salesman, in Newgate Market—they were not then unpacked—they were the ordinary hampers used for sending meat by railway—the legs were protruding from the hampers—that drew my attention to them, and I had them taken into the shop and opened—the meat was in a very wet and inflamed state, very bad indeed—the wetness indicates disease—the inflammation was obvious—I took the label off one of the hampers, and produce it—the other hamper had a similar label; I have not got that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the hampers were opened, who were present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The defendant was present, one of Mr. Coward's men, and Mr. Fisher—Mr. Coward's man took two hind quarters of beef out of one of the hampers—there were four in each—in the first were four quarters of a cow that had died, or nearly so, from calving—I am able to tell the cause of death, espe<lb></lb>cially in a case of parturition, where the animal is so inflamed in the hind quarters—the beef was very much inflamed and wet, and totally unfit for human food, all four quarters—the second hamper likewise contained four quarters of a cow that had died, or nearly so, from calving—it had the same appearances, and was also unfit for human food—in animals dying so, the inflammation always exhibits itself more in the hind quarters; still the whole system was inflamed—that state of inflammation would exhibit itself the moment the animal was opened and dressed in the usual way that butchers dress theirs—it would be obvious to anyone the instant it was opened, even to persons not acquainted with the trade—cows of that description are usually poor, these were not unusually so—in answer to a remark made to the defendant by Mr. Fisher, he said, "I must have been drunk when I bought them"—he subsequently told me he had purchased one of Mr. Thomas Reeve, at Leighton Buzzard, and the other of Mr. William Claridge, of the same place, both butchers, that he had given 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the other—I have known the defendant for thirteen years—he has been a dealer in calves during that time in the market—he buys the calves alive, and has them killed and sent to his place for sale in the dead meat market—meat consigned in the way this beef was, would be sold for human food—moreover it was dressed as and for human food—the inflamed state of the animal would cause the meat to become diseased more rapidly—I made a report to the Commissioners of Sewers, and the meat was condemned and destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time in the morning was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between 6 and 7—I believe the hampers had just been delivered I should think; they had not been opened or interfered with in any way, the top of the hamper was raised sufficiently for me to see the legs; it was not covered</p>

               <p>with straw—I have always known the defendant as a respectable dealer in the market; I have nothing at all to say against him—I hare known meat sent up, examined by the salesman, and then found to be unfit for food; it does not necessarily follow that because it is sent the salesman will sell it, he exercises his judgment upon it—if he finds it is not in a proper condition a respectable man would not sell it—I have never known it sold as cat's meat; he would inform the inspector that he had meat of a doubtful cha<lb></lb>racter, and if bad ho would take it away and it would be destroyed; car<lb></lb>bonic acid is put upon it to prevent its being used in any way—for aught I know that course might hare been taken in this case, or it might have been made into sausages, if it had escaped me—I have had a good deal of ex<lb></lb>perience in dead meat, not much in cow-calwing—I have heard that one of the witnesses in this case has stated that he killed the cow to save its life; I believe that to have been the case; that is, it would have died if it had not been killed—that would make no difference in the meat, in the state in which these cows were—I could tell by the carcase how the animal must have suffered previous to its death—in my opinion the meat must have been unfit when it started—I have never examined a cow that has died from calv<lb></lb>ing, I only speak from an inspection of the meat in the market—it does make a difference in the appearance of the flesh whether the cow has been killed while in the process of calving, or whether it is allowed to die naturally, it depends upon how near death the throat is out, it is a question of degree—I have often been sent for by salesmen to inspect neat to see whether it was fit, and I have frequently passed it as being fit—salesmen do not like to run any risk, and they often send to us when there is really no necessity—if the defendant had sent to me to look at this I should have con<lb></lb>demned it, and reported it to the commissioners—he did not ask me to look at it; I think I ordered the hampers inside before he had the opportunity; he deals in veal, I believe this was his first transaction hi beef—I could form a judgment of what the value of these carcases would have been in the mar<lb></lb>ket, had they been healthy; they are sold without the head and offal; that makes a very trifling difference, it might perhaps, make the difference of about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one cow—all the eight quarters were unfit; they were all very bad, as bad as any I ever had—all the meat was unfit, and very bad indeed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, at Leighton Buzzard—I have been in the habit of sending meat by railway for the prisoner—on 5th May, I sent two hampers of meat for him—I know this label; I wrote "Roberts" on it—I had directions from him to consign his meat to Coward—he paid me for the carriage on 9th May—be told me the meat had been taken away, that it was seized—that was the only meat I had sent to London for him that week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Coward—I was not present when the two hampers came there—I first saw them about 4.40 in the evening—it was about 7, or a little after, when they were taken into the shop—they had not then been unpacked.</p>

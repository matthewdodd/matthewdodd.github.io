            . On the 10th of June I met Goff, Myers, and a man of the name of Jem, at the Plough, about three o'clock in the afternoon - Goff searched me, Myers was by, and I think the other man: Goff then gave me eight shillings (I am a labourer, and live at No. 6, Vickery-street, Vauxhall) - I went into King-street, which leads to St. Martin's-lane; Jem, who had gone with me, left me there, and went to the prisoner Burk, and in about ten minutes the prisoner Burk, and Jem came to me - I was waiting by myself till they returned; I asked Burk if he could let me have a dozen of half-bulls, by which I meant half-crowns; he said he would let me have them in an hour, when he was to meet me at the Bank public-house; I then went to the Plough, and about four o'clock I went to the Bank - Burk was there; he said he had got them, and called me out of the tap-room into the passage; I saw Clancey at the back of the passage, about five yards from Burk; he said to her, "Give me them out;" she put her hand into her bosom and gave him a paper parcel, which he gave me; I put it into my pocket, and gave him the eight shillings - we then went and had something to drink; Jem was in the tap-room, but he did not go into the passage - we all four drank together; Burk said, "Well, I wish you luck, when will you be this way again?" I said, "In a day or two;" I went back again on the 8th - I had seen Burk before, and made an arrangement on the 2nd of June; this transaction took place on the 10th of June - I had seen him on the 8th, I then arranged to meet him on the 10th; I met him there, and promised to meet him in a day or two - I went to the Plough, and gave the parcel to Goff in presence of Myers; they were marked, and I went away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave the parcel to Goff and Myers? A. Yes; Jem did not go before the Magistrate - he introduced me to the prisoner; I think I became acquainted with Jem in the middle of May - I had never seen him but once; Jem was in the taproom when I received this from the prisoner in the passage - I do not know whether he is here; that is not my business: I did not hear that said by a gentleman at the table - I did not notice it; I work at Mr. Law's, at Peckham - I am still employed by him, when he has it to do; I worked for Mr. Kilsby on Saturday last: Goff has known me for fifteen years - I was not to be paid any thing for this, that I know of; I expect to be paid as other witnesses - if this had not come to trial I could not expect any thing - there was no agreement; if there is any present I will take it - I shall be very well satisfied if I am paid for my loss of time; I expect something, but I have not formed any expectation what - I should be satisfied with two guineas; I do not expect to be paid for swearing - I went to this man twelve or thirteen times; Jem always went with me: the first time I saw the prisoner was on the 31st of May - I have only given evidence in a Court of Justice once before this; that was in a Mint case, four or five months ago, against Parr - a man of the name of Bill introduced me to the Mint; I did not get a halfpenny from the Mint then - I did not apply for my expences; I lost two or three days on that occasion - I cannot get my money; I suppose it does not suit - I have not applied for it; Goff employed me, and I suppose he will pay me - I have heard it is not suitable; I do not know the name of the person who told me so - I expect to be paid when other witnesses are; those twelve or thirteen days I lost were not altogether, perhaps one day in a week - this morning is the first time I attended this Court: Bill said the other job would not be paid yet a while - I had no conversation with Jem about being paid; I did work for a Mr. Hunt without making<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160082"></xptr>an agreement as to what I was to have - I sometimes get 3s. 6d. or 4s. a day: I live at No. 6, Vickery-street - I have never been in any Court except as a witness; I left Sanders-street, where I lived before, because the rent was too much.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. The first time you met the prisoner was on the 31st of May? A. Yes - Jem was with me then, and I made a purchase of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Am I to understand that you mean to swear that you did not hear Mr. Scarlett say that something in reference to Jem you had no business to answer? A. I did hear it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The expression he made use of was, that he did not notice it.</p>

            . I am acquainted with Simmons - he is a respectable young man, and works at a wharf, at loading barges; he lives some where at Lambeth - I do not know where; Goff and I applied to him for the purpose of detecting the prisoner. On the 10th of June I was at the Plough, in Carey-street; Goff and Simmons were there, and another person, who was at another part of the room when we performed the operation on Simmons, that we might satisfy the Jury that he had nothing about him more than we gave him; Goff then gave him 8s. to purchase half-crowns - he left us; I followed him, and kept sight of him till he got to King-street - he went to the door of the Bank public-house; Burk shortly after came up to him - they went into the house together, and went into the tap-room on the left hand; when they had been in some time, I went through the house; there is a passage which goes into Charles-steeet - I went into Charles-street, and waited at the corner of Lincoln's Inn-fields, which is close by, till Simmons came to me, which was in about half an hour: he said, "I have got them" - he went to the Plough, and I followed him; when he got to the Plough he produced a parcel, and Goff opened it - it contained twelve half-crowns; Simmons marked them, and Goff took them into his possession - I saw the prisoner when he was taken; it was on Thursday three weeks - I think it was on a market day in Smithfield; information was given to the Mint a fortnight or three weeks before - the warrant was obtained after this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known Simmons? A. About ten months, but never to be intimate with him: I know he was employed in Parr's case three or four months before - Parr was transported; he was convicted on the charge on which Simmons gave evidence against him - he was tried more than once: I have known Jem six or seven months - Goff introduced me to Simmons; I thought Simmons an honest man, but he was searched to satisfy the Jury - he was certainly out of my sight; I do not know that Jem was in that public-house - I did not see him; Simmons did not tell me he was there - if he had said he was there, I would have believed him: Parr was tried here and acquitted, and then taken to Horsemonger-lane and convicted - Simmons was a witness here, and on the trial on which he was convicted; I did not know where the prisoner lived - we did not take him at first, as we knew he was an extensive maker, and we wanted to go to his house and find the moulds and things, but we had lost all chance of finding his house, and so we took him; Simmons was employed by the Mint for I suppose four or five months; not in constant employ; he never received any thing to my knowledge, but in the shape of purchasing - I know he is a day-labourer; I believe he was employed but very few days - it might be eight, or ten, or twenty, for what I know, off and on, not regularly; sometimes for a few hours - I do not think he has had a farthing for his expences; I did not apply for my expences - I have not had a farthing, and do not want to have it: I have asked for my expences in these cases, but if I were to ask my Lord for my expences in these cases, I am satisfied he would not grant it - I never received any thing in my life for Mint cases; the Mint pay me - the largest sum I ever received of them for one job was 5l. or 6l., but that was a very large job; I never made a minute of it - 3s. 6d. a day is paid here, but I never know what I am to have for the Mint; it is not half enough for my trouble - the last time I gave evidence was at Horsemonger-lane: the money I have got was about 5l., that is about the outside, for my loss of time - I did not take Jem before the Magistrate; I cannot tell why - I did not know he was a notorious smasher nor that Bill was; I do not think Jem got a farthing from the Mint - I suppose they all expect to be paid.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. When you attend in Mint cases, you are paid by the Mint? A. Yes, not by the County.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MYERS. Simmons was bound over at Horsemonger-lane, but he was convicted on Rose's evidence, and Simmons was not called up.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GOFF. On the 10th of June, I met Myers, Simmons, and another, at the Plough in Carey-street - I searched Simmons, and gave him 8s.; he went away towards the Bank public-house in King-street, Drury-lane- I saw him go part of the way; I then turned back to the Plough - he returned there to me in half an hour or better, and brought me a paper parcel containing twelve half-crowns; he told me what had taken place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you give the money to? A. To Simmons - he is not a particular friend of mine; my brother was an officer at Union-hall - I had known Jem three or four years; I have not seen him for a week - I am no relation of Myers, nor connected with him; I suppose I have been connected with the Mint fifteen years - I have been paid for my time as other witnesses; I remember receiving 35s. in one case - that was a small case; I cannot tell what has been the largest sum I ever received, without I were at home to look at my book - I swear I never got 5l. without it was money laid out of my pocket; perhaps 4l. or 4l. 1s. was the largest - I do not know exactly; I was engaged a great many days, and was very much dissatisfied.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sophia-street. On the night of the 8th of Nov. I was in the Harrow public-house, at Poplar, standing by the fire—the prisoner came in with an open knife in his hand, and stabbed me in the arm, through rny jacket, and through two shirts—he went out of the house directly—a police<lb></lb>man came in—I went out with him—a young man came and said the prisoner was in the Green Dragon—I had seen the prisoner in the house an hour be<lb></lb>fore—that was the only time—there had been no quarrel.</p>

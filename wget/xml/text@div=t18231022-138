The prisoner came and asked me for some beer - I gave her some; she sat down by my hat. I saw her take the handkerchiefs out of it; I endeavonred to get them from her - she struggled, and said she would take care of them, and I should have them, so I went on drinking, and thought no more of them. I went to another house, and she followed me - Davis was in my company; I went up into his room, in Jew's-row, and she followed. I sent for half a gallon of beer, which we drank; they wanted me to send for more beer - I refused. I engaged a bed for myself, and paid 1 s. for it; she offered to stop with me, and put my breeches under the pillow. She got into bed in her clothes. I had a 5 s. piece, and 2 s. 6 d. in my purse. I fell asleep the moment I got into bed, and awoke at eleven o'clock, found her gone, and I missed my purse from my pocket. I found her that night, near Jew's-row, with one handkerchief tied round her head, and the other round her neck. She denied robbing me. I gave charge of her - she then said she had had the money, and would give it up if she was allowed. The watchman found 1 s. 1 d. on her.</p>

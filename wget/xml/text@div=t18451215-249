                  </hi>. I am a watchman, and live in Tottenbam-court-road. I was employed to take care of Mr. John Williams's houses—I was placed there on the 5th of Dec.—I saw a man come into one of the unfinished houses, and take 118lbs. of lead—I was at the back, and could see him take it—I followed him out—the prisoner was in a door-way, and he received the lead of the other man—I followed the man up, and stood on the foot-way along<lb></lb>side of them—I cried out, "Police," but they did not come for a quarter of an hour—I am sure the prisoner received it from the other man—I held the prisoner as good as ten minutes, and then he made his escape—I followed him, and he swore by his God he would knock me down if I followed him any further.</p>

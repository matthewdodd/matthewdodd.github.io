                  </hi> I am the daughter of Mary Richie, and reside at 26, Dudley-street—I have known the prisoner about two years. On 19th Feb. I was in the family way by him—on that day I had been out with him, and he accompanied me home—he wanted me to stop out all night—I said I would not, I would go home—on his leaving, he said, "Good bye, I shall not see you any more"—the next morning, Sunday, I saw him go by the window, and went down to him, and asked him for some money; and he took up a stone, and said he would dash my brains out if I did not go away—I left him and came home, and in a few minutes afterwards, he knocked at the door—I went down, and he struck me in the mouth—I ran up stairs screaming, and as I ran up he tried to pull me back—I laid hold of the banisters, and he left—he came again in about ten minutes, and stood out<lb></lb>side the door—my mother was holding the door in her hand—he said, "Send Eliza out"—she said, "I will not send her out, she is not in a fit state to be knocked about"—he said, "I know she is not, I will not knock her about"—when he found my mother would not send me out, he rushed into the room, pulled a knife out of his pocket, and said that was for the pair of us—he made several stabs at my mother—she left the room—he then tried to lock the door, and I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, do not lock the door"—I found he was deter<lb></lb>mined to lock the door, and got hold of his arms backwards, turned him</p>

               <p>round, and got the door open; and when he found I was getting out, he put the knife over his shoulder, as I stood behind him, and cut me in the fore<lb></lb>head—I was getting out of the door—he was in front of me, trying to lock the door—he used very bad language, and said he would rip my guts out—I held the door till the landlord came up, and then ran down stairs—I was afterwards taken to Charing-cross Hospital—no one was near me during the struggle with him—Mary Ann Walker was on the stairs—she went down stairs, before me, opened the door, and cried, "Murder!"—she pushed me down stairs out of the prisoner's way.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, at 25, Dudley-street. On Sunday morning, 20th Feb., the prisoner came to my shop for the loan of a knife to cut the sole of his shoe—I gave him one—he said it was not sharp enough—I gave it two or three rubs on the hone, and brought an edge to it—he went away, and said he was going to his lodging, and would come back with it in about ten minutes—I saw no more of him till I beard "Murder!" called out, and the prisoner ran out—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am sure I sharp<lb></lb>ened it—he did not do it himself.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at Charing<lb></lb>cross Hospital. Eliza Burgess was brought there on the morning of 20th Feb.—I examined her immediately—she had a wound across the small of the back, about an inch and three-quarters long, and about a quarter of an inch deep, and a wound across the upper part of the forehead two inches long, and nearly to the bone—they were not of themselves dangerous wounds—they were likely to be made with such a knife as this—they were well in three weeks.</p>

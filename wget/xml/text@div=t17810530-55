               <p>HARBIN ELDERTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I advertised a sale of thread lace, for the 10th and 11th of May, at Mr. Squibb's auction-room: on the 9th, two of my servants left the premises; the next morning, the 10th, when I went to the place between ten and eleven, the lace was all, except one little bit, gone. It was taken to Mr. Squibb's auction-room on the Monday, and there remained till it was stolen.</p>
               <p>I had seen it on the 9th. Intelligence was brought to my house in Bow Church-yard, that the auction room had been broke open, and the lace stolen; and I found that information to be true. I applied at the office in Bow-street for their assistance, to recover the goods, and apprehend the thieves. I received information from one of the persons at that office, that there were not above four of the persons, who are receivers of stolen goods, that were capable of making so large a purchase. They gave me the names of those four, and recommended to watch their houses, to see what thieves went in, and what thieves came out. In consequence of the information I received, I placed myself agreeable to the direction of those people, and watched the house of

            , alias Levy, alias Hetsey, a noted receiver of stolen goods. I was told that Saturday, being the Jews sabbath, he would not perhaps buy stolen goods; but on Sunday, it being a likely day, I placed myself and some friends in some houses in Bishopsgate-street, to watch if Levy should go by. On Sunday, exactly at half after eleven o'clock, I saw him go by: I gave a signal to my friends in the neighbourhood to watch where he went to; he was followed by myself and my friends to Newgate-street. About the middle of Newgate-street, he was met by the prisoners at the bar, and, I think, two others: (the name of one of the others was Hart:) he patted them on the back; then they turned round and went back, and he with them; they turned round Pye Corner, there I lost sight of them. I speak positively to the two prisoners meeting Levy. A servant came running to meet me from towards Cow-Cross: he said, they are housed; that was about eight minutes after I had lost sight of them; he told me to go on, and I should see Burdington. I went to Burdington, who stood in view of the house where they were housed: he said they are in that house, No. 10. There was a woman standing centry at the door. I sent another person, that was with me, to the place appointed, to Sir

In about five minutes, they called to me that my goods were all safe, and the thieves were taken. I went in. I found the lace, to my very great satisfaction, all within about 100 l. worth. I found about 200 l. worth in a two-pair-of-stairs back room: the two prisoners were there, and Levy and M'Neil's wife were in the room when I came in: the lace was upon the table when I saw it; one of my servants was putting it in the bag; it was part of what I had lost; there were marks upon it; and I have some of it here now; I have not a shadow of doubt that it is mine. I asked M'Neil whether that was all the lace that was there. I addressed myself to Ridgeley to the same effect. They both said at first, they did not know, they believed it was. So I pressed it upon them repeatedly, to let me know if there was any more that I could get, and I would not indict them capitally if I got all my lace.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was requested by Mr. Elderton to assist on the Sunday in detecting these people, and was near to him in Bishopsgate-street when Levy passed, and followed him from thence to Newgate-street, where he was joined by the two prisoners. I saw M'Neil and Ridgeley in Newgate-street, walking towards Cheapside. Levy met them; he turned back with them: they all three walked together down Newgate-street; they turned at Pye Corner: when they came near to Smithfield, M'Neil ran before; Ridgeley and Levy continued walking together after him. I lost sight of M'Neil at the further side of Smithfield, but never did of Levy and Ridgeley, at least not for two minutes together. I saw Ridgeley and Levy enter an house in Cow Cross, No. 10; there was the name Lawley on the door. I turned back as soon as I could, without causing suspicion: I sent that information to Mr. Elderton, or to Mr. Parker, and staid myself within a little distance of the house: in a short time, the people from the public office, who were but at a little distance, came, and went into the house. A woman was at the door when the officers went in.</p>

               <p>Who was that woman? - The woman that was up in the room afterwards, and passed for M'Neil's wife. I did not go in for some time, probably ten minutes: I stood without: when I did go in, the prisoners at the bar, with M'Neil's wife, were in the two-pair-of-stairs back room. The goods then had been put into the bag.</p>
               <p>Did you understand whose lodging it was? - I understood it to be M'Neil's.</p>
               <p>Did Ridgeley say any thing in your hearing? - I do not recollect what words passed.</p>

             sworn,</p>
               <p>I was one of the officers who went to take these people. When we first went into the house, we saw a woman just at the door. Jealous knew her, and she was ordered into custody, and brought up stairs. I searched her. I went up stairs; the two-pair-of-stairs door was fast; Jealous broke it open. I found M'Neil, Ridgeley, and one Lee, alias Levy, in the room; and upon the table close by the bed, there was a great quantity of lace. Breaking open the door, and we rushing in, threw it all down. After securing them, we sent for Mr. Elderton.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find the three men when you first broke open the door? - To the best of my recollection, they all stood round the table together; M'Neil nearest the bed, Ridgeley by the window, and Levy beside him. I cannot be sure. We secured them. The first question I asked M'Neil was, how long he had lived there? I think he gave me no answer to that; but he was without his coat, standing in his waistcoat, with his hat on. Ridgeley was in a black coat, to the best of my remembrance, the coat he has on now, with his hat on, and a small stick in his hand. I did not ask any more questions of M'Neil. I asked Ridgeley his name. To the best of my remembrance, he said it was Knight, or White; and said he came out of Hertfordshire. I asked him how he came there? he said he knew M'Neil; that, as he passed, M'Neil stood at the door, and asked him to come up; that was the way he came there. I asked 
               <persName id="t17810530-55-person565">

             the same question; and he told the same story. I then proceeded to search the room; but first I searched M'Neil's wife, and found some lace in her pocket; that Mr. Elderton owned. She refused to let me search her; I was obliged to be a little rude, which I do not like to be, and to force it from her. Then I asked M'Neil how his wife came by it; he said he gave it her: for that reason I left her behind me, and would not take her into custody.</p>
               <p>What more did M'Neil or Ridgeley say, while you was present? - I can't particularly recollect; I am very loth to say much to prisoners when they are in custody. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300063"></xptr> proceeded to search the room. M'Neil said, I need not give myself much trouble; I should only find some quere dubs, meaning picklock-keys. I found these (producing a large quantity of picklock-keys); here is a key (producing it) which will open the door of the room where the lace was.</p>

               <p>I was with Mr. Clark upon this occasion. I do not know any thing particularly more than he has spoken to. I saw Ridgeley standing with a cane in his hand, and his hat upon his head. M'Neil had no hat on, nor no coat.</p>
               <p>Did you know from the prisoners themselves whose lodging it was? - The landlady was sent for up, and pointed out who took it: upon which M'Neil said, it was his lodging. Ridgeley said, he had only just come up into the room. After the keys were found, I went to Mr. Squibb's auction room; the door was double-locked, and this key opened it.</p>

The Prosecutor deposed. that it being too late for the Coach, she and a Gentleman's Daughter at London went to see one Mr. Poole over the Fields from Hampstead towards London, and when they came to the bottom of Haverstock Hill, while they were taking leave of her, the Prisoner came by from London; and knowing him, she call'd to him and ask'd if he was going to Hampstead, that if he would stay a little, she was taking leave of her Friend, and would be glad of his Company; that her Friend gave her her Rings, a Guinea and a Shilling for fear she should meet with any Rogues going to London, which they look'd upon to be the most dangerous Way; having taken leave of their Friend, they came along with the Prisoner to Hampstead, and as they came along, he said he wonder'd their Friend would venture over those Fields by her self so late, for it was very dangerous; the Prosecutor reply'd that she fear'd nothing, having left her Money and Rings with her, least she should meet with any Rogues: That when they came to Hampstead he offer'd his Service to go with them to West-End, saying it was dangerous, and that his Father and Mother were robb'd there: She thank'd him, and said she would not give him so much trouble, for she had a Friend in the Town who was to go thither , so parted; that she went to one Mr. Dring's a Taylor's and staid there about half an Hour; but her Friend she expected was gone before she came; that then she went to a Chandlers Shop and staid there a little; and then <placeName id="t17191204-38-crimeloc222">going to West End</placeName>

The Gentleman's Daughter that was in Company confirm'd the same, and the prisoner acknowledged it with this Variation, viz. That it was at the prosecutor's desire that he was to call on her at Mr. Dring's to go home with her; and that meeting with Harris and Lewis, who ask'd where he was going, (and would have otherways engaged him,) he told them he was going to see the prosecutor safe home to West End, she having Mrs. Pool's Money and Rings about her; that he did not communicate it with any ill Intention, but carelesly and innocently: He called several people to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of an Honest Industrous young Man.

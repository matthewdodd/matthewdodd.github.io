I keep the British Oak, Greenwich—on 23rd October, about twelve in the day, the prisoners came in together, and a third person joined them shortly afterwards, who was discharged by the Magistrate—the prisoners sat down together for three hours, and had four or five pots of porter and half-and-half—Jackson paid me with a bad shilling—I gave him the change, and as he was going away I said, "Do you know what you have given me? have you any more of them?"—he said, "No"—I broke it in half, and gave it to him—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it in the fire, and gave me a florin—I gave him the change—he had another pot of beer, paid for it in the proper way, and they left—I followed them to a little chandler's shop, where they got a half-quartern loaf—I ultimately went to the Royal Standard public-house, and spoke to Mr. Edington.</p>

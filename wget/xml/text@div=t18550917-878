                  </hi>. I own the house, No. 7, Montague-court, Bishops-gate-street. Down to Aug. the prisoner and her husband were tenants of one room there, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—they came there as teetotalers—the hus<lb></lb>band used to send the rent down, and the prisoner used generally to pay it—they paid pretty regularly—they lived with me seven or eight weeks, but I have known them for the last four or five years—they had two children, the youngest about three years old, to the best of my opinion—her husband used to buy old clothes, and mend them, and she used to sell them—that is called <hi rend="italic">clobbering</hi>, and they could get a very good living at it: I wish I could do as well—they used to work three days in the week sometimes, and were quite the contrary of sober—the man used to work very hard—the prisoner was the chief instigator—she would come in drunk, and take him out when he was perfectly sober, and keep him out till 2 o'clock in the morning—they both got intoxicated and neglected their business—this young child, Peter, used to remain alone, and in the dark, just as it came into the world, with nothing but a lock of straw; it was so three weeks before I gave them</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at No. 1, Montague-court. I have known the Henesseys nine or ten years, and have known them at that house passing in and out—on the day before they were taken, the last witness came and told me something about the little boy, and I went to the room, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening—the parents had been out ever since 7 o'clock in the morning—I went up to the top of the house, and found the child in a corner, on some loose straw, with a piece of a filthy rug over it—Mr. M'Donald lifted the child up, and it was all sores, and the straw sticking into the sores—it was a skeleton—there was no furniture or food in the room, not even a drop of clean water—we went down stairs, and in a little time the father came down, and wanted us to buy a coat—it had gone 12o'clock when the prisoner came home, and she went, swearing, up the stairs—I know she must have been intoxicated—I was in bed—the child was always neglected at the beginning of the week, till Tuesday or Wednesday—they could earn a good living if they stuck to their business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 145, Bishops-gate-street Without. On 22nd Aug. policeman Carter brought the child to me—it appeared to be between two and three years old—the first thing that struck me was the exceedingly dirty condition of the skin—it was almost literally covered with sores, some raw, others scabbed over, and others of long standing, healed over—they arose from skin disease, insufficient food, want of clothing, and want of cleanliness—the flesh was very flabbid and emaciated—the eyes were inflamed, and closed, and discharging matter—the belly was in a tumid condition, which is a symptom of disease—it was in a very dangerous state—I saw it about a week ago, and it is very much improved.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the East London Union. They have an infirmary at Homerton—the child was brought there on 22nd Aug.—I was there at the time, and instantly saw it—a woman brought it from the police office, rolled up in some cloth, and on unrolling it, it presented the most deplorable sight I ever witnessed, covered with sores, some of them bleeding—the eyes were partially open—they were highly inflamed, and there was a thick purulent discharge from them—its limbs were very much reduced—the pulse was low, and it was in an extremely sickly condition—the belly was very turgid, what we call <hi rend="italic">tympanites</hi>: as tight as a drum—that is evidence of what we call affection of the mesenteric glands, which is one of the most dangerous diseases children can be exposed to—it arises from deprivation of light, food, and cleanliness, and I can attribute the child's appearance to no other causes—I saw it yesterday—it is improved, but there are still sores about it—it was put immediately into a warm bath, and a nurse appropriated to it entirely—I expect that the disease will prove fatal, or the child will be a cripple for life.</p>

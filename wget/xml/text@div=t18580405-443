I live at No. 10, Great Queen Street, Westminster; that is my dwelling house—I let part of the house to lodgers—I sleep in the back parlour adjoining the passage—on the morning of the 25th Feb., I was awoke by hearing a noise; it was similar to a postman's knock; apparently, upon the door being forced, the knocker moved—theparlour door was standing ajar, and I saw a light in the passage—my wife called out "Who is there?"—the light was suddenly extinguished—I got out of bed, and I saw two men in the passage—it was very bright moonlight—themen were dressed in dark clothes, and one was taller than the other; they pulled the door after them and went out; they appeared to be about the middle stature—I have a lodger, who is a tall man, but he was in bed at that time; he afterwards came down, when awakened by the noise, with his dressing gown on—I procured a light—I looked in the passage; I saw there a dark stick or cane lying on the sideboard—there was no candlestick in the passage at that time—I looked about, and found nothing disturbed; I then went to bed again—in about ten minutes, I heard the latch snap again; I then jumped out of bed, and encountered the prisoner Blackman in the passage—Ihad not been to sleep—I came almost into collision with one man, as I came out of the parlour door—I am quite sure there were two men—seeing he was no one belonging to the house, I asked him what he wanted; he then tried to elude me, and straggled to get away—his face was turned towards me; he got away from me, but I caught him again at the street door, and he pulled me into the street—the cane was found upon him—I then called for assistance, and two constables came to my aid; one of them pursued the other prisoner, Redman, who was about twenty yards off—he appeared to be going away from the house; I could only see his back—I saw no one else in the street—there was nothing missed from the house—there are four females living in the house; one the wife of one of the lodgers, my own wife, an old lady of seventy-five years of age, and my female servant—my servant was</p>

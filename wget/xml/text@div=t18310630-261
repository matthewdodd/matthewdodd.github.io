On Sunday, the 5th of June, I went out in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner in charge, with a son of mine seven years old; I left the door which goes from the shop to the adjoining room closed, and fastened with a padlock - there was a chest of drawers in the adjoining room, which were locked; I left about a quarter before five o'clock, and returned a quarter before ten - the prisoner was then gone; the staple of the door between the shop and room was broken in two - the drawers had been forced open, and I missed some ear-rings from a cash-box in my drawer; I know there were three pairs, and I have understood from my wife there were four, also two watch-keys, and some copper in a paper.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGGINS. I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoner into custody on the 10th of June - I did not say any thing to induce him to confess, but he told me he had been in the habit of meeting a sailor named Reynolds, at different times, and he had put him up to rob his master, that he had slept with the sailor that night in St. Giles, and he had carried off his waistcoat, with the ear-rings in the pocket of it - I think he said he had spent the copper; I believe he said there were 2s. worth, and a shirtcollar, and that he had sold in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could get me out of the scrape if I told you? A. No, I swear I did not -I asked what you had to say, and you told me that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. SPICE. I left him in the house, and he had the key of the parlour to get into the passage - there was a long skewer in the shop, and I believe he broke the middle door, to get the skewer to break the drawers.</p>

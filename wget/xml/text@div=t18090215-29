On the 26th of January I asked Copeland whether he had any thing about him that he should not have; upon which he took off his hat and pulled out a remnant of cloth and gave it to Carter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that cloth was the prosecutor's - A. It was very much like that he had been employed that day in cutting; it was about half a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. From two shillings to half a crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not miss any - did you - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a refreshment house keeper at the Clarendon, Bow Road—a few days before 5th June, the prisoner called on me, and said he was a wine merchant—he brought a sample of wine with him, and said he had that wine in the docks for sale—he offered to sell it to me for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the quarter cask—I went to the docks before that, to taste some wine, with an order from him, but it was a different sort of wine, and when he came to me he said "I have a better wine than you tasted, and it will be a little more money"—I said I would submit it to my friend, and would let him know in the course of the day"—I afterwards met the prisoner opposite the Fenchurch Street Station—I said I wanted the wine delivered at Hamp<lb></lb>stead to-morrow—"Well," he said, "as I am rather short of money to-day, and shall have to go for the money to clear the charges in the dock and duty, it will forward it, if you want the wine to-morrow, if you pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day; you shall, positively, have the wine in to-morrow night"—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the label on the sample bottle was "A &amp; B Vaults, St. Katherine's Docks, No. 2 Sherry, No. 5 Quay," and a' double triangle—he told me the sample came from the A &amp; B Vaults, in St. Katherine's Docks—I advanced him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that representation—the next day I met the prisoner in Bow Road—he said "I have been down to see you, I am going to Brighton to-night; I never allow my carmen to receive money, if you will give me another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will send the wine in to-night"—I said "Very well," and gave him the money, and, foolishly, I did not take a reciept from him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140060"></xptr>
               <p>then, but I got one from him afterwards; after I frightened him a bit—I went to Belsize Park, where the wine was to be sent to, but no wine came—I had given him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before this, when he brought a sample of the inferior wine, on the Monday—that was to have been 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he said he had a better class of wine—I met the prisoner on the Monday following—I said "How is it the wine did not come up?—he said "The fact is we sent it to 17, Bel<lb></lb>size Road; the carman could not find the address, and went to Belsize Road instead of Belsize Park; it shall be up to-morrow night"—I have been to the docks—I did not find the wine in the A &amp; B Vaults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> To my best belief it was not there—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the warrant for the wine, but there is a difference between the label on the sample bottle and the warrant—the "V V P" is omitted on the label, and the officers could not find the wine—I know now that the prisoner traded as A. C. Ward &amp; Co.—the wine was to be delivered the evening after I paid him the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I advanced him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was to have the wine that week—that was before I advanced him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had to pay the charges in the docks, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not tell me the warrant was in pledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I believed the statement that he had a quarter-cask at the docks—I should not have advanced the money without.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vault keeper at St. Katherine's Docks, and reside at 30, Merrick Square—I have seen this sample, and I hare examined the books relating to A &amp; B vaults, and I find no wine with those marks in the name of Thomas Ward—I have some wine there in his name, but that is marked "V V P" underneath the double triangle, the same as the dock warrant—this is a bottle used in the trade—the Dock Company don't supply bottles, the merchants supply themselves—there to a wine in the docks with "V V P" underneath—it is a quarter-cask in the name of A. C. Ward &amp; Co.—it came from Cadiz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the prisoner was A. C. Ward &amp; Co.—this sample of the wine in the docks is correct, with the exception of "V V P"—this warrant represents the wine we have belonging to A. C. Ward—we should deliver to that—in the trade "V P" means very pale, and "V V P "very, very pale.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—he is a wine merchant, and trades in the name of A. C. Ward &amp; Co.—he had wine in the docks answer<lb></lb>ing the description of that label with one exception—the "V V P "under the double triangle was omitted—this is the warrant for the wine from which the sample was drawn off—I omitted the "V V P "by mistake—my father was taken ill after he had sold the wine to the prosecutor—he had small-pox—if he had been well he would have been in a position to deliver the wine—there was an advance on the warrant—with the money he re<lb></lb>ceived from the prosecutor it would have been possible to redeem the war<lb></lb>rant—it was on account of his illness that he did not attend to his business—I was ill myself—I got this warrant from Mr. Harley—I have redeemed it, and am ready to hand it over to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the small-pox, too—I can't tell how it was the "V V P "was omitted from the label, it was an oversight of mine—my father's offices were in Catherine Court, Seething Lane—that was a month or six weeks ago—we were in the habit of going there every day till he was taken—we have no offices now.</p>

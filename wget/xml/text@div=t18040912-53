               <p>Jury. Q. Do you value it at prime-cost at two shillings? - A. No, it cost two shillings and twopence a yard.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Todhunter.) She came into the shop, but she never spoke; did she see you? - A. I do not think she did when she came in; she immediately went out with part of the print sticking out, it was wrapped over with the tail of her gown, it was a small part that I saw; I did not observe the print gone before I went after her, and I saw nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came in, did she look about as if she wanted to speak to any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what she said about the conversation when you went out? - A. I ran directly after her to the corner of Steward-street; I caught her by the arm, and took the piece of print from her first; she said, I was coming to your shop, ma'am; she said nothing more, only when I sent for an officer, she begged me not to punish her.</p>

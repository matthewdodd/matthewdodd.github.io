            . I lodge at Mr. Steven's house, in the parish of Ealing. On the 6th of July I had 42 l. in a pocket-book, in my box, in my bed room. There was a 5 l. and five 1 l. notes, among it. On the 8th I missed the 5 l. and five 1 l. notes, the rest remained. Nobody but me slept in the room. The prisoner Groves, lived in the house, and Scott lived about thirty yards off. On the 11th of July, I had Groves taken before the Magistrate, she then confessed it. It was taken down in writing. I believe she had bad advisers.</p>

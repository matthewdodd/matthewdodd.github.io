                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Windmill-square, Hoxton. I knew the deceased William Rashbrook—he was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> pro<lb></lb>prietor—I believe he lived in New North-road—I have heard he was about twenty-nine years of age—I was with him on Friday, the 18th of January</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040060"></xptr>
               <p>last—I first saw him at the George and Vulture, in Haberdasher-street, Hoxton, between four and five o'clock in the evening—Aspland and Far<lb></lb>mer were with me in the same house, and Macartney had been there, but was not there when the deceased came—we then went to the Carpenter's Arms door—we afterwards went to the Duke of York public-house about eleven o'clock at night, and remained there till nearly one o'clock—when I left the Duke of York, there was Aspland, Cresswell, Farmer, Macart<lb></lb>ney, and the deceased with me—it was rather a dry frosty night—we left the Duke of York between twelve and one o'clock, about a quarter to one o'clock—on coming out, the deceased took Aspland on his back—Aspland being lame, and not having his crutch with him, could not walk home—Aspland, Cresswell, Farmer and myself were sober—the deceased was a little the freshest if there was any difference, but he was not intoxicated—he went with Aspland on his back in a direction of the middle of the road, but rather to the left—we came down the Hertford road, on the left-hand side of the road towards the Whitmore bridge—there is a turn in the road about half-way, to go to the madhouse—the deceased ran along the road at first with Aspland on his back, and made a noise imitating a horse—he went, "Hey, hey," and so on—I, Cresswell, Farmer, and Macartney were from twenty to twenty-five yards behind him—we were on the footpath when we turned the corner—there are gas lamps in the road—it is a public road, and there are policemen about—as we were coming towards the mad-house Aspland and the deceased were going along before us, and Aspland was still on the deceased's back—they both fell down, and Aspland fell over his head—a little further on there is a short crossing to get to Whit<lb></lb>more-bridge—this was ten or fifteen yards from the crossing—at the time Aspland and the deceased fell, the prisoner Bull came by—I was still twenty or twenty-five yards behind the deceased and Aspland—I think I saw the prisoner come across before the fall—he came in a direction from Whitmore-bridge, towards us—there is a waste ground on the right-hand side of the crossing—as the prisoner came by them, Aspland and the deceased were on the ground, and when he had passed, the deceased got up out of the road from where he was, and came in a direction towards the prisoner, in a staggering direction—he went about six or seven yards, in the direction towards the prisoner, and by that time the prisoner had passed Cresswell, Macartney, me, and Farmer, and we had got up to Rasbbrook—Rashbrook passed me, about a yard or two—he then turned round to me, and exclaimed, "Good God, I am stabbed," or, "That man has stabbed me—(I cannot say which)—I am a dead man"—he was holding his arm up in this direction—(<hi rend="italic">extending it horizontally</hi>)—I first saw him hold his arm up so, when the blood was flowing from him—I felt the blood with my hands—his arm was raised when he exclaimed he was stabbed—that was the first time I had seen it raised up—I let go of the deceased, and ran after the prisoner, leaving Aspland, Cresswell, and Macartney with him—the prisoner was running in the direction towards the Duke of York, in the direction we had come—I called out, "Stop him"—the police came up—the first policeman caught me, and let the prisoner pass—I fell, and lost my hat, but found it afterwards—I told the policeman he had stabbed a man—he let me go, and ran after the prisoner—I afterwards came up with the prisoner—he was in the hands of the sergeant and policeman—I said, "I give him in charge for stabbing a man"—the policeman said he must go back—he did not want to go</p>

               <p>back, but I cannot say what he said exactly—he stated that he had no occasion to go back, and said, "I have done it in self-defence"—he was not searched, but he put his hand into his coat-pocket, pulled out a knife, and delivered it to the sergeant—he stated that he had done it so, (<hi rend="italic">moving his arm in a back-handed, direction,</hi>) and he would do it again—I went up to the deceased, with the prisoner and the policeman, but did not hear any thing said—I instantly left, and went for a surgeon—I did not find the deceased in the same place as I had left him—I found him against a wall, about six yards from where he fell, moved to the footpath—I did not hear the prisoner or the deceased say any thing before I heard the exclamation, "I am stabbed"—I consider that I was near enough to have heard if any thing had been said—I did not hear the prisoner cry out any thing—I did not bear an exclamation from any body, except when the deceased and Aspland fell down, Farmer, or somebody exclaimed, "All right, good night"—nothing had been done to the prisoner by any body, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a light night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a lightish, dry, frosty night</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far do you think the deceased carried Aspland before he fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Above three hundred and fifty yards—the prisoner was not acquainted with the deceased, to my knowledge, or to any of the parties—he was a stranger to me, and I believe to all the other parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first saw the prisoner, was he in such a situation that he could have seen Aspland on the deceased's back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—they had not fallen before he came up to them, but as he came by—he was near enough to touch them at the time, they fell, I am certain—he had not got a yard from them when they fell down—he was coming by them, and instantly as he passed, they fell down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the moment when they fell, was the prisoner near enough to have struck him, if so disposed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was near enough to hare struck him before he fell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he had Aspland on his back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was what they call pick-a-back, with his legs under his shoulders—the deceased's arms would have bold of Aspland's legs—I saw Aspland and the deceased from the time they left the Duke of York, till this occurrence took place, except just as they turned the corner—that was for about half-a-minute—they were not on the footpath during any portion of that time, except as they came across it from the public-house to get into the road—they were not in the middle of the road, but rather to the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, at no time was the deceased carrying Aspland on the foot<lb></lb>path between two of his companions breast-a-breast, holding each other? After the deceased had passed you, going towards the prisoner, had you your eye on them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not look at them particularly—I took no notice of the prisoner as he passed, or of the deceased—after they passed me, I could not observe whether they came in contact with each other or not—it was a lightish night—I did not observe the moon—it was star-light—I could certainly distinguish whether a man's face was white or black within a yard or two of me—I could see at twenty-five yards' distance what dress a man had on—I had on a light brown Mackintosh—neither of my companions had a light Mackintosh on; neither the deceased nor any of the party—Far<lb></lb>mer had a white fustian jacket, but not a Mackintosh—I am a cabinet<lb></lb>maker.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many hours, on this day, had you been in public-houses with<lb></lb>out ceasing, from the time you went into the George and Vulture till you left the Duke of York? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be ten or eleven hours—I went into the George and Vulture about dinner time—it must have been two o'clock—I never said I went there between eleven and one o'clock—I said I was at the Duke of York between eleven and one o'clock at night with the deceased, Aspland, and two or three others—I went to the George and Vulture, first about two o'clock—Aspland, Macartney, and another man, a stranger to me, were there at the time—I was not very well in my inside that morning, and that was the reason I was there—I was in three public-houses—I cannot say how many different kinds of drink I took—I had two glasses of raw gin, part of some ale, and some beer—that was all the drink I had—I had beef-steaks for dinner—I did not go to any public-house where they refused to draw me any thing—Rashbrook and Aspland went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to a public-house, but it was shut up—I was behind them then—I intended, if the house had been open, to have gone in with them—there is a canal near the spot where this took place—there is a hurdle fence to protect you from the canal—it is not a dilapidated one, to my knowledge—I do not know that there are breaches in various places—when I first saw the prisoner, he was between the canal and the deceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I take it for granted, you and your companions, going along that road, were perfectly peaceable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we were—we were talking together, that is all—we were not talking so loud as to alarm people—we were perfectly peaceable—I do not consider that part of the road lonely—there is a house right opposite to where the man died—there is a row of houses within twenty yards of where I first saw the prisoner—I should not call it a lonely spot—we went to the Duke of York, in Farmer's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was at the George and Vulture, in Haberdashers'-street first, the Carpen<lb></lb>ters' Arms next, and the Duke of York last—we went from the George and Vulture to the Carpenters' Arms in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—that was between five and six o'clock in the evening—the Lamb was the name of the public-hone where they would not let us in—the Carpenters' Arms was where we staid—as they came from the Carpenters' Arms to the Duke of York, in Farmer's <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> they stopped at the Lamb, but that being shut, they went to the Duke of York—I did not pay Farmer any thing for his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my companion! found the horse a nose-bag full of corn, and they said he should pay nothing if he would take Aspland down, he being lame—there were three of us at the George and Vulture first, and a stranger—Macartney, Asp<lb></lb>land, and me—Macartney parted from us about twenty minutes after three o'clock, and came into the house again, having a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the rank—he was called out again, and we did not see him again till half-past ten o'clock at night—Aspland remained with me, from my being at the George and Vul<lb></lb>ture, to my leaving the Duke of York—the deceased did not join our com<lb></lb>pany until five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you are the only person having a light Mackintosh on, did you <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> up against any body that night, before the fatal occurrence took place, after leaving the Duke of York? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—Cresswell, Fanner, me, and Macartney came on the foot-path round the corner, and walked on the footpath—the deceased and Aspland did not walk between two companions, breast abreast on the footpath—Farmer had the white jacket on—he did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> against any body—I did not cry out to a gentleman going along the road, "What a bl—d <hi rend="italic">swell,"</hi> nor did Farmer, or any of my companions—there was no offensive expression used by any of our</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040063"></xptr>
               <p>party to a gentleman on the road, in my bearing—I did not see any gentle-man from the time we left the Duke of York until this took place—a policeman passed us, but I saw nobody at all on the road—it was &amp; bright night, and I should have seen them if they had been near me.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Howfar from the corner which you turned did this occur<lb></lb>rence happen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say from 150 to 200 yards—I cannot ex<lb></lb>actly judge the distance—from the turning to where this happened it is straight—there was no observation made by the policeman when he pasted us—the hurdles of the canal are a good distance from the road, they axe on the footpath of the canal—there is a piece of waste ground between the fence of the canal and the road—I should say that it thirty yards wide.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, and live in Newton-street, Cavendish-street, New North-road. I knew Rashbrook about three year—I was in his company on the 18th of January—I first saw him at the George and Vulture, in Haberdasher-street, Hoxton, about half-past four o'clock—Pugh and Farmer were also there—Farmer, the deceased, and I left together in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> about half-past five o'clock, and Pugh walked on to fetch his horse, and we were to wait for lime—Farmer drove the cab we stopped at the Carpenters' Arms, about six o'clock or after, and re<lb></lb>mained there till about eleven o'clock—Macartney and Cresswell came there—Pugh had joined us at the bridge, and went there with us—a man who goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cast-iron Jack</hi> also came there with Cresswell—he was not with us at the time the deceased was killed—the deceased and I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the Carpenters' Arms to the Duke of York—<hi rend="italic">Cast iron Jack</hi> drove us there, and staid there with us—he then drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> away, leav<lb></lb>ing us all there—we remained there till very near one o'clock—I am lame, and am in the habit of using a crutch—I never go without one, without I ride—I came out that day intending to go with my <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and had not my crutch that night—when I came out of the Duke of York I found the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was gone, and I said, "How shall I get home, I can't walk without my cratch"—the deceased said, "Oh, Aspland, I will carry you"—I believe I said, "You can't carry me"—he said, "Oh, I can carry you, I have car<lb></lb>ried five hundred weight," and I got on his back—he ran off with me a little on one side of the road, and then on the other, zig-zagging about, and making a noise like a horse—that was not from staggering, but in play—he made a noise resembling a frisky horse for about two hundred yards, and then I suppose he began to get rather tired—he walked after that—my arms were round his neck, and his arms behind me holding me on his back—he walked, it might be 150 yards after turning the comer leading to<lb></lb>wards the madhouse—after that he made a sort of drop with me, and fell all at once—we were then about forty yards from the corner turning round to Whitmore-bridge—when he fell I saw somebody by the side of him—it appeared to me to be close to me as I was falling—his falling threw me over his head, and he fell behind me—I did not hear the deceased say any</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it so dark that, when you first saw a person close to you, just before you fell, or as you fell, you could not tell whether he was a white man or a black one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not so dark as that, I am sure—I might have seen any one at the bridge, but it was rather a dark corner just at that part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the position of his arms before he fell, could any person get to that part of the arm where the wound was, so as to strike him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have thought there was room for a knife to strike him there, but I do not know—he had got me well upon his back, with my thighs under his arms—I had my stick in my band.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-proprietor, and live in Myddle<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerkenwell. On Saturday morning, the 18th of January, I was at the Duke of York, with Pugh, Apsland, Cresswell, Macartney, and the deceased—we left about one o'clock—I was sober, and I should say the deceased was sober—he had been drinking—when we came out of the public-house we walked in a direction towards home—Rashbrook carried Aspland—I walked in the road—I could not see where the other three were—they were behind me—the deceased and Aspland were on before me, in the middle of the road, up to the corner; and then, I believe, they walked on the footpath, but I am not quite certain—when they came out of the Duke of York they went into the road, and walked first on one side,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040066"></xptr>
               <p>and then on the other, not on the footpath, and the deceased snorted like a horse when he took Aspland up—I continued behind until the deceased fell—we met a policeman, but I cannot say whether it was before or after we passed the corner—when I came up by the madhouse, I saw Rash<lb></lb>brook fall, with Aspland on his back—I did not take particular notice where Aspland fell—I saw the prisoner coming up in a direction towards them—I should say he was not close enough to touch him at the time he fell, nor at any time before he fell—I should say he would be up about a minute after he fell—I was about twenty yards off—they were in front of me—the prisoner might have been three or four yards from them, I think, when they fell, but I cannot exactly say—it was rather a darkish night—there are gas lights there—I do not know whether there was one near—I think they are only on one side, which is the footpath—while the deceased and Aspland were lying on the ground I had time to come up to them—at the time I came up the prisoner had got up to the party also—the prisoner was coming in one direction, and I in the other, and we both, as near as possible, met—he had got up rather before me—it did not take long to run twenty yards—I saw him, before the deceased fell, coming forty or fifty yards from me—it was light enough to see forty or fifty yards by the gas light</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it light enough for the prisoner to see Aspland on the back of the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might not have been looking, I cannot say—I could see the reflection of a person coming by the gas light—when I came up to the deceased and the prisoner, I did not hear any thing said by either of them—I saw nothing done by either of them at that moment—I was the person that exclaimed, "It's all right"—the deceased and Aspland were then lying on the ground, and the prisoner was standing between me and them—I said, "It's all right," because I thought the prisoner might think they were quarrelling or something.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any body said any thing to make you say, "It's all right?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is a way we <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi> have got, if a horse falls down, to sing out, "All right"—I meant there was no mischief done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near did Rashbrook get to the prisoner before he ex<lb></lb>claimed, "lama dead man?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, he walked eight or ten yards towards him—I could not see whether he had got up to him, as his back was towards me—I did not, at that time or any other, hear any words pass between the prisoner and Rashbrook—I and my companions were quite peaceable at the time—I never heard any words between any of us—I have no reason to know that the prisoner and deceased were acquainted at all—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see more than one gas light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, several, in the way the prisoner ran—there was no lamp between me and the prisoner, when I first saw him coming along, but the one by which I saw him—there was one behind us—the part where the deceased and Aspland were was some distance from any lamp—I kept my eye on the prisoner till he came up to where the two men fell—there was nobody else coming along—I was sure to see him—I am sure the two men fell before the prisoner and I got up to the place—I concluded they had slipped—it was very frosty and slippery—it appeared to me that the prisoner stopped when be got up, in consequence of the men falling—the other persons of our party were not far behind at the time—the prisoner would see the two men on the ground, and me coming towards him, and some others behind me—it is rather a lonely neighbourhood—there are houses on one side, and a field on the other—I should say it was a lonely spot at that time in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you have said that, seeing him stop, you said, "It's all right"—was that under an impression that a stranger might be alarmed at what he saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have thought we had been quarrelling—on my saying, "It's all right," he walked on in the direction he was going—he pas<lb></lb>sed me in doing so, but he turned round before the deceased went towards him—I was four or five feet from the deceased and Aspland when the prisoner passed me, and they were getting up—I saw the deceased get up—my back was not towards the prisoner, after he passed me, it was towards the wall—I was standing sideways—I could see the deceased get up, as well as the direc<lb></lb>tion the prisoner took—I cannot take on myself to say that the prisoner moved an inch back towards where the man had fallen, when he turned round after getting ten or twelve yards—I believe he had passed Pugh then, but I cannot be certain—I believe he had not passed Cresswell and Macartney, but I think he had passed Pugh, for at the time the deceased said "I am stabbed," Pugh caught him in his arms—the two men who fell, and I, were on one side of the prisoner, Pugh near him, and the other two on the other side of him—I should say he was in the midst of us—when the deceased got up, he went towards the prisoner—I cannot give any reason for his taking that direction—it was entirely opposite to the route we were going—it was about two minutes after the prisoner passed me, that the deceased got up, and passed me in the same direction—he did not go after him till he saw the prisoner turn round—on seeing the prisoner turn round, he got np, and went in that direction—he then appeared in perfect health as he was before—after he passed me, and went towards the prisoner, his back was to me—I looked at him all the time he was going towards the prisoner—I cannot say whether I looked at any thing else particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now from the position in which you stood, and his back being towards you, and his having got a distance of eight or ten yards, might he not have struck, or attempted to strike the prisoner, without your seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say that they did advance so near to each other, that one might have struck the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; but it was then the deceased turned round and said, "I am stabbed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>him exclaim he was stabbed—I did not hear him make that exclamation more than once—he seemed in perfect health to me when he walked the eight or ten yards, but he might have been ill, and I not see it—I did not examine where the blood was first discovered, or how far that was from where he fell—there is a canal near there—when the prisoner stopped and turned round, he was not on the side of the road, nearest the canal, he was on the footpath, against the corner of the gateway—there is no footpath on the side next the canal—when the deceased made the exclamation, he staggered, and Pugh caught him in his arms—he was staggering when I heard him exclaim—in a very different state to what he was in before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a very different motion from that in which he had advanced towards the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the deceased had no stick or weapon in his hand—Aspland did not follow with him—he was lame, and could not move—he was not off the ground at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I drive a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and live in Bridegroom-court, Hoxton-square. I was in company with Rashbrook and the others, at the Duke of York, and left with them—the deceased carried Aspland on his back, and going along he went capering along, similar to a horse—just before he came to the bridge, he met the prisoner—we had met a police-man before that—I should think the deceased and Aspland were between ten and twenty yards before me at the time they fell—the prisoner came along past him, and Rashbrook fell down—the deceased and the prisoner were pretty close to each other at the time he fell—they were no distance apart—one was near enough to touch the other—when Rashbrook rose up, he said, "O my God, I am stabbed, I am stabbed, I am a dead man!"—he said that, I suppose, about a minute after he rose up—I picked him up, when he fell down again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far had he started from the spot where he first fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only made a bit of a reel round—the prisoner had passed him then, and got nearer to the Duke of York, and as soon as he heard him halloo out "O my God, I am stabbed!" he immediately began to run—I assisted in help<lb></lb>ing the deceased to the wall—I lifted him up, and Macartney helped me to get him to the wall—he was lying down, and the blood laid in a puddle in the middle of the road—I remained with him till the prisoner was brought back—he died in three or four minutes—I did not see any thing done by any of our party to the prisoner, before the deceased cried out "I am stabbed"—I did not hear a word spoken by one or the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder of the prison at Holloway. I was there on 13th April—I fed the prisoner with his dinner, and afterwards on entering his cell door, to get the pannikin, he threw the pannikin at my head, which hit me a violent blow, and cut my left temple—I made an alarm, and was attended by the chief warder, and secured the prisoner—I had not spoken to him—I had put his victuals on the little trap door an hour before, and I then went for the pannikin, and on going in at the door this happened—the pannikin was not put on the trap, as it should have been—when the prisoner threw this, he said, "There; d—n you"—I was not able to perform my duty; I was disabled for two days, and was under the care of the surgeon—I had not had any words previously with the prisoner—I had reported him three days before, for cutting off his whiskers.</p>

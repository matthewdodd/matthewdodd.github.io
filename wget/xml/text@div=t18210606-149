On Sunday night, the 16th of April, about ten o'clock, I was shutting up the shutters - I had put these things in a bundle, and was going to take them home to Stratford - a young man called me into the parlour to drink with him; I left my bundle in the tap-room, nobody was there then - I came out in a quarter of an hour, and missed it - I ran out, and saw some men on the road, they saw me, and set off running across the fields, and got away - I found the prisoners at Hackney watch-house that night, with the property.</p>

            . I am watchman of Hackney. About twelve o'clock on this night, I was asked if I had seen any one pass with a bundle, I said, No; they mentioned Buttress's name as one. I got another watchman, and we went to Buttress's house, at the bottom of Well-street; he was not at home - we went down the street, and there saw Henshaw standing by a post (it was between twelve and one), my mate collared him, and I saw Buttress run away, he was only a few yards from him - I followed, but he got off; and about half-past five o'clock, we found him at his brother-in-law's house, at the bottom of Pound-lane, concealed under two beds. Henshaw took us to a quickset hedge, about twenty yards from where he stood, and shewed us the bundle.</p>

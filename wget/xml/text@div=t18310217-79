On the 2nd of February, the prisoner came and had his supper there; he was alone in a room for about half an hour - there was a great coat in that room; he paid for what he had, and was going away - when he got into the passage, I saw the collar of my uncle's great coat under the prisoner's great coat on his back; I told him he had my uncle's coat on - he said No, it was his own; I called my uncle, and I went for an officer, who took him - I looked into the room for my uncle's coat, and it was gone.</p>

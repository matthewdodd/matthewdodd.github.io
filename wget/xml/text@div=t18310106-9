On the 31st of December I was going up Fleet-street, from the Ship, in Ivy-lane; I was not drunk nor sober - I had gone there about ten or eleven o'clock, and drank rum and water; I might be drunk and not know it - I met the prisoner in Fleet-street; she asked me to give her some gin - we went into the Red Lion in some court there, and had some gin; she then asked me to go home with her, to which I agreed - she took me to a ground floor room in a house in some court in <placeName id="t18310106-9-crimeloc55">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you a married man? A. Yes - I left Ivy-lane at near twelve o'clock; I left home between ten and eleven - I was not tipsy; I had left the public-house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I met her - I had not been toying with any girls on the road; I did not take out my watch in the room - I went into the house between twelve and one o'clock; a woman fetched the gin after I took my trousers off - that woman had been in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not the woman who awoke you, the woman who had been in the room with you? A. She certainly was not - I should think not; I am sober now- I had 2s., which I put into my stocking that she should not take them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Bride's. On the 31st of December, about a quarter-past three o'clock, I was called to No. 2, Harp-court, Black Horse-court - a woman belonging to the house desired me to go into the parlour, for there was a man there ill-using a woman; I found it was Griffin - he was dressed; he had been drinking, but had not sufficiently recovered - he charged a woman there with robbing him of his watch; I did not know I was authorized to take a person out of a house -I directly went to the watch-house, which is not twenty yards off; Watts, the night officer, went with me - the prosecutor was still contending with the woman about his watch; while the officer was searching the room, I heard a scuffle and saw the prisoner attempting to run out of the front parlour door - I followed, and took her, without losing sight of her, against Mr. Farrow's house, No. 80, Farringdon-street, about fifty yards from the house; when I laid hold of her she was picking up her clogs - she returned with me quietly; the prosecutor immediately said, "That is the woman that came in with me to go to bed with me;" he did not charge her with taking the watch - I took both the women into custody, then returned, looked about, and on the identical spot where the prisoner was stooping to pick up her clogs, I found the watch without the outer case, and in the morning at day-light, I saw the watch-case down Mr. Farrow's area; the prosecutor claimed it - the house he was in is a common house for the reception of prostitutes; the prisoner frequents it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there other houses of the same description in the court? A. Yes - it is not a thoroughfare; the place where the prisoner stopped was immediately under a gas-light - it was about a quarter-past three o'clock; the impression on my mind was that the prosecutor had been worse than he was then.</p>

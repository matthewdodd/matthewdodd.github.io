                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Mahoney; we live at No. 1, Gilbert's-alley, Stratford. The prisoner is my husband's brother's son—on 10th Sept. I left home at a quarter before 1 o'clock—I locked up the house when I went out—I returned about a quarter before 5 o'clock; I then found that our two doors had been broken in by force—the front door first, and when I went up stairs, I found my own room door broken open—that had been locked—I went into my son's room first—his name is James; he is over 19—I missed his suit of clothes—I looked into my own room—the door was smashed, and everything taken away—a pair of new boots, and a silk handkerchief of mine, and all my husband's clothes were taken away, and I picked up this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), belonging to the prisoner, close to my bed—I know it to be the prisoner's handkerchief—I had seen it in his hand several times—he did not live in our house, but he was in the habit of coming in—I have never washed or hemmed it for him—I saw the clothes that I had missed, at Stratford, to-morrow fortnight—I received some dupli<lb></lb>cates by post after the house was broken open—I do not know the prisoner's writing, but I received four duplicates three weeks or a month after the robbery; I gave them to the policeman.</p>

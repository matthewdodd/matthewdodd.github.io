               <p>Q. How many - A. There were about six men and women, they seemed to be wrangling and disputing one with another under the lamps which belong to the Albion Fire-office, they were near the pastry-cook's which is near the Albion Fire-office, they took the whole width of the pavement. The prisoner was walking half a yard before the others, he was in conversation with them, I went up to give them leave to pass me, and on my drawing up to the shop the prisoner at the bar made a spring at me and knocked me down; with my falling I called the watch; I found that he had got my watch at the same time that I had the blow. As soon as he got the watch he gave it a spring, the outside case fell off from the watch, and the remainder hustled in of a heap to pick up the case of the watch; with his knocking me down I fell to the left of him, he had then an opportunity of running away from me a little to the right; he run over to Fleet-market, down the side of the market of the Fleet prison; he left the curb-stones, and kept at the back of the shambies, I running after him calling stop thief; a watchman was standing at the gate of the prison, he turned upon me, and I laid hold of him; I gave him into the charge of the watchman, saying, that he had robbed me of my watch; I never lost sight of him. I was without my hat. I was determined to make an example of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not argue. Are you positive that he is the man that struck you and took your watch - A. He is the very man that struck me and took my watch at the same instant. There was a second man, when I cried out he ran over to me and struck me. I was upon my knees and hands when the prisoner knocked me down, I did not think it right to rise; I kept my eye upon him until the watchman was coming, then I got up and ran after him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the parish of St. Bride's. On the 19th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard the cry of watch as I stood at the bottom of Bride's-lane; I ran to the spot, I saw the prisoner running along the front of Fleet-market, the prosecutor was close after him. The lamps shined very bright. He cried out stop thief. I ran over, and about a yard before I got to him the prosecutor had got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run down Fleet-market - A. He went down there, but seeing a watchman there he turned and ran towards me; I had my lanthorn behind me. I was standing at Mr. Temple's door, the prosecutor ran after him and catched him by the collar; I asked the prosecutor what he had done, he said he had knocked him down and robbed him of his watch; he desired me to take charge of him, he said he would go back and look for his hat. He had lost his hat. While I was holding him by the collar two men and two women came up to me, they seemed to be cursing and swearing, and I thought they had a mind to take him away from me, I thought it was the safest way to take him to the watchhouse; I did, and told the constable of the night what he had done. On my going along with him to the Compter I said, you had better tell me who they were; he said, d - n your bloody eyes, if it had not been for the last half-quartern of gin you would not have had me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of him - A. I see a great many about that quarter; I cannot say I know any thing of him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. At the watchhouse I asked him how he came to rob the man of his watch; he said he came from Westminster, and then he said he came from Thames-street, and after that he said he came from the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These people were about him before; I was passing by: I never touched him at all; I was by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you find your hat afterwards - A. Yes, in the middle of the street.</p>

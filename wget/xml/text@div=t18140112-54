               <p>COURT. Where do you live, ma'am - A. Next door to the Police office, Shadwell. He asked the price of a shirt that hung in the window; that shirt did not suit him. I shewed him another, the price was seven shillings; he bid me six shillings; he said he had not sufficient change in silver, he begged me to change a 1 l. note. I called the servant to get change, the servant was not in the way, I gave the note to my sister

            . I am sister to the last witness. I received a note of my sister to get change. At the time the prisoner was in the shop I went to Mr. Andrews the haberdasher; he would have given me change if I would promise to stand to the goodness of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were at Mr. Andrews's, did you observe any thing particular on the note - A. That black mark at the side of the note, it was not out of my sight during the time I was there. I did not get change; I returned home with it. I said Mr. Andrews disputed its being a good one. I said that in the presence of the prisoner. My sister desired me to go to Mr. Gedney, and ask him if it was a good one. I took it to Mr. Gedney; Mr. Gedney said it was not a good one. Mr. Gedney gave the note to Hewitt the officer in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been out of your sight before it was delivered to Hewitt - A. No. I marked it after it was delivered to Hewitt the officer. Hewitt came home with me, he and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that note, and see whether that is the note - A, That is the note that I marked, my mark is upon the back, which I made when Hewitt came back with it, and the black mark is in the margin. I have not the least doubt that is the note.</p>
               <p>Court. To Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner make any objection to remaining while your sister was gone to Mr. Gedney's - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what he said when you told your sister to go and ask Mr. Gedney whether it was a good one or not - A. He said he had not change sufficient, he would call the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent the prisoner from going away while your sister was gone to Gedney's if he had wished it - A. No, there was nobody else in the shop but me and the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker; I live at No. 3, Artillery-passage, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner about the latter end of October - A. Yes, about two o'clock in the middle of the day he came in and fitted on a pair of shoes himself; he pleased himself; the price was eight shillings; he paid me in a 1 l. note as I thought I sent my boy to a neighbour with the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before you sent it by the boy make any remark on the note, so as to be sure the note be brought back was the note you had taken of the prisoner - A. Yes, I saw the note had been torn, and there had been a piece of paper pasted upon it.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140112-54-person511">Q. </persName>
            From the circumstance of that piece of paper being pasted upon it, have you any doubt that was the same note that the boy brought back - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. When the boy returned with the note the prisoner was with you, was not he - 
               <persName id="t18140112-54-person512">A. </persName>
            Yes, I sent the boy in the prisoner's hearing to ask if it was a good one, and when the boy brought back the note I gave him twelve shillings and the shoes. I then asked him his name and address; he gave me his name, Mr. Smith, No. 10, London Wall. I wrote upon the note from his dictation, Mr. Smith, London Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note - A. It is, I have no doubt of it in the least, this is the note I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mr. Wills, have you any doubt of the prisoner being the person - A. No doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remark his hand at the time - A. No, it is from his general appearance, and my general recollection; I never knew him before.</p>

               <p>Q. You on grave Bank notes - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a Bank note - A. No, it is not, it is not engraved at all; it is done with a pen and ink, and the other parts with a camel's hair pencil. It appears to be wholly written; if there is any thing done with the camel's hair pencil, it is the full strokes, but I rather think it is all done with the pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other note, is that genuine or a forgery - A. It is a forgery, it is made exactly in the same way, it is the same manufactory, they appear to be made in the same way; I have no doubt they are done by the same hand, I should think they are copied by the same hand, the signatures of every one is the same, and the dates are the same: there is a distinction in the numbers; the first is 62492, the next 69492, the next 62492, the same as the first, and the last 69492, the same as the second.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEES. Q. You are one of the inspectors of the Bank - A. I am, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that first note, Is that genuine or a forgery - A. It is a forgery in all respects, the signature and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the others - A. They are equally bad, and of the same description; they appear to be made by the same hand; I have no doubt of it, they are copied from the same note, the same characters run through all.</p>
               <p>The note read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is now a year and a half ago that I was bound for a person, which person absconded out of the way for the present; in consequence of that I have been obliged to keep out of the way of sheriff's officers. I have been obliged to sell my clothes and furniture to support myself in selling them is the way I got these notes, one after the other; for the list note particularly I sold all the clothes I had except these on my back; I sold them to a Jew his name I did not ask him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120029"></xptr>should know him if I was to see him. I have done business in the City of London; I have sold out three or four hundred pounds in the Bank, and never was accused at any time. If I had known these things to be what they are I never should have gone so nigh the office door to have changed one, that is a clear case; no man would put his head in the fire. And as to what the woman has said at the other end of the town, is it likely that I should shew her my hand as it has a particular mark, it is not likely. I have lodged in London-wall, and I have lodged in every place I have spoken of; I might be wrong in the number, it might have been at the next door; I have been in Uxbridge also. I throw myself on your lordship's mercy. As for knowing any thing of these bank notes being bad I did not; I know no more than any of these gentlemen here. I dare say there is not one person here but what has had bad notes in his hand; unfortunately for me there are four come through my hands at different times. I did not choose to plead guilty, because I knew myself not guilty.</p>

            . To this she pleaded Not Guilty, and put herself upon the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Anne Mounsdel was the next, who was accused for stealing the Goods of Mary Brasier, and thus it was proved.</p>
               <p>Mary Brasier testified, That the Prisoner was by her permitted to lodge in her Room for 6 d. a week, and one day pretending to send her out of a false Errand, with a feigned Letter into the Strand, to a person whom she could never find, and in the mean time robb'd her of a Gown and some Linen, and had got them quite away, if the Landlady of the house in which they both lodged had not stopp'd her, and taken her.</p>

            , the Landlady, related her part of the Story thus, That the Prisoner got her Daughter to write her a Letter, upon promise of a Reward: That the Child told her, She suspected the Prisoner was a Thief, and that she her self thought so too; and thereupon watched her, and saw her put on the Gown, after she had sent the Woman out, and was going away with the Linen in her Lap. She went after her, and fetch'd her back, though she ran from her twice, and had her before the Justice, who committed her.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner denied the Letter, or that she sent her out on her Errand; and said, That the Woman had lent her the Gown, and the Linen she was to have mended. But against the Positive Oaths of two Witnesses, her bare word the Court thought not a sufficient Counter-proof; however they left it to the Jury.</p>

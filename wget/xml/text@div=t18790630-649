                  </hi>. I live at 2, Albert Place, Charlton, and am a labourer—the prisoner lodged in my house nearly four years—he left on 5th June—my daughter Ellen resided with me—she was 15 on 19th of last September—she disappeared about 6.30 a.m., at the same time as the prisoner—I afterwards received information about them from a young man—on 9th June I saw the prisoner; I said "Halloa, you are a fine fellow;" with that he ran away; I ran after him and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I left home on 5th June at 6.30—my father was up and had gone to work; my mother was not up—no one accompanied me; the prisoner told me to go out by myself, and he met me in the lane about five minutes' walk from the house—the prisoner was a lodger—he was at me four or five weeks; he said I had no peace or quietness at home, and we would both do better in America—he said a boat would leave Bristol on the Thursday following—he opened the door in the morning—he said overnight would I go in the morning before mother was up; I said "Yes"—he, said "You go up the lane, and I will be there a few minutes afterwards"—he did so, and we went across the common to Blackheath Station—he took tickets for London—we went to a coffee-house in London and had some breakfast, and then took a bus to Paddington and took the train to Bristol—he took the tickets—we went to a beerhouse in Bristol, and there we stopped from Thursday until Monday—he then said he would come up to London for his box, and we would sail off to America on the Thursday—he said he would be back again on the Tuesday—he asked me if I would marry him; that was on Monday, the 9th—I said I would—he had beaten me on the Saturday—I don't know what for; he said it was through his being drunk—we slept in different rooms at the beerhouse all the time—he left me on the Monday; he did not leave me any money, only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a glass of ale—I did not see him</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was drunk when he beat me—he did not ask me to marry him at my father's house; not till we got to Bristol—I remained at Bristol till the Thursday after he left me, when the clergyman came after me—he had never taken liberties with me before I left home.</p>

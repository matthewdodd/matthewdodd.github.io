                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Slaughter, and live at 36, Clipston-street. The prisoner was in my employ for a few days—this ring it mine—I kept it in a box, in a drawer on the first floor at No. 4, Alfred-street where I then resided—I did not miss the ring til! the officer brought it—I then spoke to the prisoner about it, and she said she found it in the yard with some shavings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Mendicity Society. On 18th March I took the prisoner's father in Oxford-street with this ring. I went and asked Mrs. Slaughter if she had a servant—she said, Yes, and pointed out the prisoner—I said to her, "Did you have the ring?"—she hesitated some time, and then said she found itin the yard in some shaving—I asked her why she did not tell her mistress—she said she intended to keep it to see if there was a reward offered for it, as she found two or three once before, and had some reward for them—she owned before the Magistrate that she gave it to her father—her father was sent before the Magistrate but discharged.</p>

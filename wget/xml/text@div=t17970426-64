               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do not you know, that his Majesty had done Dr. Willis the honour of giving him that horse? - A. I did not know that at the time, I considered him as the King's horse, and had him under my care as such.</p>
               <p>- HIGGINBOTHAM sworn. - I am a fishing-tackle maker; on Thursday the 4th of March, the last witness asked me if I had bought any hair, lately, I said, I had, I bought some of the prisoner at the bar, the day before, (produces it); I gave him five shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gray.) According to your judgment, is that the hair off that horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Higginbotham.) Is it hair from a horse's tail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Gray.) Q. I dare say, you would not pledge yourself to swear positively, that that hair came from that horse? - A. No, but it is like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you learned since, that it had been before presented by his Majesty to Dr. Willis? - A. I did not know that it was horse that, I know it is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higginbotham. Mr. Gray told me that the horse was given to Dr. Willis.</p>
               <p>Gray. That was the third day after; I then did not know when it was given to Dr. Willis, Dr. Willis had not it for a fortnight after.</p>

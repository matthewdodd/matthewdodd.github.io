I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—two children were brought there between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night of 21st August—the elder one, the boy, had nothing the matter with him then—the younger one was suffering from opium poisoning—that was indicated by extreme paleness of the body; the face in particular—it was quite comatose, perfectly insensible in every way, the conjunctive insensible, it would not act in the least; not sensible to touch, in a state resembling deep sleep, it was almost impossible to arouse it—the pupils were very much con<lb></lb>tracted, almost to pins' points—I was told that they had both been poisoned with opium, and what I saw led me to the opinion that they had had opium—I did not administer an emetic, I used the stomach pump, as being more quick and effectual—I washed the stomach out thoroughly, and that pro<lb></lb>duced vomiting by reflex irritation—every means were used, and next morn<lb></lb>ing, about 8 o'clock, it evinced signs of sensibility, and eventually perfectly recovered from the effect of that opium poisoning—it has since died—the boy was not suffering at all at the time—he had had an emetic adminis<lb></lb>tered by Dr. Muller; he was discharged from the hospital two or three days after—he was not treated at all, there was no necessity for it—they were both kept there for two or three days, simply as a matter of charity, or convenience.</p>

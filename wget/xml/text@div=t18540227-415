                  </hi>. I am a boot maker—I became acquainted with Mr. Wood; I was in custody, and he came to me at the station house. On 10th January last, I went to his office, No. 1, Walbrook-buildings, at the back of the Mansion House, and asked for Mr. Wood—when I went, I saw the prisoner; I had not noticed him before I had seen him in company with Mr. Wood; I had never spoken to him—I asked him for Mr. Wood; his reply was, that he was in the country for some time, but it was no matter, he being the partner of Mr. Wood; I had better state my case to him—I gave him all the explanation of my case against the Company—I had these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my hand—I gave him this paper, and he wrote himself on the back of it, my claim against the London and North Western Railway Company, and this is his handwriting—he</p>

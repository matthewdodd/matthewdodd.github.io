                  </hi>. I am assistant clerk at the Worship Street Police Court. On 18th July last there was a charge pending against two persons named David Gould and Nathan Houltman for forgery—I have not got the charge sheet here—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the original depositions in the case, and were returned to this Court as such—I know it to be a fact, that those persons were charged with a felony before Mr. Hammill, the presiding Magistrate at Worship Street, on July 18th—that was the last examination—they had been remanded from time to time—I believe an application was made to admit them to bail—I was not present in the Court when any person offered himself as bail—I was in an adjoining room, where the recognizances are always taken—some one came into the office, and gave the name of Thomas Powles, No. 6, Portland Terrace, Victoria Park Road, as bail for David Gould and Nathan Houltman—I do not remember that person—he described himself as a hosier—I took the recognizances—the bail was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each prisoner—I stated the conditions of his recognizances to that party in the usual manner—I first asked him his name—he gave me his name and address, which I entered in a book—I then told him that he was bound in the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on condition that David Gould, and also the same sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Nathan Houltman, should appear at the next Session, at the Central Criminal Court, to answer a charge of forgery—I gave him at the same time a notice to that effect—he said he would acknowledge himself—he said he was content—I said he was to acknow<lb></lb>ledge himself in the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on condition that David Gould, and a like sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Nathan Houltman, should appear at the next Session, at the Central Criminal Court, to answer a charge of forgery; and then he acknowledged himself—the recognizances were not made out at that time—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the recognizances that I returned to Mr. Clark at this Court in that case, in the regular and ordinary way—they were made out by me—they bear the signature of the presiding Magistrate, Mr. Hammill, who heard the charge against Gould and Houltman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the chief usher at the Worship Street Police Court. In July last, two persons of the names of Gould and Houltman were charged with felony—the last examination was on July 18th—I was present on that occasion—I heard an application made by the defendant's solicitor that they should be admitted to bail—Ms. Hammill, the Magistrate, consented—two persons were brought forward who were represented to be respectable housekeepers—the prisoner was one of them—they each gave me a card with their name, address, and description—I destroyed them—I asked them, "Are you the person you describe yourself to be as becoming bail?"—I put that question to both—the prisoner replied, "I am"—Mr. Hammill desired their bail should be taken—I took the prisoners into the room adjoining the clerk's office with the two bail, the prisoner being one, and their recognizances were entered in this book in my presence, and the prisoners discharged—the first step that was taken was to open the recognizance book—the names of the prisoners were entered—I then told Mr. Wood that the two persons, the prisoner being one, were the persons who had presented themselves before Mr. Hammill in Court, and on that the recognizances were taken—I heard the prisoner acknowledge himself in the usual and ordinary way—he was asked, "You acknowledge yourself to be bound in the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the condition is that you do personally appear at the next Session, and produce the prisoners to take their trial"—I have not the slightest doubt that I heard Mr. Wood say that to the prisoner, and that he nodded his head, as much as to say, "I do;" in fact, he would not have been allowed to depart the Court unless he had—I am sure the prisoner is the person who so represented himself on that occasion—the recognizance is taken in the adjoining room for convenience—it is a room immediately adjoining the Court, and the door between the two is left open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>present at the last examination—I heard an application made for bail, and acceded to by the Magistrate—the prisoner came forward as one of the bail—I believe the Magistrate asked him if he was willing to become bail—he said his name was Thomas Powles, No. 6, Portland Terrace, Victoria Park Road, and he pointed to an officer in Court who knew him to be a respectable man—he said he was a hosier—his bail for Houltman was first taken in the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then Gould could not get another bail, and he went bail for him in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I heard the Magistrate accept him as bail, on the faith of the officer knowing him to be a respectable man.</p>

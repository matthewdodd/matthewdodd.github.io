            . I saw the two prisoners, and watched them, on Thursday, about four-o'clock in the afternoon; I saw them at the end of Rathbone place, with another young man with them; Bird was looking in at a shop door; the other two were standing at the corner of Rathbone place; Holmes had a bag under his arm. They crossed over, and went to the opposite side of Oxford road; then the prisoner Bird went to a shop door that was shut; he opened the door, and walked away; a woman came to the door. They then turned back, and went to the end of Rathbone place, and went into Percy street, and thence to Tottenham-court-road, and then up Hanway street, across Oxford street, into Soho square, and then they went through a number of streets, and at last we traced them to the house of the prosecutors; Bird walked backwards and forwards before the door a number of times; he several times went to Holmes, who was standing at the corner of Boswell-street; the prisoner Holmes then came with him; they stood talking together three or four minutes at the door of Davis and Taylor, then Bird took the bag from Holmes, and Holmes laid hold of the cotton; he stood at the door, and pulled it from the shop; I did not see him in the shop. Bird then followed Holmes as he was walking away. There was a young man with me all the time; he ran forward, and seized Holmes, asking him what he had got there? he replied, what he had got, he picked up. I told him he had not, and Bird interfered, by laying hold of his collar, and saying, what he had got, he picked up. I told Bird be had better be quiet, or we would lay hold of him. We then took Holmes into Davis's shop, and Bird followed us to the door. I told the young man in the shop there was another chap in company with the prisoner at the time of his commiting the robbery, and he said, he ought to be taken also. An officer was sent for, who searchen Holmes, and I told him Bird was outside, and he went out, and took him.</p>

I did not say before the magistrate that I was not sure of Bird; it was getting dark; they were lighting the lamps. We waited until the young man in the shop said Bird should be taken, before we took him.</p>

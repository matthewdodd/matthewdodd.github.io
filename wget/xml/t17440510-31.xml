            . About the 9th of April my wife missed a silver salt, and was told that a couple of girls had been at my house to sell something; I knew where to find the children. Bond confessed that she stole the salt, and gave it to the other girl, and she pawned it. I went to the pawnbrokers, and Mrs. Hatton said it was pawned to her by

            . Mrs. Calverack brought this salt to me, and I lent her 12 s. on it. I asked her whose it was, she said it was Mrs. Ellis's, and Polly desired me to take care of it, for she did not know how soon it might be called for: said she to my daughter, miss Polly write No. 12 upon it, for as I am big with child, I dont know whether I may be able to come for it; and I desire you will deliver it to any person I send for it.</p>
               <p>Capt. Milbourne. This is my salt, I know it by several marks.</p>
               <p>Calverack. Ask Mrs. Hatton whether she has not known me a great many Years, and whether she ever knew any ill of me?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I never did, she always bore a good Character.</p>
               <p>Calverack. Bond is my Apprentice, the child brought me the salt, said she, mistress, I have found something; I think 'tis a sort of a cistern, I said, I desire to know the truth, if you came dishonestly by it, tell me so, and I will send it home: and she said, she did not come dishonestly by it, but had found it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the Girl did not say before the Justice that she found it?</p>
               <p>Hatton. She did; she said she found it in the street in an old handkerchief, and the Justice said what handkerchief, and the Girl said it was in her mistress's Pocket, and Mrs. Calverack pulled out a dirty rag of a handkerchief, and the child said she found it in that. <rs id="t17440510-31-verdict166" type="verdictDescription">

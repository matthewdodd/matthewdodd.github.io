                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Crowder, a dealer in cane, who lives in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. Pugh was in our service, and had been so five or six years—it was his duty to be at the house at seven o'clock—the others did not come till half-past seven, or later—we have lost a great quantity of sticks, from time to time—I and my brother agreed to watch and on the 22nd of February I placed myself at the first-window floor, a little before seven—I saw Woodcock come down the street—he stepped into our shop, and then immediately ran out with this bundle of cane, which corresponds in every respect with the cane at my father's—I have missed such cane as this—Pugh had no right to tie up any cane—I ran down into the street imme<lb></lb>diately, laid hold of Woodcock, and charged him with stealing cane out of my father's shop—he said, "Oh, no! you are quite as wrong as ever you were right; I bought it of Ward, a cane-dealer, in Gilbert-street, Borough"—I took him back to the shop—my father came, and a police<lb></lb>man was sent for—I think Pugh was in the shop when I came back—when the policeman came, my father said to Pugh, "You are about as great a thief as ever came into a man's house; you are found out at last"—Pugh said, "No, sir, I am not," or something like that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Woodcock. Q.</hi> Did you not shut the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say I did—I went up stairs, I left you in the shop—the cane was tied up when I brought it back—it was not when my father came down; you had undone it—it was tied at one end with a small piece of string—when I came down there were three parcels of cane on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of George Crowder. I was watching outside the house on this morning—I went out about twenty minutes to seven o'clock—I saw Woodcock with another man, who is not in custody—I saw the other man, who was parading by our house once or twice, make at one time a false entry, as if to go in, but he turned back, as if some one told him not to go in—then the other man entered the shop, and in two or three seconds walked out with a large bundle of cane under his arm—Woodcock was at this time three or four doors from our house—I had seen them standing together—Woodcock had nothing with him—I pursued the other man, and could not catch him.</p>

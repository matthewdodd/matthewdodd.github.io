                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Hog-lane, Woolwich. On 3rd Nov. I was selling coffee near the gates of the Arsenal—I had a shawl on, but had not a pin to keep it together, and took it off, rolled it up, and put it under the edge of my barrow—the prisoner came and asked for a cup of coffee—I did not serve her, as she was a disagreeable looking woman, and she stood there—a gentleman came up—I served him with a cup of coffee—I saw the prisoner stoop, and go away—I went about a quarter of an hour after, and missed my shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a niece of the last witness. I remember her losing her shawl—I knew it well, and about a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner with it on—I knew it at once—I was standing near the Arsenal gate, and saw her come by—I could not leave the barrow—I waited till she came closer to me—I went to her, and said, "You have got my aunt's shawl on"—she said that she had not—I said, "Wait till my aunt comes, and she will know"—she would not, and I went to the inspector.</p>

I was at the station—the last witness brought the prisoner there, and said she brought her for stealing her aunt's shawl—I asked her how she knew it—she said she saw it on her shoulders—when I came in the prisoner had it on her arm—I asked her how she came by it—she said she bought it two years ago, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in Petticoat-lane, that she should not know the man she bought it of if she saw him again, and she did not know the shop—this is the shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

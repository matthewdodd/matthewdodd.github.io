The chain broke. There were three gold seals attached to it. He got them before I could attempt to save them, and ran down Lamb-alley. The second man crossed me to prevent my pursuing him, but as soon as I could recover myself, I followed. The prisoner kept following me, and tapping me on the shoulder, and asking what was the matter. I am certain he was one of the three. When I found the two were too strong for me to take them; I turned round and seized him by the collar, and he instantly began to strike me, as hard as he could. I told him to strike on, as he could not be in better hands then - there were three thieves, and I seized him as one of them. He was close to me when the man took them, and did not attempt to hinder the man. He struck me four or five times. I kept hold, and dragged him out of the alley, into the Ship, public-house. The constable came in, and took him; we were obliged to handcuff him. I should know the other men again if I saw them. I never lost sight of the prisoner, nobody was near, but those three. There was a good light in the alley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it moonlight or dark - A. It was lightish, there was a strong gas light, I do not know whether it was moon-light; the men came up in a line, or half-circle - the prisoner was the outside one, next the kennel - the one who took the seals was outside, next the passage, it was done suddenly; I did not see them half a minute before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not charged a man as one of the other two, who turned out not so - A. No; I fixed on a man, supposed to be in their company, but not as one of the three. I saw him in a public-house, and thought he might be the means of leading me to find the others, as I understood had been with them, at the Three Tuns. I believe his name was Higginbotham; the watch-house keeper said he was a housekeeper, and discharged him.</p>

I am secretary to the London and Westminster Lean and Discount Company, carried on at 62, St. Martin's lane—I know the prisoner Palmer—in August last I received from an agent of his a proposal to borrow 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not we him about it until some short time afterwards—I ultimately saw him—he called at the office about the middle of August, in answer to an application that had been made by his agents, Messrs. Miller and Tucker—I then told him to send back a further security—he had proposed his mother-in-law, Mrs. Maria Perry—I told him that was not sufficient—be then proposed a bill of sale upon her furniture, but that was not deemed sufficient and was declined—he then proposed Miss Emily Perry as a surety—he gave the address 6, Boyle-street, Saville-row—that proposal was put before the directors, and they granted it upon all three parties, giving a bill of sale, Mrs. Maria Perry, Mr. Palmer, and Miss Emily Perry—I next saw Palmer about 1st September, I think, at the office—the bill of sale was executed on the 2d—when he came on the 1st, he made an appointment for the parties to come and complete the transaction—I believe he brought an inventory of Miss Emily Perry's furniture—he then left and came again on the 2nd with the prisoner Marsha Perry, and his mother-in-law, Maria Perry—this is a promissory note and this a bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was present when they were executed—I saw them signed in Palmer's presence—Martha Perry signed "Emily Perry," and Maria Perry was signed by Palmer guiding her hand, and then Palmer signed, after the other two—I have since seen Emily Perry, who lives at Boyle-street—I knew that Palmer was her brother-in-law then—upon these being signed the money was advanced.</p>

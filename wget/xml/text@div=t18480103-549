On Saturday morning, 11th Dec., I saw the in Compton-street, close to prosecutor's warehouse—Machin lifted up sack of potatoes, and put it on his back—Evans was about a yard behind him—they went through Red Lion-street, and went away together—I pointed the prisoners out to Robinson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Bosomworth. On 11th Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I counted the sacks of potatoes—about seven or a little before, I missed two sacks, containing 1 cwt. each—Holmes told me something, and an hour or two afterwards he pointed out the prisoners to me—they were following each other three or four yards apart—I watched them, and saw them go together to a cart, with "Thomas Evans" on it—Evans put some carrots in, and they went away.</p>

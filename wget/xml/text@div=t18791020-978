                  </hi> I am a ship-keeper, at 33, Station Place, Shadwell—on Saturday night two weeks, about 10 o'clock, I was on board the ship Landseer—I went into the forecastle and saw the prisoner there and three boys—I ordered the boys ashore, and the prisouer up with his fist and struck me a blow and knocked me senseless; I could not say what he struck me with, I could not say if it was with his fist—he hit me in the eye; he was standing on the forecastle deck where we were sleeping; after he struck me he began to bite me in the head and in the arm—when I came to I called out "Murder"—he said he would kill me—I said, "You will be hanged for it if you kill me"—he did not say anything to that—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200170"></xptr>
               <p>struck me a blow on the arm and I fell underneath the lower bunk—he then ran to his bed where he generally kept his knife—I was helped out: I do not know how I got ashore, I was rather senseless—I think one of the biggest boys brought me on shore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew the prisoner when I joined the ship, a week and four days before this occurred—it is my regular business to look after ships—I was on good terms with the prisoner, I used to try all I could to please him, he did not do all he could to please me—he said he would tell the captain and get me out of the ship—he spitefully wished to get me out of the ship, because he said I could not work hard enough for him—he wanted me up at 5 in the morning to wash the deck and I would not, I said 7 was the time—that was on the Friday morning before this occurred; he made me a present live or six days before this, it was an Agnus Dei—he put it over my head because he said I was a Catholic—the commencement of this row was my sending the boys ashore—I had been drinking with him and the boys—I did not say anything to him before he struck me—he knocked the senses out of me, and as soon as I came to I jumped up and said, "You scoundrel, what did you do that for?" and caught hold of his long hair and held him as tight as I could—I was obliged to defend myself—I did not kick him, I was not able, he kicked me in the privates—we fell down several times, and I thought he would kill me—I sung out, "He is eating me"—he bit me in five different places while I held his hair—he said, "I will kill any white man who pulls my hair"—I do not know that it is an insult to a Hindoo to pull his hair—I was afraid to let go for fear he would kill me—I had not provoked him—as soon as I let go his hair he went towards his bed—he put the light out between 9 and 10 after the scuffle, and it was very dark—I have been ruptured before by working hard and lifting, and it came on worse after this—I cannot say if I fell on any<lb></lb>thing—I saw a lot of wood and sails on deck—he put my arm out and I fell down in the bunk—I do not think I had hold of his hair then, because he had his finger in my mouth—I have told the interpreter and the police officer I would withdraw from the prosecution if paid a certain sum of. money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 103, Upper Globe Lane—on 4th Ostober, between 10 and 11 p.m., I was with my brother and another boy on board the ship Landseer, sitting down with the prisoner and Smith—the prisoner and Smith had some beer—Smith ordered the boys ashore and the prisoner did not like it and got up and struck Smith with his hand, and pulled him down and punched him on the floor—Smith had not struck him or said anything to him before he struck him—I then went for a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went on board about 9, and saw the commencement of the row—Smith ordered the boys ashore and said he wanted to go to bed—he did not say anything to the prisoner—the prisoner struck him with all his might—Smith did not fall, but caught hold of the prisoner's hair and then they struggled and fell, and the prisoner began punching him—Smith let go the prisoner's hair before he began punching him—I did not see the prisoner bite Smith—I did not say before the Magistrates that I saw the prisoner biting him—I only saw him punching him—I did not fetch the beer, Smith fetched it—he did not ask the prisoner for the money</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police at Rotherhithe—I was called to the police-station on 3rd October, soon after midnight, and found Smith bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, and with his left shoulder dislocated—there were five lacerated wounds, apparently bites, on his chest and arms, and a large rupture on the left side, which appeared recent—I caw no wound which could have been inflicted by a knife, but the wound on the head might have been inflicted by such a stick as was shown to me—he was in a very serious and exhausted condition, and there was reason to fear inflammation of the bowels from the rupture—I have not attended him since—I have seen him to-day and for several days past, and he appears to have recovered—I reduced the dislocation at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found two ruptures, one apparently an old one and the other recent—a kick would have caused it—a fall would not have caused such a rupture—it was not an extension of the old rupture, but a totally new one, and on the other side of the body—it might possibly have been caused by falling on a projecting piece of timber, but in my judgment it was such a wound as would be caused by a kick—there were two bites on the front of the chest, two or more bites on the arms, and some injury to the thumb, and the shoulder was dislocated—that might have happened from a fall or a direct blow—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and he was in a state—of almost maniacal delirium, and in such an intense state of excitement that I considered he was suffering from the effects of a drug called "bang," which men of his nationality often take.</p>

On Saturday, 4th October, I was sent for, and found Smith in the foreman's washhouse, being attended to—I went on board the Landseer, and saw the prisoner lying apparently asleep in a bunk—I took him in custody, and brought him out on deck and tried to make him understand the charge, but could not do so—on the way to the station he became excited, and struggled to escape, and was about to strike me—I said, "You are already charged with assault<lb></lb>ing the shipkeeper, and if you commit a further assault you will be charged with it"—he said, "The reason I killed the white man was because he pulled my hair"—I went back to the bunk and found this knife, but with no blood on it—I searched the forecastle, and found this stick with wet blood on it, and there was a quantity of blood about.</p>

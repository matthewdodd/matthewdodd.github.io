                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Martin, of 5, Whitehall-gardens. On 25th Oct. I saw Daniel, who was acting as time-keeper to a lot of men repairing the sewers in Whitehall-gardens—I spoke to him about a dog of my master's, which I had lost—he made an appointment to meet me at a quarter to nine o'clock that evening, at the Swan Tavern, by Westminster-bridge—I went there, and he came in about ten minutes to nine—in about a quarter of an hour Denhar came in—he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. -worth of brandy and water; I had some of it; and then he and Daniel tossed with regular money for another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth, and then for another—it was brought, and I certainly put my lips to it—after that Daniel wanted me to put his watch and mine down, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I had got to pay for the feed of my dog, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Denhar was to put down the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then became insensible, and cannot say whether I agreed to it or not—when I came to myself, I found I had lost the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my watch—I was then at the Swan, and the prisoners were still there—they told me to keep quiet—I said I should like to redeem my watch again—they offered if I gave them 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that I should have it back again—that was about twenty minutes to ten the same evening—I must have been insensible about ten minutes—I was very stupid—I had not drunk anything besides a little spirits and water—I gave the prisoners my address—Daniel said he was a total stranger to Denhar, and he promised faithfully that he would seek after the watch,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Pimlico. On Saturday, 2nd Nov., I was in New-street, Covent-garden, looking in at a painter's shop—Daniel came up to me, and said something about the bill that was in the window—I answered him, and he said he had been waiting there ever so long to see a person about some work—I walked with him through Covent-garden market, and down Long-acre, St. Martin's-lane, and Pall-mall—he asked me to come in and have something to drink at a public-house at the corner of St. James's-square—we went in—he called for a pint of ale, and I drank with him—while we were there, a man came in, who pretended to be a German—he told me he was a German, and he appeared to be one—it was not Denhar—he said something to us about two fine geese which hung up in the bar, and said he had been out on the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> all night, and wanted something to eat—this was between twelve and one o'clock—he did not appear to be acquainted with Daniel—Daniel said to him, "I am going out, and I will show you a place where you can go and get something to eat"—he said he had only just come to town, and did not know where to go—I went out with them—I forget the name of the street they went to; it was somewhere towards Rupert-street, I believe—they went into a public-house there, and I drank the share of a pot of ale with them—the German called for it; and Daniel directly said to him, "I will toss you who shall pay for it, and I will bet you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I beat you"—they tossed with this capped penny (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not know at that time that it was capped—Daniel won several times, each time he tossed—they then went on tossing for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., half-a-crown, and so on—after the German had lost several times, he went out; and while he was out Daniel showed me this capped penny, and said, "See here, I am sure to beat him every time"—the cap has the king's head on it, and the halfpenny it fits upon has both a head and tail, so that you may have a head on both sides if you like—the German came back, and they tossed again with the same thing-Daniel still won—he wanted me to bet on the game—I would not, and he asked me for the loan of some money—I told</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George John Lloyd, of Thorn-cottage, East Brixton. The prisoner was in our service eighteen months, as cook, and left on the 18th of July—Mr. Elphick is our butcher—we generally paid him every week—the bills were generally brought to me first, and I employed the prisoner to pay them—I furnished her with the money weekly—these six bills now produced are Mr. Elphick's bills—they run from February 17th to March 27th—they were sent to me regu<lb></lb>larly, but being small amounts, they were allowed to run, and on the 1st of April I gave her the amount, not separately, but altogether, with the six bills—they were afterwards returned to me, purporting to be receipted by Jane Elphick.</p>

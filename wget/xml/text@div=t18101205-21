From information within fifty minutes after it was taken from my house, I went to Mr. Wegulin, pawn-broker, in Chandos-street; there I found my cambric. It appeared to me to be a whole piece; it had been in my house from the 2d of May, and worth about four pound. It was on the 8th of June that this happened, and I had seen it in my shop on the over night. I have no doubt of its being my property. When I saw it at the pawnbroker's the mark had been rubbed out, but there was a sufficiency left for me to identify it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive information of your loss - A. From my shopman,

               <p>ISSAC JOHNS. I am a shopman to Mr. Jolly. On the 8th of June, between the hours of two and four, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at some French cambrics. I shewed her the lowest price we had first; it was not fine enough; I continued shewing her cambrics until I think I shewed her the finest. She desired me to cut her one-eighth of a yard, upon which I opened the cambric so to do, and in stooping to pick up the measure I saw and likewise heard a rustling; I immediately rose up, and the prisoner rose up, and she was in the act of taking money out of her purse; I suspected at the time that the prisoner had taken a piece, but could not challenge her. I had suspicion of her from her first coming in the shop, but on account of her appearance and dress I did not challenge her. The prisoner then asked to look at some print; I sold her some print; when the prisoner paid for the half quarter of cambric and the print she went out, the boy was at the door; when she went out I told the boy to follow her and see where she went; in the mean time I examined the cambrics and missed the piece. The boy came back and told me that she went into Mr. Philpot's the corner of Turnstile. I immediately told him to follow her, and not to lose sight of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen that piece of cambric yourself that you missed - A. I had shewed it her at the time I was shewing her the cambric. I am perfectly clear that I had that piece of cambric. The boy went after her, and I have seen the cambric since at the pawnbroker's. I knew it to be my master's; this was on the 8th of June; my master was in the city at the time. When he returned I informed him of it. I am sure as to the person of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness Johns coming to your house - A. I do, it was on the 8th of June, and afterwards on the same day Mr. Jolly came. I shewed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050015"></xptr>them that piece of cambric; they laid claim to it; when I say they, I mean to be correct; the young man did not lay claim to it, but Mr. Jolly did. I cannot speak to the person of the prisoner; it was a genteel person that pawned it.</p>
               <p>Q. I would wish to know how that mark in the cambric came to be obliterated - A. I do not know. I should hardly take it to be a mark.</p>
               <p>Johns. I swear positively I did claim it when I first went to the pawnbrokers.</p>

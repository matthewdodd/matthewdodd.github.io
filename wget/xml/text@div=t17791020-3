I went into St. Thomas's hospital to endeavour to get admitted there, having a lame leg. I left St. Thomas's hospital about four o'clock. I went drinking at several houses along with an acquaintance. I was coming home towards my lodging at the Seven Dials, at about twelve o'clock, and between the top of <placeName id="t17791020-3-crimeloc20">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Was you in liquor? - Only a little; my leg was very painful. I asked where I could have a private lodging; the prisoner said she knew a Mrs. Jones, who kept a private lodging-house for any body that came; she went and knocked at the door; the woman opened the door; I asked her for a bed, and said I would pay for it. I sat down upon the bed; the prisoner sat by me. I did not desire her to go out, or stay and lie with me, nor any thing, but I fell fast asleep presently, and then she robbed me.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the same bed with her? - I sat down first upon the bed. I only took off my great coat and my shoes; I laid me down upon the bed, and was asleep in two minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go on to your own lodging? - My leg was very painful, and the people I lodged with I did not like to knock up at that time of night.</p>
               <p>That is, you did not like to take this woman along with you? - No; I had no design of that.</p>
               <p>How long did you sleep? - About an hour and an half, or quarter. The mistress of the house came up, called me up, and said the woman was gone out, and asked me if I missed any thing. I said no. The prisoner was then gone. I then got up, and missed my pocket-book and watch, my buckles, and a knife. Mrs. Jones, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200006"></xptr> mistress of the house, when she called me to get up, was searching my pockets, and throwing my coat upon the bed, but whether she had the knife or not I cannot say, but the prisoner had the buckles.</p>
               <p>Another witness sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner showed me a pocket-book and a watch, at the top of the King's-road, Gray's-inn lane, on the first of October, at about seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Are you an acquaintance of her's? - No.</p>
               <p>How came she to show them to you? -</p>
               <p>She thought she knew me; she pulled the pocket book out of her pocket; I said, what is in it? she said, she had got to the value of 20 s. I said, take care of it; she turned round again and pulled out a watch and showed it me. I applied to some gentlemen at a publick-house, and told them she had got a watch and pocket-book; they desired I would stop her, which I did; there was a letter in the pocket-book, that was the way I found the prosecutor out. A constable was sent for, who took the prisoner into custody. Some gentlemen who were in the publick-house went after her, and she came into the publick-house. The gentlemen asked her for the pocket-book, and she delivered it directly if my presence, and the watch too. I went after the person, whose name was upon the letter, which was the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>- JEFFERIES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. This watch and pocket-book were brought to me by two men, who had taken the prisoner into custody; one of the men's names is Davis, the other Hastings. A young man who stopped her said it was taken from a woman they had in custody at the Queen's-head, the corner of James's-street, Bedford-row, I went there, and found the prisoner in custody. I asked her how she came by this watch and pocket-book; she said she found them. I asked her where; she said in a street going into Holborn. I had these plated buckles out of the prisoner's shoes.</p>
               <p>(The buckles, watch, and pocket-book, were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Coming along I met that gentleman's servant much in liquor, he asked me to drink, I refused it: he insisted upon my going with him to a publick-house: he asked me where I lived, I told him; he said he would go home with me if it was agreeable; I said no, you are much in liquor, go home to your lodgings; he said he was not able to walk; he went to the lodging and paid sixpence for it; there were four beds in the room; he said, I am very heavy I shall fall asleep soon, so take care of these things for me till morning. At half after six he waked and asked me to get up and go to his brother's and get him to bring a coach and take him to the hospital. I offered to leave the things behind, but he bid me keep them in my pocket. I took the watch out of my bosom, and that man laid hold of me and wanted the watch from me; I said the property was not mine; he said he would give me five shillings for it; I said it is none of mine, and if there was any constable about he might fetch the owner of them, he said I have owed you a spite a long while, I will have my revenge of you now; they sent for a constable, and I was brought before the justice; the owner was sent for and they made him swear that I robbed him.</p>

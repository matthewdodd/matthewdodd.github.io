I lived at No. 4, Palace-place, Kensington—I have lately been in the hospital—the prisoner lives at No. 3, next door to me—on Sunday morning, 2nd Dec., there was some difference between me and my wife—she left my room and went to the station, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I wrapped up the baby, and took it to my mother's, three or four minutes' walk from where I live—when I came back I passed the prisoner's house—I heard my wife talking in his house—I went to the door and called</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Palace-buildings. About half-past 1 o'clock that morning I was about to go to bed—I heard a disturbance in the court—I went to the door—I paw Daley first—he was between his own door and Murnan's—Mrs. Daley was in Human's house, and she was having words with her husband, who was outside—I then went into my own room, as I thought it had nothing to do with me—I stopped about half an hour—I heard a noise again, and came out—I heard a voice across the way, saying, "Oh, Thomas, keep away, Murnan is coming out of the house with a chopper"—I saw Human coming out of his own house with a weapon in his hand—as near as I could see, it was a chopper—I did not observe it so closely—he and Daley both sparred—I mean they both put up their hands, and Daley received a wound on his arm—he dropped his weapon, and went back—he had had something in his hand in the shape of a poker—there is a wall at the end of the court—he went back, and stumbled against the wall—Murnan followed him up, and they laid hold of one another—they both fell—Murnan had the weapon in his hand at that time, and Daley had nothing—Murnan happened to get up first, and he knelt on Daley, and hit him so many blows on the head, I cannot say how many, with this weapon—Daley lay on his back, with his two arms by his side—he was in a pool of blood, and quite insensible—the prisoner got up, and went to his own house, and I cried out, "Oh, Murnan, you murderer, you have killed the man, I will prosecute you to-morrow"—the prosecutor was taken to his mother's, and then to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have left there now, because Murnan's wile used to be always threatening me since this occurred—she never threatened me before—I go out to work at the wash tub—when I came out first, I saw Daley—he was talking to his wife—I live in the third house from him—I heard his wife speaking to him—I could not judge from the sound of her voice whether she had got out of Murnan's room—there were some very bad words—I had not heard such till that time—I have not been in the habit of seeing much of them—they could not have much difference, they have been but three months married—I had never been to their room but once—I went to see her—that was the only time I ever was in Daley and his wife's room—when I came out, I did not remain listening to them many minutes, not above five—they were abusing each other the whole time—I heard the wife's voice distinctly—I knew the wife's voice, it was almost time I should—I came down again in about half an hour, because I heard the noise in the court again—I know Mary Warwick and Elizabeth Warwick by seeing them—I did not see them there—I heard a voice saying, "Keep back Tom, Murnan is coming out with the chopper"—that was not Daley's wife's voice—as near as I can say, it was some relation of Daley's, because there was a relation of his standing across the court—there was his sister and a relation of his there—I cannot say which spoke—I cannot swear it was either of them spoke—the words were, "Murnan is coming out with a chopper"—Daley's wife was in Human's house at that time—soon after I heard the words I saw Murnan coming out—Daley was at that time close by Murnan's door—I did not hear Daley challenge him to fight, or use any bad language to him—I did not hear Daley say, "Come out and fight, I have that that will do for you"—I never heard him mention a word—when Murnan came out, Daley was at his door, and they both sparred—they put up their hands—I was about four yards from them—there was a light at the corner of the court, but not near them—I saw</p>

               <p>something in Murnan's hand—they were sparring two or three minutes, I dare say—I dare say there were blows struck—I saw Daley put up his hand, and Murnan too—each had a weapon—the weapons struck each other,'and made a noise—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner and Daley were both brandishing some weapons—afterwards Daley stag<lb></lb>gered back against the wall—they closed, and the poker fell from his hand—I suppose they were struggling three minutes before they fell—they both had hold of each other, and both fell together—Murnan happened to be uppermost in the fall, and he knelt upon Daley—he struck Daley many times, and then Murnan went to his own house—Daley was taken to his father's—I did not see him taken—I went to his own house, and saw him afterwards—at this time Daley's wife was in Murnan's house, as near as I can possibly say—I saw her afterwards—she came over to see her husband, who lay in a pool of blood—she began to cry out, "My husband is mur<lb></lb>dered, my husband is murdered!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. On the morning of 2nd Dec. I was called up to see Daley—he was perfectly sensible—I found he had a scalp wound over the left eyebrow—on putting my finger in I found he had a compound fracture of the skull—the skin was cut through, and the muscle and the bone had been broken also—it was a dangerous fracture, at least we thought so at the time—I saw his hand was bruised—I found nothing else at that time—the nurse afterwards said to me that there were two or three little scratches on the head, but they were of no consequence—I could not tell whether they were scratches, or done with a chopper—they were small wounds at the back of the head—he remained in the hospital till the 26th Dec.</p>

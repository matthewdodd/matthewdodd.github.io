               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Knapp, and the case by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BROOKES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Cresswell, a proctor, in Doctors'-Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners? - A. Yes, I know them all. On the 4th of December, the two prisoners, Blake and Stack, came to Mr. Cresswell's office, to prove the will of

            ; one of them, I believe, Stack, but cannot say positively which, produced a will, they were both together. (Produces the will).</p>
               <p>Q. Did Stack or Blake say any thing to you at that time? - A. I do not recollect what they said, but they presented a will to me to prove; after the reading the will, I asked which of them was the executor; I first asked Stack, whether he was the executor; he said, no, and pointed to the other man, by which I understood he was the executor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Blakely say any thing to that? - A. No, he did not. I asked Blakely whether his name was spelt right in the will, to which he answered in the affirmative; after which, I proceeded to write a receipt, and Blakely went with me then to the Court, which was then sitting; after he had been sworn in Court, he came back to Mr. Cresswell's office with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Stack been left at your office? - A. Blake went out with me, I did not observe Stack follow; but when I came back, I found him at the corner of the street; I promised them the probate next day, and one of them said, they wanted it immediately, but I cannot say which of them said that; I asked Stack, if he knew the time of the death; he said, he did not know the time, but he would procure it, and bring it in the afternoon; I did not see him again that day; they then went away, but on account of some suspicions about it, the probate was not proceeded with; the next day, Blakely came, I told him, the probate was not ready; in about half and hour, Blakely and Stack<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090040"></xptr>came again, and spoke to Mr. Carr, who is likewise a clerk to Mr. Cresswell; but I do not know what passed; the next day, Thursday, they came together in the morning; I told them, it was not ready, but desired them to sit down; after which, I was desired by Mr. Cresswell to procure a constable, and take them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else pass between you and them respecting the will? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner? - A. Not till he was taken into custody, on the Thursday; he was brought by a constable into Mr. Cresswell's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, (Counsel for Blake). Q. The will was not given you by Blakely? - A. I cannot say, I believe it was Stack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, (Counsel for Stack). Q. When these two men came first to the office, was any body else there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man comes for the probate of a will to your office, it is nothing unusual for a friend to accompany him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you enquired what time the testator died, Stack was not acquainted with it? - A. He said, he did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CARR sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am a clerk in Mr. Cresswell's office: On Tuesday, the 4th of December, about two o'clock, I was in the office, when the prisoner, Stack, came into the office with information, that he had been to the India-house, and found that the deceased had died in December, 1797, and that he was an armourer, and not a carpenter, as described in the will; he then went away, and attended again the next morning, but the business not being done, he went away, and returned in about an hour, accompanied by Blakely, but the business not being ready, I told them, it might be ready in about an hour more, or thereabout, or if it was not ready at that hour, and the public Register was shut, they could not have it till the morning; Blakely said, that would do; Stack said, it would not do, for it must be taken to the India-house as that day, and they went away, but never returned to see whether it was ready or not, notwithstanding I saw them both in the street after that time, conversing together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other person conversing with them? - A. Not at that time; but about an hour or so after, Corns came in and enquired about the business, asking if the business had been fetched away, by which I understood he meant the probate of the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time you had seen Corns? - A. Yes, he said Blakely was related to the deceased Ford, and he had lent a little money upon the business; he went away for that day, and on Thursday, the 6th, about twelve o'clock, Blakely and Stack came for the probate; it was then determined to have these men taken into custody; while the constables were sent for, I went out of the office, and saw Corns parading before the house, and before the constables came, I returned and saw Stack going up the street; Blakely was then in the office alone, and was taken into custody by one constable; Stack had at this time got round the corner; I then took a constable up the street after Stack, and I then saw Stack and Corns conversing together, and they were both brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular pass between them at the time of their apprehension? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys, (Counsel for Corns). Q. Do not you know it to be a very common thing for persons to lend money upon a will to persons who represent themselves as entitled to a benefit under that will? - A. I believe it is sometimes done among seamen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Stack told you that Ford died in December, 1797? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That turned out to be a correct account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He also told you that the deceased was an armourer, and not a carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed that the description of the seaman in the will was not a proper description, did not that excite a suspicion in your mind? - A. I had a suspicion before that.</p>
               <p>Q. That of course must have confirmed the suspicion in your mind? - A. It certainly did.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Then you were present when Blakely took the oath before the Surrogate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Cousins). Q. Do you know of any relations of your's or your son's, of the name of Blakely? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blakely's defence. My Lord, I most humbly intreat your Lordship's protection, and the mercy of the Court. In my life I never heard of the name of Blakely, nor singed it, or heard it read, till I heard it at Guildhall and here; my name is Blake. - I believe it was not five minutes from the first time that I had seen this deed till I was sworn in open Court at Doctors' Commons; not knowing the custom or manners of the place, I thought this oath, administered to me, was preparatory to what was to be done. Mr. Brookes has said, that he read it, but I most humbly beg his pardon, for it was not read; I neither saw it, nor understood it, but positively thought it was right. A man of the name of Quin was the man that delivered this will to Mr. Stack and me, in the parlour at the Whitehart, in Butcher-hall-lane; he wrote on a bit of paper, his compliments to a Mr. Kiernan, or M'Kiernan, a proctor in the Commons; Mr. Stack delivered this complimentary note to Mr. Kiernan; and Quin not only sent this complimentary note, but said that he had an open account with Mr. M'Kiernan, to the tune of forty or fifty pounds, that he had a great deal of business to do in this way; Mr. Quin seemed to be quite the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090043"></xptr>of business, he said he had business with all the the proctors in the Commons; but, however, my Lord, this note was presented to Mr. M'Kiernan; Mr. Stack, at the same time, had a printed card of Mr. Cresswell's, but said, he gave Mr. Kiernan the preference; upon which Mr. Kiernan said, it was a usual custom with the people in the Commons, when there was a recommendation, never to take the business from one another; in consequence of which, we went to Mr. Cresswell's, where the card directed; I went to the Court, but it was not read at all, as I dare say the young man, upon recollection will acknowledge; something was asked about my name, but I do not recollect what; I went over with a young gentleman to the Court, where the gentlemen were pleading, and there was an oath administered to me; I did not exactly hear the words of it, but that I should true inventory make, and give a just account; I went back to the office, and after that, I attended as the gentleman directed, expecting the business to be done; during all this transaction, I unfortunately had taken a glass or two of spirits at the house where we met; I was doubtful whether it was the same

I attended, as the proctor directed, until we were taken into custody; I was not surprised at being taken into custody in the least, for I doubted throughout that there was something wrong; for I was doubtful how it should come to the ears of Mr. Quin that the man owned me money. We were then taken to Guildhall, and committed. My Lord, I am very sorry to add, that Mr. Stack and Mr. Corns sent this

               <p>Prisoner Stack's defence. I have been for many years in the public life; this man, Blake, came to my home along with a man of the name of Smith, who resorted to my house in the year 1794; sometimes he came with Smith, and sometimes by himself; he borrowed money of me, and got in my debt, with regard to liquors and beer at my house, and when he had got in my debt he shunned my house; I met him by accident, at different times, in the streets of London, and asked him for this money that he was indebted to me; and he made answer, that he was poor, and would pay me as soon as it was in his power. Some time in November last, I met him at the upper end of Drury-lane, I asked him how he was; and he said, very well; I met a person of the name of Read, before I met Blake, and we went into a public-house; we were not long in the public-house before I asked Blake if he could pay me the trifle he owed me, I said, I was out of business lately, and was striving to get in what money was owing me, and threatened to summons him if he did not pay me; he made answer, and said, he had a sum of money to receive from some friend that died at sea; he told me to call at his house, No. 9, Newtoner's-lane, at a chandler's-shop, and if I would go along with him I should receive my money; I went along with him to Doctors'-Commons, he produced this will, and gave it to Mr. Brookes; Mr. Brookes and he went off together out of the office, I waited till they both came back; Mr. Blake and Mr. Brookes spoke together for some time, and after speaking together, Mr. Brookes asked Mr. Blake if he knew what time the man died; to which Mr. Blake made answer, he could not exactly tell; Mr. Brookes said, he could not get the probate ready without Mr. Blake would bring him word within a month or two of the time that he died; upon that, Mr. Blake and I went out of the office, and walked together as far as St. Paul's Church-yard; Mr. Blake says to me, as you are the youngest man, Mr. Stack, will you go to the India-House and find it out; I accordingly went to the india-House, I am well acquainted there, and if I was to do any thing wrong they would know me as well as my father or mother knew me, every one of the gentlemen knew me; I enquired, and they told me, I think, in 1797, such a day of the month; I said, it was Ford, a carpenter; and the gentleman said, there was no Ford a carpenter, there was Ford an armourer; I, my Lord, came back, and left word at the office the answer that I had got; the gentleman, Mr. Carr, I believe, said, very well, that will do, come to-morrow and it will be ready; I then went and told Blake I had delivered the message to the Commons, and that he was to call the next day, according to the order of the proctor; he said, very well, if you will give me a call to-morrow, come along with me, and you shall be paid; I called upon him, and we went there the second time, and were put off then till the third day; I parted with Blake, and said, if I am not paid what trifle is due to me to-morrow I will never come any more; I went along with Mr. Blake the third day, and went into the office; one of the gentlemen in the office asked me to sit down near the fire, he and Mr. Blake stood together; the gentleman said, you may have the probate of the will in a few minutes; when I had walked as far as the top of the street, two constables came up to me while I was speaking to Mr. Corns, and I went with them before the Lord-Mayor. I know no more of its being amiss than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Corn's defence. All that I know of it is, that Stack brought Blake to my house, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090044"></xptr>me if I would lend him some money; accordingly I told him I would if he would give me security for it; upon which, he said, he was going to administer for a relation; and I went to Mr. Cresswell's to make enquiry about the security; I went again the next day, and I was taken into custody; that is all I know of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Blake. I never saw Corns in my life, nor ever had a farthing from him in my life.</p>

On the 3d of April I came home about half-past six o'clock, and about a quarter to eight o'clock went to the pay-table, returned at nine o'clock, and found the door open, and missed this property; the prisoner had lodged in the house for a week - he came home at night - I charged him with it, which he denied. I have not found the property.</p>
               <p>PHOEBE DIGGLE. I lodge in this house. Tapley gave me the key of his room. I went up about eight o'clock, and found the window open - the pots outside had fallen on a chest under the window. I missed the spoons. I had seen the prisoner go out of the house very quick, about half-past seven o'clock, he went sideways - I could not see whether he had any thing.</p>

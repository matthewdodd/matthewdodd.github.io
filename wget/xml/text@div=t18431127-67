                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">linen-draper, 5, Newport-street, Soho.</hi> On the 28th of Nov. the prisoner came to my shop and asked for some gauze ribbons—she saw some, and then asked to look at some black silk neck handkerchiefs—another party showed them to her in my presence—I came down to show her some—she made several remarks about their not being good enough, and soon—I missed a piece consisting of five handkerchiefs—I looked about the counter, removed everything, and removed her away from the counter, but did not find it—I then told her I had missed some handkerchiefs, and asked if she had any objection to be searched—the said, "No," if I would send anybody to her house with her—I said there was no occasion for that, as my mother was in the house at the time, and asked her to go with me to my mother—on going from the counter I saw the handkerchiefs drop from under her shawl—the young man picked them up—I called a policeman, who came and took them—these are the handkerchiefs—they are the property of myself and mother—our mark is on them.</p>

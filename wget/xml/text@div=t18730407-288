               <p>I was in the service of Mr. Auckinvole, who trades under the firm of Johnson and Fairie, and has business premises at Glasgow, Bradford, and 19, Old Change—I am employed as salesman at 19, Old Change—he is a yarn merchant—I have been in his service twelve months—we occupied the first floor—the prisoner Prout had an office there as well, on the second floor—he was there before I was—I have known him about six years—on 30th December I had in coburgs, cords, alpacas, and flannels for the purpose of selling—the coburgs, cords, and alpacas were worth 435<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the flannels 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 30th December a person named Stevens called on me, and wanted to see ray Bradford goods; before that he had placed two or three memo<lb></lb>randa in my letter-box, saying that he wanted to see me; they were generally put in at the time I went to dinner—I showed him the goods—Prout was present and assisted me in showing them—I asked him who he was repre<lb></lb>senting, and Stevens said he was the buyer for Paul Henwood, of Lime Street, and their shipping office was at 154, Leadenhall Street—Prout wrote that on a piece of paper at the time he was leaving—Stevens looked at the goods, and I told him my price for them—after I had shown him the different numbers, he offered me a farthing a yard less to clear the lot—I told him that I could not do so until I had communicated with my people in Brad<lb></lb>ford, and then Prout reminded me of a letter I had had from them to say that I could take a farthing a yard less, which I had forgotten at the time—he wrote on a piece of paper "Do you recollect the letter?"—I don't know what has become of that—I destroyed it with my letters—I read the memorandum, and I then remembered I had received a letter to that effect—I had previously shown that letter to Prout—I then told Stevens that he could have the goods; that applied to the coburgs, cords, and alpacas—after that, as he was going out, I asked him if he was a buyer of flannels—he said he could buy them if the price was right—I showed him the flannels and Prout assisted me—he said he would let me know the next day, he could not agree to take them then—he came the next morning and said he would take them—I asked him then for a reference, and he referred me to Cook, Sons, &amp; Co., and told me he could give me several if I wanted them—that was a reference for Paul Henwood—he rather laughed at the idea of my asking him for a reference—I told him I should not send the goods until I had a reference—the reference was very good—on the following day Stevens came in again and told me how he wished them to be packed, and asked when I could get them ready—I asked him how long he could give me, and he said "Till 4 o'clock"—Prout was there—I asked Stevens if he would give me till 4.30, as I could not get them done, and Prout offered to assist me in packing them—I said I would try and get them in by then—Prout did not come to assist me at the time until nearly 4 o'olook or a little after, so I was behind in getting them ready—I had been packing them up in the meantime—Prout assisted me when he came—Stevens came again about 5 o'clock or 5.30; the goods were not all packed by that time—he asked me why I had not sent them—I told him I was unable to get them ready, and that I could not get them ready till 6 o'clock—he left and came in again in about a quarter of an hour—Prout and I had continued packing—it was then nearly 6 o'clock—I told him I could not promise them till the next morning, as the waggons were busy to go north and south of London for their regular customers—Stevens said he must have them that night—I told him I could not do impossibilities, if I could not get a waggon of course I could not deliver them—he looked at his watch and said it was just 6, and one of</p>

               <p>Paul Henwood's waggons would be in Leadenhall Street, as they had three or four waggons of their own—I referred to Prout, and asked him what he thought of it, and he said it would be a very good idea if he wanted them that evening, as he could not have them without—Stevens went away, and came back with a man and a waggon a little after 6—we had finished the packing then—Clegg was the carman of the van—Stevens came up with the man and said "Those are the goods, take them down and put them in the van"—Prout was there then and his brother-in-law—the carman took the first lot down, and Prout followed him with some more—his brother-in<lb></lb>law took some down as well—I was going to take them, but Prout sug<lb></lb>gested that the man should keep in the waggon; they would take them down and I should get them ready for them to take—Prout and his brother<lb></lb>in-law carried the goods down—the carman, after the first time, remained down stairs—I delivered the goods in that way—after they had taken two or three loads down I asked Prout to ask Stevens whether there was any occasion for them to be signed for, as I had a book for that purpose—when he came up again for some more goods he said Stevens said there was no occasion, as it was Paul Henwood's own van and carman—that satisfied me as I had had a good reference—the goods were all delivered in that way—Prout and his brother-in-law took about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to take them down—Stevens was at the tail end of the van and the carman was stowing the goods away—I did not make put any invoice as the goods came from Bradford; I sent my list of what I had sold, and it would come up from Bradford—after the goods were carried down, Prout and his brother-in-law remained in my room a few minutes and then left. Stevens went with the waggon—I afterwards saw the whole of the goods at Burton's sale rooms at the Broadway, Ludgate Hill, on the 15th January—they are the same goods—before that, on the 5th or 6th, I wrote a letter to 154, Leadenhall Street, the address which was given as the shipping office—I addressed it to Stevens—he said I should always find him there if I wanted to write—I did not get any answer, and I went there myself on the 16th—I found 154 was Deacon's Reading Rooms, and my letter was lying there unopened—I went to 12, Lime Street—I found that there were business premises there, but that they had never ordered the goods—I had not been in the habit of selling goods to shippers—Prout had suggested that I should go round amongst the shippers—I did not hear from Stevens how he came to me—two or three days after the goods had gone, Prout spoke to me about commission, as he had brought the man to me—I said, "You did not bring him, he came by himself, "that was all that was said—Prout and I used to live together in the same house of business, that is how I knew him—he used to sell some of my goods, and was very often in my place—he went down to Cornwall, and I received this letter from him on the 17th or 18th January—when I found the goods were wrong I had written to him—I said "You know as much about the goods as I do, you had better come up, "and this was his answer—"New Quay, Cornwall, Sunday. Dear John, I am astounded at the contents of your letter; will be, if possible, on Tuesday morning in London. I was required down to see my mother, who is ill and wants to make her will. Will be with you as soon as possible. By G—! if I had thought he was a swindler what would I have done with him! I should like to be with you now. Cheer up, I shall most likely find him out. I shall know him again when I see him; he was someone who understood the trade, by the way he handled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070039"></xptr>
               <p>and looked at the goods. I am sorry for you, yet you could not help it; I should have done the same if I was in your place. References first-class, what more was there wanted? If I get the will made to-morrow, I will be with you on Tuesday. Cheer up all you can." I know Prout's writing very well, and have seen him write—this invoice of Hall &amp; Co. is in his writing—I should not have parted with my goods unless I had thought it was a true story about Henwood, and the shipping office, and all about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I had sold goods for Prout on several occasions, and I had sold him goods for my employers—the last amount was over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have sold him goods for the last four or five months—he has had credit and he has paid—the last payment was in January, after this affair—I never received the money—it was sent down to Bradford—I think it was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he is still indebted about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods sold to him—he was in the habit of coming to my office nearly every day—he has never assisted me in packing before—my goods have generally come from the manufacturers to the wholesale houses and have not been delivered at my office at all—he had no opportunity before this of assisting me in packing—he used to take my goods out and sell them, and he had 2 1/2 per cent, for what he sold—he has not sold a great deal; to the amount of some hundreds, I dare say—the commission would come from Bradford to him, not through me—no doubt that would be taken off his account—he was in the office when Stevens first came—we had just come in from din<lb></lb>ner—we generally went to dine together—I had never seen Stevens before, and as far as I could judge Prout had not—he remained about half-an<lb></lb>hour the first time—Prout was present all the time, and we talked the matter over after Stevens left—I had the reference to Cook's the next morning—I had the name Paul Henwood—I know now it is a well known name in the trade, but I did not know it then—Prout did not remain long after Stevens left—I don't think I saw him again that day—it was on the first occasion he wrote something on a piece of paper and handed to me—a reduction of a farthing a yard is a very common thing to clear a large quantity—Prout came to the office the next morning for a short time, in the usual way—Stevens did not come the next day, but on the 1st January—he came early in the morning—Prout was there; he came in afterwards—he merely said "Good morning" to Stevens—they did not seem to be acquainted—it was on that day the goods were loaded in the way I have told you—I say that this invoice is in Prout's writing—the "January" I believe to be his—the other part is disguised, but I believe it to be his writing—the figures are like his figures—I can't point out any other resemblance to his writing except in the top part and the figures—the word "January" is more like his style of writing—the figures are joined together in his usual way of making them, but there is nothing particular about that—I was given into custody on this charge at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Stephen Baker, a carman, of 263, Hoxton Street—on the evening of the 1st January, between 5 and 6, somebody came and hired a van—he saw my master—he said he wanted a covered van to move some goods from Old Change—I had a covered van, with two horses—I went to 19, Old Change—I don't know who the man was—he rode beside me—when we got there I went up stairs to the first floor with him—there were some goods and three or four men there—I went down to the van again, and Prout and another man brought the goods down and I packed them in the van—the man who hired the van told me to drive to the Amherst Road, Hackney, and then he would show me where to go—when we got there he pointed out a private house, five or six doors from the Fairlie Hotel, and said "Go there and leave the goods, "and he went away—he said he had had a few words with a gentleman who was there, and he did not wish to see him—as I was driving to the house Prout met me in his shirt sleeves and said "Follow me"—I knew him again as the man who had brought down the goods at Old Change—he led the way and I drove the van into the back gates of the Fairlie Hotel into the yard—he said I was to unload there—he and three or four others assisted to unload—some of the goods were taken into the house and some were left in the yard—Prout asked me how much there was to pay for the hire of the van—I said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as agreed"—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my master and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for myself—it was a heavy load—after I was paid I drove home—after a short time, from what I heard, I gave a description of the men to Spittle, the officer—I am quite sure Prout is the man who paid me, and one of the two who brought the goods down—I have an idea that. Chapman helped to unload—I believe he was there.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070042"></xptr>
               <p>the rest"—I asked him when he received them—he said "On the morning of the 7th they were brought in a van to my place"—I asked him from where—he said he did not know—I asked him whether he knew the name of the carman who brought them—he said he did not, and he did not know the name of the carman who took them from his own place to Burton's—he said he sent a boy who was hanging about for a carman, and he would not know who he was until he had received the account—I asked him whether he knew Hall—he said "I purchased some things of him about twelve months ago, but never knew his address"—I tried to find Hall &amp; Co., but there is no 196, Mincing Lane—I telegraphed to Cornwall, and Prout was taken into custody—I went down and saw him at the police-station at St. German's—I read the warrant to him, and he said he did not understand it—I brought him to London, and when the charge was read over to him at Bow Lane Station I said "The property referred to in the warrant is that which you assisted in removing from Mr. Green's warehouse on 1st January last"—he said "I know all about it"—I know the Fairlie Hotel—Prout lives about 400 yards from it—Chapman was taken on 23rd February—I did not take him myself.</p>

I first saw Chapman on 15th January, and he was taken into custody on the 23rd February—he was always to be found between those dates—I saw him when I wanted to—he professed to be anxious to give me all the information he could—I have heard that these goods, after they left Mr. Green's, were offered for sale to a commission dealer of the name of Woolf—I have not heard that he declined to buy them because there was no invoice made out—I know Mr. Waller, Mr. Burton's foreman; he might have been the person who told me—I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion of Chapman saying he had been to Fenchurch Street to find Mr. Hall—I won't undertake to say he did not—he told me that he had advertised these goods, or caused them to be advertised, several times for sale—he told me he had given Mr. Burton instructions to advertise them, and the pro<lb></lb>perty was discovered there by the catalogue.</p>

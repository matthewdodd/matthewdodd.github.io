                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Joynson of North Gray, Kent—on 28th March, I went by his direction to a stable in Cleveland-row, St. James's—I had this advertisement with me—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "For sale, a pair of handsome dappled-grey geldings, six years old, fifteen hands three inches high; step and go well together, fast action, good hunters, warranted sound, a trial allowed, price moderate. To be seen at 1, Russel-court, Cleveland-road, St. James's")—I did not see the defendant that day, but I went on the Monday following and saw the groom, who said he would fetch his master, and brought the prisoner—I told him that I had come about that advertise<lb></lb>ment—the prisoner told me that his name was Henry Sinclair, he had had the horses two years, and driven them at Malvern and Bath last summer,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120018"></xptr>
               <p>that they were perfectly free from vice, and he could warrant them perfectly sound in every description; and that they had never been in any dealer's hands—he said that his estate was in Leamington in Warwickshire, that his son had ridden one of the horses in hunting, which was the reason he did not carry so much flesh as the other, that his daughter had ridden the other, but had given up doing so, as she was under medical treatment, and that was the reason he was parting with them—he asked me if his servant had told me anything respecting the horses, and I said that he had given me a very good character with them—the groom was the man whom I had seen on the Saturday—Mr. Dorkin went with me, on 1st April, to pay for the horses—I did not see him pay for them, but I heard the prisoner tell his servant to deliver them up to me, which he did—the prisoner told me not to go away without seeing him, and after the horses were paid for, he came back, gave me a sovereign, and told me to get some refreshment, and then I took the horses home—on the Monday the prisoner gave me the note to take home to my master—(<hi rend="italic">This note stated that Mr. Sinclair had many times refused 100 guineas for the horses, the price of them being 120 guineas, that they were six years old, and he would warrant them free from vice or blemish, and would return the money at any time within three months if the horses were not approved of</hi>)—The prisoner said, on the Monday, that he was in no particular hurry to sell the horses as he should not require the stables till he and his family came up from Leamington at the end of May, when he should require them for a pair of cobs—I took the horses away, and by the time I got to Westminster-bridge, I found that they were both roarers, but I took them home—I went back to the stables next day, but could neither find the prisoner or the groom—no<lb></lb>body knew anything of them—I believed that he was a private gentleman at Leamington, and told my master so—if I had known that he was a dealer, I should not have advised my master to buy the horses.</p>

               <p>horses, and on his coming, I said that I came on the part of Mr. Joynson to pay for the horses—he said that they were horses which he had a great regard for, he had had them some time, they were quiet to ride and drive in single and double harness, and had been used by his daughter and wife, but on account of ill health he no longer wanted them, haying another pair which were more suitable for his purpose; and he spoke of Leamington, in War<lb></lb>wickshire, where he had some place or estate, and where the horses were very well known—the other person was dressed as a groom; he had a blue coat with bright buttons, and when I asked fur Mr. Sinclair, he said he would fetch his master, and went away, and returned with the prisoner, who gave directions to him as a groom, saying, "Mind you feed them before they go out of the stable," and the groom said, "Yes, Sir"—I paid the 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me this receipt on black-edged paper, "1, Russel-court, St. James's, 1st April, 1862.

Henry Sinclair"—I should not have parted with the money if I had not believed that he was not a horse-dealer, but that they were his own private property—I believed his state<lb></lb>ment that they were used in his own family—he said that it was usual to give a gratuity to the grooms each—I said, "Very well, I shall give your groom a sovereign"—he said, "I shall do the like."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Mary Crav—I sent my servant, James Jones, up to London, in consequence of an advertisement I saw in the Times, on 31st March, to look at a pair of geldings—he came back and said that he had seen a pair of very fine horses belonging to a gentleman who had considerable property at Leamington, who had lately lost his wife, whose daughter was very ill, and under the care of some of our great professional men; in consequence of which these horses were useless to him, and he wished to get rid of them, having a pair of cobs which would answer his purpose—my man's impression was that he was a gentleman, that all was right, and therefore he never tried the horses, as he ought, as the prisoner said when he asked for the carriage to try the horses, that it had been sold, and they had no harness—I paid the 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in consequence of the im<lb></lb>pression made on my mind that they were really valuable, good horses; that it was a gentleman who wished to give them up; that they had been driven two years; that one of them had been ridden by his daughter; and that they were worth the money—I had not time to go to London to buy them—I should not have bought them had I known the prisoner to be a dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing-clerk to Messrs. Aldridge and Brom<lb></lb>ley, the Crown Solicitors in Bankruptcy—I know the prisoner; but as to whether he is William Thomas Cook, I cannot say—I have seen him in Whitecross-street Prison—these proceedings relate to the bankruptcy of William Thomas Cook, who I believe to be the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">The petition was dated March 17th, 1862, from William Thomas Cook, commission agent, a prisoner in Whitecross-street, of 13, Princes-street, and of Lambeth, in the County of Surrey; which was accompained by his affidavit, stating that he had not the meant of paying the fees.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined). Q.</hi> Is he not compelled, under the new Act, to petition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—it is not one of the cases where the Registrars went to clear the gaols—there would be no petition there—the prisoner was not there when the Registrar went, but the Registrar might go again after the prisoner had filed his petition—I believe it is not usual to ascertain whether a bankrupt has given the right address—he has to swear to the truth of it.</p>

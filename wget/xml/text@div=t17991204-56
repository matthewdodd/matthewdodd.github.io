             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a dustman: On the 14th of July, I was in my master's yard, in Scotland-yard, adjoining to Wood's-wharf; about five o'clock in the morning I heard some watermen crying, stop thief, I immediately jumped over the pales belonging to my master's yard, and ran by the water-men; I immediately saw three men run away from a boat loaded with goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their persons? - A. I followed them till such time as Orrell was caught; I I saw Mackaway after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other person? - A. I think the next person, the third, was rather stouter in the face, and rather a darker complexion than the prisoner; I cannot positively swear to the man, it is a long time ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far were you from the person that you suppose to be of a darker complexion? - A. About five yards, and sometimes three.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HATTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private in the guards; about five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 14th of July, I heard a cry of stop thief; my comrade, Harris, and I saw three men come running up a street from the water-side, I believe it was Hungerford-street; I did not know the name of the street, and a man running after them; the man said, those are the three men, soldiers why do not you stop them; Orrell, and Mackaway, crossed the street, and ran up the court, and a third man took up another court, and both the courts led into Round-court; I was so nigh to Orrell and Mackaway, that the prisoner could not get in between them and me; then he turned back into the Strand, and I looked strait at him as he turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and tell us if you know the man? - A. I have no doubt that that is the man that I saw running; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This man has only been taken up a few days? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The transaction you have been speaking of was in July last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been walking along Piccadilly since? - A. No; I have been in Piccadilly but once since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of a reward of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a part of the eighty pounds reward in the former case? - A. I had something for my trouble in taking Orrell.</p>
               <p>Q. And if this man should be convicted you will get something more? - A. I expect to be paid for my loss of time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private soldier; I was with Hatton on Sunday morning, the 14th of July; I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw three men coming up the street from the river, Tyler was following them, and calling out, stop thief; they ran across the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040039"></xptr>street, up towards New-street, Covent-garden; I did not know them before.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a part of the reward upon the other trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect how much you received upon that occasion? - A.Four pounds ten shillings, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not often receive so large a sum as that? - A. Not without I earn it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very considerable sum for a man in your station in life to receive? - A. I have received more at times.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before, upon the trial of the other men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying then, that you did not see the face of any one person more than a minute? - A. I saw it more thatn two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes sight do you think you had of the third man? - A. I went two hundred and fifty yards side by side with the prisoner, as near as I can recollect; he was not running then, he was walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him? - A. I called to Tyler, and said, this is the man, and he took a spring directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a view of his face more than two or three minutes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was five months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think you may very likely mistake the person of a man that you had seen but once, and that five months ago? - A. To be sure one man may be like another; but I am positively certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Besides the reward in the other case, there is an additional reward if this man is convicted? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been often in Piccadilly since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time was it that you saw his face for two minutes, was it while you were going these two hundred and fifty yards by his side? - A. Yes; and the time that he passed me in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a view of his face the whole of that two hundred and fifty yards? - A. Yes; I took a good look of him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BECKET sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Mackaway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the prisoner before the 13th of July? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know him now? - A. Yes; I have no doubt but he is the man; on Saturday, the 13th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, he came to me and Orrell at the Waterman's-arm, Bank-side, Southwark; Mackaway brought him to the Waterman's arms; Mackaway then said, he would go out and fetch the things; I did not know what things they were; then we all went out together, then Orrell asked me, whether I could borrow a fail; then Orrell and I rowed from Mason's-stairs, Bank-side, which leads from the Waterman's-arms, and went over the water; what became of Mackaway and the stranger I do not know, they went out; Orrell and I took the boat and rowed over to the Surry-side of Blacksriars-Bridge; then we walked from thence to the Waterman's-arms, at Masons-stairs, and we found the stranger sitting there.</p>

               <p>Q. Who do you mean by the stranger? - A. The prisoner at the bar; Mackaway then came in, in a few minutes with a basket; we stopped there till about five o'clock, and one of them said, that we should go; then we all of us went to one Wells's in the Upper ground, as you cross the road to Blacksriars-bridge, and go towards the shot manufactory; we stopped there till it was near seven o'clock, and then me and Orrell went to the waterside to see how the tide was, to see whether it was stood; the prisoner and Mackaway stood upon the steps, the wind blew hard; I went back and told them it was not stood, and the prisoner said, he was positively sure it was stood, and insisted upon going; then one of them, I cannot say which it was, gave me a basket, and told me to put it in a dry place, and I put it in the boat's foreships under the head, the basket was sewed up quite close; one of them, I cannot tell which, asked me how long it would take to row to Richmond; I said, it would take two hours, or two hours and a half; the prisoner said it would be three hours and longer; then we all four went up to Chelsea; we set off about four or five minutes after seven o'clock at night, and stopped at the Magpye-and-stump at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Peacock). Is this one of the persons that came to your house? - A. Yes; he was the last that came up.</p>
               <p>Becket. We got there about eight o'clock; Mackaway, Orrell, and the prisoner at the bar went in first, and I stopped to hawl the boat up, and they called out at the window to me to get some onions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to them? - A.In about ten minutes; when I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040040"></xptr>in they had got some bread and cheese and beer upon the table, I gave them the onions; we stopped there as nigh as I can guess an hour, or an hour and twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular discourse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the reckoning? - A. Orrell borrowed a shilling of me towards it; the reckoning I believe came to two shillings and eightpence, the money was put upon the table; it was two shillings and eightpence, or somewhere thereabouts; I do not know who paid the rest; then we all went away together, about twenty minutes or half an hour after nine; then we went up the river, and landed where there was a green grass-plat, and it appeared to me as if there was a church in it; the prisoner was the man who shewed me where to land; when we got there, one of them asked me for the basket that I had put at the head of the boat; I gave it to one of them, and they took it up the grass-plat; they all three went up the grassplat, and took something out of the basket, and then brought the basket back, and threw it into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. As near as I can tell, about twelve o'clock, it was just at high water.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to be three hours going from Chelsea to Twickenham? - A. The wind blew very hard, and beyond Richmond the tide was very dead, sometimes it runs no farther than Kew; in about twenty minutes, or half an hour, Orrell came back with two pieces of woollen cloth, he threw them into the boat, and said something, I do not know what, and then he went back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who came next? - A. I cannot say; they went backwards and forwards two or three times a-piece; the prisoner at the bar brought some white parcels, and put them into the boat, they were parcels of Irish cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackaway bring any thing? - A. Yes; they all brought something every time.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time was the last time that they came? - A. They might be gone about an hour, or it might be more; they stood upon the grass, and I heard them say, shall we have any more; what answer was made to it I cannot say; then they came into the boat, and we rowed towards London, and just below Kew-bridge, the prisoner went ashore to get some sacks; one of them said there were some sacks hanging over a barge's side above the bridge; and the prisoner got ashore below the bridge, and returned without any sacks; then we rowed down till we came below the Red-house, and one of them observed that there were some sacks hanging out at a miller's place, and they wanted me to put them ashore; I told them they must walk through the water if they did, for I could not get near it for a hill that runs out; then we came towards Westminster-bridge, and just before we got about to Lambeth, Mackaway and Orrell took the skulls; before that, the prisoner and I had been rowing; before we got to Westminster-bridge, there were some people ashore on the Westminster side of the river, below the bridge; one of them asked me who they were; I told them I believed they were the Police-officers; I then observed Orrell and Mackaway to have pistols in their breeches, I did not observe the prisoner to have any; I desired them to put me ashore, and, after great persuasion, they put me ashore at the uppermost side of Wood's wharf; as I was getting out of the boat, one of them said, how frightened you are; I then left them all three in the boat, and went up the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were taken up? - A. I was not taken up at all, I went to Bow-street and delivered myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. Six or seven days after.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you were admitted a witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you first came into their company? - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. And what time was it when they put you on shore? - A. About five o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Having been in his company all those hours, speak fairly, and honestly if you can, whether the prisoner is the man? - A. I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had a doubt of him? - A. Yes; the first time I thought he was a swarthier man, but when I came to see him a second time, I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you been out of prison? - A. I cannot take upon me to say, I was never in prison but that time; I have been out ever since Mackaway and Orrell were cast.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the first man that got out of the boat, and away you ran as hard as you could run? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a cry of stop thief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that could not mean you, and therefore you did not look back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You tell my Friend you had a doubt - now I ask you if you did not positively say he was not the man? - A. I said he was a swarthier man, and a rounder face, rather a fatter face.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you this, and recollect there is such a thing as the pillory, for people that can be convicted of it, and transportation into the bargain; now, where not your words these, that is not the man, it was a man of a fuller face, and a swarthier complexion? - A. I might say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040041"></xptr>Q. Do not you know you said so? - A. Yes; I have no doubt but those are the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it; are you not sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my learned Friend, that you were thirteen hours in company with the man, and therefore you knew the person, and you could not therefore possibly be mistaken? - A. I was not so positive of him at the first sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting facing of him a part of the time? - A. A very trifling time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with him at different public-houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was light by three o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, having said he was not the man, because he was a swarthier man, how long was it before he was brought up again? - A. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not brought up, not having been suffered to be washed or shaved for those three days, that he might have the appearance of a man of a swarthier complexion? - A. He had a blacker beard than he had on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his face dirty from not having been allowed water? - A. On Saturday I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday, when you said he was not the man, was your examination on oath then taken? - A.There was no examination at all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you then taken away by the officers, and the examination put off for three days? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you had conversations with some of the people about that office? - A. I never had any conversation, only when I was up there.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were up there, you know, on the Wednesday and Saturday? - A. I was not there half an hour on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not dine with them on one of those days? - A. I did not dine with any of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor drink with any of them? - A. Not with the officers; I drank with the soldiers that were witnesses with me.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday you were told the other man was taken? - A.They told me there was a man there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you know before you went, that you were to find the man who had been concerned in the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you had been so told, you said that was not the man, for the man had a swarthier complexion, and a fuller countenance? - A. Those were the words.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what way was the person, you supposed to be the prisoner, dressed? - A. A sort of a reddish snuff-coloured coat, and pearl buttons; he had a long beard on that day, when he went to Twickenham, and boots with clean tops.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Peacock.) Do you recollect how the prisoner was dressed that night? - A. I think he had a brown coat and pearl buttons, and new boots.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You told me, you had heard that the other persons had had a part of the reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not a share of that reward? - A. I had my expences; I had it at the Recorder's office, Carpmeal received it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not a share of the reward; and did you not attend to receive a share of the reward? - A. I had only a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that was your share of the reward? - A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not apply for your expences in Court, and where you not told that you were to have a share of the reward? - A. I expected to have my expences of Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not referred to the next Sessions for your share of the reward? - A. Mr. Carpmeal ordered me to come here, I did not know what it was for, I was sent for; I told Carpmeal he was welcome to that to share it among them, only to pay my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what you were sent for about - do not you know it was a share of the reward? - A. I gave it away; I told Carpmeal it was too much for my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not standing close by the Recorder and his clerk at the time you divided the reward? - A. No; I was a great deal further from him than I am from you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that was your share of the reward? - A. I do not know; whether it was or not I meant to ask Mr. Read for my expences, and Carpmeal told me I was to come the next Sessions for my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he did not tell you, that you were to come for your share of the reward? - A. I don't remember that he did; I told him to take and share it among them, because I did not want any thing of the kind, I wanted only the expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what kind? - A. I did not know then that it was a share of the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that as true as all the rest of your evidence? - A. I did not think it was a share of the reward of the men being hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that, till the present time, you did not know that that two pound note was your share of the reward? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Whether it was for a reward, or whatever it was you felt yourself satisfied for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040042"></xptr>your trouble and expences with less than forty shillings? - A. Yes; and I gave them the rest.</p>

               <p>JOHN AUDSLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a waterman: On Sunday morning, I was at Wood's wharf; I saw some persons in a boat, between four and five in the morning; there were two fitting and two rowing, and the boat looked very deep; we had had information of the robbery; four of us stepped into a boat, and we pursued this boat, and the goods; they found that we came up with them, and they got upon Wood's wharf, and got ashore, and all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of their persons? - A. I know neither of them, but the waterman's boy; and I did not know that it was him till afterwards: we went on board a boat and brought her up to Westminster; we found many bundles of cloths and pieces of linen, and articles of that kind; the boat was taken to a place where I live, and there I took care of them till I delivered them to Carpmeal, the officer. I found also a basket in the boat, but I do not know the contents. There was Mitchell, Herne, and me took the goods out of the boat; we kept them from six to ten or eleven, and then Carpmeal had them; Lawrence took the basket out.</p>

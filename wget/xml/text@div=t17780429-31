I went into the shop to serve a customer, and then went into the parlour again; and the shop being near shut up, I left the door unbolted: just as I had got in I heard the latch move; I went into the shop to see if any body was come in, and saw the door latched: just as I had returned into the parlour, I heard the latch move again; I turned quick about and saw a man go out of the shop in a hurry, with something under his arm; I ran out and pursued him: I ran as far as Brownlow-street, and found I had out-run my strength, and could not catch him. I called, stop thief! and then heard somebody else cry stop thief! I then recollected I had left the shop with nobody in it, and if there were any more of them they might strip the shop; so I ran immediately back. The things were dropped and brought back; they have our mark upon them.</p>

I heard the cry of stop thief! he was taken. I saw him when he was brought back, and knew him again directly.</p>

             (Police-constable S 1.) On Sunday morning, the 23rd of September, I was on duty at Highgate-hill; the prisoner came up, and spoke to me - as he was going along towards Highgate we got in front of a public-house; he went and laid down his head on the trough, and his hat fell into it - I took it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180039"></xptr>found in it a new handkerchief, an old one, a cap, and seven pairs of gloves; I said, "Have you lost any thing?" he said, "Yes, my hat" - I asked if he had lost any thing else; he said Yes, a new cotton handkerchief, a nightcap, and an old handkerchief; I then produced the gloves, and asked if he knew any thing about them - he said No; he claimed the hat - I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was the hat? A. In the trough; there was no water in it; he was not asleep - he was a little in liquor; he did not appear to have been fighting - I meet him every morning when he goes out to work; it was about half-past two o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

On the 22nd of September I saw the prisoner in my shop, in company with two other persons - one of them bought a half-handkerchief; while I was serving them I was called to serve a man at the door; on returning, I saw the prisoner putting a parcel into his pocket, but not suspecting it was any thing of mine, I took no notice of it - he went out before the other men, and said he wanted to go and get some tobacco; I have no doubt of these being my gloves; they have my wife's writing on the paper - I did not miss them till they were brought on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock; I could not miss them from my stock; but when they were brought, I missed some similar to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many pairs of gloves ought you to have had in your stock? A. That is impossible for me to tell - I missed such as these; I have no mark on them; I cannot say the prisoner was sober, but he was not drunk - he was sober; it was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were your gloves wrapped up in a paper of this description? A. Yes; I had but one paper of gloves of this description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop with my mates; I believe they bought a shirt and a handkerchief - we came out together; I saw no gloves - I then went on to Camden-town; I offended one of them, and we quarrelled and fought - the Policeman came, and told me to go home about my business; I then went on to the trough; this Policeman came, took my hat, and took it behind the Flask - when I awoke up I saw two lights, and two Policemen came, and asked if I had lost any thing - they brought these gloves forward, but they were not in my hat at all.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Was there another Policeman with you? A. Yes; the prisoner appeared to be looking about for his hat; his head had been laying down; then he got up, and looked for his hat - I did not consider him tipsy; he was a little in liquor; I had not a light; the other Policeman had - there was only one light at the time he was taken, but another man came up afterwards; I had my Police dress on; he asked me for his hat before I showed it him, but not till I had asked him what he had lost.</p>

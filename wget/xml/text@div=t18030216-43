               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that that which you describe to be a counterfeit, had not been in your pocket before they came into the shop? - A. I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many seven-shilling-pieces had you, besides this? - A.Five good ones; I cried out to my man, Thomas, pursue them, they have done me; I put them all in my pocket, and went in pursuit of the prisoner; from some information I received, we found them in a gin-shop in the neighbourhood; I got there first, then my man,

               <p>Q. Did you weigh the others? - A. I did, they were all good, I gave the bad one to Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, all you had in your pocket, when he came into the shop, were good?- A. Yes, I weighed them five minutes before; I attended before the Alderman, on Monday, he was committed for re-examination on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You are a butcher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Saturday is the busiest day you have? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many paid you gold, and received gold from you in change that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary, when you receive a seven-shilling-piece to weigh it? - A. I always weigh them as soon as I take them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to weigh six seven-shilling-pieces together? - A. On Saturday afternoon, I put the money out of my pocket, at tea, and then I weighed the seven-shilling-pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You weighed these seven-shilling-pieces twice? - A. Yes, when I took them, and when I took them out of the till, and put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How came you to weigh them?- A. I had nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you weigh them? - A. At my desk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160035"></xptr>Q. You weighed them at the desk the first time?- A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dean in the shop when you weighed them the second time? - A. I believe he was, he was hanging up the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he observe your weighing the seven-shilling-pieces? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what a seven-shilling-piece ought to weigh? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear then that it was not weight? - A. It was not weight by the balance we weigh seven-shilling-pieces with.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did they come into your shop?- A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other customers in the shop before? - A. Yes, they went out just as they came in, they gave me a seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh the seven-shilling-piece those persons gave you, before you weighed the seven-shilling-piece you took of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear that it was five minutes before, that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say a while ago, that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces five minutes before, because you had nothing else to do? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me you weighed the six, and this was the second time you weighed them?- A. I weighed the five I took out of the till, and then weighed the sixth.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the constable that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you charge him, before the constable, with having stole two seven-shilling-pieces? - A. No; I said, I did not know till I weighed them, but there might be two; I cannot recollect what I told the constable, he took them and weighed them, and there was only one.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon the oath you have taken, did not you charge the man with having stolen two seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I cannot recollect what I said to the constable, may be I might say two seven-shilling-pieces; I did not know till I weighed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you to say, you only weighed one, and therefore you did not know? - A. After the prisoner went out, I only weighed one in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you weigh the rest? - A. At the watch-house; the constable sent to my house for the weights.</p>
               <p>Q. You said awhile ago, that a seven-shilling-piece was given you by the customer, just as the prisoner came in, had your servant gone out of the shop then? - A. No, he was there all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about that seven-shilling-piece? - A. No, the woman that was with the prisoner, when I weighed the seven-shilling-piece I took of the other people, said, that was a good one.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said, at any time, that you never weighed the money after the time that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not you said, that after you weighed all the seven-shilling-pieces in your pocket, no person came in before the prisoner? - A. No one came into the shop after the prisoner gave the seven-shilling-piece back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that no person came into your shop in the intrim, between your weighing the seven-shilling-pieces, till the prisoner came in? - A. Not after I took the seven-shilling-piece, there were two persons in the shop, when the prisoner and his wife came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you marked the seven-shilling-pieces before you put them in your pocket? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the dates? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no way of distinguishing them, but by the weight? - A. No, I always weigh every one I take.</p>
               <p>Q. Your observation was drawn to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were attending to him, did you see him change either of the seven-shilling-pieces?- A. I saw him take up the seven-shilling-pieces, and throw them down again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him change either of them? - A. I did not know but they were my own two, when he slung them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him change them? - A. I saw him take them up, and throw them down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you see him change them or not? - A. I saw him take my two up, and saw him sling them down again.</p>
               <p>Q. I must have an answer - did you or not see him change the money? - A. I did not know that he changed them, I certainly saw him change them; I did not see the change take place; I did not know what you meant by the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Did not you say you saw him change them? - A. I saw him take them up, and sling them down.</p>

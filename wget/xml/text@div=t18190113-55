On the 24th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I received this money from Mrs. Clarke, at the Star and Garter, public-house, Old Bailey, which I took home and locked up. About seven o'clock I called at the Star and Garter, and saw the prisoner there. Mrs. Clarke asked me, in her presence, if I had taken care of my money? I said I had locked it up in my box. I told the prisoner I had drawn a guinea in gold. I left, returned in about an hour, and found her still there. She asked me to let her go home, and sleep with me, as she was tired, and had a long way to go - she went home with me about half-past ten o'clock - I took 2 s. 6 d. out of my box, and gave it to her to fetch some supper; I showed her the guinea. She said,</p>
               <p>"The sight of gold was good for sore eyes," and returned it to me again. She got some beef, and I then gave her 1 s. to get three half pints of beer; she stopped a long time, and then returned; I told her that I thought she was lost: she said she had met a friend. I asked her for the change two or three times, and she said she would give it to me by-and-by - we went to bed. I locked the door myself, and asked her to put the candle out; she wanted it to be kept alight - I agreed to it. She only pulled off her gown, and took one bone out of her stays, nothing else. About half-past four o'clock I awoke, missed her, and found the candle gone. At daylight I found the key of my box in a different place to where I left it - the box was shut, but not locked, and the money all gone. I got an officer, but could not find her at her lodgings - she was taken on the 30th of December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose you never walked the streets for money - A. No; I was never taken up for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You was never in custody of a watchman, or any one else - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that it was not a guinea that you lost, but a new gold coin - A. The prisoner said it was a new coin.</p>

            . My husband keeps a tailor's shop in Prujean-square, where the prosecutrix lodges. On the 24th of October I met her and the prisoner on the stairs; I went into the room, and she asked the prisoner to fetch her some beef, unlocked her box, and took out a guinea, put it in again, and gave the prisoner half-a-crown, she returned in about half an hour. Fletcher asked for the change four times, but the prisoner made her no answer, She gave her 1 s. to get some beer, and I went away - next morning the prosecutrix missed her money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prosecutrix lodged with you - A. Fourteen or fifteen months - she left me before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. About a week before she went away, she brought a man home with her at night, and he gave her in charge, saying, she had robbed him of a 1 l. note - he afterwards found he had got his money.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's; I know the prosecutrix; my beat is in the Old Bailey, she was given in my charge for calling out Stop thief! after a gentleman, nine weeks ago, about twelve o'clock at night; she charged him with robbing her of 5 s.; he offered to be searched, and no such money was found on him - the constable of the night discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you have her again - A. On the 23d of November last, I was calling twelve o'clock, and was fetched to Mr. Curtis's house; there was a cry of murder, and great disorder in the house; Curtis found the door open. We found her, and a sailor there; Mr. Curtis gave them both in charge. The man charged her with robbing him of a 1 l. note - they were discharged before the Alderman, I know the prosecutrix is a common prostitute, and very much addicted to drink.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and am a married woman; my husband is a brush-maker, and lives in Russell-court, Drury-lane. The prosecutrix called on me, and said my sister had robbed her of 5 l. 16 s. all in silver, except a new gold coin, and unless the money was brought forward, she would hang her. I saw my sister, and called on the prosecutrix at Curtis's; Mrs. Curtis said the prosecutrix was so drunk that night that she wanted to go out with my sister, but she persuaded her not to go, fearing that if she got down stairs, she should not be able to get her up again.</p>

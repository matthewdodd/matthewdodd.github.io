On the 1st of February, between twelve and two o'clock, I gave her leave to play in the court with her skipping rope; she had a row of beads and a coat on; she came in in a short time without them, crying, and complained of being robbed. She was playing in the court ten or twelve days after, and ran in to me. I went out and called to a man to lay hold of the prisoner. I pursued and took her in Southampton-street, running towards Covent-Garden, and told her she had stolen my child's neck-lace. She denied it, and said, I had no authority to take her, as I was not an officer. I took her back - the child came down, and said she was the girl who had robbed her. She denied it. I sent for Trueman, who was with the child, and she said she was the girl.</p>

            . My father is a shoe-maker, and lives in Denmark-court. I was playing with Murphy; she had a coat on and beads. I saw the prisoner take her down the court, but did not see where she took her to. I saw her again in about two hours, going to look for her coat. I am sure the prisoner is the girl. I have known her some years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's, and am agent to the Mint—on 8th April, in consequence of information I went to 21, Dudley Street, between 1 and 2 o'clock, with Inspector Brannan and several other officers—we went to the second floor front room and saw the three prisoners—Reardon was partly undressed, and I said to him, "Well, Mr. Barlow, I need not tell you who I am, I have called to pay you another visit. You are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession. We come here with a search warrant"—at that time Hinds handed me this packet, partly open, wrapped up in this piece of carpet—I opened it—it contained three separate packets, containing six crowns, 200 half-crowns and shillings, all counterfeit—I said to Reardon, "You will have to account for the possession of these"—he said, "I am very sorry for it, but not here"—they were all in tissue paper, with paper lapped between them in ten piece packets—Evans then said, "This is what I have got by serving others"—Hurley said, "I only came here for a little washing"—I have</p>

On 8th April I was on duty, and saw Hurley coming up Dudley Street, St. Giles's, with a little carpet parcel in her apron, which was turned up in this form—I followed her to the second floor front room at 21, Dudley Street—she went into the room, and shut the door—I pushed it open, it was not locked, and found the three prisoners there—I asked Hurley for the parcel she had just brought in—she said that she brought no parcel—Evans was standing behind the door—I said to Reardon, "Halloa, Barlow!"—he said, "You have come again"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You have been here before"—I said, "I know I have"—I heard something drop on the floor, and saw a motion of Evans' foot, who was standing at the head of the bed—I found this parcel under the bed, and gave it to Mr. Brannan—Evans tried to get out of the room, but I stopped her—I was alone at first, as the other officers were a minute and a half or two minutes behind me—we took all the prisoners in custody, and also a woman who came in, who lives with Reardon as his wife—she has been discharged.</p>

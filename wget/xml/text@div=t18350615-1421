                  </hi>. I am servant to John Giles Pilcher and Jeremiah Pilcher—in consequence of suspicion, I marked some pieces of indigo, in a chest in the colour-room, with chalk—I afterwards missed them—On Thursday, the 21st of May, the prisoner came down from the work-room—I watched him—he went into the colour-room—I went outside the warehouse to the window of the colour-room—the chest was under another window, right opposite the window I was at—I saw him lift up the lid of the chest with one hand, and put the other hand in—he closed the chest and took his paste-pot, and filled it with paste—he came and put down his paste-pot—then returned to the colour room—lifted up the lid of the chest again, and put his other hand in; but I could not see at either time whether he took any tiling out, in consequence of the lid—he closed the chest—I came round and met him at the colour-room door—he seemed much confused—I told my employers directly—his hand was all blue, and his shirt, wrist, and forehead—he worked up above—his business was with the black lead, he bad no business in the colour-room, but to fetch paste—he had been in the employ between four and five years—he was in the habit of putting his black lead box on a firkin in the work-room—he bore an honest cha<lb></lb>racter before this was discovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Pilcher. On Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 13th of May, Gawkrodger was sent to weigh 21bs. of indigo—in consequence of information he gave me, I went and examined it—I found there was a deficiency, and some pieces were marked with a pen-knife—I marked six pieces width my own hand—I have since seen one of the pieces found in the tub in the prisoner's shop, where he worked—it was one of the pieces I marked—there were other pieces besides, not marked at all—four of the pieces I marked remained where they had been—one was missing, and one found in the firkin—I afterwards saw a piece of indigo, said to be found off the premises, but it was covered with purple-brown, and I could not swear to it; but I believe it to be the same indigo—it was not exactly the mark I made—there appears to be a mark on the bottom more than I put, which creates a doubt in my mind whether it is the same—on the Thursday and Friday after the indigo was marked, he went oftener than he need for paste—the paste-pan stood on the indigo chest—on the Saturday, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner came down for paste—I watched him when he came out, his hands were quite blue, and I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to my employers—on Wednesday I weighed 21bs. of indigo, and placed it on one side of the indigo chest—on Thursday morning, when I went to work, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I found the colour-room door opened, without a key—I found the shutter taken down, the paste-pan removed, and a bag shifted from one end of the chest to the other, and some of the indigo taken out—that found in the firkin was a different sort to that I weighed up—it is a sort of indigo that has been missed from bags—the 2lbs. had been weighed to detect the person, but none of that was found in the firkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men are in your master's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never counted them—there was no one but myself and Gawkrodger en<lb></lb>titled to weigh indigo—I have the sole charge of the colour-room—any body might go in, but nobody but us go in without being specially noticed—I never heard of the reward—I have not been in the employ six months—I believe there are four men and a boy in the warehouse, but the town-ware-house forms quite a separate concern altogether—the prisoner worked in a room which has two sides and an end—it is not an open place—it is a con<lb></lb>fined place, as it is set apart for him to make up black lead—it Is boarded off from the warehouse, but there is no door to it—there is a door-way—there is a firkin in it, the prisoner uses it to put his black lead on, he has a box or another firkin, and puts the box on the two to keep it even—the indigo was found just underneath his counter—some paste was found over it—he had been noticed to go more frequently for paste than he could want it—some of the chalked indigo was gone—we informed Mr. Pilcher—I know nothing of a man named Russell weighing any—I never heard a word of the reward before to-night—Gawkrodger never mentioned it to me—</p>

               <p>I did not stop the prisoner when I saw his hands blue—I pointed him out on the Saturday night, when his jacket stuck out—that was the Saturday before the Thursday that he was taken—the key of the indigo-room hung up in the warehouseman's little office—no person has a right to that key but my<lb></lb>self, who unlock the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Describe more particularly where the prisoner worked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a small space, boarded off the warehouse—it has a little door-way at the top of a ladder—no one can go to it without going up the ladder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he went to the paste more frequently that be ought to have done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he used it to paste black lead labels—he should come down once a day; but he came down two or three times, and there was a large quantity of paste found wrapped in paper in his place, about as much as his pan would hold—any person had the means of putting paste there; but he would be sure to find it out by lifting up his box—the place was appropriated entirely for him to work in, and to get to it you must go up a ladder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, What are the hours of work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From six o'clock in the morning till seven at night—the other workmen were employed the same hours—a quantity of paste was found in his place, put aside quite fresh, as if it had not been used—as if he had gone oftener than he need for it—I saw the indigo found under his counter, with the paste and other rubbish on it—the paste was immediately above the indigo—here is one piece, which was found in the tub—I can identify it—it is one of the six pieces I marked on the 13th of May—I have no means of judging when it was taken; but I missed it on the Saturday morning, and found it on the 21st.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I recollect the prisoner's being sent for into the counting-house—Mr. Pilcher said, "I have sent for you, in the presence of the officer, on suspicion of stealing indigo"—he said he was very sorry they should think that—Mr. Pilcher gave him into custody, and sent one of his men to the station-house, to enter the charge—his hands, face, and forehead were all over blue at the time, and his shirt—I afterwards searched his work-room, and found in a half<lb></lb>firkin, concealed under a quantity of shavings and cuttings of paper and paste, this indigo, which weighs two pounds and a half—I examined it before the witnesses who were with me at the time, and saw me find it in the firkin—I afterwards went into the indigo-room—I found a handker<lb></lb>chief outside the indigo-chest, on one side of the bench—I afterwards went to a room in Snow's-fields—the prisoner was not with me—I went there by his master's directions—I never saw the prisoner there, or heard from him that it was his lodging—I found this lump of indigo there, in a cup<lb></lb>board in the room—I did not take the number of the house—the two wit<lb></lb>nesses went with me.</p>

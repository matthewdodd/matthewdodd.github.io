                  </hi>. I am a recruiting sergeant stationed at New-cross, Deptford. On 22d November, between 9 and 10 in the evening, the prisoner came into the Little Crown beer-shop, and asked me to enlist him in the Royal Marines—I told him I was not engaged for that duty, but I would enlist him in the Rifle Brigade—he agreed to that—I asked him if he had ever served in the Army, the Marines, or the Ordnance—he said "No"—I then gave him the enlisting shilling, and drew a billet for him—I took him before the doctor next morning, and in consequence of what he said, I made inquiries as to whether he had been in the service before—he said "No"—I made further inquiries, and gave him in custody—he stated then that his name was not Gosling.</p>

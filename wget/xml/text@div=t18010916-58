             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep a house, No. 11, Denmark-street, St. Giles's: On Sunday morning, the 19th of July, about two o'clock, I was alarmed that the house had been broke open; I got up, but could not discover where they had got in; before I went to bed, I had tried the outer door, and found the spring lock fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, was it light? - A. Not clearly; for there was a parcel in the passage, and it could not be distinguished what it was till a light was called for.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were alarmed, how did you find your doors inside the house? - A. The parlour door had been forced; the brass box, which receives the lock, was pushed on one side the door of the front room on the first floor, appeared to have been forced by tools applied on the outside, for the whole of the pannel was split down; the papers in the desk were strewed about the parlour, the desk having been forced open; the two parlours had been robbed; the front room up one pair of stairs, which Mr. Williams occupied, and the front kitchen-door, was broke; but I don't know that any thing was taken out of it; Mr. Williams had a padlock upon the front kitchen-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose the persons must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160042"></xptr>have been in the house? - A. If they had done it in the most expeditious manner, they could not have done it in less than an hour; it could not have been day-light when they got into the house; there were matches lying at my room door, which had the appearance of having been used.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the three prisoners, and tell me whether, before the 19th of July, you were acquainted with their persons? - A. Yes, all three of them. On the 19th of July, at near half past two o'clock in the morning, going past the end of Denmark-street, in Crown-street, (Mr. Bateson's house is the third door from Crown-street,) I observed the prisoner Freake, Nowland, and another man, whom I believe to be Whitfield, but I cannot be certain, for, as he passed me, he huddled among the rest; there was also a butcher with them; there were four of them; Nowland was the last man; Freake and the butcher had a bundle huddled between them close to the wall. I saw them come from the porch-way of Mr. Bateson's door, from inside the railing, and they all turned into Freake's house, the corner of Dudley-court. I live right opposite Freake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then day-light? - A. It was just break of day; just the twilight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been any break of day an hour before that? - A. No, nor half an hour. I could not get proper assistance till between six and seven; I alarmed Mr. Bateson about a quarter of an hour after I had first seen them; I went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, from what had been done, that it could have been effected in an hour? - A. I don't think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards apprehend either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, Freake was the first; I apprehended him that very morning, about seven o'clock, near his own house; we searched him and his house, but found nothing; I was at the apprehending of Nowland; I went to search him, and he pulled a bundle of papers out of his pocket, and said, this is what you want, I suppose; which turned out to be bank-notes. Black has the notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether Freake has a brother or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are not very unlike one another? - A. There is a difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Slater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that you had forgot what you had said at Bow-street, and wished him to remind you? - A. No such thing; he told me he had got a subpoena, and I said, all he had to do was to speak the truth, as to what I said when I called him off his beat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are the two brothers so much alike, that you could mistake one for the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was this man, and not his brother? - A. Yes.</p>

I go out to work; I have been at Mr. Freake's house these three months; he was taken up on Sunday, the 19th of July; the night before he had been at Mr. Powell's, and came home about half eleven, or near twelve o'clock; I was up ironing; he was very much in liquor, so much that he was brought home, and his wife put him to-bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your room near his? - A. Yes, he has to go through my room to get into his; his wife called me up the next morning at five o'clock, and I then saw him in bed.</p>

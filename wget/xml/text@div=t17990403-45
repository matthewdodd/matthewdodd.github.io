            , and a man of the name of John, a foreigner, and Smith and his brother, and Alger; there was nobody else in the tap-room; a woman came in that knew Macdonald, and she asked him what he had to drink, and he said, he had a glass of gin; it was agreed that they should toss up for a quartern; Macdonald tossed, and Stevenson said, toss her again, and if you lose, I will pay for it; they tossed again, and then Smith said, who was to pay for it; Macdonald said, he had won it, and then he desired them to take the gin away; I saw that the two Smiths wanted to quarrel with Macdonald, and I got up, and then Stevenson struck me twice; as soon as I recovered myself, I saw Macdonald lying upon his back, struggling, in the hands of both the Smiths, and Alger; I cried out murder, and going towards the door, I called out watch, and as soon as the watchman came up, I do not know how Macdonald got liberated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say what they wanted of Macdonald? - A. No, I believe it was intentional; he was knocked down under the table, and he was begging for mercy; it was a house I frequented.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Smith's a respectable house? - A. Not while he kept it; he was there about a fortnight, I believe; I saw a great deal of gentlemen there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was a very disreputable house while Smith kept it? - A. In what respect? I met with no ill treatment there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an improper house to go into? - A. They were apparently gentlemen there.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you called it a bad house; you used the house yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Macdonald thrown upon the table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And saw all that passed while he was upon the table? - A. As much as I could; I was in a great deal of danger myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord all that passed? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How much gin had you drank before you went there? - A. I cannot tell you; we had drank a little ale, but to the best of my knowledge there was not more than a quartern of gin between us before that, and I had a glass of gin in the morning part.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in the afternoon part, now? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had you stopped at a quartern, or did not you drink your share of above two quarterns of gin before you went into the house? - A. Here are a number of gentlemen coming here that did not see any thing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Answer the question? - A. I cannot say how much I had had, but I was sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many public houses had you called at? - A. In coming from Bow-street we had a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. I cannot say; we stopped and had some ale between Marlborough-street and Margaret street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then you had drank some gin before you got to Marlborough-street? - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many houses did you stop at before you got to Smith's? - A. One house, but I cannot say what the name of the house was; we drank between six of us half a pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How much gin did you drink in Smith's house? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call at any other house, nor drink any other gin, but what you have described to my Lord? - A. No, we did not, but at one house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the London Apprentice? - A. Yes, in Margaret-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the house where you drank the gin? - A. No, I drank some ale there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any gin there? - A. No, I did not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you drink any gin there? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, at Smith's house, were you not so drunk, that the landlady of the house, Mrs. Smith, refused you any more gin and any more liquor? - A. I believe she is a woman quite the reverse; she did not care who was drunk, if she got the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not refused by Mrs. Smith any more liquor, because you were so drunk? - A. Macdonald had half a pint of gin, and I heard nothing about her refusing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that Macdonald ordered half a pint of gin? - A. I did not order it, but it was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macdonald order it? - A. To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that Macdonald ordered it? - A. I cannot swear it, it was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it brought by the order of Macdonald? - A. It was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

I live in Margaret-street, opposite the house of Mr. Smith; I am an engine-maker; I make instruments of agriculture; I have turned my dwelling-house into a warehouse, and have a lodging in the house of Mr. Smith; I was in the house from the time that Dwyer and Macdonald came in, till they went away again; they were both very drunk apparently, I am certain of that; they had all the appearance of being very drunk, and they were very riotous.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the prisoners all there or not? - A. I am not certain whether they were all there; Macdonald and Dwyer had not been in ten minutes; Smith did not stay then above then minutes or a quarter of an hour; after some time Dwyer went out, and left Macdonald sitting in the box; he wanted to get some more liquor to drink, and Mrs. Smith refused to let him have any more; then Macdonald got swearing very violently at Joseph Smith, and then gave him a slap in the face, and that was the beginning of the assault.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you there when the watchman came? - A. Yes; Joseph Smith went to call the watch; the watch came, as far as I can understand, to the door, but I did not see them, I heard them; I heard the watchman say, he would not come into the house; Macdonald and Dwyer went out just at that time; I followed them as fast as possible, and not a word about robbing them was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said about a pocket-book or Bank-notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body thrown down while you were there? - A. There never was such a thing; I am sure that neither of the three prisoners touched any body that night; Dwyer was very drunk, and he swore he would sight; he struck me, and I struck him again.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing said about losing any money that night? - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard Macdonald say how much he had lost? - A. No, I heard Dwyer mention, that his friend Macdonald had lost about 40l.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who called the watch? - A. Joseph Smith and Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be sober or otherwise? - A. They were very drunk, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>- HEYLYN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a hair-dresser: I was at Smith's house, I live with my father, in Wells-street, Oxford-road; Macdonald and Dwyer came into the house very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they conduct themselves, at the time they came in, like drunken people? - A. They did; they had some porter first of all, and after that they had some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. That did not make them less drunk, I should think? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Joseph and

            , and Alger, there, at the time they came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Henry Smith in the tap-room all the time they were there? - A. No; he was absent after about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing happened before he retired? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent? - A. I suppose it might be an hour, he was absent during the whole of the affray; I understood he was asleep, he was called in, by Mrs. Stevenson, after Macdonald and Dwyer were gone; a German went to light his pipe at the candle where Macdonald sat, and he would not let him; and, in the scuffle, with his elbow, Macdonald broke a square of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether it was his head or his elbow? - A. It was his elbow that broke one square; and on the other side of the house there were two squares broke, but how he broke them I do not know; but there was nobody near it but himself, and he was very much in liquor; Mrs. Smith refused to give them any more liquor, and Macdonald struck Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Gentlemen, have you now any doubt?</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. We are satisfied with respect to two of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I need not ask you if, upon the table, you saw Joseph Smith put his hand into his pocket, and take from him a pocket-book? - A. If he had I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macdonald, while he was in the house, complain that he had been robbed of a pocket-book, either upon the table or any where else? - A. Upon my oath, he never did that evening.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a German: I was at Mr. Smith's when Dwyer came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they drunk or sober? - A. They were not sober, they were not quiet all the time they were in the room; Macdonald used me not well, I wanted to light a pipe, and he took the candlestick in his hand and would not let me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who broke the window? - A. Macdonald, with his elbow; he had the candlestick up in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he complain of being robbed? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macdonald and Dwyer call the watch, or did any person from the house call the watch? - A. It was Mr. Smith's brother who called the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly the Gentlemen of the Jury's consciences are in their own breasts, they are not in mine, or else I should have thought the cause had long ago got to its end; generally speaking, the feeling of the human breast is inclined to mercy; and before Juries find themselves warranted to give a verdict, involving the life of a fellow creature, they expect something not amounting to absolute demonstration, but judging mainly from the circumstances, throwing mercy into the scale of justice; and it oftentimes falls to my lot, and to the lot of those who fill the same situation much oftener, to caution Juries from yielding too much to their feelings, than to caution them on the other side; sometimes one feels it necessary, when one sees an improper leaning, doing great credit certainly to the feelings of the parties, but not dispensing, as it ought, the administration of justice; it is essential to the ends of justice, that Juries should summon up the fortitude of men in judging upon their fellow creatures; but I do not know whether, upon this occasion, it is not for the Judge to call upon the Jury to be certain that they are not proceeding upon grounds which will not bear them out. Here are three persons called upon to answer with their lives, for it is a capital offence, and the cause had proceeded a great way, when I thought myself called upon to put the Jury in mind that the evidence for the prosecution being closed, they had made no case upon earth against two of the prisoners; - why the indictment extended to those two, against whom no evidence was given, God knows, it was very improper; that interposition of mine, perhaps, was premature, and I yielded to the better judgment of the Gentlemen of the Jury; since that time, you, Gentlemen, have unanimously acquitted those two men. Then in what posture does the case stand against the other? The prosecutor has sworn that his pocket-book was taken from him; he has sworn, at the same time, to other facts, that he and his companion were sober; he swears that he did not break any of the windows, but that his head was knocked through the window; and upon his evidence, and his only, depends the life of the prisoner; he has sworn that the prisoner took his pocket-book, in that fact he is not contradicted; in all the other facts of the case, is there any one in which he has not been contradicted by one, two, three, or four witnesses? - They all swear that both of them were very drunk, very tipsey; - Why then was his head knocked through the window? - Three witnesses have sworn directly the contrary. The German, who is not very conversant in our language, swears it was done with the candlestick; it was not very easy, perhaps, to distinguish whether it was done with the candlestick or the elbow; these witnesses all swear that he began the riot, that he would not suffer this poor German to light his pipe. The witnesses for the prosecution swear that they were not refused liquor because they were drunk, they swear that Henry Smith was a chief in the riot the whole time; whereas Mrs. Stevenson swears to his being asleep during the whole of the affray. There is another circumstance: when the watchman was fetched, it is sworn by every one of the witnesses that he was called by Joseph Smith; - did the prosecutor complain of the robbery smarting under the injury he had received - It is sworn by all the witnesses he did not. I am now addressing twelve Gentlemen possessing humanity, while they are administering the justice of the country, but I can hardly suppose that this is evidence upon which they are to deliberate upon the life of a fellow creature. I have stopped the evidence; if you are not satisfied, the evidence shall proceed till you shall unanimously say you are satisfied, or till you shall unanimously say that this man shall go to the gallows and be executed. If you have the least doubt, the case ought to proceed to be sure.</p>
               <p>The Jury immediately pronounced a verdict of</p>
               <p>NOT GUILTY.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Lord KENYON.</p>

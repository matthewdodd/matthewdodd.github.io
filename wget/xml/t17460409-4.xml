When I went up to them on Sunday Morning, the Woman, the Prisoner, said, I am going away; I said when; she said on Sunday Night; I said, How must I come by my Sheets? They would have paid me for Lodging, but I would not take it. Says the Prisoner, d - n your Eyes, it is Sunday and I do not care to make a Noise: She damn'd me for a Bitch, that I should do my worst; and her Husband said, I'll blow your Brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of their having your Sheets?</p>

               <p>Detrose. No, my Lord; but the Prisoner appear'd very well, she wore a Couple of Gold Rings upon her Fingers, and I thought they would give me my Sheets again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they leave their Lodgings?</p>
               <p>Detrose. They left their Lodgings about six Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you demanded the Sheets then they gave you this Sort of Language you mention'd?</p>

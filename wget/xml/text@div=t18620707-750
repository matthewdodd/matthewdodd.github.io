Cocks and Co.—I made up the order, and sent it to the Eastern Counties Railway Company—partly in accordance with the order, instead of two pieces, I ordered one to be put up—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 14, New Charles-street, Hackney-road, and am a porter in the service of the Eastern Counties' Railway Company—I recollect, on the 26th June, receiving a parcel from the last witness—this is it—about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner—he asked me for a parcel for Messrs. Cocks and Co., of Hertford—I handed this one to him, and asked him if that was it—he said "Yes," and took it from me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. From Information I received I went on 26th June to the Shoreditch station, at twenty minutes past 12—I was there when the parcel now produced was left by Messrs. Morrison's clerk—about ten minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner go to the cloak-room window and ask for a parcel for Messrs. Cocks and Co., Hertford—the parcel was delivered by the railway porter to the prisoner—he left the cloak-room, and was going down he steps to Shoreditch—when he got on the last step, I tapped him on the shoulder, told him I was a detective officer, and asked him what he was going to do with the parcel he had in his possession—he said a gentleman had tent him from the other side of the railway station, on the other plat<lb></lb>form, for a parcel for Messrs. Cocks and Co.—I then said to him, "You must accompany me there and show me the gentleman who sent you for that parcel"—I then took him round to the platform, into the waiting-room, and also into the refreshment-room, to see if we could find this gentleman—he said, "I can't see him"—I then said to him, "I will give you another chance; these is another train on the other side, going to start for Woolwich, I will take you there to see if the gentleman is there"—I took him there, and he said he could not see the gentleman—I then said he must accompany me into a private room—I told him I was going to ask him very important questions, he was not obliged to answer them, as they might be given in evidence against him elsewhere—I then asked him how he came to be in Shoreditch station—he said, "I came there to go to the water-closet"—I then asked him how he came to be in the waiting-room—he said that he went there to rest—I then said to him, "Do you not think it very strange for a gentleman to come and ask a person of your appearance to go across to the cloak-room for a parcel when there are porters to do that?"—he said, "No, I do not think anything of that"—I asked him his name—he said, "Henry Tolhurst"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "No, 1, St. Andrew's-hill, Doctor-commons"—I asked him what his profession was—he stated he was a linendraper's assistant—I asked him whether he was in employ or out—he said that he had been out of employ two months—this is the parcel he had—I put my initials on it—he gave a correct address—I took him to the station.</p>

             the younger and myself. From the very frequent and continual loss, and from the particular times that money had been stolen, we strongly suspected the prisoner at the bar, he was a <rs id="t17930911-40-deflabel221" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17930911-40-defend442 t17930911-40-deflabel221"></join> of ours, he lived and slept in the house; on the 6th of August after all the servants had left business, I really don't know the exact time, we placed half a crown and four shillings in a drawer which were previously marked; the other servants left business about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it yourself? - I saw it done, it was placed in the drawer from whence the money had frequently been stolen. It was a drawer without a lock, it was in the shop, next drawer to the till.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When did you make these marks? - I made them three hours before they were stole, I made the mark the time as I put the money in the drawer, I marked one, and there were marks on the others and I took down the marks; I marked a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take down these marks with a view of observing the shillings again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may read your paper? - There are three round o's on one shilling, I made them with my penknife. The money remained there that evening so marked; at half past six o'clock the 7th of August the next morning, I sent for the constable, we had the prisoner searched; the money was found on him, the very identical money with some other money; it was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. In his Waistcoat or breeches? - I really don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken from him? - I did. The money was given to the constable immediately and sealed up; he was taken before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor granted us a warrant; and in his box there was ninety-four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place this box was in your house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where the prisoner dwelt? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no other persons interested in the business except those four you mentioned? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person who derives any profit from the business of this house? - Clearly not.</p>
               <p>Q. No person whose name is not given to the world? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any foreman who is paid out of the profit in proportion to these profits? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. This man lived with you as a porter for nine years; Was he ever turned away? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had been nine years in your house and never once turned away. Had it happened that there had been any difference of opinion between you and this man some time before this matter took place? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before that this quarrel happened between you? - I believe it might be about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. That quarrel I believe was known to the persons in the shop? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110051"></xptr>Q. And I suppose among the persons in the shop it was likewise known to those who marked that money which was put by in this drawer? - Certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray will you be so good as to tell what were the names of the persons who assisted in this operation of marking the money and putting it into this drawer? - Mr. Nellum and Mr. Liddle.</p>
               <p>Q. This quarrel got to some height? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This money was not put in the till? it was put in a drawer where money was not expected to be put? - It used to be frequently put there; the only reason it was put in that drawer was, when the foreman or person who took it, had not the key of the till.</p>
               <p>Q. The till I take it for granted was locked? - It ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have a person of the name of Sale in your employment? - We have at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. This person had on more occasions than one been the means of restoring bank notes which had been by the carelessness or negligence of Mr. Sale been found on the floor? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say on the 6th of August this money was found there; who was with you at the time? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. No one else? - Mr. Sale was in the counting house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the other servants access to this drawer? - All the servants, except the house maid who was up stairs about her business, had access to this drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this money found on him in the counting house? - He was searched in the counting house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man after six o'clock had the liberty of going out to get his supper? - He had not, he had after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence he had the means of carrying any thing away, if he had a dishonest intention. I would ask you this question, has it not been said that if it had not been for this quarrel this prosecution would not have been carried on to this length; has not this been said in your hearing, and in your house? - Upon my honour I never heard it, I am confident it never was said so; I abominate such conduct.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about marking this money? - I do not; I saw it after it was marked, and put it into the drawer myself, a little after eight o'clock between eight and nine, this was Tuesday evening when the four shillings and half crown was put into the drawer, all the men were gone except Mr. Liddle and myself, one shilling was marked with a figure of two on each side, another shilling was marked with a figure of three on one side, one was marked with an half moon, and a C. the other shilling I cannot say how it was marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, see if they correspond? - They are the same marks exactly; I put the money into the drawer myself, and the clerk see me put it in, and then I bid him good night; in the morning when I came about seven o'clock, the shop was open about that time, the first thing I went and looked at the till, and I saw the money was gone, I went and informed Mr. Charles Fourdrinier of it, he told me to be particular and see that it was gone, Mr. Fourdrinier sent for Mr. Black the constable, and all three porters were called in, and there was some money laid down on the desk, outside, and I picked out the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you hear of any quarrel between your young master and prisoner; - I cannot swear for six or seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You say then six or seven years ago there might be a quarrel? - I say there might in the course of six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of a fortnight before this transaction happened? - I do not recollect any thing of that sort happening, I will swear that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation taking place between old Mr. Fourdrinier, and his saying if it had not been for this quarrel between the prisoner and your young master, this prosecution would not have taken place? - I never heard it in my life.</p>
               <p>Fourdrinier. I saw the money in the drawer myself at half past one in the morning on the 7th, and I saw the money in the drawer again at half past six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is one other circumstance, Mr. Fourdrinier, with respect to this quarrel? - Chapman has been in the habit of living with me since I have been in house-keeping for myself this two years; I told him that he was welcome to the cupboard, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110053"></xptr>never locked any individual thing up from any one.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot go into these particulars.</p>

             on Wednesday the 7th of August last, between seven and eight, when the prisoner was present, Mr. Fourdrinier ordered me to search the three men who were in the shop, for he had lost some money; the prisoner stood first; accordingly I told him to pull what money he had out of his pocket, which he did, and out of which Mr.

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The prisoner stood first to be examined? - All the men were to be examined.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told the prisoner to pull out of his pocket all the money he had, which he readily acquiesced in? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it left? - I don't know where he found it; he gave it me in the morning, and told me it was in a little insecure drawer above my desk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that? - I suppose two years ago or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he has had the opportunity of doing it again since? - Not within my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did Nellum live with you at that time? - Yes, and long before.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the fact of having found a guinea and returned it to you, was the conversation in the house? - I don't know that it was, it was not to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 20, Warwick Street, Blackfriars Road, Southwark—the deceased was my brother—on Sunday night, 10th, November, about 10.30, I was with him in Parliament Street, going towards Charing Cross—when we got to the corner of Charles Street I saw a cab coming up at a very unusual pace, and within 10 yards of the top of the street I halloaed out, and put up my hand—my brother attempted to get back to the kerb again, and the hind wheel struck him on the breast, and knocked him backwards, and then he fell insensible—the prisoner stopped, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Cabby</hi>, what has caused you to come round the turning at such a rate as that?"—he helped me to put my brother into his cab, and take him to the hospital—nobody was in the cab, but some one was riding on the</p>

               <p>Springs—I am not a judge of speed, but the cab might have been coming at eight miles an hour, and it might have been more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not very dark; there was a light in Charles Street, a light at the Red Lion, and a light in Parliament Street—Charles Street is not very long—the cab came up Charles Street, and was turning the corner into Parliament Street—my brother was in the act of crossing—it struck him on the left breast—he had been drinking the share of a quartern of rum between three of us—he was about 3 feet ahead of me when he heard me halloa—the cab did not go over him; it knocked him down—Hansom cabs generally appear to go fast, this one especially—it was driving at a very unusual pace, coming out of a turning especially—it was going faster than usual, even for a Hansom cab—it appeared as if the horse had just been livened up by the whip—it was about 10 yards from me when I saw it first—I had not time to catch hold of my brother; I was on the point of stretching out my hand to him and holding up the other to the cabman—he took a step back when he heard me halloa, and that made, the wheel catch him on the left breast.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is no pretence for saying that my brother was drunk—the cabman did not slacken his speed at all till a gentleman halloaed to him—my brother was 3 feet ahead of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on 16th November I received the deceased into my care in a state of almost perfect insensibility—at the back of his head was a cut an inch and a half long, extending to the bone—his left breast and left knee were bruised—the wound on the head would be likely to be caused by falling on the kerb—I attended him till he died, and afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—a considerable quantity of blood was effused between the scalp and the skull, and there was an extensive fracture of the skull 3 inches long, and effusion of blood on the vessels of the brain and the base of the brain—the fracture of the skull was the cause of death.</p>

I am a member of the Bar, and live at Lincoln's Inn—I was coming along Charles Street to Parliament Street on this night at 10.30, and saw a cab coming at a quick pace—I thought there would be an accident before it happened—I was about the length of this room from the comer of Charles Street when it happened—I heard a cry, ran across the road, and saw a man lying on the ground—I shouted out "Stop that cab," and it stopped—I cannot tell the rate it was going at, but it was a furious pace.</p>

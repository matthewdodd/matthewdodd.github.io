            . I am a dustman. The prisoner drove my team three or four years. I sold Marshall the mare - I bought it of the prisoner on the 16th of February, and kept it about six weeks; he told me he bought her in the Romford road. I gave him 14 l. for her, and sold her for 20 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he got the money to buy her - A. After he left me he was in business for himself. It was too light for my work, and I sold her. He had two horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got home to Spencer's-court, Bethnal-green, on Sunday night, at ten o'clock, on the 30th of January. I bought the mare on the Romford road. Howard can prove I was at home on the 30th of January.</p>

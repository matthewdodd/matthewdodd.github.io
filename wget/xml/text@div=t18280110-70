            . I am a Bow-street dismounted patrol. On the 10th of December, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at Walhamgreen - on seeing me, he crossed from the gas-light to a dark part of the road; I and Young crossed over to him, and saw that he had a cask on his shoulder; he said he picked it up against Garden-row, and was taking it to his own home; we said he must go with us; he then said he had picked it up near the two mile-stone, and was going to lay it on the bridge; we took it to Mr. Stocken's brew-house, and it was claimed; he said he did not think we should take him for so trifling a thing, if he had any thing of more value he should have planted it till morning, and then got it; he was about three-quarters of a mile from Stocken's, and about two hundred yards from Mr. Jermain's.</p>

            . I live in Garden-row, and can see Mr. Jermain's premises from my house. On the night of the 10th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I heard a noise, I got up, and saw a person hanging on the fence, coming out of his garden; it was dark; his dress appeared lightish - he said, "Is that you, George?" I said Yes; I know the prisoner, but it was too dark to see him: I could not speak to his voice.</p>

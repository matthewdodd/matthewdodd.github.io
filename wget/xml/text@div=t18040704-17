               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at Brentford? - A. On the 17th of May I saw him at Mr. Nunn's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Mr. Nunn's shop before the prisoner? - A. No; he was in there before I was; the prisoner was in the shop buying some dressed ham; Mrs. Nunn put the ham in some paper; the prisoner tossed a 1 l. note on the counter, to pay for the ham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the note? - A. I observed the note particularly; I made an observation to Mr. Nunn that it was a bad note in the prisoner's presence; the prisoner immediately stepped to the counter, close to me, and asked me how I knew it was a bad one; and I asked him (and looked at him very sternly), how he knew it was a good one; I meant to take him by the collar; I took the note nearer to the candle, and examined it more minutely, and found it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take hold of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was it? - A. Between nine and ten in the evening, on the 17th of May; the candles were lit, and the prisoner said he had it of a man at the door, and he would call him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any answer to him? - A. Not at that time; on my looking at the note more particularly (I was behind the counter). I immediately said I would take the prisoner; the prisoner was making to the door, as I then supposed, in order to bring the man; I followed him, and could not find him; I did not go outside of the door at that time.</p>

Yes; towards the evening; it was duskish; he asked me the price of the best nuts, what they were a pound; I said fourteen pence; he said, weigh me a pound; I weighed him a pound, and he gave me a 1 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able from what took place at that time, to know the note again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? (The note shewn him.) - A. It is; it is the first note that I took; I had the misfortune to take two at that fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the note you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what mark is it that you know that is the note that you took of him? - A. I observed these two flaws, and particularly this tear is a crooked tear.</p>


               <p>Q. Did it differ by that tear from the other note you took? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark by which you know it? - A. Yes, by the names of Jenks and Green at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes after you received them? - A. I put them in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you deliver that note to? - A. To the solicitor or inspector.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Bliss? - A. That is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you deliver it to Mr. Bliss? - A. The second day of the fair in the morning, at Brentford; the gentleman came up to my stall the day after I received it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. When did you write your name on it? - A. Last week, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got in your possession any other note that you had took on that day? - A. No; I parted with that on the same day, to the same gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the other note, that you received on the same day at the fair? (The note shewn him.) - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that? - A. By the long name; I took notice at the time it was a long name; I cannot pronounce it perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver these two notes to Mr. Bliss, and did you receive these two notes on the 17th, at the fair at Brentford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had no notes but what you delivered to Mr. Bliss? - A. No, I only took two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. (To Mr. Bliss.) Look at that note? (A note shewn him.) - A. This is one of the notes I received of Stone, it is a counterfeit, like the other note he has got in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you receive it from Stone? - A. On the 18th of May, at the fair, both the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at Brentford? - A. Yes; on hearing there were some counterfeit notes there, I went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that you received on the 18th of May from Stone a counterfeit note? - A. Yes, they are both counterfeits, and from the same plate with those I have received before; they are all from the same plate with that I saw of Kimbell and Nunn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of what is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040032"></xptr>Alledged against me; I was never at Brentford fair in my life, I am in the plated way by trade, the lady is here where I work at; we were short of work at our shop, and I bought things of my mistress to get a shilling or two, because I had not employment, and a young man, of the name of Booth, had got his watch in pledge; he gave me the ticket of it, and in the course of three or four days, I pawned some of my things to release the watch, because he told me it was worth four pounds, and I thought to get something by it; it was not worth fifteen shillings, I kept it for two or three days, the case was very much bruised and broke; I mended the case, then it was much better than it was before; I wore it for three or four days, then I saw a man that gave an order for three or four plated spoons and cups, and when I had taken them to the man that had ordered them, they were too small and too light, I had them returned on my hands, I kept them for three or four days; I then thought I had better get a fresh place of work; I went down to Hoxton, to a friend, at the Royal Oak, he was not at home, then I went to the White Horse in Pitfield-street; I called for a pint of beer, and there was a gentleman there whom I had never seen before, I supposed he was a countryman; seeing him play at skittles, I went up to him, and I said to him, I beg your pardon, an't you a traveller? Why, says he; by your appearance and your dress, said I. I then said to him, I have an article to dispose of in my pocket; he asked me what they were, I told him; he says, come and go into the parlour, we will agree if we can; we went into the parlour, and there were three or four gentlemen there; I shewed him the articles, he liked them very much; I asked him fifteen shillings for the two cups, and seven shillings for the spoons, or seven shillings and sixpence, I will not be sure which; he bated me down to twelve shillings for the cups, and six shillings for the spoons, that was eighteen shillings; I told him there was another article to sell, and that was the watch that I had fetched out of pledge; I gave it into his hands, and he set the price, and I took it, that was twenty-eight shillings, I was to spend a shilling out of it, which I agreed to do; in the mean time, I asked him if he dealt in such goods as them; he said, he generally dealt in a smaller way, in knives, &amp;c. I said, if you do, I will give you my master's residence, I knew the manufactory of such goods, I could get them cheaper of my master and mistress than he could get them himself, and get something myself by them; in the mean time, he did not want the residence of my master and mistress, he said he would sooner deal with me; I then required of him where he lodged, when in town, which he gave me; he could not write himself, nor read in his life; he said, he always kept his accounts by his head, and a gentleman in company wrote his residence, that was in Charlton-street; he gave me the direction to the Brill-house, which I have lost; he travelled to Norfolk he said, and to Newmarket; he authorised me to sign it in his name. I was never in the house above three times, in the White Horse, Pitfield-street, and I saw him there twice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

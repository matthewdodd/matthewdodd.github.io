                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Davey, of Sheerness. On the night of 10th Dec. I was in Woolwich, and went into a shop to purchase a basket—the prisoner stood by my side, near the window—I put my hand in my pocket, and missed several pence, and my handkerchief which had a half sovereign tied up in the corner of it—they were safe when I was two doors off, a minute before—I told my husband I had lost my handkerchief and money—the prisoner said she had not got it, she had no handkerchief—I told her I did not accuse her of it—my husband paid for the basket—I said, "It is quite plain that somebody has picked my pocket"—the prisoner said "I have not got it," and pulled out her pocket, and showed me several pence only—I left the shop—I saw my handkerchief next morning; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has "H. D., 3," on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 122). On 10th Dec., I saw the prisoner in Power-street, Ayre-street, and watched her—I received her in charge from Newell—on her way to the station, she took this handkerchief out of her pocket—I took it out of her hand, and asked her where she got it; she said she could not give me any account—I took it to the prosecutrix, who identified it by the initials.</p>

I never catched her doing any thing wrong before the 24th of May; then I missed my silver watch out of a mahogany case over the chimney-piece in the fore parlour.</p>
               <p>Was that the room you used to work in? - No: she asked the favour to let her entertain some friends to dine with her that day, the 24th: I gave her leave. The door was locked. I gave her the key, to lay the cloth. She was in the room about five minutes, between two and three o'clock. She had a leg of mutton boiled, at my expence. She came out of the room into the back room, put the key in her pocket, and said she was going for some capers to the mutton. She went out, and staid above half an hour. I was a little surprised that her company did not come, nor she return. I looked for the key of the door. I could not find it. Then I opened another door that goes into the room. I immediately missed my watch.</p>
               <p>How long before had you seen the watch in the mahogany case, in the parlour? - Four or five minutes. I had but just come out, and locked the door, when I gave the key to her. I called my women down I had at work, and desired them to go round to the neighbouring pawnbrokers, to get them to stop it, if she offered to pawn it.

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. On the 24th of May, between three and four o'clock, a watch was offered me to pawn by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Mrs. Scott's? - About three or four hundred yards. She then said her name was King. I never saw her before, but I can swear to her person. I asked her whose watch it was. She said it was not her own, that it belonged to one Mrs. Smith, in Drury-lane. I had some suspicion of her. I sent the boy with her to Mrs. Smith's. The prosecutrix's woman found the boy, and the woman came to our house.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have no witnesses but God and your honours. If I had meant to steal it, I would not have pawned it so near hand. I had an acquaintance to bring me some money on Sunday. I wanted a little before hand. I did not mean to wrong her of it.</p>

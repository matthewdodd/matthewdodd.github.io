                  </hi>. I am a stonemason of High Street, Stoke Newington—on the night of September 12th I was at the comer of Charlotte Street the worse for drink, and met the prisoner, who enticed me to her home several streets off—she asked me for some money, I said that I had only four pence-halfpenny or five pence, upon which she fumbled in my pocket sand began to take the things out—she took a pocket-book from my breast pocket inside, and this bunch of keys (<hi rend="italic">prodnced</hi>) from my left trousers pocket, and this fusee-case—I wanted them back and she struck me with some instrument on my left cheek arid on the top of my head, I have the marks now, and while trying to prevent her I got a slight cut on my wrist—she opened the door for me and I went out as quick as I could and found a policeman, who took me back to the room and I identified it—it was the same shaped room and there was a bed in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 78). I saw Winters in Bedford Square, Stepney, drunk—he scarcely knew what he was doing—I went with him to 7, John's Place, where he pointed out the prisoner in the front parlour, but he first took me next door—he charged her with stealing his pocket-book only—there was a bed in the room—I found the keys and part of the fusee-case on the mantle-shelf, and the pocket-book in a Dutch oven in the kitchen—Winters had the other part of the fusee-case in his pocket—I charged him with heing drunk, handed him over to another constable, and he was fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he charged the prisoner with robbing him and assaulting him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Winters was not in your room when I searched it, he only came to the door and pointed you out—I found the pocket-book about a quarter of an hour after you were in Custody, he had not mentioned the keys till I showed them to him, and then he said "Those are my property"—I did not have two searches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. He knocked at the door about a quarter to 2 a.m., very much the worse for drink, and said, "I think that is the woman who robbed me; "I said, "You are mistaken, you are quite welcome to search the place." We were both locked up, and some time afterwards I heard the constable come and say that he had found the pocket-book in an unoccupied room. That room has nothing to do with me, it is for the convenience of four houses for cooking.<hi rend="smallCaps">

I marked five shillings in half-pence, eight shillings in silver, two half guineas, and one quarter, by filing the edges. I had some suspicion of the prisoner. I ordered the other servants to go up to dinner and leave him in the shop. There were eight shillings in another till, and two half guineas, and a quarter: when I came down from dinner I sent him up, and found sixteen-pence deficient: I called him down; the rest of the servants were come down from dinner. I desired they would pull their money out of their pockets; the prisoner pulled out some, and said that was all he had; I shook his coat pocket, and said, There is half-pence in your coat pocket: my brother put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some half-pence, which were marked: he denied that they were my half-pence: they corresponded with the others exactly.</p>

            . I was present. My brother marked some money. He came and told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100007"></xptr> he missed about sixteen pence. He desired I would go over and see him searched. I went over to his shop: he desired the prisoner to pull out what money he had: he said he had very little or none: it did not appear indeed that he had much in his breeches pocket: my brother touched his coat pocket and said it rattled: my brother put his hands into his pocket, and pulled out two or three; I put my hand in, and found about eight pennyworth. I asked him how he came by them; he said he did not know, he had had them a good while. About twelve penny-worth were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Are you satisfied that the money found in the prisoner's pocket was what you had put in the till?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Had you paid any of that marked money away.</p>
               <p>White. No; I gave my servants orders not to add or diminish, so they paid sometimes out of their own pockets. I marked three or four together, and the file did not touch all alike.</p>

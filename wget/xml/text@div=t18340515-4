            . I am a policeman. On the 5th of April, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's residence - among other things, I found there about a yard and a quarter of cloth - the prisoner was present, and his wife said the cloth was hers - he said nothing - I found five or seven duplicates on his wife, one dated the 26th of March - I asked her for the duplicates, and she produced them - I went to Stevens at No. 82, Wardour-street, in consequence of the duplicate, and there they produced some cloth - I asked Mrs. Willard who the cloth belonged to which was in pledge - this was in the presence of her husband - she said she did not know who it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get the duplicate from? A. The front room - Mrs. Willard gave it to me.</p>

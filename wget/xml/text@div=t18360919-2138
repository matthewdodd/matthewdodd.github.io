                  </hi>. I am a custody-house officer. It is my duty to come up with carts to the London Docks—I remember this cart coming—Henry Hilson drove part of the way, and Thomas Hilson part—they were both driving in—the Commercial-road, about ten minutes after I left the West India Docks, I got on the top of the cart, and rode to the top of the Commercial-road—I got off there, and followed the cart to the London Docks—I never lost sight of it—when I got there, the shipping officer, Bishop, called attention to one of the bags, which was slack—I called Henry Hilson back, and asked if he knew any thing about how the bag was robbed—he said he knew nothing about it at all—it was cut—I asked him what was the young man's name who came along the road, and drove part of the way—he said he never saw him before, and do not know his name, and do not know any thing about him at all—I am sure Thomas Hilson was the person, and Henry Hilson must have seen him—I went into the searcher's office—the bag was weighed, and about 40lbs. was deficient—I left my papers there, and followed the cart—I detected it be<lb></lb>fore it got out of the Docks, and gave it in charge—I bought the cart back to where the rest of the goods were delivered—I was there searched by the Dock company—when I got down, no one got on the cart—Henry Hilson was driving then—Thomas left us at the top of the Commercial-road—I do not know where he went—when I got down, Henry was driving—Thomas went away—he was not on the cart when I was riding—I never lost sight of the cart from the Commercial-road, and I never saw Thomas come back—he told Henry that he had got another load for him in the London Docks, if he could get there a quarter before o'clock—he asked me the time—I told him it was about a quarter before three o'clock.</p>

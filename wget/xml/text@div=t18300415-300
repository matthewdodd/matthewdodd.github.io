About Christmas my cellar was under repair; I employed Godfrey, and he employed the prisoner, who I believe is his son-in-law - the door was taken off and repaired by the prisoner; in that cellar there was wine to a considerable amount - it is the inner cellar; it opens into the spirit cellar - I have examined the partition between the two cellars, and find a hole cut on one side of the post, for a bottle to pass and re-pass, and a mark where some one's finger had been cut and bled; I never allowed the prisoner to go to my cellar after the job was over - he never asked; on Saturday night, the 27th of February, my servant gave me information, and I had the prisoner taken on the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you find the blood? A. On the Monday morning, when I found three bottles broken, and lying in the cellar; I do not know how long it had been there - the prisoner was taken on the same morning; I did not order his hands and wrists to be searched - the officer mentioned the blood to me.</p>

            . I am a porter and chairman. On the 27th of February I was with the prisoner at the prosecutor's house, waiting to be paid; my father and other persons were there - the prisoner beckoned me out, I went out of the room: he said, "Don't take any notice, but it is my birth-day; and if you will go with me I will give you a glass of wine;" I said, "We had better go back, and pay that one pot between us;" he said we should not be five minutes: I went with him up to a house, in Castle-court, where Lousia Lawrence lodges - when we got there, he took a bottle of wine out of his pocket, and we drank it; I think I had two glasses: he then pulled out a bottle of rum - Lousia's mother said, "This won't do:" the prisoner and I had a glass a piece; I do not think there was much drank - the bottle and the rest of it was left there: we then went to Mr. Brown's, and paid a pint a piece towards the pot we had - I thought I had been treated enough and did not expect to have a second edition of it; but when we were coming out: he said, "I have another bottle of wine at home, suppose we drink it at your lodging" - we went to his father-in-law's to get it: I did not go in, but he did - we went to Mr. Brown's to get a light: he then went to a fishmonger's-shop, and he served out the wine among a number of people there; we then went home and drank the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him take any wine from Mr. Brown's? A. No; Godfrey is a carpenter - he bore a fair honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him? A. I suppose nine or ten years; he has borne a good character as a tradesman, as far as I know - there was one time I heard he had been here, but I was not in Court, and did not know much of him then: I have only heard of it since this business.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my lodging on the 27th of February, and brought a bottle with wine and a bottle with about half a pint of rum in it; we drank the wine amongst us, and I believe two glasses of rum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150132"></xptr>were drank by Taylor and him - there was but a little left; the officer came and asked for two bottles: my mother gave him the bottles, they were clean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you venture to swear they were the two bottles the prisoner brought? A. No; the prisoner and the witness were very much in liquor - the bottle was not one third full of rum; I suppose it was between a pint and a quart.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were they not what are commonly called quart bottles? A. I cannot answer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say his father-in-law, Godfrey had given it him? A. No. I saw the blood in the cellar; it might have been there a day or two - I examined the prisoner's arms and wrists, but found no cut on them.</p>

            . Q. Was it blood or Port wine? A. Having been brought up a butcher I think I am too good a judge of blood to be deceived; I should think I have not less than 50l. worth of wine and spirits: I think it possible there might be another engaged in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never entered the place with the key in my pocket; I was not certain that it would have fitted it - it is not reasonable that I should have returned to the prosecutor's house if I had robbed him.</p>

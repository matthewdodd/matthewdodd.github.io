On the 5th of April, at two o'clock in the morning, I was out and fell in with the prisoner in Fleet-street - I had been waiting the day before, and had gone in the evening to see a friend - I had had two glasses of brandy and water, and one glass of gin and water - I was a little the worse for liquor, but knew what I was about - I was on my way home when I fell in with the prisoner; I am not certain whether I spoke to her first or she to me, but we got into conversation and I agreed to go home and sleep with her - we went to a house in <placeName id="t18330516-24-crimeloc118">Star-court</placeName>

I might be; if I had been sober, I dare say I should not have gone with her - I am married; I went into one public-house with the prisoner, and had a glass of half-and-half - I had forgotten that before - I had forgotten to put the money out of my pocket.</p>

             (police-sergeant F 4.). The prisoner was taken by another officer, and brought to the station-house - she was put into the cell with another woman - I knew the prisoner, and knew her voice perfectly well; I heard her say to the other woman that she supposed she should be transported this time - and the other asked her what she was there for - she said for robbing a man of some money, that it had done her no good as she had been drinking about ever since, and all she got out of it was a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false - I said I was there for robbing a man of seven sovereigns, and I had not had it; for if I had I had no occasion to have pawned an article that week to have got my bonnet from the cleaners - he came in while I was speaking to that woman, and she asked him if she could have a pint of beer, and I said if she had not got the money to pay for it, I would give it her - and she said to me that if I was to be transported, it was what she had been and had returned - I have the duplicate of what I had pawned that week.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am quite certain of what I heard her say through the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many persons were in that cell? A. Only that one female and the prisoner; the door was shut - I knew the prisoner's voice well - I cannot say what has become of the other woman - I knew her by sight - I did not hear the prisoner say that she need not have pawned her articles if she had had this money - there is a trap in the door - I did not stand to listen; I was in the yard - I don't think the prisoner could see me - I was rather above the door; the flap is about six inches square - I was about half a yard from it - there were some men in some other cells; the other woman was there for drinking - the prisoner was sober - I cannot tell the name or number of the officer who took the prisoner - he was before Sir

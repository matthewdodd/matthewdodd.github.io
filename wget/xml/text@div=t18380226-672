                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Underwood Coy, warehouseman, in Wood-street, Cheapside. On Saturday, the 1st of April last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I packed up this cloth, and took it to Aldermanbury, near Love-lane, and gave it to Rock to carry to Everett and Co., of Holborn—he was to carry it to oblige me—I was here when two men, named James and Taylor, were tried—the property was pro<lb></lb>duced then—it was the same I had delivered to Rock—it has since been sold—we have the wrapper here—the cloth was worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I Was wagoner to Messrs. Kenworthy at the time in question. I remember Mattinson coming and giving me the cloth—I placed it on my wagon, and covered it over with a heavy sheet, near the Church at the bottom of Aldermanbury—I should not consider that half a mile from Gutter-lane—when I got to Everett's it was gone—I afterwards saw it in possession of the officer at Guildhall, and, to the best of my belief, it was the same property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the watch of Bread-street ward. On the 1st of April, about eight o'clock, I was in Gutter-lane, and saw the prisoner, and two other persons with him—all three together—Taylor was carrying the property in question under his arm—I followed, and at last took him into custody, and took care of the property—some time after I took James, the second man—they were tried here, and the property was then produced—I apprehended the prisoner last Thursday week.</p>

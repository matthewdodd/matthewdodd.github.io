            ; it was a little after ten, on Friday the 10th of this month, I was behind the counter, within a yard from whence the watch was taken.</p>
               <p>In what manner was it taken? - By a violent blow made against the window, it hung up by a small brass hook, within an inch of the window, or thereabouts; I was writing behind the counter, I heard the window break, I immediately turned and missed the watch, I ran out as fast as I could, I did not see the watch taken from the hook, I missed it the instant it was taken; I run out and turned to my left-hand, and met my next door neighbour, who was coming out, I took him with me, there was a man standing by, whom I imagined to be an accomplice, who informed me wrong, and said the man was gone to the left; a witness that is here present, said, he has misinformed you, Sir, he has ran the other way, upon which I immediately turned round, and found the prisoner in custody, he had been knocked down on the fact being committed, I never recovered my watch again.</p>

               <p>I was standing the corner of Swallow-street, about eighteen yards from this shop at the time this affair happened, I heard the window break, and I saw this prisoner's hand come from the window, he immediately ran across Vigo-lane, into Sackville-street, then John Lowe took him into custody, I never lost sight of him till he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Could you from the place where you stood, see into Sackville-street? - Very plain, as far as the watch-box, and there he was knocked down, I knew nothing of the prisoner before; I am a young fellow come out of the country, I keep a little shop at Swallow-field, near Reading, I was in town about a little business, I am sure it was the prisoner; the prisoner was taken into a public-house and searched, and nothing was found upon him, except a key, and a pair of scissars, there was no watch.</p>
               <p>Did you see any suspicious persons lurking about the house? - There was another man standing by the prisoner within three yards of him, at the time the window was broke.</p>

               <p>On the 10th of this month, in the evening, I was going along Sackville-street, about seven, and I saw two men lurking about the prosecutor's shop window, when I had passed the prisoner I suspected them, I clapped my back at the corner of Sackville-street, and watched them five or six minutes, and I saw the prisoner put his left-hand in his right hand-pocket, and pull out a rag or handkerchief, and he lapped it round his left hand, and with his left hand I saw him break the window, I am sure of that, but what he took I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing? - I did not, I saw him break the window, and I saw him take his hand out of the window, and as soon as he took out his hand, he ran away to Sackville-street, and I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Did you see him put his right hand into that hole that he broke with his left hand? - No, I did not, I then took him into a public-house, the corner of Sackville-street, he was searched, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>After he took away his hand from the window that you saw him break, did you see him hand over anything to the man that you saw lurking? - No, I did not, I knocked him down once, and picked him up, and he fell down again, then I picked him up again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I walking along with my hands in my pocket, and did not you come up to me, and strike me over the face, and did not I say, do you want to rob me; my Lord, he knocked me over the nose, and I put my hand into my pocket, and said, do you want to rob me, I had a few shillings in my pocket, they stripped me, and searched me, says I, gentlemen, this is not proper usage, and one struck me, and another struck me.</p>
               <p>Lowe. His clothes were not pulled off at the public-house, they were at the Rotation-office, he did not say that I wanted to rob him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You did not see this man break the window, or catch hold of him immediately on your coming out? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What kind of man was that which put you upon a wrong scent? - He was much such a kind of man as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. In such a business as this, it seems to me to be very improper to put a watch of this value in a window.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have wires for that purpose, but they were not up that night, I am so fearful of being robbed, I generally shut my shop up at night, and leave my door open.</p>

               <p>When the window was broke, and you went out, did you miss the watch? - Yes, I did, as soon as I went from the door, I met my next door neighbour, and told him of my loss; it made a report equal to that of a gun, I turned round immediately, and saw a vacancy, there were three watches hung there, and this was the centre watch.</p>

             sworn. - I am a shopman to Messrs. Morgan's: Last Friday evening I saw a man pass half the length of the shop-window, and return back again; I then saw him do the same again, and I kept my eye fixed upon him, and saw him come into the shop, and take hold of the bacon; I came forward thinking he might want to ask the price of it, and he immediately ran out at the door with it; when he heard my feet, he immediately dropped the bacon on the fill, and walked off; I did not stop to pick up the bacon, but jumped out and seized him; he had not got two doors before I took him by the collar; when I seized him, he said, do not take any notice, let me go on; I said, no, you shall go back, and I took him back.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Morgan.) What is the value of the bacon? - A. It cost me one shilling a pound; there is seventeen pounds and a half of it.(

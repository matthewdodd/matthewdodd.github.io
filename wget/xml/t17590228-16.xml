            . I was going on board my ship last Friday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she lie?</p>
               <p>Bacon. She lies <placeName id="t17590228-16-crimeloc128">off Bell wharf, St Paul's Shadwell</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17590228-16-crimeloc128" type="placeName" value="off Bell wharf, St Paul's Shadwell"></interp>

               <p>Q. How much would the bag hold?</p>
               <p>Bacon. It would hold about half a hundred weight; he said, he did not know what it was, but upon hearing somebody call sculler, he rowed there and took it in; when on board he showed me the other man, named Goodwin, I took and brought him on shore, but before we got to the justice's he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Bacon. He is, what we call a lumper: that is, one of the men that we hire to clear the ship of the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the other prisoner Weatheral?</p>
               <p>Bacon. I saw him go out of the stern-port of the ship to assist Neive in taking the bag out of the water into the boat, and before I came to him he went out of the boat in at the stern-port again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Bacon. He <rs id="t17590228-16-deflabel129" type="occupation">belong'd to the ship</rs>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to imagine either of these prisoners had a hand in stealing this tobacco?</p>
               <p>Bacon. I imagine Goodwin had hired them to come off with the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other circumstances than what you have mention'd?</p>
               <p>Bacon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Weatheral say?</p>
               <p>Bacon. He said they called sculler.</p>

            .

               <p>Q. Where was Weatheral at the time the parcel was thrown out?</p>
               <p>Brown. I was informed by the mate he was in the gun-room.</p>

I live at 31, Coston Street, Westminster—on 3rd February, 1868, I was married to the prisoner at St. Luke's Church, Chelsea—I produce the certificate—I obtained it from the clergyman—I saw him copy it out of the register, and I compared it; it is correct—she told me she had been married; but that her husband was dead—I cohabited with her for two years, and then I married her—her husband came back last July, and I have not lived with her since.</p>

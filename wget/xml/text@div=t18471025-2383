                  </hi> I obtained this ticket, as a seaman, on the 11th of Aug., 1845, in the capacity of fidler—I made a voyage to Bombay and bask, and to the Carnatic—I returned home last Jan.—I went to live in my own lodging—I have since removed to Mill-yard—I met the prisoner Thompson some months back—he was a stranger to me, but I asked him to drink—he sat down, and said he was on board the <hi rend="italic">Sarah</hi>, as cook, and was going to the West Indies, but he was sorry to say he had lost his ticket—I told him I had a ticket at home, which was of no service to me, if it was of any to him, I would give it him with all the pleasure of life—he asked if I had it about me—I said an, it was at home—he asked me to bring it down the next evening, and I did, and gave it him—he told me he would satisfy me when he got his advance note—I told him I wanted no satisfaction, he was welcome to the ticket—he said if I did not want anything, he would stand something when he got his note cashed—I said he might do as he thought proper about that, and gave him the ticket—he read it, and said it did not exactly agree in age and height, and asked if I knew anyone who would alter it—I said I knew nothing about the altering it myself, but there was a Mr. Williams, who wrote, in the Black Horse, he might take it to him, and see what he could do with it—he then went away to go to the Black Horse—I saw him again the next day, in a beer-shop—we went from there to the Black Horse, and I saw him give the ticket to the prisoner Williams, and he asked him whether my name could he altered into his—Williams said he did not see why it could not be done, but he was not in a fit state to do it that evening, but if he would call the next morning it should be ready—I cannot recollect whether anything was said about the height—Thompson went on board his ship, and the next morning I went down and saw Williams—I asked him whether he had done that for Thompson—he said no, but he would do it in my presence—I saw him scratch out something, and write something, but what it was I cannot tell—my eyes are very bad without my glasses—I cannot tell whether he altered it in one place or many—I saw him scratching out and writing—he might be a quarter of an hour about it—he scratched out with a bit of white paper—I cannot say whether it was writing paper or what—he gave me the ticket, and I went, saw Thompson, and gave it him—I saw Williams next day—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, he was afraid he bad got him<lb></lb>self and me into a scrape, and he very much pressed me to go back to the ship, and get the ticket back again from Thompson—I went to the ship, and</p>

               <p>Thompson was cooking—I asked him for the ticket—he said the boatswain had goy it looked up in his chest—before that, Thompson had said to me that the ticket was not altered to his satisfaction, and he would make an altera<lb></lb>tion, or get it altered, and he said he daubed it over with tar that the altera<lb></lb>tion might not be seen—it has the appearance of tar on it—I believe the ship sailed on the second or third day afterwards, but I went on board the ship again, as she was hauling out, endeavouring to get the ticket again, as I thought I might get into trouble, though I had done it innocently—I told the steward of the <hi rend="italic">Sarah</hi> of it before she sailed, and also the boatswain, and the owner—Thompson sailed with the ship—he came into the dock at the last moment, and had hardly time to get hold of the fore-chain, and get on board, or I should have given him into custody—he was taken when he came back.</p>

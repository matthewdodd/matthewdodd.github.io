               <p>—I stayed there some little time, and then Mr. Payze went home with me, as I felt rather nervous, and did not like going home by myself—I have not any doubt about Campbell—I afterwards saw him in custody at Stratford police-station—there were other persons with him—I did not notice anything particular about him—there was a peculiar look about his eyes, but taking a general view of him, I did not notice anything very particular.</p>

I am a corn-merchant, and live at 10, Vicarage Terrace—on the evening of the 9th February, about 8 o'clock, Miss Green came into my house, and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went up stairs into my dressing-room, which opens on to the portico by a sash window—I examined the window, and found broken glass, some on the lead gutter, and some in the room; also the catch broken off, and the window lifted up some three inches—on the bottom of the sash, there was a mark where <hi rend="italic">jemmy,</hi> or chisel, or some instrument had been used to force the window up; it had left a deep impression under the sill, it is there now—I had not left that room more than twenty-five minutes; the window was then fast, the blind down, and the catch all right—I fastened it myself; there was no broken pane—the window had not been unfastened for a month or six weeks—the sash was very difficult to raise, it had got swollen from the damp weather—I have a small fire-place in the room, consequently we had sufficient air in the room, and that was why the window was not opened—the sash was swollen, and would not yield to the pressure of the instrument used—I afterwards pointed out the marks to Inspector Mason.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Oxford Villa, Ilford Road—on 9th February I was living there with my husband, Samuel Galloway—he was forty-nine years of age, and was living on his means—my niece lived with us—my husband came home at a few minutes past 8 o'clock that evening—he went into the breakfast-room on the basement—he was there for a few minutes preparing to do some writing—my niece went up stairs—after she had been up stairs a short time she came down into the breakfast-room, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what she said I ran up stairs with her, to the front door—my husband ran out at the back door, up the back steps, and round the entry—when I opened the street door my husband was at the front door, at the bottom of the steps—I saw a man wearing a cap jump the gate—as my husband was going towards the gate I said to him "That is not the man wearing the cap that was up the front steps, it was a man wearing a wide-awake;" the man wearing the wideawake was about three yards off the gate, outride; the one wearing the cap disappeared—my husband went up to the man wearing the wideawake, and accused him—he was standing about three yards off our gate—I heard high words between him and my husband—they were walking together in conversation, in the direction of Hamfrith Road, towards Ilford—by that time I had got outside the gate, and was following my husband, and when I had reached to where they were stand<lb></lb>ing, which was the middle of the Hamfrith Road, half-way across it, close to the lamp, my husband was holding the man at arm's length—I was standing opposite my husband, within a yard of him—as soon as I had reached my husband two men came running up from the direction of Ilford—they were both wearing dark clothes, one had a wideawake, and one a cap, with a peak—the man my husband was holding also had a wideawake—the two men came close up to my husband, the one wearing the cap came between me and the man my husband was holding, and the other one was at my husband's right side—one of the two that came up, I don't know which, said to the man my husband was holding, calling him by some name</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Sun Row, Ilford Road—on the night of 9th February, about 8.45, I was passing by Mr. Galloway's house, and saw two men standing at the corner of the Hamfrith Road—Mr. Galloway was one; he was talking to the other man—I saw Mrs. Gal<lb></lb>loway come out of her gate and go up to her husband, and I heard her say "Oh yes, you are the man"—I then came across the road, and she came towards me, and begged me to go after a policeman—before she spoke to me, I had seen two more men coming from towards the New Road, just by Hamfrith Road—they came towards Mr. Galloway and the other man—I noticed those two men; Campbell is one of them—they came just up to Mr. Galloway—I went towards Stratford, to fetch a policeman—I had not got many yards when I heard Mrs. Gallowny screech out "Murder!"—I then turned round and followed the three men—they ran away, towards Ilford—I was not able to overtake them; they made their escape—I went back, and rendered assistance—some time afterwards, I saw Campbell in custody, at the police-station, with a number of other persons—I did not pick him out, in his own presence, I went in the next room, and told the inspector I knew him again.</p>

               <p>inquiries I made, on the afternoon of 20th February, I went with Inspector Mason to 18, Waterloo Court, Samuel Street, Cannon Street, St. George's-in-the-east—I went up stairs into the front room, and there found the prisoner Campbell, with two other men and a woman—Foster, an officer who was with me, said "That is Michael Campbell" who was sitting in the corner of the room—I ordered him to be brought down stairs, and took him into custody—he said "What is this fort"—I said "I will tell you when I get you out of the court"—on the way to the station, a short dis<lb></lb>tance from the house, I said "You will be charged with the murder of Mr. Galloway, of 2, Oxford Villas, Romford Road, on the 9th instant"—he said "Oh God! no; I have been guilty of almost every crime, but, thank God, not that"—I took him to the Leman Street Station—that was all that passed on the road—I searched him, but found nothing except a small knife—I asked him his name and address—he gave it as Michael Campbell, 18, Waterloo Court, the place I had taken him from—I again repeated the charge to him, and he said "God! no; I have been guilty of many crimes, but, thank God, not that"—I afterwards took him to the West Ham Station—I caused him to be placed with five other young men who I called out of the street, and he was spoken to by the witnesses—Mrs. Galloway went in first, and other witnesses went in, and spoke to his being one of the men.</p>

I think there were four officers altogether with me when I went to Campbell's room—that was not the first time I had been there that day; I had been in about ten minutes previously—I had seen him then—I don't think I asked him his name; I don't think I spoke to him at all—I made some remark about the room—I went to make observation, and I did not say anything to him with reference to this charge—I had some conversation with reference to the accommodation of the place, nothing else—I don't think I spoke to his brother, who was in the room; I am not sure—I said "This room is very close, and it is very unhealthy"—I think I asked if they all slept in the room, or something of that sort—I did not say who I was, or by what authority I went—I went with a gentleman who had some authority there, the Inspector of Nuisances of the district—I did not hear Campbell's brother say to him, "That is Mr. Clark, from Scotland Yard"—I went away for about ten minutes, or it might have been less; I had about 70 yards to go to fetch the officer that I believed knew Campbell—I found him there when I returned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. When Knott identified Calbraith I was against the door of the room in which they were placed—Calbraith was not handcuffed in Knott's presence—I did not take him from the station to the Court—I don't think he was taken handcuffed before Knott; I took" every precaution I could that it should not happen, and I think it did not happen—I pledge my oath that, as far as I know, he was not taken before Knott handcuffed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I selected persons from the street, called them in as they were passing, so that there might be a fair identification—there was no officer in plain clothes—every officer was shut in another room at the time—Calbraith was not handcuffed at that time—when I went to Campbell's room I did not know him personally—I had some suspicion, and I went in to confirm that suspicion—I had had some description of the persons who were engaged in this matter—when I went in I left other officers on watch at the court—when I came out I took in an officer who knew Campbell by</p>

I am stationed at West Ham—on 21st February, about 8.30 in the evening, I went to Ernest Street, White Horse Lane, Stepney, accompanied by Sergeant Brydon—I saw Calbraith in the street—I got hold of one side, and Serjeant Brydon the other; I said "We want you, and shall take you into custody"—I searched him, and in his pocket found a large key—on the way to the station, I said "The charge is, being concerned with another in murdering Mr. Galloway"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him first to Arbour Square Station, Stepney; he was afterwards taken down to Ilford, and placed with others, to see whether the witnesses could identify him—on Friday, 10th February, my attention was called to Mr. Payze's house in Vicarage Terrace—I went to the room over the portico, and examined it—the window was closed at that time, the glass was broken, and the top of the catch forced off and a little bent—there were marks in between the two sashes, just by the catch, and on the bottom sash, as if a chisel or <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> had been inserted.</p>

I am a surgeon, living at Stratford—on the evening of 9th February, about 8.45, I was called to the late Mr. Galloway's house—I found him lying on his back, perfectly insensible—he was bleeding, a very small quantity, from a small lacerated wound under the lower lid of the right eye—the eye was protruding very much—I examined the wound and probed it—I found that the instrument had passed through the orbit of the eye and entered the brain—in my judgment it was a mortal wound, I said so at once—I saw at once that it was mortal—it was caused, in my opinion, by a sharp pointed instrument with blunt sides to it, for this reason, that the eye itself was not cut, the globe of the eye was not injured—it was a very small wound at the side of the lid—I do not know what a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> is exactly; I believe it is something like a chisel, with a round edge and a point—a chisel might have caused the wound, it must unquestion<lb></lb>ably have been a violent blow—he died in consequence of that wound on the following Wednesday, the 15th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

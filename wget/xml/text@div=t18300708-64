On the 23rd of June these stocks were in a box at the side of the counter; I saw the prisoner in my shop when I came in about five o'clock - he had brought me a note, which was taken up stairs; my young man said there was a note up stairs for me - I went up, read it, and came down; I asked the prisoner what time it would be convenient to wait on the gentleman; he said about eleven o'clock the following morning - he was about to depart, and my shopman said,</p>
               <p>"While that young man has been in your shop he has been robbing you - if you look into his hat you will find he has robbed you of some stocks;" the prisoner himself took off his hat, and I found four stocks in it - he said poverty had driven him to it: the stocks were given to the constable - they have my private mark on them; this is the note - a piece of paper was found on him, corresponding in water-mark with that the note is written on; a list of names was found on. (Note read.)</p>

I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner, with the stocks; I found this piece of blank paper on him, which is the same size as the note, and the water-mark corresponds - I went to No. 11, Gray's Inn-square, but no such person as Graham lives there; I found two pairs of white stockings in the prisoner's pocket, loose, without paper; I have found no owner for them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, pleading distress. He received a good character.</p>

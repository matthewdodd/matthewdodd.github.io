                  </hi>. I am shopman to George Miller Galley, grocer and cheesemonger, Oxford-street, Mile-end. The prisoner came to me on the 27th of March, and asked for 14lbs. weight of coals, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a halfpenny-worth of wood—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2, change—I put the half-crown into my pocket—I had no other silver there—I gave it directly to Mr. Kelly—a little after eight, on the 6th of April, the prisoner came again for a halfpenny-worth of wood, and gave me a hilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling into my mouth—I knew it—was a bad one, and showed the shilling to my master—he gave it me back—it was not out of my sight—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—I followed the prisoner three streets round—I could not run any further—I was obliged to call out, "Stop thief "—my master heard my voice, and ran out, and caught him—I have seen a halfpenny which the policeman showed me—I told him it was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Dinckell's master. I received a half crown on the 27th of March—I put it into a drawer away from all other money—I kept it in the drawer till the man came again on Saturday night, when I gave it to the policeman—it was the one I got from Dinckell—on Sa<lb></lb>turday, the 6th of April, I was standing at my shop door—Dinckell brought. me a shilling—I saw it was had—he said, "Never mind," and ran to the corner of the street—I ran after him—the prisoner went up one street, and down another, and hid himself behind a back gate—I called for assistance—a man came, and we took him out of the court—he was fumbling about, and put his hand to his mouth—I called the other person to hold his hand, but it was too late—he had been talking some time before he put his hand to his mouth, and then he was silent for some time.</p>

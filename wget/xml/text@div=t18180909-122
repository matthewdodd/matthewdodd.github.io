On the 27th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening. I hired the prisoner's coach in Oxford-street, to take me home - He drove it - I was rather forward in liquor, but not drunk. I am certain I had eleven 1l. notes in my pocket when I got into the coach; I felt them safe when I got in; he drove me to the Green Man, at Ealing. I got out, and sat on the box with him at Notting-hill, as he did not know the way. We had a dispute with the turnpike man. I emptied my pockets to find the ticket, and my notes were then safe; the prisoner held a light while I shook the ticket out of the notes, I was then in the coach; when we got about a mile from there I got out, and sat on the box; he then drove to Ealing. We went into the Green Man, he demanded 1l. for his fare, I said it was too much. I put my hand into my pocket to pay him, I missed my money-this was before I sat down. I told him he had robbed me, he denied it. My brother was with me in the coach all the time; he insisted on being searched, and having the prisoner searched also, but the prisoner refused; there was a piece of work in the house, he then took two notes out and threw them on the table, the publican took them up, and asked if there were any marks on my notes. I said if they were mine Mr. Spencer's name was on them, in my hand-writing. They were produced, and they had that name on them; the people crowded round, he then threw another note on the table. The constable came and took him to the watch-house, without searching him-it was about eleven o'clock. Two notes were left in my pocket - He only took nine. The prisoner said he had had them in his possession for a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have never seen my brother since. I have not enquired after him. We stopped at Acton.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man, at Ealing. On the 27th of August the prosecutor and his brother came to my house in a coach, the prisoner drove the coach; they disputed about the fare, and referred it to me; I said I thought it was right. Brady put his hand into his pocket to pay for it, and immediately charged the prisoner with robbing him. Brady's brother went into the backparlour to be searched, we found nothing on him. The prisoner refused to be searched, said he would shew all his money, and pulled out two 1l. notes and some silver, and put them on the table; Brady said, if they were his they had "H. Spencer, Drayton-green;" on them-which I found on both of them. I told the prisoner if he had any more, he had better give them up, or I must send for the constable; he threw another note on the table, which had the same name on it. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prosecutor - A. He was rather intoxicated, but he knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he found them on the floor of the coach - A. Yes.</p>

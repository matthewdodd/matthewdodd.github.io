                  </hi>. I am a conductor, in the service of the London General Omnibus Company—on 29th June, about fifteen minutes past 11 at night, I was standing by my omnibus, which was standing still in Sloane-square, and was going to make a memorandum—I had a strap over my shoulder, and a bag containing about twenty-nine shillings, the property of the company—I was just going to put the pencil to my book when the prisoner, who I had never seen before, came in front of me and said, "You b—"—I looked up, and he gave me a bump on the nose—I told him to go away, and another person came up with a flannel-jacket on, and three or four others with him—I went backwards with the first blow, and the man in the flannel<lb></lb>jacket said, "If you do not leave him alone, I will give you a b——crack in the eye"—the prisoner then gave me a second blow—it did not knock me down, but I was dragged into the road and knocked down by the prisoner and the others, and the prisoner kicked me three or four times in the face when I was down—when I got up my bag and money was gone, and they had all decamped—my coachman found a hat, and I went over to the pump to wash my face—the prisoner came back to look for his cap a quarter of an hour afterwards, and I pointed him out to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Before you received the blow had you seen the prisoner on the kerb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not pulled up three minutes—I did not push the prisoner before he struck me, but when he came up the second time, I knocked him in the eye, and sent him by the side of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I dare say I am the more powerful man of the two—when he came from under the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> again, I did not hit him again—no one interfered in consequence of the maltreatment he was suffering, but one of his companions said that if I did not leave him alone, he would give me a b——smash on the eye—the prisoner then ran at me again and struck me, and I hit him again—there were ten or twelve people round—it was at the Star and Garter—the strap of my bag was under ray coat, which was buttoned at the top—I am certain I had the bag on, because I had just put a passenger's fare into it.</p>

                  </hi> Had you pushed the prisoner before he struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the strap must have been cut, and then the bag would drop—I looked about, but could not find it.</p>

I was the driver of this omnibus—I saw an alterca<lb></lb>tion as I got down, and saw the prisoner, and others, as I turned the omnibus round—it is usual for me to get down there—I saw the prisoner kick the conductor most brutally—there were three others besides him—I found I</p>

               <p>could not assist him in any shape or form as three ruffians were kicking him most brutally while he was on his back in the road—the prisoner was one of them—I shouted "Police!" as loud as I could, and the prisoner knocked me on the jaw, and knocked me down on my back—he and others kicked me, and his cap fell off as I raised my hand to save my face from the kick—I put it in my pocket, and they all ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the commencement of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not see the prisoner pushed by anybody—there were four persons at the door as I turned the omnibus round—I saw the prisoner the first time previous to his striking the conductor—he was on the kerb—one of his companions pushed him after I got to the back of the omnibus, but that was done to cause the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw my mate hit the prisoner on the eye, and throw him under the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—that was after the prisoner struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer maker, and live in the Hackney-road. On Thursday, the 7th of May, I employed the prisoner to sell ginger-beer for me—I sent him out that morning with five dozen and five full bottles, and the rest empty ones, to the amount of eight dozen—he brought the same quantity back about twelve o'clock—he said he could not sell any—he went out again about two o'clock with the same articles, and did not return—I went with a policeman next day to the Britannia Saloon, found the prisoner there, and gave him in charge—he was taken to the station—he said Douglass's chap had persuaded him to sell the bottles, and he had sold them to Mr. Wickham—they were my property—I found my truck by the side of the road, and nothing upon it—he also had an earthen pot—I have since found the tumbler which I thought he had.</p>

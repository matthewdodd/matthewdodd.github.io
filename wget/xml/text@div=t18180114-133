On the 26th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, a man brought the prisoner to my shop, in custody - I had not seen him before. The man that stopped him took his hat off, and took two pair of shoes out of it; a pair was taken out of each of his sleeves, and several pairs out of his bosom. My wife was in the back-parlour, which commands a view of the shop-none of my servants were in the shop.</p>

            . I was at work in my back-parlour, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop - I ran after him; I missed a great quantity of shoes out of the window-the parlour door was open, in order that I might see into the shop. My husband was up stairs. I ran after the prisoner, calling Stop thief; he was stopped, and the goods taken from him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CASSADY. I am a salesman. The prisoner was running up Queen-treet, about twenty-four houses from the prosecutor's, and a woman pursuing him, my master stopped him, but he got away again; I stopped him, and took him back to Emmens's shop; he had nine pair of shoes, and two pair of boots, about his person. He begged for mercy.</p>

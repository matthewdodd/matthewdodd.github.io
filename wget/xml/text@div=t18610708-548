                  </hi>. I am a traveller. On Saturday afternoon, 19th June, about half-past 5, I was on Fish-street-hill, and stopped to look at a band which was passing—I saw the prisoners hand at my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, where I had had my watch, but it was gone—it had been fastened to a chain, which went through a button-hole—I made a grasp at him, but he ran away—I ranafter him, and caught him at the bottom of Fish-street-hill—he struggled to get away at first, but eventually gave in—an officer came, and I gave him in charge—he had the watch in his hand, and the guard came in contact with my hand; a little boy brought it to me after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live at 2, St. Dunstan's-alley—last Saturday afternoon I saw the volunteers on Fish-street-hill—I saw the prisoner with his hand in Mr. Tyer's waistcoat pocket, but did not see anything taken out; but he took his hand out and ran—I did not see anything in his hand; but it was shut—Mr. Tyer ran after him and took hold of him.</p>

               <p>not say before the Magistrate that I saw him take the watch out of the pocket—there was a great crowd about—there were others running beside the prisoner—when I first saw the prosecutor he was walking, then running and then he stopped by the Monument; and it was when he was standing still that the prisoner put his hand into the pocket—the prisoner had on a round hat and a brown coat—I saw him caught—I was by myself—I ran when Mr. Tyer ran—I was on the other side of the road when the man was caught, and was about as far from him as I am from you.</p>

About half-past 5, on Saturday evening, I was on duty near the Monument—I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner at the bottom of Fish-street-hill—he gave him in custody for stealing his watch—he gave his right address, and said that he worked in the Docks, and did not get his living by thieving.</p>

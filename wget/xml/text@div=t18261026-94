            . I am a constable. I was called up about half-past one o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 10th of October, I went to the prisoner's house, and found it shut up; I heard him drag the pump up-stairs; I called several times to him, and told him what I wanted - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260067"></xptr>said he knew nothing about it; soon afterwards, he threw the pump from the window - it fell about one foot and a-half from me; the prisoner then began to swear and abuse me - I sent for the beadle, who desired me to break open the door, and take him, which I did - he had his coat off, and appeared rather intoxicated, but not much - I had not seen the pump before, nor did I fit it to the place - but they were both cut, and appeared alike.</p>

            . Q. Did you find the prisoner in bed? A. Yes; he was in bed covered up; he had nothing off but his coat - when I opened the door, it was bolted and locked; the key was inside - there was no other person in the house.</p>
               <p>- SIMMONS. I am a fishmonger. I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years; he did live at East Barnet - I had been drinking with him on the night this happened; he was very much in liquor, and did not know where he was going, nor what he was about - he came home with me as far as he had to come; he did not go to his own house, but went to a neighbour named Ellis.</p>

            . I am of the firm of Halliday and Carter - we supplied blankets to the Steam Washing Company in 1830 - I have the books here; on the 2nd of January, 1830, we delivered goods to the amount of 7l. 13s. 4d. - I believe the bill of parcels went with the goods - on the 14th of January we supplied them with six pairs of cards, which came to 1l.; we had no other dealing with them till the 29th of May - we generally allow a discount for prompt payment - the first money we received was on the 23rd of April, 8l. 10s. discount 3s. 4d. - I received it by this cheque - this other cheque for 7l. 13s. I believe was never in my hand till now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known the prisoner many years? A. Yes - I entered his name in our book as the person to whom the goods were to be delivered, and made out the receipt in his name; this is it - it was given by my clerk; he stated it was on account of a Washing Company, and the gentleman did not wish his name to be known - I knew nothing of Mr. Macdonald, but he afterwards called on me and told me to make out the account to the Washing Company; the whole of the balance has not been paid to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had you received any money for goods between January and April? A. No - the balance not yet paid is a subsequent account. (Cheques read).</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. MACDONALD. Q. You had no account with this house till after these goods were purchased? A. No - I was arrested at the prisoner's suit, I think in March; it was before that I called on Messrs. Halliday and Carter to order the alteration to be made in the bills, as I had found out various things.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080105"></xptr>MR. ALLEY to MR. CARTER. Q.Could it have been so early in March that he called? A. I cannot say, but I think not.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. MACDONALD. Q.Upon your solemn oath, was it not after you were arrested that you called? A. No, before - there was a bill of particulars delivered by my attorney; I pleaded a set-off, and was ordered to give the particulars of my account - I did give this very sum of 7l. 13s. 4d. in my set-off originally, and afterwards I amended it; after I had preferred my bill of indictment last Session, I gave in the amended particulars, omitting the sum for which I had indicted him - till I preferred the indictment it remained a matter of set-off against the claim he had for wages against me; I then altered it by omitting it - my solicitor advised it should be left out, for the purpose of sustaining the indictment.</p>
               <p>1830, January, Cash to pay Halliday and Carter's bill, but returned, 7l. 13s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I saw that the cheque of 7l. 13s. was charged to me, I naturally concluded that it had been given to me, and I gave Mr. Macdonald credit for it.</p>

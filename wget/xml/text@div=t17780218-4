Then Lake put his hand into his great coat, and pulled out a pistol which he presented to me, and said, d - n your eyes, make haste; I gave him one shilling, which was all that I had about me; Lake said, I will be d - d if this will do, you have more; I said, if you think so, you are at liberty to search me. Then he asked me for my watch; I told him I never wore one. Then he demanded Mr. Bowry's money, which he gave him. Then he asked for Mr. Bowry's watch; Mr. Bowry told him he had a watch; Lake bid him hand it over to him, which Mr. Bowry did, and then they rode off.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to the person of Lake? - I am; he is the very man that robbed us both; I knew him before; he lived with a baker at Pimlico, whom I served with flour; I recollected him when he took out his pistol and presented to me; it was quite light, and he had not any thing upon his face to disguise him.</p>

I was on duty near the Bell public-house at Ealing, on the 2nd of March, at six o'clock—I saw a cart of hay there—both the prisoners were by the side of the cart, and appeared to be speaking together—the name of William Colley was on the cart—I saw Dean get on the cart, and take down a truss of hay—Tilbury, the ostler, went into the corn-house, which was four or five yards from the cart—a person can see from the corn-house to where the cart was—Dean took the truss into the corn-house, and, as he was going in Tilbury was coming out—when Dean had taken the hay in he came out, and both the prisoners went to the water-trough together, and appeared to be talking—Dean then came to his cart—I went, and asked him what truss of hay that was that he had taken into the corn-house—he said he had not taken one in, and he did not know any thing about it—I said, "Come here, and I will show it you"—I took him to the corn-house, showed it him, and said, "Now I will swear I saw you take that truss off the cart, and put it down there"—he said, "I hope not"—I said, "I will"—he said, "I hope not, as I am a poor man, I hope you will look over it"—he said he would satisfy me, and as there was nobody but Tilbury, me, and him, knew of it, I might look over it—Tilbury was at that time standing near the water-trough, about</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Northolt. Dean was my carter—I saw the cart loaded on the 1st of March—the hay pro<lb></lb>duced by the policeman is mine—I had not authorized Dean to leave any at the Bell—he had no authority to leave any hay on the road—he was only to take one load and one truss, which I allowed for the horses—two trusses he took wrongfully.</p>

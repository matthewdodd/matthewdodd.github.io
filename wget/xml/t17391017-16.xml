I know I had 12 s. in it when I was at the End of Lombard-street, for I then took out my Snuff Box, and felt my Money; and I was no sooner off the Plank, but I miss'd two Half-Crowns and 2 s. Upon this I turn'd, and saw the Prisoner stand at the Place where he first offer'd to help me, so I went back, and took him by the Sleeve, and charg'd him with picking my Pocket, and three Gentlemen came up to my Assistance; so we took him to the Mansion Alehouse, and charged a Constable with him. He was desired to send for somebody to his Character, but he refus'd. Then the Gentlemen asked him, if he had any Money about him? At first he said, he did not know what Money he had; afterward he said he had 16 or 17 s. and at last he pull'd out 17 s. there were two Half-Crowns, and all the rest were Shillings.</p>

            . As I was passing by Stocks-Market, Mrs. Lillo stopp'd the Prisoner, and told him, he had pick'd her Pocket. We carry'd him to the Mansion-Alehouse, and she told the same Story that she has done now. We ask'd him who he was, and where he lived? He would not give us any direct Answers; but at last he said he liv'd in Whitechappel. I asked him in what Street? He could not tell. Then a Gentleman asked him, what Money he had about him? He said, he could not tell; but at last he pull'd out 12 s. and two Half-Crowns. We told him he might justly be suspected, and desired him to send for some People of Credit, to speak to his Character: The Drawer told him, there was a Porter ready to go to any one; no (he said) he was innocent, and he'd send for nobody. Upon this we advis'd her to charge a Constable with him, which she did, and we carry'd him to my Lord Mayor's, where several People knew him; but my Lord being at Grocer's Hall, he was sent to the Compter for that Night, and was committed to Newgate next Day.</p>

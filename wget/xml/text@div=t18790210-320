                  </hi>. I live at 4, Glenmore Terrace, Greenwich, and am engaged at the Naval College—on 19th December I went to Devon<lb></lb>shire, leaving my house locked up and the key with Mr. Lucas, next door—on 2nd January I received a telegram, came to town to my house, and found the door leading from the front had been broken open, and it had marks on it—the latch of the dining-room window had been opened from the outside, and there were marks of a knife—the dining-room door had been burst open from the inside—I missed an overcoat from the hall, and from an upper room a box of mathematical instruments, a cigar case, and all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't know the prisoner—the front door was fastened as I left it.</p>

I live at 9, Glenmore Terrace—on 1st January about 1 o'clock in the day my attention was called to No. 4 on the same side of the way—I went there—the front door was locked, but the window was open—I got in at the window, went into the passage, and saw two men looking over the balusters—the prisoner was one of them—he had this pair of fire-tongs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—they rushed downstairs, and succeeded in getting to the front door—the prisoner tumbled down the steps—I caught hold of him, and held him some time—he tried to get away and struggled some time, but got away; I pursued him, and he picked up a flint, but did not throw it—he went into a stable and I lost sight of him for half a minute or a minute, but I saw him come out, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I live at 4, Hyde Vale Villas, opposite 4, Glenmore Terrace—on 1st January I saw a struggle between the prisoner and Mr. Chetwind—I went out; the prisoner had then escaped—I pursued him with Mr. Chetwind—he ran a long way down Hyde Vale and Upper George Street and to the top of Hyde Vale again, where I saw him throw something which glittered over a garden wall—we kept him in sight till he ran into a stable.</p>

               <p>running—I am sure of him—I ran after him, and caught him in a stable—he said that two men had broken into the crib in Hyde Vale and made a mess of it—I asked him why he had been running—he said that the boys had been pulling him about—I took him to the bottom of Blackheath Road and gave him in custody.</p>

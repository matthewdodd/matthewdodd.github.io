I was drinking at the bar of the Artichoke, with Fox and Dudman, between 11 and 12 o'clock—at about five minutes to 12 o'clock I heard a ft row in the tap room, and directly the door came open I was knocked back-wards—the first blow was on my left eye, which was cut—I think it was done with a quart pot—I fell against the door leading from the bar—I got up again to see for my cap, and got another blow on my ear, which rendered me insensible, and I recollect no more—I had had no quarrel with anybody—I saw neither of the prisoners there—I did not see the man who struck me, it was all done so suddenly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 210). I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" coming towards the station—I ran up, and saw Dudman stand<lb></lb>ing bleeding, and two of his friends holding him up—as I was going down the steps to the tap room, I saw King just outside the house, bleeding from the head—I went into the tap room, and found a great many people with quart pots in their hands, and several couples fighting in all parts of the tap room—I saw Casey there, I think, but should not like to swear it—I took Bryant outside, and was <hi rend="italic">put</hi> upon by six of them—1 drew my truncheon, but could not move till my brother constable relieved me—King</p>

               <p>and Dudman were outside—we went to the station, and the prisoners were identified—Bryant had a patch of blood on his thigh—he was not wounded that I saw—I took him to the station, and when he was taken before the Magistrate, there was a piece torn out of his trowsers, where the blood had been—he had been drinking when I took him, but knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was present when Mrs. Smith pave Far<lb></lb>rell in charge—he had a red handkerchief on—it was about 1 o'clock in the morning—he was standing outside the station, and she said, "That man with the red handkerchief on I can swear was in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—when he was brought before the Magistrate he had a black handkerchief on, and Casey had a red one—I said, "How is it that you have changed your handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Why, may we not do as we like about that?"—I took the red handkerchief off Casey's neck when the prisoners were committed, and gave it to Farrell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the P division of police, and live at Pine House, Camberwell-green. About 10 minutes past 1 o'clock, on the morning of 21st Aug., I was called up—I looked at the clock as I came out—it was then not a quarter past—I went to Camberwell station house, which is about 100 yards from my house—(it is about ten miles from Camberwell to Kingston)—I found Dudman, King, and a man named Gibson, there—Dudman had six scalp wounds, penetrating to the bone, but the bone was not fractured—they might have been inflicted by these pots, or by any blunt instrument—he was in such a faint, exhausted condition that I could hardly say in what state he was—I attribute that to the immense loss of blood—he had a bruise on the right shoulder, and another on the back, but not of importance,—the wounds on the head were all dangerous—it is a remarkable thing that they all healed so kindly—two of them were near the temple, which is in some respects more dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bryant's Defence</hi>. I went to the house for five minutes, to have some beer; the company there <hi rend="italic">kicked up</hi> the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, but I was not in their company; I was just going to leave, when one of the men fell against me, and the blood came on to my trowsers; when the police came, I told them that I was standing, watching an opportunity to get out; I went out, and was in this man's house half an hour, and the police came up and said, "Take him up; there is blood on his trowsers"; the men who did it are at liberty; 1 am innocent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Casey's Defence</hi>. I was with a couple of young females at Camberwell fair; we went to have a drop of beer at the Artichoke; there were a lot of people there; some of them were dancing; one of these young men came and sat on our table, and spilled some of the beer; some one told him to come off the table, and to keep to his company; a boy, between fifteen and sixteen, came and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him off; he put his hand to one of them, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him towards his company; they struck one another, and that was the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>; they had got pots, and everybody stood up and went on one side, for fear of getting struck; I do not know how the business happened, but when the room was cleared out, we went out, and were taken; I never hit one of the men, and never saw this man (<hi rend="italic">Farrell</hi>) in the tap room.</p>

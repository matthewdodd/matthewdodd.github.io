                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hodge; we are book-binders—Gorman and Mould were in our employ as errand-boys—on 25th Nov., in consequence of information, I went with the policeman Green to a shop in Shoe-lane, kept by the prisoner Jenkins's father—it is a news agent's shop, and I think they sell cigars—young Jenkins was in the parlour, and was called by his father into the shop; and Green, in my presence, said to him, "Have you bought, or had left with you, any books by any of Mr. Leigh-ton's young men?"—he answered, "No." Green then asked me the names of the two boys; I was unable to give them at the time, and went to ascer<lb></lb>tain them—I came back to the shop again, and Green then asked the prisoner Jenkins whether he had bought any from, or had any left by, Mould or Gorman; he said, "No."—I think the question was repeated two or three times, and each time he answered "No"—Jenkins's father then said he was afraid something of the kind was going forward; he had been in ill-health and unable to attend to the shop himself, and, in fact, be thought he had been robbed himself, and said "If you know anything about this; if you have got any property, any books, why do not you produce them? you have no business to associate with that boy, Mould, he belongs to a bad lot"—he then produced a copy of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" which had never been sent home to the publishers, from under some papers in the shop-window; I believe it was covered over; I had looked in the window and did not see it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is our binding—we have bound many thousands of this edition, but only 208 with gilt edges, which this has; and this has not got our label as binders of the book, which every book has when we deliver them to the publishers, and there is no mark of its ever having been there—I have examined the book, and find two of the 208 deficient—Green then said, "I know this is not all; you have got something else?"—he said, "No, I have not"—his father said, "If you have anything else, produce it?" and he then produced this "United States Exploring Expedition" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under the counter—it is our binding—I have missed five copies of it—I cannot say that this is one of them; but I swear it is our binding—Jenkins was then removed to our counting-house; and in the presence of the other prisoners, he said, pointing to Gorman, "That is the one I had the books of, but the other one was with him" (that was Mould)—Gorman said he bad not sold him these books.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN VON DER HYDE</hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 80, Lower Thames-street. On Saturday, 22d Sept., the prisoner came to my house—he said he wanted some cigars to send to a friend in the country—I think he said at Birmingham—I do not think he mentioned the party's name—I do not recollect what quantity—they were not selected—this check was sent up to me—I came down and saw the prisoner—I said it was not usual to take checks from a stranger, Mr. Wallis and Mr. Tuke might be very good men, but I did not know them, neither did I know him, and therefore I could not take the check—he said he knew the young man at the counter very well—that was Baker—I said, "If Mr. Baker knows you, that is a different matter; I do not know you"—Baker was not in the counting-house at the time—I went out of the counting-house and spoke to Baker—I said, "If you know him, and know him to be a respectable man, and like to take the responsibility of the check, it is all very well, but I certainly shall not send the cigars"—the check came into my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Von Der Hyde. On Saturday morning, 22d Sept., I saw the prisoner there—he told me he wanted from ten to fifteen pounds of cigars—he produced the check, and wanted me to give him the difference—I referred him to the counting-house—he mentioned that he knew me, and Mr. Von Der Hyde came and asked me if I knew him—I said, "Yes, when I was living in the Borough six years and a half ago; he was a customer of mine for tobacco and cigars"—Mr. Von Der Hyde said if I liked to give him the change I might, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took the check—he told me to send the cigars to Messrs. Arrandorf, I think it was, at No. 2, Crooked-lane—we did not send them, and the prisoner did not come to make any inquiries about them—I took the check to the banker's, and it was refused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say about nine or ten years—I never heard anything against his character—when he called at our house he had a letter in his hand, I did not look at it—I cannot say that I know his handwriting—I cannot say whether this check is his writing; he gave an address at the counting-house—that I did not make any inquiries at that address—I believe there was a person came into the counting-house who said that that was his address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Williams, Deacon, and Co. No party named J. S. Wallis keeps an account with us—all the customers' books pass through my hands—I have looked through the books, and there is no such person—I should say the check came from this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were two books of this number issued; one to Mr. Roberts, and one to Mr. Elmore—it must have come from one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not mean it came from this book; but it must have come from some book issued by your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; our books are made from the same paper, and are printed from consecutive numbers—when a customer comes we give any number—I cannot say how many books of "No. 897" we printed; these are the only two we can trace.</p>

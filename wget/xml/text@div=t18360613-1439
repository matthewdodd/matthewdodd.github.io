                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James West, a linen draper, at No. 76 and 77, Shoreditch. I missed a piece of printed cotton, of nine yards and a half, from our shop, about five weeks ago—it was sometimes on the shelves, and sometimes in the window—I cannot swear it had not been sold, but it could not be in the regular course of business, without notice being given of it—six persons serve in the shop—I went to the pawnbroker's and saw it, and knew it again—I know the prisoner—he came to our shop once with a set of reputed thieves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Cassell, a pawnbroker, in Church-street, Bethnal-green.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the pawnbrokers, and then ordered Parks to go there—I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of May, in Church-street, Bethnal-green—his father brought him to me, and I said to him in his father's presence," Do you know any thing about any prints"—he said, "No, I do not"—I said, "Do you know a person named Gadbury?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said, "Did you at any time pledge a piece of print?"—he said, "No, I never did"—I took him to the pawn<lb></lb>broker's—they identified him, and I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been to his father's house, and left word that you wanted to see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had—in consequence of that he was produced to me—I did not ask him if he had pawned any linen in the name of Gadbury—I knew him before, but knew no harm of him—he is a poor boy sitting about the street—his father, I believe, is a very honest man.</p>

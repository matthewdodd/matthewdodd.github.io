            , a Soldier , who sold Gingerbread at the Door of the Pench Bowl and Two Blue Posts, in Russel-Street , Covent Garden, and gave him a bad Shilling to change for a Pennyworth of Gingerbread .<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173112080016"></xptr> Honest Friend, says Hampstead, (looking on the Money, and bending it between his Teeth) this is not Good; and if you had another such a Piece you might be brought into Trouble. The Prisoner took out some more Money to pay for the Gingerbread; says Hampstead, There's another Shilling in your Hand that looks like a Bad One too. The Prisoner bade him try it then, which he did, and found it like the former. By this time several People were got together, and the Prisoner was apprehended, and carried before Justice Du Veil.</p>
               <p>On his Examination, he said he call'd for a Pint of Beer at the Swan Alehouse in the Old 'Change , and gave the Man Half a Crown, who return'd him those two Shillings, and four pence half-penny; and therefore he desired the Justice to grant a Warrant to take up that Victualler. The Justice carried the Prisoner into a private Room, and press'd him to discover the Truth there, but in vain. He was then brought out again, and at last confess'd that he made those two, and one more, himself; and that he had intended to make fix in all; but not with a Design to defraud any Body, by putting them off for Good Money, but only to make a Fortunatus's Wishing Cap with 'em, to divert his Fellow-Servants, and his Master's Child, in an Evening. ( Fortunatus's Wishing Cap is a Thing that Jugglers show Tricks with.)</p>
               <p>The Prisoner call'd several Witnesses in his Defence.</p>

            . I am a Gold Chain-maker. The Prisoner is my Apprentice. He was an honest, industrious Servant, minded his Business, and behaved himself very well in the Family. I have intrusted him with a great deal of Gold, and never found any Deficiency. I was surpriz'd at hearing he was taken, and that my House was to be search'd for Coining Tools. I went to the Justice to enquire about it, and there saw the two Counterfeit Shillings, and immediately perceived that they were not struck, but cast in Sand. I have heard him talk about a Wishing-Cap .</p>

             . I am Journeyman to the last Witess, Mr. Hunt. I was present when the Prisoner cast the Shillings, (for he did not do it privately) and he said they were to make a Fortunatus's Wishing Cap . I had heard him talk a long time before about such a thing, and we having a Gold Button to match, he said he'd take that Opportunity, and cast the Shillings in the same Flask, which he did; and afterwards took this Tool, which is frequently used in our Trade, and did the Edges of the Shillings. The Flasks are two Iron Frames fill'd with a particular kind of Sand, in which we make the Impression.</p>

            . I came from St. Albans about a Bankruptcy.

            . I was with my Brother and the Prisoner at this House, and I brought him out from her, but it seems he pick'd her up again the same Night. I went with him afterwards to see for her. Smith, the Man of the House, promised to bring her to us by seven in the Evening. But a Drawer advised us not to stay, for he said, Smith would make a Property of us. So we went away, but coming again afterwards, we found her at the Bar talking with the Woman of the House, who tipt the wink upon me. The Prisoner at first denied, but at last; fell on her Knees, and owned she had them The Prosecutor offer'd her half a Guinea for them, but she refused, and said, he had given them to her.</p>

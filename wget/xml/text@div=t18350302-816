                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Crawford-street. On the 28th of February the prisoner came into the shop and asked for some eggs—he threw sixpence on the counter—I observed him, and saw him place a handkerchief over some weights on the counter—di<lb></lb>rectly he was gone, I missed a seven-pound weight which had been on the counter—I followed hrm, and saw him at the further end of the adjoining street, walking fast—I called "Stop," and then he quickened into a run—I ran also, and the boys joined in the pursuit—when I got to the end of the street, a boy gave me the handkerchief and the weight—I can swear this is my weight—it is worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew the handkerchief again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was playing in Spring-street, and saw the prisoner running, and heard a cry of "Stop"—I saw him throw the handkerchief down, containing this weight—I picked it up, and gave it to the witness.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge on the 5th of December, in Long-alley, Moorfields, by the prosecutor's father; he was taken to Bishopsgate watch-house; I sent for the son - I do not believe we had any other prisoner there, but other persons went in, on purpose that the witness might not see him alone - he was a long time considering; he at first looked at one, and I think he said, "I think that is the man;" that was not the prisoner, but after that we turned him round to the gas-light; he turned to each individual, and looked strongly at the prisoner for some time, and then said "That is the person, I am positive;" the prisoner at that time was disguised, and had a large coat on, and a big bat - he identified him when he came under the gas-light.</p>

               <p>Long begged the landlord's pardon for having thrown a pot at his head, and gave him a sovereign to pay for a looking-glass—Simpson was gone to Barnett's at that time—I afterwards, by Barnett's direction, changed my clothes—I afterwards agreed to go down to Uxbridge to get out of the way—I was taken into custody at Farnham Royal—I left this note (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for Simpson, at the Hare and Hounds, Red-hill, two miles beyond Uxbridge—when I drove up to Uxbridge, Long was standing at the door of the Falcon-inn, and Simpson was inside.</p>

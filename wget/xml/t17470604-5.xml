            . On the 8th Day of May last I was robbed by Persons unknown, they got in at the Window, as near as I can guess, between nine and ten at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say they got in at that Time of Night?</p>
               <p>Pithean. Because my Wife was to make the Bed, not a Quarter of an Hour before.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Pithean. About ten o'Clock; when the Gentleman that lodged in that Room went to go to Bed, they were gone.</p>

               <p>Pithean. My Wife went to make the Bed just before.</p>

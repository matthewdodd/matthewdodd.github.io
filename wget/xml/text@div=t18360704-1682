                  </hi>. On the 26th of June, about past five o'clock in the morning, I was going from Whitechapel, down Petticoat-lane, towards home, and met the prisoner with another girl—they both asked me if I would treat them, two or three times—I said I had no objection if there was a house open—they took me down George-yard, but the house was not open—I sat down on the bench, and one of them sat in my lap in the open yard, and the prisoner sat on the left-hand of me and put her hand into my pocked—I said if she did not take her hand out of my pocket I would knock her down—I wanted to get up, but could scarcely get away—at last the girl got off my lap and they both ran away—I felt in my pocket and my money was gone—I caught hold of them both, the other one tore her shawl and got from me—I called "Police"—the policeman came up and the prisoner threw 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her hand—the prisoner is the one whose hand was in my pocket—I found the money safe after she took her hand out—but she put her hand in again directly after and took it—I felt her hand in my pocket—I lost between 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

No, I did not—I went into a public-house in whitechapel and found them there—they saw me have money there, and followed me out—I did not treat them, to the best of my recollection—I never gave them any gin—I gave them a draught of beer at the wine<lb></lb>vaults, and they followed me out, seeing I had money in my pocket when 1 paid for the beer—I gave an alarm of police, and one woman got away from me—Stracey, a constable, came to my assistance, and the prisoner threw 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her hand, I saw the money fall—I pulled her down with me, and picked up 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had some half-crowns and halfpence among the money I lost.</p>

They asked me to give them something to drink, and I gave them the pot with the porter in it to drink out of—I did not call for a half-quartern of gin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took charge of the prisoner, on the complaint of the prosecutor, in George-yard, at about half-past five o'clock on Sunday morning—just before I got up to them I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner throw her hand out, but did not see any thing fall from it—I was too far off—when I got up, I saw some half-crowns and shillings—the prosecutor said she had robbed him of nearly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in silver—he picked up two half-crowns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I picked up shilling</p>

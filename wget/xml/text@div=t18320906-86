I followed the prisoner - my purse was picked up in the way which the prisoner ran; it is mine, and had four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and three shillings in it; the prisoner was stopped in Albemarle-street, about two hundred yards from where I missed my purse - I had lost sight of him, but I know him to be the person I had been running after.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Foley, in Berkeley-square. On the afternoon of the 7th of July I was near the bottom of Hay-hill - I saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor, and then I saw his hand in one of his pockets - he drew out the purse; he then turned round, and ran towards me - he saw that I saw him, and he turned down a turning; I called out "He has picked your pocket," and ran after him; I lost sight of him, but I saw his person and face, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many turning did he turn? A. Three, but I saw him between the corner; I lost sight of him as he turned - I cannot tell which of the gentlemen's pockets, he had his hand in, when I first saw him I thought he belonged to the gentlemen, but as I kept looking at him, I saw him draw the purse out momentarily - I did not take particular notice in what pocket he had his hand in; I first thought he was pushing in the gentleman's handkerchief - I had not seen him before, I cannot tell whether he had boots or shoes on; he had a black cravat.</p>

            . I am a servant out of place. On the 7th of July I was at the top of Hay-hill; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he was calling Stop thief! but there was no one in front of him but me; I followed him, and he took something from his girdle and threw it away down an area - I followed him; I did not see the article which he threw picked up - he turned towards Albemarle-street; I did not see him taken, but I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was he to the corner of Hay-hill, when you saw him? A. About ten yards; I was in front of him on the other side, with my back to the corner - I was not far enough up for any one to have turned the corner.</p>

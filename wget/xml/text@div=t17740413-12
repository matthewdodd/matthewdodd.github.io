            . I am servant to Mr. Benfield; the two last witnesses brought a basket of china to our house, and asked me to help them down with it; I refused, I did not care to meddle with it, because I thought it was on a bad cause; I thought they were goods that would never be paid for, because there were a great many goods came on the same footing, that were never intended to be paid for; they brought in the china, laid it on an ironing board, and the bill of parcels upon it; Garrett came to me and said it the bill of parcels was taken away the goods would be delivered; then he went down immediately into the kitchen to Mrs. Hall; she came up directly and took away the bill of parcels; Guerin was in the room with the china, and said he would keep possession till his master came; Eddin took away some of the china by the order of Mrs. Hall; he was a servant in the shop, and she took some herself; Guerin said something at that time, but I could not hear what; Guerin took up some china, and was bringing it into the shop; Garrett followed him and said d - n your eyes deliver it to me, and took it out of his hands; Guerin smattered something and turned up his eyes and seemed startled.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the goods in case they were left?</p>
               <p>Turnbull.

               <p>Q. Was Benfield at home any part of that day to give orders?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. I believe not; he was a bankrupt a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Garrett take the dishes and a parcel of china from Guerin by force?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. Yes; Mrs. Hall only acted under the direction of Benfield, and had the whole management of the house.</p>

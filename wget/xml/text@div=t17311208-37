Cole open'd the Door, and clapping a Pistol to my Breast, said, G - d d - n your blood! your Money! and then he came into the Coach, and took 16 Shillings and my Watch. Pain, the other Prisoner, stood at the Door at the same time, in a red Coat, and the 3d Man stood by the Horses with a Pistol in his Hand. I could see them plainly by the Lights in the Shops, for it was not far from the Houses.</p>

            . No. Being fetch'd in a hurry before the Justice, I said then, that I verily believed that you, was the Man. But I was not so positive then as I am now, I have fully recollected my Memory.</p>
               <p>P - J - . I and the 2 Prisoners stopp'd the Coach, and committed the Robbery. Pain stood by with a Pistol, while Cole open'd the Coach Door, went in, and robb'd the Prosecutor of his Watch, and 8 s. as he told me; for if he took more he sunk it. From thence we went and drank together at Mr. Oads's, at the Goat in Black-Boy-Alley , in Chick-Lane.</p>

               <p>Pain. I could have but a short Acquaintance with I - , for I am but just come from Sea. What I know of him is, that he is a Cooper by Trade, and that when he was taken up, he deny'd that he knew any thing of the Watch.</p>
               <p>Cole. I was taken up first about a Quarrel, and was the Cause of P - being apprehended; but he had Friends.</p>

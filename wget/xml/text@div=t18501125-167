                  </hi>. I live in Victoria-place, Clapham-road. On 15th Oct. I saw the prisoner and another lad at the bottom of the Lansdowne-road; they appeared in conversation—I saw the other boy in about five minutes come to the Landsdowne Arms for a quartern of gin—he tendered what appeared to be a shilling—the landlady refused it, and said it was bad—she took it in her hand and put it in the detector—the boy said he took it of a woman at the corner, with a black bonnet and a blue shawl—the potman and the boy went out to look for that woman, and I went with them—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side—I followed him till I lost sight of him at some new buildings—I turned up Larkhall-lane and over-took him—he came out from some building—I went and told him he must come with me to the Lansdowne Arms; he wanted to know what for—I told him I would tell him when I got him there—this was about twenty minutes before three o'clock—I do not know what became of the other boy—I believe the potman brought him back with the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. On the afternoon of 15th Oct. I was in Sussex-place, Larkhall-lane, where there are some new buildings—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there—he first tried to make a hole with his heel by the side of a well—after he had done that, I saw him throw something white into the well—I went to the well and got on a board—I saw the last witness catch the prisoner—I emptied the water out of the well and found seven bad shillings—they were not wrapped up, but were on the top of one another—I took them to the station—I afterwards found one shilling in the well—I marked that as I had done the others, and gave it to the officer</p>

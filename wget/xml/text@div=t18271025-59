               <p>Prisoner. He said before that I stood half a yard away from him, when the handkerchief was on the ground. Witness. It was in his possession - it was never on the ground.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Mr. Brown's, in Elbow-lane, and in Leadenhall-street the officer was wanting this drunken man to go on; I stood with my hands in my pocket, on the left hand side of the officer; he took his handkerchief out of his pocket, threw it on the ground, and then collared me; he swore I took it out of his pocket - he wanted several gentlemen to come as witnesses, but they would not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOWE. The road was muddy, but the handkerchief was quite clean - he had it not out of his possession till I took it from him.</p>

               <p>Had he been knocked down? - Yes, then I turned round and said, the man is dead; the doctor came up, who was just by, and bled him, the man was taken out of the ground, and was carried to his own home; he died on the spot.</p>
               <p>Had there been any further provocation between the deceased and the prisoner than you speak of, of any kind? - None at all; the first proposal of fighting came from me; I said I would fight the prisoner; he said he would not fight me, he would fight the man with the pig-tail; I do not know that there had been any quarrel between them before.</p>
               <p>Which of them struck the first blow? - I believe it was the deceased.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of this accident; we were playing at trap-ball in the field, six of us; the prisoner and two more came into the field, and mentioned playing at quoits; after that we moved on the other side of the field, this man followed us; as we went along, the word was mentioned about fighting, who mentioned it I cannot say; they purposed to fight, and the money was made good; the deceased asked me to second him, I told him I would do the best in my power; the prisoner struck him a knock-down blow, after fighting about twenty minutes; I saw no weapon but their fists; I cannot say which of them talked first about fighting.</p>

               <p>Was you there when the poor man was knocked down the last time? - Yes, I saw the deceased lay down, and I said to some person that was present, I believe it was the deceased's wife, that it was requisite the man should be taken care of, and carried home, I did not think he was able to stand; he seemed before he received this blow to be exceedingly agitated, in consequence of the preceding blow; when he stood up, the deceased and the prisoner made blows at one another; both the blows took place immediately, and at one time; the deceased fell and lay on the ground; I went up to him, and felt his pulse, and turned round and told the people that the man was certainly dead, in consequence of a violent blow he received on the jugular vein, under the right ear; I look upon it that was occasioned by the violence of the blow on the jugular vein, that caused a rupture that was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Was the jugular vein ruptured by the blow? - I think it was, I have not a doubt but the blow occasioned his death.</p>

               <p>This man and I had many words together in the field, and he challenged to fight me for a guinea, and I said I would; about twenty minutes after the money was put down, and then I stripped off my clothes; I shook hands with him, and asked him twice if there was any malice between us; he made no answer, the first blow he struck me was on the shoulder.</p>

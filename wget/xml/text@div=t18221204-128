I had met him at another public-house, and drank with him at both, and was about half an hour with him. I had been to four public-houses. He went away, and when I was going to pay, I missed four half crowns and two shillings from my breeches pocket, which were safe ten minutes before. He had sat close by me - it was safe ten minutes before - I had been with him from eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Two Brewers. I saw Murray and the prisoner there about four o'clock, for about quarter of an hour. They had a pot of beer, and sat close to each other. The prisoner put his hand into Murray's pocket, and pulled out some silver, and put it into his own pocket. He was talking to 
               <persName id="t18221204-128-person1150">Murray</persName>
             all the time. They were sitting in a corner; there were about a dozen people in the house; he went away, and Murray could not pay for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q Why not mention it before - A. Murray was in liquor, and I thought he took it to take care of for him. He went out while I was telling my brother.</p>

               <p>mine—she remained there till the Sunday; she then asked me to change her a Scotch note—I said I could not, but I would get her change—she said I could only get it changed at one place; and if I could give her the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she would leave me the note—my husband then called me, and I was away about three minutes—when I came down, she had gone with the note, the ten shillings, a handkerchief, and a decanter; and I never saw her till this day three weeks, when I saw her in Bermondsey; she was looking at some bills of apartments in windows—I am sure she is the same person—I followed her to the Old Kent-road, and gave her in charge—she offered me some duplicates of some rings, and she pulled her scarf from her person at the station, to give me; I refused to take it.</p>

I solemnly declare the prosecutrix swears falsely against me about the old black handkerchief and a small veil; she went willingly to her drawer, and lent them to me; the veil was to bring her a quartern of gin; she lent me the money, and I expected some money, but being disappointed I absconded myself for some time; I offered her the shawl off my shoulders; I am a poor widow, and I beg for mercy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 7, King-street, Bethnal green. On 14th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in Nichol-street, with my daughter, Sarah Bay—I saw the prisoner at the second-floor window of the house where he worked—whether my daughter called him down or not I do not know, but he came down—they went to words—I went away, and came back again—they were then having some beer together at a public-house, and were having some words—I prayed him to be quiet—he threw me down, and went away—I got up, and went into Nichol-street—my daughter called him down again, and aggravated him to great extremes—she had been living with him for three months—he came down, and kicked her, I think, on the side—I scolded him a little—I went away—she went back, and aggravated him—I got in the way, and he knocked me down, and kicked me on the right side of the head—it bled very much—I was taken to the hospital, and was there eight days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where was I when you came first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At your window, at work; I did not hear my daughter ask you for some money—after I came back I stood at the bar, and drank with you and my daughter—we had one pot of beer and one pint—I had no gin—you threw me down, because you wanted to get to my daughter—your child came in while we were drinking—my daughter took it up in a corner—she did not hurt it—I did not say you should not have the child—I do not know that you said your child should not stop in a public-house—I am sure I was not drunk—it was when you threw me down that I tore the front of your shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon to the London Hospital. I examined Mrs. Leonard there—she had a contused and lacerated wound of the scalp—there was considerable swelling, and slight hemorrhage—it might have been caused by a kick—it was dangerous from its probable consequences, but she is now recovering—she was in the hospital a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Might it not have been caused by her falling down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but more probably from a boot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). I positively deny having used the violence to the prosecutrix, never having on any occasion entertained the slightest idea of doing her any harm, although for the last four months I have had the greatest provocation from her; she has I been to my place, swearing at me, and calling my child a bastard, and has done everything to irritate me to violence, but I never resented it; on this day they compelled me to leave my work three times, and come down; her daughter rushed on me, and the prosecutrix called me disgusting names, and said I should not strike her daughter; she held me, and refused to let me go; in the endeavour to free myself from her, she accidentally fell, and in falling struck her head against the kerb; she was very drunk, and I used no violence to cause her to fall; on the part where the injury is inflicted she has an old wound, inflicted by her husband many years ago, and since her discharge from the hospital she has been constantly intoxicated; this prosecution has been got up entirely from malicious motives.</p>

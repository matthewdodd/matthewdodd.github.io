            ; they employed the prisoner as the broker: I was confident he was not employed by them in this last case, as he would not show his authority - he had not then sold the former goods; they have now realised considerably more than the rent. I asked for his authority; he gave me none - he took the goods away about eight o'clock in my presence - I have purchased such of them as I wanted; but they were shifted from place to place, and it was quite by accident I discovered them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not, on the 15th of June, send to say that he had got the authority, but wished to give you an opportunity to pay your rent? A. He did - when he was brought into the Court of King's Bench to be bailed, I certainly interfered, and wished him to be brought to gaol - the Judges said it was no felony, but it was a robbery.</p>

I saw Abbott, on the morning in question, come and ask if Warren was at home - I said not - he spoke to Warren's son, and left his man in possession; and when the goods were condemned, he took them away in his cart - on Saturday evening he came again, and took these things, which were not in the inventory.</p>

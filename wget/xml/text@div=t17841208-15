               <p>Did you see him put his hand into the gentleman's pocket? - I did.</p>
               <p>Are you quite positive? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you see what he took out? - The gentleman's handkerchief, it appeared to me to be a white handkerchief, it was done so sudden I could not venture to say what it was, I called after the gentleman, I told him where the boy was; they ran over the way, right against the gentleman, I imagine he came for a second attack.</p>

               <p>Court. Did the lad that put his hand into his pocket run up Field-lane? - Yes, he was out of my sight, but I am quite sure he is the lad; I had stopped the gentleman and he went to go after him, and before he could get off the curb, the lad was right up against him again.</p>
               <p>Should you know the gentleman again if you saw him? - Yes, that is the gentleman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 18). On the morning of 20th Dec.

Osmond's Coffee-house, Dec. 18th, 1851. If A.G. has not met with an engagement yet, he is requested to call tomorrow, Friday, about 1 o'clock, at the above-named coffee-house, in the Strand, and to inquire for Mr. Sims. If found suitable he will find employment")—I also found on him this slip of paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Sims has been waiting for A.G. a whole hour; he requests him to come immediately to the Duke of York's Column, where he will find Mr. Sims, leaning against the column")—I asked him where he had got the check from—he said he had put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, and that he had received the note which I have just produced in reply to it, requesting that he should meet a gentleman at Osmond's Coffee-house, in the Strand; that he went to Osmond's Coffee-house, and, instead of seeing a gentleman, he received that strip of paper, directing him to go to the Duke of York's Column; that he went to the Duke of York's Column; that he saw no one leaning against the column, as described in the piece of paper, but he saw a man come up to him, as he was looking about, who said, "Are you looking for me? I see you are; you have got my piece of paper in your hand;"that he then asked him for references to his character, and directed him to meet him at Osmond's Coffee-house on the morrow morning, which was Saturday, at 10 o'clock; that he went accordingly, on the morrow morning, and, as he was about to step into Osmond's Coffee-house, the party that he had seen at the Column the day before said, "You are behind your time," and asked him where he had been to, and said he had been waiting for him a quarter of an hour; he (Gerber) replied, "Not so long as that;" the party said, "I have; if you want busi<lb></lb>ness,</p>

               <p>you must be more punctual;" that he then gave him the check, and directed him to go and get the money for it, and the party who had given him the check walked after him sharply, and said, "Have you any bags to put the money in?"he replied, "No, but I have good pockets;" he told him if he wanted business he must be prepared with those sort of things, and gave him these two bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I found on him—Gerber was taken to the police-court, remanded till the Tuesday, and then discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Selim, Dean, and Co., silversmiths and money-changers, of 9, Coventry-street. This check for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a forgery—it is not my writing or my partner's, or written by our authority—it was brought to me on 20th Dec. by one of the clerks of the bank—on Friday, 12th Dec, the prisoner Kessler came to our shop, and requested change for some foreign money—he brought thirty-eight thalers and an American eagle or gold coin—I agreed to change them—they came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in English money, which I laid on the counter—he then said he wanted to send the money to a party in the City-road, and he thought it would be too late for a Post-office order, and asked me which I thought was the best way to send it—I told him as it was too late for a Post-office order, he had better send it by a porter—he said that would be too much trouble, would I oblige him with a check—I said I would, and he threw a sovereign on the counter and told me to write the check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and make it payable to John Asch—I took the sovereign, took the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. difference, and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., keeping 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him a check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you a way of drawing checks under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. different from those of a larger amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I always join the last letter of the amount with the word "pounds," so that it should not be filled up for a larger amount, and in consequence of that I make a particular kind of "P"—I join the two letters together, so that the "eight" could not be altered to "eighty," or "nine" to "ninety"—I did so in the check I gave Kessler—if the check is for a larger amount than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is not my form at all—on the following day I received a letter, which I have not preserved—I do not know whose writing it was—on the Saturday the clerk of the London and Westminster Bank produced to me the check for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which 1 at once said was a forgery—our checks are numbered 6723; we have no checks of No. 6725, which is the number of the forged check—the form of the "P" in the forged check corresponds with my form of making the "P" when I draw under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we very rarely give checks under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of noticing that peculiarity in the check, I proceeded that same day to find Kessler—I went to many places—I went first to Castle-street where he formerly lived, and ultimately to the Cafe National in Cranbourne-street, where I found him—I asked him to tell me to whom he had sent the check that I had given him on Friday, the 12th, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had sent it to the Holloway-road, St. John's Wood—I asked him the number of the house—he said he did not put any number; there was no number put on the letter—I told him that when he obtained the check from me he said he wished to send it to the City-road—he said he thought not, that he was not quite certain whether it was the City-road, the Holloway-road, or St. John's Wood, but he thought it was the Holloway-road</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230051"></xptr>
               <p>road—he seemed very much disconcerted by my questioning him, and asked me my motive for making these inquiries as to whom he sent the check—I told him that the check had been imitated, and one forged for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been presented at the London and Westminster Bank that day, and therefore it would be very important for his own character to let me know the party to whom he sent it—he said he would do so, that he would try if he could find out—he then told me how it was he came to send the check—he said he had re<lb></lb>ceived a letter demanding payment of the money—I then asked him if he had the letter directing him to send the money—he said no, he had destroyed it, he thought, he did not take care of it; he saw it was a demand for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he owed, and having sent it, he took no more care of the letter—he told me that the demand arose in this way, that a French gentleman seeing him change foreign money at his Cafe for one of his customers (he keeps the Café National) asked him to change some for him, and gave him some foreign money which came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that on examination he told his friend he had not English money to pay the gentleman 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the gentleman thereupon said it was of no consequence, he would take the money when he came again, leaving the French money in his hands—he did not come again, but wrote him a letter which he received on the Friday morning, stating that he was about leaving London for Paris, and he was to send him the amount in Post-office orders—I told him that it was very important that he should have kept that letter; I thought his mode of doing business was very careless, and begged of him to try and recollect to whom he had sent it, and I would call again on the Monday morning—this was on the Saturday—I went again on the Mon<lb></lb>day with Webb, the officer—Kessler said he had used all his endeavours, but he could not recollect where he had sent it; he had even borrowed a "Directory" to try if he could refresh his memory from that, and with that we left—I have never heard from him to whom he se'nt the check—I saw Gerber when he was discharged on 22nd at Marlborough-street—he said he knew the party by sight well that gave him the check, having seen him at the Argyll-rooms and different places of amusement.</p>

               <p>not ask me if it could be cashed in the City-road—he asked me whether it was necessary to register the letter—I said, "No, we never registered letters for so small a sum—when he left he did not make any observation about his going to post the letter—when I went to his house, I saw the place where he keeps his bills and letters, it is at the further end of the shop, as you go in, from Cranbourne-street—the house has two entrances, one in Cran<lb></lb>bourne-street, and one in Newport-street—there were some letters on a rack, and a great number on a file, and in a sort of portfolio—when I asked him to look for the letter he examined those in the rack—there were about two or three in the raek—he then examined the letters on the file—there probably might have been twenty or thirty there—he did not examine them, he merely showed me where he kept important letters—he did not look on the file for this letter, but told me at once he had not got it, he had not taken care of it, as he deemed it of no importance—the letter rack is against the wall close to the bar—it was accessible to any persons that liked to go to it, in the house—I did not tell Kessler, I had only given two ehecks that week, I am quite sure of that—I did not ask Kessler to go to Marlborough-street when Gerber was there first, he offered to come—when I went on the Monday, I believe Webb asked him in my presence—I told him there was a person going to be examined at Marlborough-street relating to the forged check, and he called on me for the purpose of going to Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—I told him it was much too early, and I did not intend going till I knew the case would come on—I have carried on business as a money<lb></lb>changer in Coventry-street about fifteen years—I was formerly servant to Mr. Solomons, who was unfortunate some time ago in the gold dust robbery—Mr. Selim is my partner, his name was formerly Solomons—I was in Mr. Solo<lb></lb>mons' service at the time of the gold dust robbery.</p>

See Reg. v. Hinks, 2 Car., and Kirwan, 462, and Reg. v. Arundel, 4 Cock's Crim. Cases</hi>, 260. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called the attention of counsel to a passage from Lord Hale, quoted in Russell, which stated that a party jointly indicted with others need not be put upon his trial at the same time with them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in urging the same objection, thought that the force of the passage from Lord Hale would depend very much upon whether the word "trial" was to be taken in its limited sense to mean the mere trial of the issue joined, or whether it was to be taken as including the plea, the arraignment, and other proceedings connected with it; if the latter construction was to prevail, he contended that the witness having been arraigned, and having pleaded, he was actually upon his trial, and that therefore it was too late for the prosecution to use him as a witness unless a verdict of acquittal were taken.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that no objection upon the latter point could be sustained; the prosecution were clearly entitled to apply, as they had done, that the witness might be tried separately, and that application (not opposed) having been granted, it could not he said that the witness was upon his trial, the Jury not being charged with his case; with respect to the first point, it had now been settled for considerably more than a century, that it was no objection to the competency of a witness, that he, being an accomplice, had received an implied or even an express promise of pardon; he had no doubt therefore that the evidence was receivable. The witness was then sivorn, and examined as follows</hi>:) I have known the prisoner, Wagner, between twelve and fifteen months, or the utmost, might be eighteen months—I have been in the habit of meeting him at his own house, and at Kessler's, 4, Leicester-street, Leicester-square—that is a coffee-house, and there is a room up stairs for gambling—some time previous to this transaction, Wagner said he could show me a way to make money if I would bring him signatures of people—he said, "If you can procure me signatures from people, and people to send for money, I can make money, and you can get your part out of it"—for a time I did not bring him any, but afterwards he had some signatures through me—I do not know that he did any<lb></lb>thing with those signatures he received through me, he did not tell me; he said they would be made use of, but I have not heard anything of it—previous to</p>

               <p>this check being presented at the London and Westminster Bank, Wagner said to me, "I shall receive a check from Kessler on which we will use the signature, and get 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. money on the name (of Selim, Dean, and Co.,) at the London and Westminster Bank"—he did not mention, the name at that time—I knew that was the name when I saw the check—he said, "I shall get a blank check, and it will be done very soon, and engage me a party who is going for the money"—I said I would try to get a person—he said there would be 10 per cent, to pay away from the money for the blank check, and the rest would be divided into four parts, of which Wagner was to have a quarter, the writer of the check a quarter, and the informant who brought the check a quarter (that was Kessler), and a quarter for the man who went for the money—he said I must make a bargain with the person who was going for the money, what he would give me, if I could get half, well and good, if not I must take what I could get—I was to have as much of the fourth as I could get, the more the better for me—Wagner said the man who was to go and get the money was to advertise in a newspaper for a situation, with his real name and place of abode, whereupon he would receive a letter to call at a certain place, at a certain hour, to meet with an engagement; alter that he would receive at that place a note which would appoint a place where to meet a gentleman who wished to engage him; but he should not mind that appointment as I should instruct him further, as it was only done to save him from trouble, in case he was taken up, by uttering the check—he said I must instruct him further to ask for Mr. Sims; after receiving the note I was to instruct him to call the next day, and take the check to a cer<lb></lb>tain place which I was to appoint—I have known Gerber several years; I saw him after I had this conversation with Wagner, and I told Gerber I had been ordered to get a man for a certain purpose, and if he would like to go for the money—he at first raised objections, but afterwards when I told him that I was instructed to telt him that the case was so arranged that in case he should be taken up nothing would happen to him, he was satisfied to go, telling me that he had no clothes to put on to appear respectable—I after<lb></lb>wards saw Wagner, and told him that I had got a man who would go for the money, but he had no clothes to put on, and was poor—Wagner said, "Cannot you give him a coat?"—I answered, "I have only got one, and that is a new one"—he told me to give him that coat, and I should get the money out of the amount that would be fetched, and he gave me at the same time 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give to Gerber to redeem his trowsers and waistcoat out of pledge—I gave the money to Gerber—I cashed this check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the bank—I got it from Wagner—when he gave it me he asked me to get it cashed; I had seen it before at Wagner's—after Wagner had told me he would get a check from Kessler, he told me in case Kessler came to his house I was to leave the room, because Kessler would not like me to see it; because Kessler did not wish me to know he gave Wagner the check; he did not wish me to know him in the affair; that was before he gave me the check—Kessler came and I took my hat, said, "Good morning," and went out of the room—Kessler was with Wagner about half an hour, and then I was called back, but I cannot say whether it was by Wagner or the girl—when I got back Wagner showed me this check—he did not then give it me—I should say it was four or five days after that he gave it me, and I cashed it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">the advertisement</hi>) is my writing—I wrote it in the coffee-house for Gerber—I told him I had a copy from Wagner how to write out the advertisement—I took him to the coffee-house to write the advertisement himself which I put before him—I had the copy from Wagner how to write it out, but Gerber not being able to spell it properly I said, "I</p>

Letters, post-paid, A.G. 34, Percy-street, Bagnigge-wells-road"—I gave that to Gerber, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—I gave him the coat he has on now; I went with him to buy a hat, and he had a satin stock of mine—I made an appointment with him that he should meet me nearly oppo<lb></lb>site Osmond's coffee-house in the Strand, at 1 o'clock on Friday—that is the coffee-house where he was to ask for Mr. Sims, according to the letter, and I took him I believe on Thursday up the Strand to show him the house—Wagner told me to make an appointment with Gerber at a certain place which I was to choose, and inform Wagner where it was, and he would wait at a little distance and follow us to the bank—that was on the Saturday—I had made an appoint<lb></lb>ment with Wagner to meet him at his house on the Friday as usual—I met him at his house, 85, Long Acre, on the Friday about 11, and after 12, I am not sure what time it was, I left the house with him for the purpose of going to Osmond's coffee-house—we left the house going towards the Strand—I do not know the names of the streets where we passed, but I know there is on one side a very large urinary going up to Drury-lane—when we got near there the officer Jervis met us, and I told Wagner, "For God's sake there is Jervis coming! I had better go away," and I went away from him up the urinary—I knew Jervis—when I came up the Strand, at the corner of the Strand and that street, I met Gerber and took him into the Crown public-house, which I believe is opposite Osmond's coffee-house—Wagner said he was going to Osmond's coffee-house to leave the note there—while we were in the public-house we bad some pale ale and bread and cheese, and not long after, about 1 o'clock, Wagner came in and called for something, and I told Gerber, "Now it is time for you to go;" Wagner did not tell me where he had been to before he came there, but I noticed—I told Gerber it was time for him to go to Osmond's, as he would find a note there—Wagner had told me he was going to leave that note there—that was before I left in the morning—I went with Gerber at the door, to send him out—I told him as soon as he got the note to follow me up the street right opposite, the street that leads to Covent-garden market—I then came out opposite Osmond's, and turned back again to that street, and walked slowly on—I left Wagner in the public-house—he came after me, and passed me—he did not join me—he said, "It is all right; I have seen him; I am going home," and passed on—Gerber followed me, and I kept in advance of him till we came to Covent-garden, where I turned the corner sharp, and waited at the corner—when he came up I told him, not stopping with him, to meet me that night at my house—he met me at my house that evening, and I told him to call in the morning, I believe at 9 or a little after, at the Giant in Drury-lane—on the Saturday I went to Wagner's about 9, and he placed a check in my hands and some bags—this is the check he gave me (<hi rend="italic">the forged one</hi>), and these are the bags—hesajd, "You place that check in Gerber's hands, and tell him to go for the money; let him ask for ten twenties, and the rest in gold, and you show him the place, and I shall follow you," and the notes were to be taken to the Bank of England, to be changed, or to several money changers for foreign money, and he said that Gerber was to go first to the money changers in the Hay market, and get foreign money for part, and that if he got the money, after that he might know him, Wagner—he did not know him at all until they were placed together at the Mansion-house—Wagner had seen Gerber at the public-house—Wagner said that in case Gerber did not get the money he was to say that a gentleman had sent him, a dark gentleman</p>

               <p>with black whiskers, and some description, and to appoint a particular mark in his face, so that he should not be found, as he said they would take him about to look for the man who sent him—I went to the Giant to meet Gerber, and Wagner followed me—when I got to the Giant, Gerber was waiting opposite—I went in, and he followed me—he had some pale ale, and I placed the check and the bags in his hand, and walked on with him towards the Bank, Wagner following—Gerber went to the London and Westminster Bank—he had on my coat, which was a sort of mixture—when he went into the bank, me and Wagner were waiting outside—we were not together—we walked up and down the street, and into the square—once or twice he came over and spoke to me, and then we separated again—I saw a policeman go into the bank—I told Wagner, and We then left—Gerber was discharged from the police-court on the Tuesday—after that Wagner told me that I should not take the coat away from Gerber, I should let him keep it, and he would give me a sovereign to give to Gerber, and he, Wagner, would give me another coat—on the Friday following he went with me to Mr. Bullock's, and bought me a coat, and another on the Monday—Mr. Bullock's is No. 2, some street of which I do not know the name—it leads into Long-acre—he bought two coats for me, and one for himself.</p>

I saw Krakauer, in company with Wagner, go to a public-house, at the corner of Vinegar-yard, Brydges-street, Drury-lane—it was about twenty minutes past 12 o'clock when they left Wagner's house—I had seen Krakauer go there about 11—they went from Long-acre, through Bow-street and Russell-street, turning into Brydges-street to the Drury-lane tavern opposite Drury-lane theatre, going in the direction of the Strand, and in the direction of Osmond's coffee-house—Drury-lane tavern is at the corner of Vinegar-yard, the front of it is in Brydges-street—I left them there—after about an hour I returned to my former position in Long-acre, and saw Wagner go into a public-house in Long-acre—that was about half-past 2, I think—I was in company with Jarvis, both times—I know Kessler—I have fre<lb></lb>quently seen him go into Wagner's-house, almost daily I should say—I was watching the movements of Wagner and Krakauer from the beginning of Dec. till about 4th of Jan., the day we took them into custody—when I saw Krakauer, on 19th Dec, he had a gray Witney coat on.</p>

On 8th Dec, from instructions I received, I was engaged with Badcock to watch Wagner's lodgings, No. 85, Long-acre—I know Krakauer—Wagner occupied the second floor—I have seen Krakauer in that second floor with Wagner, I believe daily, from 8th Dec. until 4th Jan.—I know Kessler—I often saw him go to Wagner's from 8th Dec. to 4th Jan.—before the 13th Dec. Krakauer was in the habit of wearing a gray Witney coat—on 13th Dec.

                  </hi>. I am waitress, at Osmond's coffee-house in the Strand. On 19th Dec. I remember a person coming there, and ordering a chop—it was the prisoner Wagner—he said, "If any one inquires for a Mr. Sims, send him in to me"—no one came and inquired while he was taking his chop—after he had taken it, and paid for it, he called for a sheet of paper—I got it him, and then I left the room—when I returned to the room, he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), and told me to give it to any one that might come and inquire for Mr. Sims—he then left the house, and about ten minutes after Gerber came and said, "Is Mr. Sims here?"—I said, "No, he is gone, but he has left you this strip of paper," and I handed it to him—he read the paper, said "Thank you," and left the house—after Wagner had left, I observed he had left half a sheet of the paper which I had got for him on the table—the note I received from Wagner was no part of that paper—I cannot state the exact time Wagner was there—it was about from half past 12 to 1 o'clock—he wore a coat that came round and buttoned over—I call it a dress coat—his hair was rather dark—I have not the least doubt Wagner is the man, I am sure of it.</p>

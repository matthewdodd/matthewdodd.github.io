On Thursday the 29th of June, as the prisoner was going home to dinner, the warehouse man detained him, saying, he had something in his pocket. I took him into the cellar and asked him what he had in his pocket? He replied nothing at all. I lifted up the flap of his pocket and saw the pepper and asked him what that was? He artfully replied I have been working this morning without my coat; and one of my fellow servants, having a malice against me, has done this. I replied, that would not do; I was happy I had discovered the thief for the sake of the reputation of my other servants, and that he must come along with me. He instantly threw off his coat and said, The pepper was not his property, and he would not have the property of another about him. I laid hold of the coat with one hand and the man's arm with the other, left he should get away; and turning round to the cellar door I observed my partner, Mr. Campbell, coming towards me. I said Mr.

             this is the man who robbed us; while I was conversing with him the prisoner slipped out of my hand, and escaped into the lane by another door of the cellar, and left his coat behind him; we all pursued him into Thames-street, where we missed him; then we divided, and when I returned he was brought into the compting-house. Mr. Campbell called upon him to confess, but prior to his making confession, he was told that the way to expect favour was to discover his associates. My lord will it be proper to mention his confession after that.</p>

               <p>Court. It will not; you do very right to mention it.</p>

On Thursday was se'nnight I ordered the prisoner to go to dinner; he was at work without his coat; he went backwards to the place where his coat lay, and staid about ten minutes; when he came forwards I met him and saw his pockets were very full, and could discern it was pepper. I called Mr. Travers and he took him into the cellar to search him.</p>
               <p>Do you know where his coat had been lying? - Yes; upon some lump sugar in the back part of the warehouse. I had an information of him and concealed myself in the desk. I had sent all the other men to dinner before him, in order to see whether he would do it or not; there was no-body there but our cooper's little boy in the front shop; when the men were gone to dinner I went and put my hand in his pockets and they were empty.</p>
               <p>Had the boy been backwards after that time? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you can say upon you oath there was no man went backwards into the warehouse after you felt in my pockets and had sent the men to dinner? - I am upon my oath, there was not one.</p>

               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I was recommended to the prosecutor by one of the first merchants in London. I served him a considerable time as warehouse-man, and quitted his servitude with a character unblemished. I served the prosecutor with the same integrity, but with fellow servants who were full of malice against me, and to complete their diabolical design have done this; finding my coat heavier than it used to be I put my hand into my pocket and found it was black pepper. I thought it was done out of a joke, but I found it was meant to destroy me. I went to put it out into the tub but I thought I would go to Duett to show it him in order to find the person out who had put it into my pocket; he told me immediately that Mr. Travers wanted to speak to me in the cellar about some fruit. I went down into the cellar; he asked me what I had in my pocket, and threatened to hang me. I thought it was to be done in the cellar, and therefore I made my escape but was taken and brought back; and then they talked again of hanging me; there was a soldier's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280247"></xptr> bayonet lying; I thought they were going to put an end to my existence. I begged they would suffer me to be tried by the laws of my country. Mr. Travers then promised I should, and sent for a constable. I have a disconsolate wife near the time of her delivery. I leave myself to the mercy of the jury, trusting they will make a just sentiment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Travers. I did not say I would hang him, nor to my knowledge I did not threaten him.</p>

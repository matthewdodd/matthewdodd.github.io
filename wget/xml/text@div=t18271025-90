            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October, about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Castle-street, Saffron-hill - he had a cloth, with something in it; I followed him into an iron-shop; he put it on the ground: I asked what he had there - he asked what it was to me; I said I was an officer, and insisted on knowing - he said it was iron, and while I was looking at it he ran out; I marked it - it was lead. I ran out, calling Stop thief! secured him, and gave him to Waddington; he struck at me several times: I took him to the office; I afterwards fetched the lead - he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250050"></xptr>had found it against the foundry gates; I went to the <placeName id="t18271025-90-crimeloc542">foundry in School-house-yard</placeName>

I compared it with two places on the roof - it fitted exactly, and was certainly cut from that roof; the edges appeared quite fresh, and bright.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you he had found the lead? A. He said it was iron - nobody could tell what it was without opening the cloth; he was about a quarter of a mile from the foundry; he was asked where he lived, and said in School-house-yard: I then said,"I will be bound it came from the foundry;" I went to his house, and saw two or three children. I found a half-crown and a knife on him: his window leads out into the foundry yard. I found a ladder in the cellar of the foundry; it is not now used as a foundry. I found no lead in his house, nor any thing which appeared to have cut lead.</p>

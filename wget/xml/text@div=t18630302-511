                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Rotherhithe—on Saturday, 21st February, I was drinking in a public-house with the prisoner, another soldier, and a young man named Phillips, for about an hour at the first house—I was not quite sober, but knew what was going on—we all four left together, and I stopped for a necessary purpose—I had about 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I left the public-house, but no purse—I felt the money safe five minutes before I left—I was wearing the prisoner's cap, and he was wearing my hat—he came and took the cap off my head, and then I felt a pull at my pocket, and the prisoner ran away—I found my pocket torn, and my money gone—I had seen the prisoner once before, and knew him—I saw him again on the following Tuesday—I have no doubt he is the man—no one else was close enough to me to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the Commercial Docks—I left with Clark—he turned aside, and at that time the prisoner was close by him—I saw him put his hand in the prosecutor's trousers-pocket, and run away—the prosecutor immediately said that he was robbed—he was not quite sober, but knew what he was about—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 1). On 24th February, I went to the barracks, and the prosecutor picked the prisoner out from several others—I told him the charge—he denied it—I asked him if he had been at Rother<lb></lb>hithe on Saturday night—he said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor, and have offices in Essex Street, Strand—I live at No. 8, New Ormond Street, Bedford Row—about ten o'clock on the night of the 11th May I arrived at my door—I knocked and then turned round—there is a light on the pavement about two yards from my door, and another one on the opposite side of the street—just as I turned round the prisoner came and attacked me—another man was with him, and I think there was also a boy—the prisoner Mruck at me with something,</p>

               <p>but I warded the blow off with my stick, which broke it—I said, "Halloa! what do you want to do? "—he struck me about the body and head, and seemed to be trying to get at my throat—he then struck me a very heavy blow on the shoulder, I believe with a life-preserver, which knocked me down—while down he kicked me, and gave me another blow on the knee as hard as he could, which completely disabled me, and I could not move—I had in my pocket a gold watch, which was attached to my waistcoat by a gold chain, and while I was down the prisoner jerked it away with great force—they were worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got up and cried out, "Stop thief! "—I went and found two policemen, and they had to take me home—a surgeon came and found my shoulder was dislocated—I have not seen the watch and chain since—on Whit Monday I went to the House of Detention—I recognised the prisoner out of ten or eleven prisoners, but I did not say anything there—I saw him at the station with four others, and amongst them was Crawley, and I was of the same opinion that he was the person—I asked the jailor to put his hat on—the night he attacked me he wore the same coat as he has on now, and he had on what is called a Fenian hat.</p>

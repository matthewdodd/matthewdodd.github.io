Elliott, the brewers, deal with us for straw—on 27th Aug. I sent three loads of straw to their brewery—I sent Wren and Brace with it in two carts, about four o'clock—I saw them leave Smith<lb></lb>field with it—I directed them to deliver it at Elliott's and Co., at Pimlico—it would take them about an hour to go—I saw Wren and Brace again the same evening about eight—Brace produced to me the receipt for the two loads of straw—they were worth 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load, four guineas altogether—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read—27th August,</hi> 1850, <hi rend="italic">received three loads of straw.

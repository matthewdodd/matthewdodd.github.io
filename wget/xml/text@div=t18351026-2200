                  </hi>. I live in Downer's-cottage, Kingsland-road. On Wednesday, the 14th of October, I met two girls in St. Giles's—the pri<lb></lb>soner Rosetta is one of them—I accompained them to a house in St. Giles's, up stairs—it was three o'clock in the morning—I had been out to dinner—I went up stairs with both of them—one of them instantly left the room with my watch, leaving Rosetta in the room—they had been both together—the girls and I entered the room together—I was tipsy—Rosetta went on one side of the room, towards the bed—I was standing between the two girls—the other girl was on my left—I pulled off my cost and waist-coat, and placed my watch with them, on a table by the window—the other girl stood by the table, she took my watch, and went off immediately—I ex<lb></lb>pected she would return, and remained in the house—I went to bed with Ro<lb></lb>setta—I remained there, and in about an hour Charlotte came into the room with another women—I mentioned about my watch being taken, and I gave Charlotte half-a-crown, and the other woman a shilling, to go out in search of my watch—they returned in an hour, or an hour and a half, and told me it was useless to look for the watch—they were both very much intoxicated—I remained there till about eight o'clock in the morning—at that time the two prisoners were in the room—Rosetta was in bed—Char<lb></lb>lotte brought me my clothes, and told me to put them under my head, and be careful that I was not robbed—Rosetta then got up, and both left the room—my clothes laid on the pillow, where Charlotte had put them—not under the pillow—in a quarter of an hour I got up to dress, and found my handkerchief and an umberlla, and velvet waistcoat, and card-case were gone—my pockets were emptied—I lost two half-sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in a small bag—this waistcoat, card-case, and umbrella, are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Lawrence-lane, St. Giles's, in the house of Peckham. The prisoners lodged up stairs—on the morning in question, I was standing against my room door, at seven o'clock—I saw Rosetta Harmer bring an umbrella down stairs—it was the one produced—it was a wet morning, and the umbrella was open—it was a green one—I took notice of it, it being so short at the top—that is the only thing I know it by—I did not look at it—I only saw it as she passed by me—I am certain it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker.

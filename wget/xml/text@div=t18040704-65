             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you live in Wych-street, in the Strand? - A. Yes; in the latter end of November last, the prisoner Howes came to my shop, and brought an order from Portsmouth for goods to the amount of twenty-five or twenty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a written order? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it? - A. No, they were to be sent off in the course of two days; he hurried me, because the ship was going off; I was to have ready money, and I sent the goods to No. 3, Isabel-place, Westminster-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards call to pay you? - A He came according to promise that same evening that I sent the goods, and brought me a draft at three months, which I returned to him the next day; I said to him, Mr. Howes, the agreement was cash, or I would not have hurried the goods; he said, he should have plenty of cash in a fortnight, and he would bring it me; I gave him four pounds one shilling change out of thirty pounds ten shillings; he promised to bring me the cash in a fortnight. When he was gone, I looked at the bill, and found it was not accepted; I went and shewed the draft to Mr. Bird; in consequence of a conversation with him, I went to Westminster-road the next morning, and got the goods again; I saw Mr. Howes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040069"></xptr>and he promised to call upon me in the afternoon with the four pounds one shilling. A woman, of the name of Williams, called about eleven o'clock, and brought me this bill, (producing it.) After she was gone, the prisoner Thody came, and said he was the person to accept that bill which Mrs. Williams had brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accept it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write this acceptance in your presence? - A. He did; I asked him if he knew Howes; he said, yes, he thought very highly of him as a professional gentleman, he had got a cause for him twelve years ago; I asked him how I was to get my four pounds one shilling. While we were talking, Howes came in, and wrote upon the back of this bill a memorandum, to which Thody put his name.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either Howes or Thody tell you any thing about No. 4, Temple-lane, London? - A. No, that was in the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe it to be his hand writing or not? - A. I rather believe it; not but it is larger than his usual hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that endorsement; do you believe that to be his hand writing? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you could not swear to his hand writing because it is larger than his usual writing? - A. I go by the H. I have seen him write very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him write? - A. I am not obliged to answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you are; upon your oath tell me one single thing you ever saw him write? - A. If my Lord requires me I will.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you where you have seen him write? - A. I saw him write a letter to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a perfumer? - A. Twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been a waiter? - A. Yes, at the watering-places, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose you are an itinerant perfumer? - A. I have the run of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house? - A. At Thurpark's, in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been getting a livelihood for twenty years past in the trade of a perfumer; have you never been an informer? - A. To be sure I have, for the good of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. And for the good of your own pocket too? - A. I do not say that; I never was but once in my life in a Court, and that was in the Court of Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Q. I know that is the Court in which informations are brought; where do you keep a shop? - A. I do not keep a shop at all; I sell my goods by wholesale; my warehouse is at Pentonville.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you go into Yorkshire? - A. I have not been there these eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again do you mean to swear from the comparison of some writing you may have seen, or from the knowledge of having seen him write, that this is the defendant's hand-writing, or from both? - A. From what I have seen, and from having seen writing that I believe to be his, I think this is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you talk of the run of the house, have you ever been in the capacity of an officer of any sort; I do not mean a military or naval officer? - A. Mr. Phillips, the Sheriff, employed me as a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been over the way lately? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been bail? - A. I am bail for the sheriff.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she shew you that bill? - A. That is the bill she produced to me; and I asked Thody if he had accepted that bill; he said he had; I asked him if he lived at No. 4, Temple-lane; he said he did; I said you may be a respectable gentleman for any thing I know, but it is very proper I should go and see if you live there, Mrs. White being a widow woman; but I should be more satisfied if I could see Mr. Howes, as he represented him to be a respectable gentleman; I said, I shall not suffer these goods to go till I see Mr. Howes, to know who he is, the goods were in a coach at the door; says he I can fetch Howes; he went out of the shop to fetch Howes, down Wych-street, and the coachman ran after him; in about three or four minutes he came back, and brought Howes with him; I asked him if his name was Howes, he said it was; I asked who drew this bill, and he pointed to Thody; I said, that cannot be, for Thody has accepted it. I said to Mrs. White's porter, get the goods out of the coach, it is an infernal piece of business, they are a set of swindlers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you afraid of these merchants bringing an action against you for destroying their credit? - A. I was threatened by Howes with a prosecution, Howes said he was an attorney; I said his actions were not like one, and I shut the door with intention to secure him; after many threats from Howes, I thought it best to let them out, for fear of a prosecution, not knowing the length that such gentlemen might go; the goods were delivered back safe into Mrs. White's shop, I kept the bill; I went to No. 4, Temple-lane, with the bill; I found it a respectable house in the profession of the law, the name of Lloyd was on the door, but I found no person of the name of Thody; there was another No. 4. I went there, but no such person was to be found there; I then got information of another Temple-lane, I went there, to No. 4, but no such person was to be found there, one Mr. Masters lived there. Some time afterwards, eight or nine days, I was coming through Scotland-yard, and saw Howes and Thody, I had a gentleman with me; I went up to them, and asked them for the balance that was due to Mrs. White; and Howes said, he had done business, to arrest one Wallis, for Mrs. White, and she owed him that money.</p>

Yes, a woman; I afterwards went to No. 28, Duke-street, I think it was the 11th of February; I went up stairs, and saw Mr. Howes; Mrs. Howes told him I had called concerning the masquerade tickets; he said, oh, he had not seen Mr. Ronalds, he supposed he had been in bad company, and lost the things; I said the things were brought here, and I should expect them returned from here; he then asked if I had got the note, and I said, no; he said, if I would give it him, he would try and get it changed for me; I did not deliver it to him; he then said he would get the things if possible for me, if I would call the next day; I called the next morning, and saw him at breakfast with Mrs. Howes; he asked me whether I had not been to Hoxton, and seen a lady there; I told him, yes, I had; I told him I would call again; he said, very well, if I would call again, he would do the utmost of his endeavours to get the things for me; he said first, he believed Mr. Ronalds a very good sort of a man, and there was no fear of my having them again; in about five minutes after he said Mr. Ronalds was a very indifferent sort of a man, and he thought he should never see either the things or the note again; I then went to Bow-street, and he was taken into custody about two o'clock that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He was taken at his own lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>

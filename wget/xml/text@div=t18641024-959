I said, "That has nothing to do with you"—she asked when I was coming out—I said, when I thought proper—she asked me for money—I refused to give her any, as she had no authority on me for money—she then gave me a slap on the face—she did nothing else then; afterwards, when I was moving from there behind the door, she came in again, and asked me again if I was coming out—I said no, I should come out when I thought proper—she then said, "Take that, and be d-d to you," and threw some liquid over me—it went right down my face, mouth, and neck, and all over my clothes, and burnt my clothes very much—it appeared like boiling water when it first came on my face—she ran away, and I went to the dispensary and had my face dressed.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—I told her it was for throwing vitriol over two men—she said, "I know all about it, I done it; I meant to throw it in his eye"—on Monday morning, in going from the station to the police-court, she said, "I did not mean to throw it in his face, I meant to throw it over his clothes. I got the vitriol from a bottle in the room" I got this mug from the room where Major was lodging—there was vitriol in it—I took it to a surgeon, and he tested it—I did not find any bottle in the room.</p>

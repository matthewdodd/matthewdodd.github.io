                  </hi>. I live at No. 46, Downham-row, Islington. I have a house which is unoccupied, at No. 28, in that row—I heard a noise in it between twelve and one o'clock on the 16th of June—I went in—the prisoner came down stairs into the passage, and asked me the rent of the house—I told him it was more than he could pay, and that he had been taking the locks off the doors—he said I had better go up stairs and see—he wanted to go away, but I made him go up stairs with me, and saw that two locks had been taken off two of the doors on the first floor—he instantly ran up into the attic, and when he got there I heard a noise as if he was throwing things down as quick as he cauld—I ran down and got a person to assist me—when we went up the prisoner came down to the bed-room floor—his pockets were hanging out, and he said, "I have got nothing about me"—I said we would see—I pushed him into the bed-room, and was about to leave him there, when he jumped out of the window, a height of about twenty feet—I found these locks, which be<lb></lb>longed to the bed-room floor, in the attic from whence the prisoner came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crescent-street, Euston-square. I was formerly a constable of Islington—to the best of my knowledge I know the prisoner by the name of James Wilson—I was in the Old Court in April, 1837, and to the best of my knowledge and belief he is the man I uw tried there—I have no doubt of it—I produce the certificate of his conviction—<hi rend="italic">read—(Convicted the 3rd of April, 1837, and transported for seven years</hi>)—I heard he was transported, and had a free pardon in 1841.</p>

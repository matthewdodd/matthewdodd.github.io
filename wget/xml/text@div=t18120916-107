I was returning homewards about a quarter after ten, in the morning part, I met the prisoner coming out of my shop, carrying away my pot before him. This is the pot. The pot was within the shop, under a table; it was within the shop for sale. After he had gone one hundred and fifty yards from the shop, I called to my wife, and, from her information, I pursued him. I asked him, what he was going to do with the pot? he said, it was his. I told him, it was mine, and I would take him to Marlborough-street. The prisoner said, do not keep me here among a mob of people; take me away somewhere. I gave him in charge of Cobham, the officer, and I delivered the pot to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to your shop, was there any body in the shop - A. No person at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You called your wife; from what room did she come - A. From a room in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from the door when you first saw him - A. He was just coming out of the shop. When I saw him coming out of the shop I was as far from him as I am from you.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had that pot - A. About three months. It stood me in about six shillings: it is worth about twelve shillings for copper.</p>

               Dean-street, St. Andrew's Parish
            </rs>, my house was broke open on the 13th of January, in the evening between seven and eight, I cannot tell exactly; they came in at the street-door, but I cannot say, whether the street door was upon the latoh or not, somebody came in unknown to me, and went up stairs to the first floor, and opened the dining room door, with a false key, my daughter about half an hour before, brought down the key into the kitchen, where I and my wife were, and laid it in it's place.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing broke? - Nothing; I lost a jacket and petticoat, and a surtout coat, and a cloth coat, the fellow to this waistcoat, I value the great coat at two pounds eight shillings, and the jacket and petticoat at twenty shillings, a cloth coat, value fifteen shillings, it was not much worn, and a pair of black velveret breeches, lined with leather, they are quite new, I never wore them, they cost me twenty-seven shillings, I value them at twenty shillings, there was another coat, what they call a Bath coat, with a green cape; I know my things were in the room that day about ten or eleven o'clock; I heard nobody in the house; I was below in the kitchen cleaning my tools, I am a milwright by trade, and I says to my wife, I have some tools lay in the chest up stairs, I will fetch them down; I took the key which my daughter brought down, and when I went up stairs, the door stood wide open, I was coming down in a passion, and I looked to see whether the bolt was slipped, and I found the bolt was back, that was before eight, it might be twenty minutes after my daughter was up there, or more; I called to my wife, and my daughter ran up stairs, and she declared that she locked it, and it had been opened, I had given a strict charge about it; I directly went and said to my son in law, run down to some of the pawnbrokers, and I will go to the others, so he went one way, and I went the other; and a young man from Mr. Dobree's came to my house, and brought me some of the things, and I found some at Mr. Lane's, the corner of the coal-yard, there I found a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did you find that at Lane's? - The next day, and I found the coat that is the fellow to this waistcoat, and a petticoat of my wife's, that had been pledged at Mr. Weston's.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was locked? - Yes, I always try it, and I tried it then, there are two people in the house besides us, and they might leave the street door open; there was a coverlid taken off the bed, and a blue stuff petticoat, and a green silk petticoat of mine.</p>
               <p>Were they up stairs when you locked the door? - Yes; I cannot say where my father's great coat and breeches were; there was a jacket and petticoat and handkerchief of mine hung over a chair by the bedside, and a white cloak of mine hung behind the door, there was one shirt and apron, but I cannot tell whether they were in the room when I locked the door.</p>

I took my watch out before I left the room, and it wanted three minutes to nine o'clock. Three men and two women were in the parlour - the three men were walking about. While I was taking up my stick, a fourth man came in, but I did not take much notice of him. The prisoners Read and Kelly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090023"></xptr>are two of the three. When I came out I left the four men and the two women in the parlour - I went out at the front door, turned up against a railing for a necessary purpose on the right hand, and then proceeded down the steps, and saw two men on the left; one on the right as if waiting for somebody to come down - when I got on the last step, the one on the right put his right hand on my fob, and his other hand on my collar - he put his hand outside my apron, took hold of the watch chain, and demanded what I had got; the other two, on the left, directly seized me by the throat, and throttled me so that I could not call for assistance. I attempted to strike the one who seized my chain, with my stick, but being so close, I had not power to strike. A struggle ensued, and one of the two said,</p>
               <p>"You b - r, if you don't let go, we will do your job for you." I still struggled with them and got one of them towards the door of

While I was down, the man who held the chain fell with me, by my stick getting entangled between his legs and mine, that pressed my apron strings tighter, so that they could not get the watch. I was kicked on both sides. I endeavoured to turn myself, and then I was able to cry Stop thief!

She put my hat on my head when she came up, and on being knocked down again, it went off; I do not know how it went from me. - There was no light but when they knocked me down a second time, a female came, and held two candles, and I could see the persons run up the place, and saw one had white stockings on - he was the person who had been in the parlour that night. One of them wore white stockings, but I do not know which. There was a tall man among them, who was neither of the prisoners - I only saw three men when I was attacked.</p>

I then opened the door, and went out; it was dark - the lamp gave a very bad light. I saw Jones, who I knew, laying on the ground, a short distance from my house, and three men at a little distance from him - I helped Jones up. I found his hat a little way from him, and put it on his head - he appeared exhausted. I said to them,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you go about your business, and let the man alone." I had not seen them do any thing. I led Jones towards his house; the three men followed; one of them took hold of my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"He has robbed a man of his handkerchief," and while I was speaking, the other two knocked Jones down - he got up, and was knocked down a second time. I said,</p>
               <p>"You'll kill the man." Two of them went up the steps; one of them, a short man, who wore white stockings, had Jones's hat in his hand. Neither of the three prisoners are the men who held my arm, I am certain, for that was a tall man. I cannot say that either of the prisoners is the one who had the hat. A woman came to the door of No. 7, with candles, and then they went away.</p>

On the 3d of March, Jones came to my house, and went into the parlour, where the three prisoners were - there was also a fourth man, taller than them, and two women - one was the wife of Sweeney, the tall man; and the other was the wife of one of the prisoners, but I do not know which. They had all four been to the house before, and sometimes used it. They have lived in the neighbourhood for years. When Jones went, he left them there; and in eight or ten minutes, they all four went to the door - the women remained. They all returned in about ten minutes, and went into the parlour. I did not see whether they brought any thing with them. They stopped nearly an hour after, and went away together with the women. Two other young men had been in after Jones left, and stopped till after the prisoners left. I cannot say, whether either of them had on white stockings. I found a hat in the parlour next morning. I do not know who brought it there. It was delivered to Jones's servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Since the transaction, have not some of them been at your house drinking as usual - A. Yes; the two young men came in after Jones went out, and before the four returned - the prisoners were drinking at my house the night before they were apprehended; they are respectable tailors, and have lived in the neighbourhood many years.</p>

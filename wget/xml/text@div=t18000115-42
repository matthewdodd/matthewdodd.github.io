               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What countryman are you? - A. A German; from Navarre.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You learned that this woman was a married woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you that the person she expected at home, was her husband? - A. No; only that she expected somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not turn out to be the most aukward person in the world; was it not the husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the husband, when you came to enquire for his wife as a woman of the town, threaten to beat your brains out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you talked of the watch, did he not say you should have no watch from that house? - A. No; he insulted me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had done to your wife what you had done to his, would not you have knocked my brains out, if you could have laid hold of me? - (The witness gave no answer.)</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you do not mind these things in Germany? - A. She was in that business.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mind these things in Germany? - A. I cannot give any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the watch upon the table yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And ran away, for fear of this somebody? - A. I did not run away.</p>
               <p>Q. When she told you she expected somebody disagreeable, you brushed off, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray how much did you pay for this crim. con. for which many a man has paid five thousand pounds? - </p>
               <p>Court. You are not obliged to answer that question.</p>

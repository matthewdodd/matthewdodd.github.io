               <p>You are the gentleman who went with money from the man under your care to fetch liquors for the women of the town? - We were coming up at two in the morning from the Strand, the watchman had got hold of a man for robbing the prosecutor, he gave me a shilling, and I went over and fetched the liquors, and brought the change to him, I was turning round and the other woman said to the prisoner , that is too bad before the patrols; I ran up to her, and caught her hand out of his pocket, she wanted to get her hand down.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not wonder at women's robbing men before your faces, if you suffer them to pick up men in this manner? - There was no picking up, we did not suffer them to go out of our sight.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. They attacked us about three in the morning, and the man went to fetch the liquor, the gentleman asked me to go with him to the place, I said I did not like to go, the other patrol said he did not like to go, so he took me and pulled me three or four yards down, he was in liquor; he said, I want to give them the bag, and the patrol said, damn your blood, what do you want to pick the man's pocket, I have owed it you a long time; the prosecutor would not go to maintain the charge, he counted his money over, and declared he had not lost a half-penny; two gentlemen of St. Martin's parish came up and said, why take the girl to the watch-house, she is not guilty; they said, damn your bloods, I suppose you are parties concerned, we will charge you, which they did, they found they were parishioners of St. Martin's parish, and they begged their pardon; Dorrington had been at No. 10, in Bennet's Court, and he wanted a guinea and a half to make the affair up.</p>

             in our court.</p>
               <p>Dorrington. On Saturday last I was down at Guildhall, Westminster, we had several trials, one concerning this man, it was this Mrs . Lawless that was with the prisoner, and told her not to rob the man; she was down at Westminster, and we went to have something to drink; I went to her house to let her know when the recognizances were to be withdrawn, and she said what can we do concerning this matter of Het Davis that is in prison now, says I, I can do nothing in it; says she I will give you a guinea, that will be half a guinea a piece, says I, I cannot make it up, I dare say the prosecutor will not hurt you, that was all I said; I could not stand and see that man robbed. I can bring people to my character, here is one of the beadles here if you please to call him.</p>
               <p>Court. Your conduct sufficiently speaks your character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

I am a baker, of 167, Camberwell New Road—on 12th April, between 3 and 4 P.m., I served the prisoner with two pennyworth of cake—he gave me a half-crown; I saw that it was bad as it laid on the counter, and asked him where he got it—he said he did not know; he thought he took it on Saturday night for his week's wages, but was not sure—I sent for a constable, and gave him in custody with the half-crown—he was remanded till the 16th and discharged.</p>

I was called to Mr. Sexton's shop and received this half-crown—I asked the prisoner where he got it; he said he could not account for it in any way, and that he was at work the day before at Mr. Austin's, a tobacco manufacturer in the Borough—I ascertained that he was an apprentice there, but had not been there for a fortnight—I found nothing on him—he gave his name "Arthur Anderson"—he was taken before a Magistrate, remanded till the 17th, and discharged.</p>

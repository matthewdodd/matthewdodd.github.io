                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 18, Berkeley-square. On Saturday evening, 2d Sept., about six o'clock, I was going in a steam-boat from Hungerford-market—as I was in the gang-way, I felt something in my pocket—I looked round very sharp, and saw the prisoner with my purse in his hand—I said, "You have picked my pocket"—he said something in Ger<lb></lb>man, and gave me my purse—it contained half-a-sovereign, two shillings, and a sixpence—I afterwards gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>and behind me—I did not understand what the prisoner said—I did not understand him to say that he picked the purse up—he went on in the vessel, and travelled with me up to London-bridge—he then went out of the vessel, and was given into custody at the corner of King William-street—I followed him for the purpose of giving him into custody—we kept close to him—there was a gentleman accompanying me—I have dropped my purse, but I do not know that I ever dropped it in the street—my pocket-hole is not wide—I found a hand in that pocket—there were persons before, around, and behind me—I do not think I could have been mistaken about a hand being in my pocket—there was an interpreter for the prisoner at the Mansion House—the hand appeared to come by the side of me—my pocket is in front, on the right side—it was there that I thought I felt a hand, and immediately I called out—I saw the prisoner with my purse in his hand—I did not see him pick it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Dover-yard, Piccadilly.

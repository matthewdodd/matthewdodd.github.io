I am a solicitor, of 40, Great Marlborough Street—on 13th November I was in a restaurant in Maddox Street—the prisoner came in with a baby in her arms, and showed it to two females, one of whom exclaimed "Good God! the child is dead!"—I looked at it, and thought it was dead, but it moved its arm—it looked like a living skeleton—we gave her some money, and I said "You ought not to have that child out; you should take it at once to the workhouse"—she made some gesture—I thought she was grateful for the advice, and left her there—a few minutes afterwards she came out, and I watched her from public-house to public-house, stopping everyone she came to in Regent Street and Oxford Street, and uncovering the child to show it—it was a cold, frosty night, and a keen wind—I thought the child would not lire the night through, and gave the prisoner in charge for begging, in order that the child might get sufficient food and care—when she came out of the restaurant, she appeared to pass some money to a woman, and therefore I determined to take steps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the Westminster Union—on 14th November, a female child was brought to me—I ordered it some medicine, a milk diet, and some wine—it was extremely emaciated, it only weighed 9lbs. 10z. without its clothes, whereas a child of that age ought to weigh 24lbs. or more—I sent it to the nursery, as there was hooping cough in the sick ward, and I directed that it should not be brought to me across the yard, but that I would go to it, which I did at some inconvenience—after its death I had it weighed again, and it only weighed 7lbs. 10 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2oz.—I had given it eggs, brandy, and everything possible, but I was satisfied that it would die when I first saw it—I found no marks of injury, only extreme emaciation—the heart was healthy, in the chest there were old adhesions</p>

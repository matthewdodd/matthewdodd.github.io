On the 22nd of September I was passing through Cornhill, and saw the prisoner pick Mr. Thomas Benja<lb></lb>min's pocket of a silk handkerchief—Benjamin is gone abroad—he appeared at the Mansion-house by that name, and answered to it—the prisoner tried to escape—Stock well stopped him—he threw down the handkerchief, and struck Stockwell a violent blow on the mouth—I took up the handker<lb></lb>chief, and took the prisoner into custody—MR. Benjamin claimed the handkerchief, in the prisoner's presence, on the spot—I saw sufficient of to say it was the same as I saw him take from his pocket.</p>

I am an iron merchant, carrying on business at Nos. 20 and 21, Upper Thames-street Early in Feb. last my premises were broken into—among other things, I missed two blank cheques from my cheque book—they were the ordinary cheques of a cheque book of Messrs.

               <p>I am not in any employment at present—I was last employed by Mr. Harris, the tailor, of Oxford-street, as porter—in Feb. last I was out of a situation—on the 18th I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and among other replies I received one purporting to come from a gentleman of the name of Hammond—in consequence of receiving that note I went next afternoon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, to No. 6, Oakley-crescent, City-road—I inquired for Mr. Hammond, and was shown np stairs, into the front room, and there saw a person calling himself Mr. Hammond—the prisoner is the person—if it is not the same person it is one just like, him—he asked me who I was—I told him I was James Humphreys—he said he wished me to produce the note, and then he should see which it was that had come, because he had written to several—I gave him the note—he said he had got business to do at Oxford and in London, and he should want me to collect bills and likewise to look after his horse and chaise—he said he was in Oxford some<lb></lb>times and sometimes in London, but his residence was in Oxford—I told him I could not take the situation because he said he wished me to go to live at Oxford—he said he would rather I would see him again to<lb></lb>morrow, he should like me to take his situation—he said, "I rather like your appearance, and if you will come to-morrow morning I have a few little jobs for you to do, if you don't mind undertaking them"—I then left—that was all that passed that day—I was with him perhaps six minutes—he—had his hat on during this conversation—he was sitting when' I went in, but he was standing part of the time—I went again next morning about 10 o'clock—he was not in—I waited for him in the passage—he came in in a few minutes—he went up stairs first and asked me to wait a minute—he afterwards called me up stairs—I had told him on the first occasion where I had been living, but that morning I told him I had made up my mind not to undertake the situation—he then asked if I would mind doing a few little jobs for him, and asked me to go to the Euston Station to fetch him luggage, a portmanteau and a carpet bag, coming from Bath, I believe—he said, "You know my name, you can ask; for Mr. Hammond's luggage"—I went and there was no luggage for him there—they said I had better go to the luggage department at Camden-town, which I did, but did not find any—I then went back to the prisoner—I found him waiting for me—I told him I could not find any luggage for Mr. Hammond—he said he did not know how it was that it was not there, it ought to have been there; however, it did not signify, he must send again—he then asked me if I would go to Lombard-street foot him, to take a cheque—I said yes—he gave me the cheque—this produced is it—I was to take it to. Smith and Sons, or Smith and Payne's, in Lombard-street, and get 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me to get so much in notes and so much in gold I forget what it was exactly, and bring it back to him—he said, "I suppose, you have not had your dinner"—I said, "No, sir"—he said, "I will give you sixpence, and you can have it before you come back, as I have act got the wherewith here to provide it for you"—I then took the cheque to Smith, Payne, and Smith's, the bankers, in Lombard-street, and presented it at the counter for payment—it was refused—I was taken into the; bank, and from there to Messrs. Mullens, the solicitors—I made a communication to them—I was detained there while they made inquiry about my character, and I was then released—I did not go back to the prisoner—on 5th April, I was taken by Mr. Forrester to the House of Detention (I had previously given a description of the person from whom I had the cheque)—I was taken to the doors of different cells, and was desired to look in each cell as I</p>

               <p>passed—two servants of the House of Detention were with us; one went before and opened the door, and the other came behind—I looked into each cell as I passed—I looked into twenty or thirty, it might be—I had passed all the cells except the last one, and after I had passed the servant said, "Have you seen any one that you know I" and I said "The last one that I passed was something like him"—the prisoner was in the last cell—the officer then said, "You have passed them all"—a day or two afterwards I went to Marlborough-street police court—I there saw the prisoner—I recognized him immediately upon his being brought into Court—I now believe him to be the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Q.</hi> Are you in service now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not been in service since I answered the advertisement—I have been obliged to borrow money from my friends—I have received none from Mr. Mullens that I am aware of, but I have received money from Mr. Mullens's clerk—that is not</p>

               <p>the friend I alluded to—I have had a good deal from friends—Mr. Mullens did not say he would not let me have any—his clerk let me have some—I have not been examined many times by Mr. Mullens, nor by his clerk, by neither of them—I communicated to the bankers that the prisoner said his name was Hawkins—I do not remember it—I do not remember telling any one that the prisoner had told me his name was Hawkins—I might have told the constable—I will not swear that I did—I know he gave the name of Hawkins at Marlborough-street—he gave it at the police station—when I went to communicate the circumstance to the bankers, I can swear I told some one there that he had given the name of Hawkins.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me you did not remember it. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It went out of my mind just at that minute; at least, I quite misunderstood yon—I went to the bankers immediately after meeting him—I swear that I told them he gave the name of Hawkins—I could not say that he had any whiskers at all, if he had, they must be very fair, they were scarcely discernible—I have never said that I was not positive that he was the man, I am positive he is the man—I never said that I was not positive to anybody—I told the inspector I had a very, very slight doubt—I do not remember saying that I was not positive he was the man—I do not remember using such words—I will not swear I did not—I will not swear that I did; I may have said it, and not recollected it—this man's hair is darker than the man's hair was who employed me, but he kept his hat on all the time—his features are the same—if he had lighter hair he must have had a wig—no one suggested to me about a wag—I did not mention to Mr. Mullens that he had a wig—I did not know that there was a necessity for it—I might have said it at the police court—I might have said it to the police constable—I did not say so to Mr. Mullens—I do not remember that I said so to the clerk—he took down what I had to say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at No. 16, Stanhope-street, Regent's-park. In March last some one came to look at the apartments—I let him in, and showed him up stairs—on the following day I let Bowells in—the same man was there then—Bowells afterwards went out—I let him in a second time—he went out again, and I let him in a third time—the man was still there—I did not see Bowells leave again, or the man—I did not see the man again until one Saturday, about a month afterwards, when the policeman brought him to the house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I opened the door, Bowells was with them—as soon as the man came into the house Bowells asked me if that was the man that came to our house and took the apartments—I said to the prisoner, "If you are not the man, you are his brother"—he said, "I am not"—he became rather violent, and I fainted away.</p>

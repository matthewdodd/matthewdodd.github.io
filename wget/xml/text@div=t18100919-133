             had oil on the quay in our charge, until the duties were paid. On the 18th of August, between eleven and twelve at night, I was walking down the Custom House quay, I saw three men standing very near together to the oil-cask; I said, what are you doing here, the prisoner was one of the three; as I stepped up to them, two of them ran away, and at the same time the prisoner had got a bladder in his hand, and appeared to be doing something at the bottom of the cask. I laid hold of the prisoner's coat, asked him what he was doing there; he begged for God's sake I would forgive him, and consider his wife and family. I told him I could not forgive him, my place was in danger. There was a pint of sweet Florence oil in the bladder, there were two spills in the cask. I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was shewn the oil in the bladder. I had oils at the Custom House Quay, and this oil was the same as I had there. I believe it to be mine. We had the cask re-guaged, there was a deficiency of some gallons.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

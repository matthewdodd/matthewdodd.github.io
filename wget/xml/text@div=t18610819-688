I am a whip-maker in Barbican—I have a partner—Stan-field was an apprentice to me, and Harris was a servant—about a quarter to 8 o'clock, on the morning of 30th July, I secreted myself in a room on my premises and saw Stanfield force a door which leads to another room, which is used as a warehouse for unfinished stock—he forced it with a long bar I then saw him open several nests and take out some mounts similar to those produced, put some in his pocket, and some he secreted under the flooring of the outershop—about 12 o'clock on the same day I saw him there with Harris—they both went in about seven or eight times, and each time opened several drawers, took mounts out, and put them in their pockets—I had previously to that made a communication to the police—I know Taylor; he was in my service four or five months, about five or six months back, till about February or March last—we had missed whip-mounts from our stock before this 30th July, for a considerable time—Stanfield was in my service at the same time that Taylor was; Harris was not—we were missing the stock every day, and I at last watched—we had missed some of those horns—I know that these mounts are mine; they have come out of our stock—they cost us about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a set—I recognise these handles—we purchased fifty-four of these hooks, and they degenerated to thirteen—we call them buck hook whistles—they are used for sticks and hunting tops—we had not sold any either to Taylor, Stanfield, Harris, or anybody else.</p>

I was apprentice to Mr. John Smith, the prose<lb></lb>cutor—on 30th July, about a quarter to 8, I broke open a door leading to the warehouse, and took out some whip mounts, and again at half-past 11.

I had taken some about three times before that I took some to the prisoner Taylor, and some to Harris. I think Taylor gave me sixpence a set for some of these mounts. I took about fifteen or sixteen buck-horn hooks. I did not know that there were fifty-four of those—I took them to Taylor, and he gave me fivepence and sixpence apiece for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Feltham, and am foreman to Mr. George Daw—on Saturday night, 12th October, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was on the Staines Road, with my wife—Linsey and Kilby (<hi rend="italic">Parker</hi>), in company with another man, came across the road—Linsey grasped his left hand at my watch-chain, and struck a blow at me with his right—I bobbed my head on one side, and it just brushed my whiskers—I threw down a basket which I had in my hand, and I struck at Linsey and knocked him down—my wife called for the police and screamed "Murder!"—a man came up with a horse and cart, and one of the prisoners went up and told the man to go on—he said he should not, for he knew there was something wrong—he jumped off the cart, came towards me, and the prisoners ran away—during the transaction, Parker said "Come on; that is not parties," and my wife said "That is Kilby, the plasterer."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was with him on the Staines Road going home—three men came across the road towards us—the prisoners are two of them—Linsey clutched at my husband's watch-chain, and struck at him—the blow missed, and my husband knocked him down—I called out, and a man came along with a cart—one of them went up and told him to go on, and he said he should not for he knew there was something the matter—I still screamed, and Kilby came up and said to Linsey, "Don't, they are not the proper parties," and I noticed he was Kilby, the plasterer.</p>

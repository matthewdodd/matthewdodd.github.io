               putting off several Counterfeit Guineas, &amp;c. knowing the same to be Counterfeit
            </rs>. It appeared, that on the 15th of March, the Prisoner and Harpham were drinking together at the <placeName id="t17250513-61-crimeloc296">Rummer Tavern, Charing-Cross</placeName>

He carried it down to his Mistress at the Bar. She scrupled it for being so thick. Mr. Thomson, Warden of the Mint, happened to be behind the Bar at the same time, and desired to see it. He caused it is be cut, and it proved Counterfeit. Harpham and the Prisoner afterwards coming to the same House were apprehended</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172505130008"></xptr>Mr. Reynolds thus deposed. I paid the Prisoner twenty two Guineas on Account of Mr. Hornby. The Prisoner being blind, or pretending to be so, he fumbled over the Guineas a pretty while out of one Hand into t'other, and then began to ring 'em; and one of 'em not sounding well, he desired me to give him another for it, which I did; but when I look'd upon it, I told him I was sure that he never had that Guinea from me, for all that I gave him were old Guineas, but this was a new shining one; but I thinking it might be good, I made no more Words of it, but paid it away in the Afternoon; but the next Day it was return'd me. I told him of it, and he readily gave me two good Half-Guineas for it.</p>

             thus deposed. I desired the Prisoner to give me Silver for a Guinea; which he did, after Mrs. Reves, his House-keeper, had look'd upon it, and told him it was good. But next Day she brought me a Guinea, and said she believed it was not good, and desired me to get it chang'd. But this was a King George's Guinea, and the Guinea that I gave him the Day before was King Charle's Guinea. But I did not know what to do in the Case. I went to change it at Mr. Cotton's, and he took me before Justice Ward, in whose Hands the Prisoner's Guinea was left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel thus deposed: I was telling the Prisoner, that the Guinea that he had given my Wife, was left in the Justice's Hand. The Justice has no Business with it, says he, Go and fetch it from him, and I'll give you eight Groats for it, for the Gold upon it is worth so much. The Guinea was produced in Court, and compared with the other that was cut. They appeared perfectly alike, and particularly the Figure [3] in the Date 1723, was remarkable by a small Blemish occasioned by a Fault in the Dye. One of Harpham's Dyes was again produced, with which they exactly agreed in that, and all other Parts. <rs id="t17250513-61-verdict297" type="verdictDescription">

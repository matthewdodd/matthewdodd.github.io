               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you see the seals? A. When I collared him in the passage the second time; about twenty persons might have gathered round; I had not called out, but I never lost sight of him - it was a market-day; I did not see him give them to anybody. I did not tell the Magistrate that I said,"Come drop them now."</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the Red Cow public-house, Long-lane; I found two knives upon him - the property has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and was so astonished at being charged with the crime, that I could not speak. On the day stated I was passing through Long-lane - forty or fifty people were stopping in this court, looking at a man with a pig; the prosecutor seized and accused me of the robbery - it was easy for him to be mistaken as to the hand that robbed him, among so many people huddled together in a court. I neither robbed him, nor did I see the thief.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WITTON re-examined. I had a child in my arms all the time - I only ran six or seven yards - I cannot be mistaken.</p>

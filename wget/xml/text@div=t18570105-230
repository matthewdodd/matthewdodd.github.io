               <p>On Sunday night, 21st Dec., I was in the New-road, near Marylebonne church—I saw the prisoner driving a Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at about ten miles an hour—it wanted about a quarter to 11 o'clock—the horse was galloping—I saw another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming towards it—the driver of the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> hallooed to the prisoner to get out of the way—the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man was in the middle of the road—I believe he endeavoured to avoid the Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he could not draw on his right side, but he went toward Marylebonne church to make way—he could not come this side, because he had passed another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the left hand wheel of the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over the left wheel of the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it tilted the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on one side, and threw the prisoner into the road, and the horse of the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> galloped on without the driver—it ran against an omnibus, which was on the proper side of the road—it was just against the kerb—I did not notice any person inside the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> just then—I saw the horse kicking furiously, and the conductor of the omnibus held the horse—I got inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and there was a young woman lying down on the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I took her out and laid her on the pavement—she groaned twice when I lifted her up in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when we laid her on the pavement her eyes closed, her bottom jaw dropped, and she died—I helped to take her to the workhouse—there was blood on my right shirt sleeve which came from her when I had hold of her in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 44, Pall-mall. On Sunday night, 21st Dec., I was in company with my sister Sarah, at King's-cross, about half past 10 o'clock; we got into a Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I believe the prisoner was the driver; I do not know—I observed that the driver drove from one side of the road to the other; he did not guide the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at all—he kept falling on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> kept rolling to and fro—that was when he first began to drive—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> did not stop exactly; I do not think it did; I was very frightened—the prisoner asked us which way we were going, and said he had lately returned from the Crimea—I never answered him at all, but my sister asked a man by the side of the road which was the way to the railway arch—she corrected herself, and said, "To the Marble Arch"—the man told the driver he was going quite right—the driver whipped the horse very</p>

               <p>much—it stood on it's hind legs, and darted off—he went very fast, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rocked to and fro—I have no distinct recollection of anything more that took place—T was not hurt when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a gentleman who called the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for you when you got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a little beyond King's-cross—I cannot tell how far we had gone when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped or went slowly, and the question was asked of the man—I had observed some turning before that, and I wished my sister to get out, but she would not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Marylebone Infirmary. On Sunday night, 21st Dec., about 11 o'clock, Sarah Tydeman was brought in—she was dead, but warm—she was accompanied by the last witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you examine her sufficiently to form an opinion that the death had taken place in consequence of the collision that had occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a fracture of the sternum, and the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and laceration of the liver—the injury was such as might have been inflicted by the collision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been driving a long time, and never had an accident before, and never had a summons; I was obliged to pull to the off side to pass, and that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man did the same thing, which threw me off; I will swear I was sober, with the exception of having two glasses of ale, from 6 till half past 10 o'clock; it was a very fidgety horse; as to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rolling, all Hansom cabs will roll, they are not fit for a lady to ride in; if it had been a gentleman, he would have caught the reins and stopped the horse in a moment; I have but just come from the Crimea; I had the fever there, and have been very excitable ever since.</p>

I am the wife of Benjamin Vincent, of Smith's-rents, East-lane, Greenwich—I have lived there going on for four years—I knew Bridget Holloway, the deceased—she lived in the next room to me—mine is the front, hers was the back—a partition of wood separates our rooms—you can hear what passes from one room to the other—you can hear persons talk—the prisoner was in the habit of going to the room in which the deceased lived—I thought, at first, they were man and wife—he is a pensioner in the Hospital—on Sunday, the 10th of July, about nine o'clock at night, I was in my own room, and heard the cry of "Murder" coming from the deceased's room several times—I did not hear any other person but her—she continued to cry "Murder" several times, until the cries grew fainter—I went down and told Mrs. Smith, who was at the door—I then went back to my room, and heard no more noise, or cries that night—next day I went into Bridget Holloway's room, about half-past twelve—I brought her up some hot water—I found her sitting on her bed undressed, in her petticoat and shift—she told me she was very bad—she could hardly speak—she was obliged to stop two or three times between the words—she showed me her left side—it was all bruised black and discoloured—she said she should never get over it, for she was sure her ribs were broken—she appeared to be labouring under the impression that she should die—she said the prisoner had done it by constantly knocking her on the side—I saw her again on Tuesday evening, and then no more till after her death—she died on Thursday—about twelve o'clock on Tuesday night I was in my own room, and heard her groans—I never heard her any</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Smith, a shoemaker, and live in Smith's-rents, in the room under Bridget Holloway. On Sunday evening, the 10th of July, about eight o'clock, I was going down stairs, and met her on the stairs—she appeared to be as well as usual—the spoke to me—I do not know what age she was—she appeared about seventy—Mrs. Vincent came and told me something; that evening, in consequence of which, I went up into my own room, and heard the deceased crying bitterly, in her own room—I did not see her any more that night—about half-past eight in the morning, I heard her knocking in her room—I went out to see what it was, and then went up into her room—she was just sat down on the bed—she was alone—when she spoke she put her hand to her left side, and it was several seconds before she could speak—she showed me her bruises—I observed bruises on her side—she said she was sure her ribs were broken, and he had given her her death-blow—she had a bruise on each arm, a bruise on her breast, and a slight one on the leg, besides those on the side—I went up about one o'clock, and took her a little broth, thinking it might do her good—she seemed in more agonizing pain than before—she was in the habit of going into the streets with a basket, for the last eight months—she went out that afternoon, between three and four o'clock—I carried her basket down stairs for her—she seemed very bad, and still complained of being very ill, that he had given her her death<lb></lb>blow, and she should never get over it—she returned between six and seven—I saw her next day, Tuesday, between three and four in the after<lb></lb>noon—she appeared to be getting worse—I did not see her on Wednesday—I heard her in her room about half-past twelve at night, groaning very much indeed—on Thursday morning, about half-past seven, the prisoner opened my door, came in, and said, "She is gone; she is gone"—another person said directly, "Is she gone to the Union?"—he said, "No; she is dead, she is dead"—in consequence of that, I went up stairs into the room, and found her dead, but not quite cold—there was a bruise to be seen then on her side as she was lying—the prisoner said, "What do you think will be done in this case?"—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Greenwich. I knew the deceased before this occurred—I was called to see her after her death—the prisoner applied to me to give a certificate of the cause of death—I had attended the woman twelve months prior, for a rheumatic affection—at the time the prisoner called on me he stated that she had been in a very infirm state of health a long time—I left the room, to consult a medical report book—on my return, I found Mrs. Vincent there, and in consequence of hearing the word "ill-treatment" made use of, I refused the certificate—I afterwards, by the order of the Coroner, examined the body externally—it presented appearances of bruises, extending from the left shoulder, over the left side, nearly to the pelvis, and also marks of bruises on the right and left arm—four ribs were fractured, two of which were found penetrating a portion of the left lung, which, in my judgment, was the immediate cause of death—the most prominent symptom was the difficulty of breathing—a blow or a kick would most probably produce such an injury—it must have been very violent—I should say she had been suffering from the injury three or four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She had been under him once before with a very bad cough, and was ailing; she took liquor, and has fallen down stairs; it is not the first time I have taken her up stairs, bruised, and complaining of her side. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never attended her before with any complaint of that description—she was subject to rheumatic affection in the winter—the body was in other respects perfectly healthy—the fracture of the ribs was the cause of death, by producing inflammation of the lungs—I doubt whether, if it had been seen to in the first instance, that life could have been saved, from the position in which the ribs were, and the lung being lacerated—it might have given her a chance.</p>

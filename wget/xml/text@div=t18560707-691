                  </hi>. I live in Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green, and am a lamp lighter. On Friday morning, 6th June, I finished putting out my lights a few minutes before 4 o'clock, and I was in Old Bethnal-green-road, opposite Essex-street, as nigh as possible, at 20 minutes to 5 o'clock—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come up Essex-street—it drew up opposite the Barley Mow beer shop—I saw the prisoner, Fowler, get out of that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he went to the back door of the Falcon public house, and knocked with his knuckles; I stood and watched him—the prisoner Jackson was on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the caiman, Lister—while I was standing watching, the policeman, 242 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>, came up; I spoke to him—while I was speaking to him Fowler ran from the back door of the Falcon to the corner of Elizabeth-street, up Elizabeth-street, into the Hackney-road, and got away—the constable went to look after Fowler, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove away—I left the constable while I went to lock up my ladder in Union-square—I afterwards saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in New Bethnal-green-road—I went, called a constable, and ran with him—he stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

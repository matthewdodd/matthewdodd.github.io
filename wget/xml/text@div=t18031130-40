               <p>Q. Have your servants never accounted in the evening for more than was booked in the morning? - A. No; the drayman gives me an account of what he has upon the dray, and then I stand by the side of the dray and reckon it, and then they are answerable for that load; I look over it, and if there is any thing wrong I tell them so; I was more particular that day than ever I was in my life.</p>

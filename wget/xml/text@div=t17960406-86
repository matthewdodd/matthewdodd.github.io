               <p>I am a porter; I ply sometimes in Fleet-street, and sometimes in Covent-Garden: the prisoner at the bar came to me, and asked me to take a note for him, I be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060075"></xptr>lieve sometime in February, but I am not certain; he gave it me at the end of Fleet-makert; I had seen the prisoner before, I am certain he is the man that gave me the note; I took the note to Mr. Harris's, in Fish-street; it was to fetch a quarter of a hundred of soap; I gave the note to Mr. Harris, the elder; young Mr. Harris was not present; he told one of his porters to weigh me a quarter of a hundred of soap; he weighed it me, and put it in three brown pieces of paper; I put it on my knot, and brought it as far as the Blue-Last, Blackstiars, there I met the man that gave me the note; he told me to go a little farther with him; I went to the end of Water-lane, Fleet-street, and there he took the soap from me, and I charged him sixpence porterage; I saw no more of him from that time till he was taken up; I am sure it is the same note that I delivered to Mr. Harris, that I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Harris, jun, called again. I am in partnership with my father Richard Harris: On the 15th of February, when I received the note, I desired the man to weigh the soap, and give it to the porter; I asked him if it was from Mrs. Stanton; she had been a customer of our's several years; (produces the note, it is read).</p>
               <p>"Sir, Please to let the bearer have 28lb. of mottled soap, tied up in paper; please to send a bill; when I want more, I will call.

No; I have known the prisoner seven years, he served his time with the tallow-chandler that serves me, Mr. Wood, in the Butcher-row, with candles; he has been out of his time about three or four months; he has left his master about four months; I never saw him after, till I saw him at Guildhall; he used to come to my house most days to bring goods, and take orders.</p>

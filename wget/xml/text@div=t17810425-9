               <p>Mr. GRIFFENHOOFE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed on the 8th of March, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, in the road going from Hanworth to <placeName id="t17810425-9-crimeloc42">Hounslow</placeName>

Upon the heath I saw two men; one with a blue coat, a round hat, his own brown hair, or wig, mounted upon a dark brown horse, or mare, with a switch tail; the other was a lustier man, with a brown great coat, round hat likewise, and a brown wig, or hair, mounted upon a lighter brown horse, with a bald face remarkably white from his ears down to his nose: when I came within a few yards of them, they parted on each side; I was in a one-horse chaise; they bid me stop, and demanded my money; I think they both spoke together at the same time; the man in the blue coat told me they did not intend to use me ill, but they must have my money; I gave the man in the brown coat two guineas; he said, I had plenty of money, and he desired the man in the blue coat to search me; I then gave him the rest of the money I had, making in the whole five guineas and an half, and some silver; I told them that was all the money I had; then the man in the brown coat said I had a pocketbook; I told him I had none; he said I had, and he desired the man in the blue coat to search my pockets; the man in the blue coat stroked down on each side of my waistcoat; he then took out this box, a salvatory, from my pocket; I said it wou'd be of no use to him; he then said, your watch; I gave him my watch, which was a silver one; then the young man in the blue coat said, be was sorry they were under a necessity of taking my money, wished me a good morning, and said I might drive on; then I went away.</p>
               <p>Then by your account the man in the blue coat behaved with great civility? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe either of them, so as to be able to know their person or face again? - Yes; one I was positive of, the man in the blue coat; the other, when I saw him again, he had left his brown coat behind him, and his hair was powdered, which it was not when he robbed me; therefore I could not positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Then it was rather from your observation of the dress than the face that you knew the other? - I was certain to the other from his face; I had a better opportunity of observing his features, because he searched my pocket, and took out my salvatory.</p>

               <p>How long after the robbery was it before you saw these men again? - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250013"></xptr> the men till the next day at Bow-street?</p>
               <p>Which is the man that had the blue coat? - King.</p>
               <p>When you saw them again at Bow-street, had you any doubt that King was one of the men? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt now? - I am sorry to say that I have not.</p>
               <p>Are you equally certain as to the other? - The other had a great coat on when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>You are not equally certain to him? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe him to be the other man? - I do, from his hat and from his voice.</p>
               <p>Were you present at the examination of the prisoners at the office? - They were brought there for me to see them.</p>
               <p>Did you hear them give any account of themselves there? - Not much; I don't recollect any thing particular: they did not confess any part of the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Whoever they were, they spoke to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did one or both of them desire you not to be alarmed? - Only the man in the blue coat, King, told me they did not mean to use me ill; but they must have my money:</p>
               <p>Afterwards he lamented that necessity obliged them to it? - After I had given them every thing I had, he very politely said he was sorry, but necessity obliged them to take my money; then he wished me a good morning, and bid me drive on.</p>

               <p>I went out in the morning on the 8th of March; coming home, I saw the prosecutor stopped between eleven and twelve o'clock; he was in a one-horse chaise, I was on foot: I suppose I was about 100 yards distance; he was coming into Hounslow, I was coming the same way; I was upon the greensward, opposite the chaise.</p>
               <p>Who stopped the chaise? - I saw two men, one upon each side the chaise; I saw one of them put his hand to Mr. Griffenhoose.</p>

Gardiner to take one man with me and go up to the Red-lion, the upper end of the town, and there I should receive descriptions of the men, from a gentleman that was robbed; in consequence of these descriptions, I went in pursuit of the men: this is the written description of the men I received from the prosecutor (producing it).</p>

We met with those two men between Isleworth and Twickenham; by the descriptions the gentleman gave, I thought they were the two highwaymen; I told the soldiers so; one of the soldiers rode up to the one of them, and said, You are my prisoner; he was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, and had a deep round hat on: I rode up to the other man to take hold of him, but he struck me, and rode away.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a brown coat, and had a round hat: I immediately rode after him; he turned up a lane; I went to go by him, he struck at me, the horse leaped round, so I saved the blow, and got before him; he turned, and rode away another road; I turned my horse, and rode after him; when I came up to him, a gentleman and he were fighting with their sticks.</p>
               <p>Did he ever get out of your sight? - No: I was close to him all the way: he got away again, and I followed him; just after that, I saw him throw the pistol away into a hedge in a lane between the Royal Oak at Isleworth and Twickenham; I told the gentleman of it; he got off his horse to pick it up, but could not find it; then he mounted his horse again, and rode after the prisoner, and the prisoner was taken between Isleworth pound and the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight, from the time he rode off first till he was taken? - No; he was in my sight all the time.</p>
               <p>Who assisted you in taking him? - A serjeant happened to be in the George yard at Isleworth; I called out, a highwayman! the serjeant mounted his horse, rode after him, and took him.</p>

               <p>Was he the same man you met first in company with King? - I am sure he is: the serjeant bid me mind that he did not do any thing; I perceived him putting some money into his boot, or his stocking; I saw his boot, or his stocking, taken off afterwards, and there were four guineas and a half found in it.</p>

               <p>I searched King, and found some half-pence upon him; and I searched Sheering; in his boot on his right leg I found two guineas, and in the right thigh of his breeches I found two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>KING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor, when we were brought up to the office in Bow-street, said that the two men that committed the robbery had the appearance to him of father and son returning from some fair; he supposed them to be graziers, father and son: the soldier that rode up to me desired to know if I had seen two persons pass that way; we were going over Richmond-bridge, which was the road the robbery was committed on; if I had been guilty of the crime, self-preservation would have taught me to have taken a different path from that where the robbery was committed; they asked me if I had seen two men pass, for a robbery had been committed; I said I had seen only one pass, and that lately; the boy came up, and said, This gentleman is dressed in blue, and the description of the person that committed the robbery was, that he was in blue; the soldiers came up to me; I said he need not collar me, I would go any where with him; they found a pistol upon me, which I was going to get repaired; they searched me, and found nothing else upon me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was the idea that struck me before they stopped me, that they were two graziers.</p>

               <p>When the serjeant took me, I asked him what he wanted with me, whether he had a capias against me; he said, no: I said, I know there is one out against me; I suspect you are after me for that; he said, No, I am afraid it is something else, Dickey.</p>

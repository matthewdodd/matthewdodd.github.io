               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the man at that time to say whether or no it was the prisoner - A. I was hurried at the time; I am apt to be harried; he surrendered the shawl to me; I could have done what I liked to him. He came in to look at the house, it is to let, it is not finished, I had left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had given you the shawl what became of him, how came he to be stopped - A. It was my hastiness. When my husband came in I said I had been robbed. My husband ran after him, and the man surrendered himself to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you were a good deal flurried - A. A good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed so much, I should not think that you should be able to speak to the person of that man from another - A. I was so much hurried I cannot pretend what to say in it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never stood in such a situation before. I must leave it to the counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

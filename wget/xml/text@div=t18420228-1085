                  </hi>. I reside at Norway-wharf, Greenwich. I saw this chain weight, crow-bar, and iron bolts, safe on my wharf between five and six o'clock in the evening, on the 18th of February—I did not miss then till the policeman came, about a quarter before eleven the same evening—these now produced arc the articles.</p>

On the 26th of October, in consequence of suspicion, I sent him to Bayswater, out of the way, and in his absence had his box opened by a smith; it stood in the back kitchen, down-stairs; I saw it opened, and the articles stated in the indictment found in it - they have no marks on them, but we have the pieces which the cloth was cut from, and I have compared them. I had an officer ready when he came home about three o'clock, and I gave him in charge: I told him he had been robbing me; the officer asked him for his key, and we went to search the box again, in his presence; the things were there still - he said he had done wrong, and they were my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many other servants have you? A. Several; the prisoner had no right in the warehouse - all the servants had access to the place where his box was; the goods correspond with the pieces in colour and pattern, but not in the cut, that I know of.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Messrs. Wyllie. On the 23d of October, in consequence of something I observed, I watched at night - I was in the back yard, and heard the prisoner come from the warehouse, and go down stairs; I then saw him through the back kitchen window; he had a bundle under his arm, and a light in his hand; I saw him put the bundle into his box, and shut it; I went to bed, and he went up-stairs - next day, about four o'clock, I went to a drawer which he used in the back kitchen, and saw a piece of blue cloth tied in a silk handkerchief - I went up-stairs, intending to tell Mr. Wyllie, but he was not in the way; in about ten minutes I went there again, the cloth was gone from the drawer, and he was gone out; I had not seen him in the meantime.</p>

No, I saw a light in the warehouse, and heard somebody coming down from there - I saw him directly he got down the stairs, in the back kitchen - the drawer was not locked, but it was generally used by him; I did not see him at the drawer when the cloth was there.</p>

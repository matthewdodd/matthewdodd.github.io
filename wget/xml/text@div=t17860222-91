I said I did not know; I went along with them to see, and I missed my grate; I swore to it when it was found on the Monday morning; I am sure the prisoner is one of the two men I saw.</p>

               <p>About nine, to the best of my knowledge, I saw the prisoner with the range on his back, in the road between Tottenham-court-road and Mother Red-cap's; he was coming to town; I stopped him, he said he came from Mr. Lomax's at Hampstead, and was going to carry it to Snow-hill, to have it mended, and I called Croker to assist me, and left the grate at the toll-house in his charge.</p>

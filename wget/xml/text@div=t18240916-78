I had a 10 l. note and seven sovereigns in a canvass bag - I was on the bed with her when I felt her hand in my pocket; I charged her with it, when she jumped up, and ran out of the room. I went after her, but was intercepted on the stairs by some women. I described the court to the officer, as having only three houses in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not charge some other persons with taking your money - A. No, not with having the money, but three women stopped me from pursuing her. I have been out of business since the 31st of May. I never saw her before - I was about six minutes in her company. This was on a Thursday, and I saw her in custody on Saturday morning. I felt the money in my pocket when I entered the room; I had some silver beside. I said I had no desire to prosecute, but the Magistrate said I was liable to an action for compounding felony if I did not. I have no doubt of her being the person.</p>

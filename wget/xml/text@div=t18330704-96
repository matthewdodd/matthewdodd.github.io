On Sunday morning, the 19th of May, I heard a person speak as I laid in bed, between four and five o'clock- I got out of bed and looked who it was, and the person on the left-hand side of the road was the prisoner Smith, the person on the other side I did not know, but he had a horses collar on his neck, and Smith had some horses gear on his shoulder - the person I saw on the other side of the road was dressed as Webb was when I saw him before the Magistrate - I stopped out of bed, and who should come by in less than ten minutes, but a lad with a wheelbarrow, and upon it I noticed a cart saddle with a double row of brassnails - the lad had a dark jacket on, a black cap, a gaiter on one leg, and a light stocking on the other- about seven o'clock the same morning, as I passed the

            . I am constable of Enfield. I went with the other officer to take the prisoner; I have known Young from his infancy - I have seen him in a kind of blue waistcoat, and a dark cap, and he had one on when we took him - Smith and Webb said, that they had worked for Mr. Laycock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe Mr. Laycock has a great many persons work for him? A. Yes, he has.</p>

            . I am one of the constables of Barnet. I went to Enfield with Webb's father; I saw Austin and Webb in the room - Webb's father shook hands with him, and they both fell crying - the son said, "Do not say anything to those two men in the cage, but the harness is in Laycock's field, hid in the dung in the upper end of the field, if you will go with me, I will show you" - I handcuffed myself to him, and went, but Mead and Austin had been and got it - as we were going along, Smith said, he could transport both Webb and his brother- he asked me if Webb had told me what I had spoken of before the magistrate, about the two men in the cage; I said, "Yes" - then, said he, "I could transport both Webb and his brother;" a man said to Smith, "I will give you a leg up when you go to have your trial; I will swear you were along with me all night."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. Patrol to the Barnet Association - I don't know what was Webb's reason for saying, "Say nothing to those two men in the cage" - Smith said, when Webb had brought him into danger, that he could transport him and his brother; it was in the open street, and in presence of all of us that the man came and said he would give him a leg up on his trial - I should know the man if I saw him again.</p>

            . I am one of the constables of Barnet. I had Webb in my custody; I told him if I had come round one corner of the field, I should have found him and his two mates - he said, "If you had, you should not have been alive now" - I said, "I don't care, I have got that in my pocket which would take two of you down, and you, I should not have cared for."</p>

            . I am steward to Mr. Parris, at the farm spoken of. One of our men, who is Webb's brother, found some of the old harness in another field; the prisoner Webb knew my master's dog on the farm well - I cannot say whether the dog was fond of him, but he is a very good dog; he would not let me go into the yard - I know this barrow, it is Mr. Parris's, and made by his carpenter - this harness is his, it is worth between 11l. and 12l.</p>
               <p>Young's Defence. It is very strange that Ellis, who has known me all my life, should not know me, and Freeman, whom I never spoke to, should know me.</p>
               <p>Webb's Defence. I went to Mr. Brewer's, and stopped there till eleven o'clock at night; I got very tipsy, and laid down against the brewer's shed - I then got up, went round the road, and met four men by the side of Mr. Laycock's field, but neither of them were Smith or Young, they had long smock frocks on.</p>

            . I am daughter of the prisoner Smith, I live in the same house with him at Enfield. I remember the night this robbery is said to have been committed, my father came home that night at half-past eleven o'clock, and did not go out till seven o'clock the next morning - in the whole course of that night, he was not out of the house; we all sleep in one room - it is impossible that he could have got up and dressed himself and gone out without my knowing it; I and my two sisters slept in the room - he got up and went away about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you a mother alive? A. Yes; she slept there too - I know Webb by sight, he is not in the habit of coming often to our house - I don't know that I ever saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be careful, for your own sake - upon your oath, have you not often seen him at your father's house? A. No, Sir, I have not to my knowledge; I remember my father being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Webb there then? A. Yes, I had forgotten that - I came in just as the constable came in, and he was there then, but I will swear he was not there when I went out; I had been out about an hour - I had never seen him at my father's to my knowledge before - I remember my father being taken before the magistrate; I went there, I did not offer to give evidence - I did not say to any one, but to my sister, that I was able to prove that my father was at home all night; one of my sisters is twenty-one years old, and the other is eleven- I know a person named Hockett; he came to our house that Saturday-night, and went away at two o'clock the next morning, and my father went to bed at two o'clock - we were not sitting up so late for any thing particular; we had supper about a quarter to twelve o'clock - we had bread and cheese and porter; Hockett came about half-past ten o'clock - my father, mother, Hockett, and I, and my two younger sisters supped - I have three sisters in all - I am turned eighteen; one of my younger sisters is eleven, and the other eight - we sat talking over our supper, I had not been at home a week; Hockett was standing at the door, when my father went up stairs to bed - I then locked the door, and locked Hockett out; I then went up stairs into the room, but did not go to bed directly; it was half-past two o'clock before I went to bed - it was the first evening I had seen Hockett after I came home - he is rather paying his addresses to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040081"></xptr>I mostly make it a practice to look out at the window before I go to bed, and I did so that night, but I did not open the window - I did not observe it to rain; my father gets his living by work - he works for Mr. Laycock, to my best belief - Hockett went with us before the magistrate; I was with him when the prisoners were being brought from the magistrate's - I remember his saying to my father, "Never mind, old boy, I will give you a leg up upon your trial" - I did not hear him say,"I will swear you were with me all night."</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did not he say, I was with you all night? A. I did not hear that - I will not swear that he did not say it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do not people in the situation of life in which your father is, sit up later on Saturday nights than on other nights? A. Yes, rather so; I had been before that in service at Clapton for seven months - I saw Hockett out of the door that night; I then locked the door, took the key up stairs with me, and put it on the shelf; I found it in the morning in the very same place - I am the person who unlocked the door with it at six o'clock; I found the door exactly the same as I had left it - no questions were asked of any person in defence of the prisoner before the magistrate; I was not there all the time the examination was going on - I heard Mr. Freeman examined - I did not hear any witness for the prisoner called - my sister who is older than me is here; her name is

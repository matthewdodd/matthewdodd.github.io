               <p>On the 19th of June, at a little before ten at night, as I was coming from North-end, going over <placeName id="t17810711-44-crimeloc230">Golder's-green</placeName>

He struck me a violent blow with a hedge stake. He then fell upon my body. I had my hand in my pocket, upon my purse, and the prisoner had his hand upon mine; he said D - n you, pull your hand out; and he forcibly pulled my hand out of my pocket, and took my purse. I begged him not to do it. Then he struck me another violent blow as I was lying upon the ground, and threw the stake across my body, saying, There is a stick for you to walk home with. This was much about ten o'clock, for it wanted about a quarter of ten when I passed through North-end; I was going at an easy pace, and it might take me about a quarter of an hour to go to the place where the robbery was committed, which was about the middle of Golder's-green. I knew the prisoner at the time of the robbery; I knew him by his clothes; his waistcoat, his strait black hair, and his flapped hat: I have known him three or four years, and have worked with him; but I did not know his name: he went by a nick name in the country, by which he was known by the people who worked with him, the name of Gabey. I had a surgeon with me the next morning, and was very ill till the Friday: he has knocked my eye out. I described the man to Mr. Goodwin. On the Wednesday or the Thursday, Hale asked me if I knew the man who had robbed me. I said I did. Hale mentioned the names of several persons. At last he said, Was it Gabey? Have you any suspicion of him? Upon that I burst out a crying, and said that was the man. I had been not quite right in my senses; they were at times disordered by the violence of the injury I received, but I was sensible when I told this to

            . When I begged the prisoner not to take my purse, I cannot recollect that I spoke to him by the name in which I knew him, or not; or whether or not I expressed any knowledge of him at the time. The prisoner came to my house on Saturday night before he was taken up; he had some discourse with my wife.</p>

               <p>Is your wife here? - No, she is not. He came in, after having had some discourse with my wife, and then asked me if I had said he had robbed me. I answered, Gabey. I don't know rightly if you robbed me, but you have got a very bad character; you are certainly the man who robbed me; I am certified of it. He then denied all knowledge of it, and said he never hurt any man; and he fell into discourse for a quarter of an hour more, and shewed a disposition to have staid longer; but I said, Pray don't disturb me, for my head is bad. The reason I spoke first to him with that appearance of doubt was because I was afraid, as they had let the other go, that he would run away.</p>

               <p>What other man? - I saw another man about twenty yards off when the prisoner stopped me; but I cannot say whether the other man did any thing, or lent the prisoner any assistance, or not. I thought and believed that Dighton was one of them, but not the man that robbed me: he was taken up for examination; but nothing appearing against him, he was discharged. I knew where Gabey worked, and knew he lodged at Mrs. Gunnis's; I knew that at the time of the robbery, and all along. The prisoner told me on Saturday, that he and Dighton had been at work for Mr. Davis, but they had done that work. I knew where he had lodged before. He was taken in bed in his own lodging on the Tuesday morning following. I did not send to the officers till Monday to let them know who it was. Justice Wright and Mr. Bond were with me on Saturday, at about four o'clock. I described the person, but did not tell his name, I believe; but, to the best of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110134"></xptr> knowledge, I told them where he lodged. I never said Dighton was the man who robbed me, but that I believed he was the man who was near. The prisoner's bad character was not the cause of my suspecting him; I should have been equally certain to the prisoner if he had had ever so good a character.</p>

               <p>(The hedge-stake was produced in court; it was a very thick stake, about six feet long.)</p>

               <p>Mr. GOODWIN sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I was called between three and four o'clock on the Wednesday morning, to attend the prosecutor. I found him in a terrible condition; one of his eyes was beat out, and he had several bruises on his face, which bled a great deal, and he vomited blood, so that I thought him in a dangerous state. When I dressed his wounds, I asked him if he thought he should know the man that had done it: he told me he believed he could; he was sensible at that time. The next day, he was not sensible: he described one man to be in a drab loose coat, and flapped hat, and his own black hair, that robbed him; that the other man stood at a distance, and had on brown cloaths: he said he knew the men well, but seemed careful not to mention their names. On the Thursday or Friday he said the name of the man that robbed him was Gabey; he said, on the Wednesday, he believed he knew them; afterwards he was more cert ain, and said, he was positive Gabey was-one.</p>

On the Tuesday following, I took the prisoner in bed: when I took him, he said, he did not value being hanged, as he was innocent of the crime: he never seemed the least daunted.</p>

               <p>Jury to Gunnis. The prisoner lodged six weeks at your mother's: was he ever absent any other night? - Yes, one night before that.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor's informations before the justice were read; from which it appeared that he did not swear any thing against the prisoner, till the Friday, when his second information was taken, and then, only that he believed him to be the person.</p>

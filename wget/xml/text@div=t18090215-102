               <p>Q. What is this girl - A. She is the daughter of my washerwoman - previous to the 18th of January, for about two months, we had missed at divers times eight silver table spoons. This girl came backward and forward; the servants suspected her. I know no further than she said.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. About the middle of December we lost three spoons, and so on till the beginning of January. I was determined to find out who was the thief; there were no strangers came backwards and forwards to the house. I put two spoons out, one on the table and the other on the dresser; I cannot exactly tell the day of the month; it was in January. I went up stairs, and when I came down in the kitchen I missed the spoon off the table; the prisoner left in the kitchen. I went up stairs and acquainted my mistress of it. My fellow servant came down and asked if we knew any thing of that spoon; the girl was then in the other kitchen. My fellow servant asked me to turn my pockets out, and then asked the prisoner; she turned one pocket out, it contained nothing but a pair of gloves; she said she had no other pocket; my fellow servant put her hand to her side, felt she had a pocket, and desired her to turn out what she had; she had no spoon in her pocket, she had put the spoon up between her frock and her stays; my fellow servant took it from her person. We then acquainted our master with it. The prisoner then said she took it up by mistake, and asked did we mean to say that she had stole it; we asked her what she did with the others; she with a great deal of persuasion acknowledged that she had pawned them.</p>

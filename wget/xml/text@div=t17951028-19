               <p>I am a weekly servant to Mr. Wigzell; my fellow servant loaded the cart with the wine, to drive to Sloan-street, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cart loaded? - Yes, and helped to load it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it loaded with? - Port and Lisbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it loaded? - Opposite No. 32, <placeName id="t17951028-19-crimeloc109">George-street, Minories</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you attend the cart? - I did not, my fellow servant did all the way, as I understand.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this cart loaded? - About eleven o'clock in the day; I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the day of the week? - I do not; when we came to unload the wine at the Star and Garter, Sloan-square, in the third pickle there were two bottles of Lisbon wine wanting, my partner said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the man that he said so? - Yes, he was there, he helped to unpack some of the wine, I told my partner that I could swear there were twenty six when we left home, he said there were but twenty four then, and I said, perhaps the horse has swallowed some of them; I went up immediately and searched the bag that was under the axletree of the cart, and found a bottle of Lisbon sealed there, with my master's seal; I went immediately to the basket out of which the horses fed, and I found there a bottle of Lisbon wine, sealed with my master's seal, and my fellow servant took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else attend this cart besides the carman, except you and your fellow servant? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you pack them up yourself in the pickle? - No, my fellow servant did, but I counted them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found two bottles near this cart, you did not ascertain what they were, you did not draw their corks? - I did not, but they were sealed with my master's seal "Wigzell, Lisbon."</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever the two bottles were, you put them all with the rest in the cellar? - My fellow servant took them, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them afterwards you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was the carman only, pray how long was it afterwards that these bottles were produced? - I cannot tell the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the man was taken up? - The day following, in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see what wine it was? - I did not see myself; I see the carman go to the basket some time before the wine was taken out, but I did not see him put any thing there but hay.</p>

The carman was along side of us, giving them into my hands as I put them down.</p>

               <p>I was in the cellar when Mr. Wigzell's man unpacked the wine, and he set twenty-four on the shelf, and I said, there ought to be twenty-six, and he said, very likely the other two were in the pickle, under the rail, and it was examined, and they were not, and he told his fellow servant, and he went up and brought them down; I have kept them separate ever since, one of them, and one Mr. Wigzell has had ever since Friday. They were all set on a shelf in the wine cellar, and these two were set at the other end, not among the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to say that he did not put the two bottles with all the rest of the cargoe? - Close by them, but not to mix them so but they might be taken from the rest; he could not put it with the parcel of the others, because I had filled the shelf up with other wine.(The wine produced.)</p>

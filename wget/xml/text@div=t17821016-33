               <p>I took the prisoner just by Union-Court, last Friday, I did not say two words to him, we took him to the round-house; the child immediately said that is the butchering-man; in about an hour's time, the other child was brought in, and he looked round, and said, that is the butchering-man.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Last Friday as I was coming up Holborn-hill, I met this gentleman and another man, one said to the other, that is him; I said what do you want with me; they said have you a mind to do any good for yourself? I said what do you mean? he said if you know of any foot pad robbery, or any thing that will fetch us any thing, we will let you go; they felt my pockets, I said do you want money, they said no; and they told me the same story when they took me up to the watch-house; then they said I have two bills I can bring against you: and the man said when the children came, says he, mind this is him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought five witnesses who all gave him a good character.</p>

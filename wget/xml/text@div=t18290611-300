I put my fowl in possession of Mr. Williams two months ago - it was a game cock; I heard it was stolen on the night of the 23d of May, and saw it at Queen-square; I know it by its feathers, and there are two or three feathers cut off at the front of the wing.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. I had the fowl to take care of six weeks or two months before it was stolen - it was safe on Saturday, the 23d of May, and I missed it the next morning; the prisoner is a <rs id="t18290611-300-viclabel1587" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

               <p>GEORGE UPWARD. I am an officer. I took this fowl from the prisoner on the 24th of May, between four and five o'clock in the morning; he said it was his own - I was not satisfied, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Chelsea on the Saturday before, and saw a man with this fowl; I gave him 4s. for it - I was going to my employer's, Mr. Chorley, of Putney, when I was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Angel-gardens, Shadwell. On the morning of 14th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I had been to get something for my supper, and as I was coming home I saw the prisoner kicking at the door of a house, and his companion was <hi rend="italic">singing out</hi> to an old woman up at the window, calling her very bad names—she said if he kicked at her door again she would cleave him down with a poker—he kept kicking at the door, and the old woman's daughter came and struck his companion in the face—a young man came and kept the prisoner from hitting her, and he turned round from the door, grating his teeth, and went to cross over towards his companion—he took his knife from behind him—I screamed out twice, "Murder! he has got a knife!"—I said nothing to him—he ran after me round the corner, caught me by the throat with his left hand, gave me</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in High-street, Shadwell On 14th Jan. I was called to the police station to see the prosecutrix I found two incised wounds, one on the abdomen, and the other on the forehead, the former about two inches in length and three-fourths of an inch in depth, the latter about half an inch in length, and the same in depth—they were such wounds as might have been produced by such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the wound in the abdomen was a dangerous wound; the cavity was almost penetrated; if it had been, inflammation would have set in, and loss of life would have been the consequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Angel-gardens, Shadwell On the night of 14th Jan. I was coming down the street, and saw the prisoner kicking at the door of the corner house—an old lady put her head out of the window, and desired him to cease; his companion was then fighting with another man—the prisoner drew his knife—the prosecutrix called my atten<lb></lb>tion to it, and ran round the corner—I saw the prisoner go after her, and strike her, and knock her down, and fall atop of her—I did not see him stab her—I heard her say, "He has stabbed me"—I went and called the police, and when I returned I found her bleeding, and several persons round her, lifting her from the ground.</p>

I was called to the prosecutrix—there was a crowd round her; she said she was stabbed, and pointed out the prisoner as the person that had done it—he was taken by another con<lb></lb>stable—he said he had not stabbed her—about two yards from where he was standing, I picked up this knife; it had blood on it then, and has now—at the station he said he had no knife round his waist—there was a sheath, and no knife in it—he said his knife was at his lodging; I went there, and in a box that was pointed out to me I found a knife and sheath—the prisoner's face was covered with blood at the time, and his companion's also.</p>

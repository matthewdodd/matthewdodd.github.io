                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Randall, and live at Twickenham. On the 15th of March, a shirt and several articles were taken out of my garden in a wet state—the shirt was wet, just as I had wrong it out of the water—I went to a pawnbroker's at Isleworth, and found it there with the mark taken out, but I was satisfied it was the same, as I had made it myself—I received the dupliceates from Ann Taylor, to go to Isleworth to take it out—I met a man named William Ballard, when I went out on missing my property, and he asked me if I had lost any thing—he was about a quarter of a mile from my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Twickenham-common. The prisoner came to me on Thursday, the 17th of March, and said she had been deal<lb></lb>ing with another person, and they would not let her have any more things on account of her not having quite enough money to pay the last week's bill, and she was so distressed that she was obliged to pawn her husband's shirt—if I would let her have some money on the duplicate, she would leave it till Saturday night, and then would come and pay me, as her husband had no other shirt to were on the Sunday—she left me the duplicate of the shirt, and I let her have some bread out butter on it—she called the man she lives with her husband—his name is Messenger—next day the called with another woman, and said, "Don't let any body see that duplicate; if you do, my husband will make a great piece of work about my pawning his shirt"—I said, "No, I will not"—next morning the woman</p>

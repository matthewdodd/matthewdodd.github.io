On the 17th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was going home; I had long suspected him, and I had called on Mr. Davis the constable to be in readiness; when I went in he said as usual good night; I replied good night, Benjamin; he advanced two or three paces, I called him back, I told him I had reason to believe, and I could prove it by my own servant, that he had long been a rascal to me. I asked him if he had any property in the bank, if he had any property out at interest, and if he had any property at home, to all which questions he positively denied having any; Mr. Davis came in, and I desired the prisoner to turn out his pockets; he turned them out, and there were a great many more halfpence than it was necessary for him to have in his pocket; I asked him whose property the halfpence were, he said mine, meaning his own; Mr. Davis then put his hand down his side, he rather resented; he had concealed in his breeches a cake of soap, it was divided in two; halves were on each side; I asked him whose property that was; for the soap, when joined, was the same as a banker's check; he said his apron was dirty, he took a little bit to wash it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was the weight of the soap - A. They are generally on an average about three pound; I identified some of the halfpence; there was a sixpence in his shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence was found upon him - A. I did not count them; there were two or three that I knew. I then desired him to give me his keys, he did, and every one of these keys have separate locks at his habitation, and all his drawers were lined with clothes, rings, broaches and silk stockings, and a variety of other things; he had six gallons of gin in his cellar, four gallons of rum, preserved damsens, and exclusive of that, in one of his iniquitous nests I found forty guineas, beside half crown pieces, and all from poverty and woe; when I took him he had scarce a shirt or a shoe; and it is an iniquitous thing that a retail tradesman should be plundered by such a rascal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long had this man been with you - A. Near twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. These rings, and all these quantity of things, were your's - A. If you took a man from an indigent state, and had placed him behind your counter, you would have thought so. He was a labourer in the India house; I only had him late of an evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he had a legacy left him of a considerable sum of money - A. I do not believe it. He told me he found some money in the tea pot, but that was a deception. He is a rascal; it is a duty that I owe to society to bring him before this court; as to the rigour of the law, I do not wish to go to the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not got possession of a considerable property of this man, of which you made no claim - A. Yes; here it is in my hand: forty guineas, four score half guineas; his sister desired me to take the four watches.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been able to trace where he sold these things of yours to raise that money - A. He is too sly for that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you refuse to let this man have a guinea to defend himself - A. I said I would bring it before the court, and to them I would humbly submit.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day he was searched you only found two or three halfpence - A.What he took that night was very little short of four shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIS. Q You were sent for to search this man - A.Yes, I asked the prisoner if he had any of his master's property about him; he said he had not; I told him I must search him; I put my hand in between the lining and the upper part of his breeches, and took out these two bits of soap, making one cake, broken in two; I asked him whose property that was; he said his master's. I put my hand towards his waistcoat pocket, he emptied it into my hands; the halfpence, I examined them, and found two marked halfpence as described by Mr. Everatt; I found in a pocket half a guinea, and sixpence in his shoe.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

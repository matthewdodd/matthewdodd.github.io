                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works at the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, and live at 33, Page-street, Westminster—about twenty minutes past 12, on the morning of 11th July, I was returning home down Great Peter-street, and saw the three prisoners standing together—I had got slightly past them, when the two male prisoners rushed up to me and threw me down—in front of them was the woman—she made a grab at my watch, but did not succeed—Fulbrook said, "God strike me blind, I'll have you" and then the two men threw me down—I cried out to them," Don't rob me"—I had got my hand close to my waistcoat-pocket, And I felt the woman's hand in my pocket, and my watch going—a gentleman came up and they ran away—I paid 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my watch—I was kept from my duties for a fortnight after this—this pocket-handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I have the corresponding one to it—I had it in my pocket that evening—it was taken from me with my other property—I had had three glasses of bitter ale during the day. I knew as well what I was about as I do now—there was a gaslight close by—about two days afterwards I saw Davis at the Police-station, amongst ten or twelve others and recognised him at once.</p>

About half-past 12 on this morning; I was on duty in St. Ann's-lane—I went down the lane to Peter-street—I then saw the three prisoners together, standing about ten yards from me—I went back again up the lane, leaving them there—when I had got about sixty yards up I heard something fall heavily on the pavement, and on look<lb></lb>ing round I saw three or four persons, and saw the female prisoner run from them as hard as she could towards me—I stopped her, and said, "What are you running for?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "What is the matter down here?"—she said, "Some man has knocked a chap down, and I ran away because I was so frightened."—I said, "Well, you had better come back with me, and let us see what is the matter"—I took her back to Peter-street, and there saw the prosecutor, Mr. Goodacre, and the two male prisoners The prosecutor said, "That is the woman who robbed me"—the two men said, "No, I am sure that is not the young woman, the person who has robbed you has run down St. Ann's-lane"—they said that repeatedly—I said, "Nobody else has run down there"—both the male prisoners came very close to the woman, and I pushed them away three or four times—they both asked Mr. Warrington repeatedly not to press the charge against the woman, as they were sure she had not got his watch—Mr. Goodacre was accompanying me down to the station with the female prisoner and the prosecutor, when Fulbrook went up to him, and, I believe, caught hold of his arm and tried to prevent him going, and I saw Mr. Goodacre strike him, or push him with some force, from one side of the street to the other—I sprang my rattle, and the two male prisoners directly made their escape—I did not see any more of them that night—I had no doubt that the prosecutor had had a little to drink, but he appeared very nervous from the effect of the fall—I could not say whether it was the effect of drink, or the effect of the fall—he recovered when he got towards the station—about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was found on the female prisoner at the station—I afterwards went back to the place where the robbery was committed, and in a narrow passage close to where the female prisoner had run past, I picked up this handkerchief—I took Davis into custody the next day—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with others in stealing a watch from a gentleman, in Great Peter-street,</p>

The Prisoner desired this Deponent might be ask'd, If he did not know the Deceas'd followed bad Courses? To which be answered, He only heard of this once staying out all Night.

This was likewise confirm'd in every particular by another Evidence, they both agreeing that the Deceas'd was very weak, and could scarcely creep up and down Stairs.

Some witnesses appeared in Behalf of the Prisoner, to prove that he had before this Time been a very loving, indulgent Father to the Deceas'd: But the present Fact appearing plain, the Jury found him <rs id="t17280117-38-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

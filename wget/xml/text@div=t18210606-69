On the 29th of May, at night, I saw my house fastened, I have a flap door made partly of wood and iron, that was safe, and my street door was safely locked - I was the last person in the counting-house; but not the last person at the street door, the flap door was safe. I had a considerable sum of money in my counting-house, in notes, gold, silver, and copper - there was 1 l., 5 l., and 10 l., notes, some of all those amounts, but none higher than 10 l. - there was upwards of 100 l. in silver, and about 30 l. in guineas and sovereigns, the halfpence were done up in a 5 s. papers, the paper was not marked - my young man,

            , did them up. I know one 1 l. note particularly and will swear to having marked it that night, and there was a French 5 d. piece, or demi franc, which I knew - I was awake about four o'clock, it might be that time, but I am not certain, and was out of bed. - I heard nothing then, it was just getting light; I went to bed, and went to sleep, and I heard the servant man get up, about five o'clock, and in consequence of an alarm from him, I went down stairs to the counting-house, I looked through the counting-house door, which is glazed, and there saw the iron chest broken open - I had locked the door, and taken the key up stairs, part of the copper, and all the silver, notes, and gold were deposited in the iron chest. I found them all gone, and the cash-box, which was in the iron chest, lying on the floor - I missed about 300 l. - on examining the premises, I found they had entered by the cellar flap, and from thence to the shop, by a trap door, which leads into the shop, they had broken the door leading from the shop into the counting-house, which I had left locked, and had the key; I then observed the door leading from the shop to the passage, broken open, and an iron till, behind the counter broken open; there was nothing in there that night.</p>

               <p>Q. On searching the counting-house, did you observe any thing else - A. A quantity of bills were taken out of the cash-box, and thrown over the floor, I missed none of them. On the table, under the iron chest, I observed a great quantity of tallow dropped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you go to this room before the windows were open, could you see - A. Yes; There is a glass door without a shutter, I can always see there without a candle, by day-light. The drops of tallow appeared as if they were dropped from a candle being held up to see into the chest, they were not there the night before, I found also a piece of candle which was not there the night before, we had none so thin. I got Ellis and Furzeman from Bow-street, we went with a search warrant to Holding's father's house, No. 7, Grafton-street, six doors from my house, it is rather a short street, we found nothing. In consequence of directions we got there, we went to Crown-street, Soho, and in Crown-street, we saw the two prisoners, it was about twelve o'clock in the day, we had been no where but to Holding's father's. Ellis took one, and Furzeman the other - we got a search-warrant, about eleven o'clock, we went to No. 71, Crown-street with the prisoners and saw the person who keeps the bottom part of the house - the officers asked, in their hearing, which was the room the prisoners lived in (I think it was Ellis) she said the front room, two pair; the officers went up with the prisoners, I followed behind, and saw Holding produce two keys and unlock the door himself, it was locked and padlocked; Ellis and Furzeman began to search the room, I stood at the door, and did not take particular notice - I saw Furzeman take a 1 l. note from a pair of trowsers which laid on the bed, I knew the note to be mine, it was in my iron chest the evening before, and I had written on it; I am confident of it. One of the officers then produced a bag from the chair, which was full of money, and was in my iron chest the evening before, there was 20 l. of silver in it. The French piece was produced at Bow-street, it was the same sort as the one I had, and the same date of the year, I know it by that, and its general appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Holding's father lived near you, did he (the prisoner) know your premises - A. I believe years ago, he was in the habit of coming for butter, but I have not seen him there lately. I have frequently seen the prisoners about the house with another person standing at the corners, I only knew them by sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARCHBOLD. Q. At what time it was done you do not know - A. No; if the chest had been broken after I got up, I should have heard it; I cannot be sure it was four o'clock - my window curtains were down - I drew one up, and saw it was getting light; the watchman was standing opposite, he leaves at five o'clock. There is a sky-light to the counting-house, there would be no occasion for a candle to examine the chest by daylight, any one may search the boxes in it without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop quite dark - A. No; there is a light over the door, it is perfectly light in daytime, and so is the cellar; the light comes through the grating; a light would be no help to them by daylight. I sleep on the second floor, nobody sleeps on the first. I thought the money as safe as in the Bank. Mine is two houses thrown into one - there is an inner communication between them.</p>
               <p>Q. They must be adepts in house-breaking to do it - A. I had no idea that any one could break the counting-house open without being heard.</p>
               <p>Q. A drunken man could not do it - A. No; I think none of my bills were taken, but I do not know what quantity I had. I never saw Holding in my house myself. His father is a bedstead turner, and I believe a respectable man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge by what the flap or doors were broken with - A. By an iron crow-bar; they broke off one of the bolts. If they had been in the house overnight, and broken out, there would not have been those marks.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 30th of May I went with Furzman and Mr. Brown, to Holding's father's; in consequence of what was told us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060045"></xptr>we went to Crown-street, and saw both the prisoners in the street, and apprehended them. I took Holding - Wade heard what passed. I asked him where he lodged - he said he had no lodging. I said he must have a lodging somewhere - he said, No, he was out of employment, and lodged where he could. Having had previous information, we took them to No. 71, Crown-street, and saw a person in the shop below; we then went up two of stairs with the prisoners - Mr. Brown followed us - Holding produced two keys, when we came to a door which was locked and padlocked, he unlocked both the locks; I proceeded to search the room, and in a table-drawer I found this canvas bag, containing 100 l. in Bank notes - there were five 10 l., nine 5 l., and five 1 l.; also eighteen sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and eight half crowns. About that time Furzman said something which drew my attention to Wade, who was taking something from his hat. I saw Furzman take from his pockets and hat, some papers of halfpence - there were eight papers. On this Holding took a paper of halfpence out of his pocket, and put it on the table. I then searched Holding, and took from his coat pockets seven other papers of halfpence, and some loose, also 2 s. 6 d. in silver, out of his breeches pocket. I found a hat-box standing under a bedstead turner's bench, and in it a tea-caddy, filled with silver, so that part of it ran into the hat-box, it was so full - there was 69 l. 19 s. 6 d. and a half-franc, in it. Furzman found a crow-bar up the chimney, also one picklock, one skeleton, three or four latch-keys, and seven or eight door keys of different descriptions. I found three small keys, a drawer key, and a latch-keys in another part of the room, and a box with some tools that are used by turners. Holding works at that business. In the course of the day I went to Brown's premises, and next morning took the crow-bar there - the flap of the cellar appeared to be forced by a crow-bar, and this fitted the marks; I fitted it with the marks, they corresponded; I tried both ends, and they corresponded with both ends. I tried the crow-bar with the lock of a door, but will not positively say it fitted. It is a common instrument of house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through the premises where the persons must have been - A. Yes, I could see in the counting-house by day-light without a candle. There are shutters, but a large space above them, whenever it is light out of doors you can see there notwithstanding the shutters - the prisoners gave no account of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holding produced the keys of the door of his own accord - A. Yes, without the least hesitation - made no resistance; we searched some time before we found the property - the crow-bar and keys were up the chimney, completely out of sight - there had been no fire lighted there since they were put there, apparently; a kettle stood there and some cinders, apparently fresh burnt - there had been a fire there lately, if these were put there before the fire was lit, the crow-bar would have appeared smokey and sooty - it is an ordinary sized one, but one claw is broader than the other, which I never saw before. I found another crow-bar on the premises, that could not have made the marks on the flap, it might have been used in opening the iron chest, or one of the doors. I never saw one that would make marks like this - it has an extra purchase; they had forced it down under the flap, so that it cut marks with the pressure, both on the flap and the cill of it - and it is fresh broken.</p>

            . I went with Ellis and Brown in search of the prisoners, I met them in Crown-street - I took Wade - we took them to No. 71, Crown-street; Ellis asked Holding where he lived, he said, he had no lodging, that he slept where he could - Wade must have heard it, as he was close to him. Ellis went into the shop and asked the people if these two men lived there - it must have been in Wade's hearing, for I was with him, and Holding must have heard it; a man came out and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they lived in the two pair of stairs front room;" we proceeded up stairs with them - Mr. Brown followed; Holding produced the keys, unlocked the door, and I locked it inside. I went towards the table, and saw Wade put his hands to his hat as he sat on the bed. I went to him and found four 5 s. papers of halfpence in his hat - he used a very bad expression. I searched him again, and found two more 5 s. papers in each pocket, which made eight, and in his breeches pocket which he had on, I found a 1 l. note; he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brown, you need not look at this, it is my property." Brown looked at it, and said he could not swear to it; there was a pair of blue trowsers on a chair close to Wade, before I searched the pockets, I asked whose trowsers they were; Wade said,</p>
               <p>"They belong to me," and in the pocket I found a 1 l. note; he said,</p>
               <p>"That is mine." I shewed it to Mr. Brown; he said,</p>

I went to the table drawers and found a phosphorus box and matches complete, and in the chimney I found the crowbar and keys, about the height of my arm up the chimney - it is a wide chimney, the bricks run up so as to make a shelf, on which they laid; there was no appearance of soot at all on them, but a little under them.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found nothing on Holding - A. I saw him pull a paper of halfpence out of his pocket, and told Ellis to search him, as he (Holding) was going to mix them with what I found - they were all tied up in the same kind of paper.</p>

            . I live at No. 71, Crown-street, Soho, and have lived there ever since the 14th of October last. On the 30th of May, Holding lodged there, and for two or three months before; Wade came backwards and forwards with him - they lived on the second floor; I lodge in the third pair front, over Holding. On the night of the 29th of May, or the 30th, between three and four o'clock, on the Sunday morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060046"></xptr>I heard a noise of persons coming up stairs - it was quite light; I should suppose it was only two persons. I heard them go into the two pair front, they unlocked the door, went in, stopped a little while, then both went out again, at a few minutes past four o'clock. I came down stairs at six o'clock, the door was then locked, and padlocked. I had heard nobody else come up to the door after they went out, we have many lodgers - the street door was never fastened till after this affair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holding lived there with his wife - A. Yes, till within a fortnight of that time, but his wife was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Wade sleep there after his wife left - A. I have seen him there frequently, but cannot say he slept there. The house was very quiet, and I can swear I heard the feet of two persons, and two went out. I saw the door was locked when I came down, but did not hear them lock it.</p>

            . The prosecutor is my brother, I make up the half-pence, and should know my making up again (looks at some of the papers found on Wade) I wrapped them up in such papers as these are, I am sure of this by a dent on the corner of the paper, which I make always as a private mark, to know it again, and here are three more - (looks at those found on Holding) - here is an old halfpenny in one paper, which I remember putting in, and my mark is on the paper, they are not all done up by me, but were all packed in the same paper, which is some sheets of the Antijacobin Review, I can speak to one found on Holding, and two found on Wade, the rest are packed in the same papers, and the pages of the work correspond, it is all the same sheet, there are sixteen pages to the sheet, from 427 to 443 - it is the paper I used in folding them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never put halfpence in that sort of paper before - A. I believe I have, and paid them away; I remember packing the one with the old halfpenny, on Monday the 28th, and remember the particular place the old halfpenny was put in, on the right side; I do not remember packing an old one before, it is flatted out just like the old one I put in.</p>

            . I know this 1 l. note, it was in my iron safe on the night of the robbery, and has my writing on it, in red ink</p>
               <p>"Mr. Binion," I received it the evening before the robbery, the 29th, and wrote that on it, and put it in the chest, I knew it the moment I saw it, I know the canvass bag by the mark P S T, it was a sample bag of oats; the French coin has the same appearance and date, I have no doubt of its being mine, I saw it in the cash-box the afternoon before the robbery.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Before the new coinage those demi-francs were offered as sixpences - A. Yes, it is dated 1808, a great many were coined that year, I got the sample bag from Mark-lane, it was taken out of a drawer where there was a considerable quantity, I do not know what the mark means, I can swear to the bag, I lost above 14 l. in halfpence, one man might carry them.</p>

            . I know the prisoners. On the 29th of May, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I met Holding, and remained with him till half-past twelve, at the Black-Lion, in the Vinegar-yard; he drank very freely of gin and water and other liquors, and was insensibly drunk, I am perfectly satisfied of it, I walked with him to the top of Bridges-street, and left him there in company with a male and female, I thought him not capable of conducting himself - neither him or the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about the other prisoner - A. They were both with me at the public-house, I left them at the top of Bridges-street at half-past twelve.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did Holding live - A. In Grafton-street; I do not know where he lived on the 29th of May; I am a licenced hawker, and live in White-Hart-yard, Drury-lane, when I am at home; I have lodged there three years; I did not drink much, as I had a bad hand, and the doctor desired me to abstain from drinking; I believe the landlord's name is Drake; he is not here; I heard he was in trouble in less than thirty-six hours after; I have been in the gallery of this Court before, but in no other way; I have been charged with assaults three or four times.</p>

            . I have known Holding a long while; I called on him on Sunday, the 17th of May, at No. 71, Crown-street; I saw him put his hand in his pocket and take out two-penny pieces - then he pulled out some notes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you read - A. No, nor write; I know Bank paper, his hand was full of paper money, rolled up; he gave me a note, and asked me to get change, but it was church-time, and the shops were shut.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What relation are you to his wife - A. I had her from a day old, and brought her up; he worked at his trade, and sold greens; he said, he had no silver, and wanted me to get change; he said nothing about 5 s. papers of halfpence - I never knew him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was housemaid to Mrs. Flynn, of 22, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall—the prisoner Slowgrove was cook in her employment and was about to leave on 27th November, according to notice—Mrs. Flynn searched her box in my presence, and everything in it belonged to Miss Flynn—a constable was sent for, but Slowgrove was not given in charge that night—after the constable left, on opening the box a second time, a silk dress of Mrs. Flynn's was found it—Jennings was a frequent visitor to Slowgrove, and on a subsequent day I saw a pencil taken out of Jennings' pocket, which was mine, and which I had missed when I went for my holiday in August, from a drawer in my bedroom.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Slowgrove told me that she was about to be married t Jennings—she had three large boxes and two small ones, and when she left she took them away with her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer G</hi>). On Monday morning, 30th November, I went with Odear to Mrs. Flynn's house about 12 o'clock, and from information I received from her I went to Queen Street, Oxford Street, where I found the prisoners in bed—I told Slowgrove I was going to take her in custody for stealing the property from Suffolk Street—she said that she knew all about it—Jennings went to the station with us—I searched the place and found thirty-eight composite candles, a lace fall, some dress trimmings, and other articles—on arriving at the station I told Jennings that I wanted him to go to Should ham Street with me—he did so, and pointed to No. 20, in the parlour of which house a box was handed to me containing the articles in this bag, four toilet covers, two chemises, a plated cream jug, six forks, two trays, four knives, a marrow spoon, a plated butter knife, a window blind, some snuffers, a salt spoon, and a knife sharpener—I left him there and he was afterwards taken in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Jennings' brother lodged in the house; it was he who gave me the box at the direction of Jennings himself—I believe the box was locked—I don't believe I opened it with a key, but the brother may hare opened it before it was brought to me—Slowgrove was not there, she might have given the key to Jennings in my presence; I will not swear she did not, because it was at the lodging if it was done at all—the landlady spoke to me about the box being removed, and I asked Jennings to show me where it had gone to, and he said that he would, but nothing was said about the key in my presence—I did not hear Jennings say to Slowgrove "Give me the key"—I found three large boxes at the lodging and two small ones—this was the second small one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer C</hi>). On 30th November I met Jennings in Shouldham Street, and told him I should take him for being concerned with Slowgrove in stealing articles from Suffolk Street, Pall Mall—he said "Very well, I thought it would come to that, the things were given me by Slowgrove to take away to my brother, because when the place was looked over I did not want them to be pulled about, as they were the property of my father"—I searched them at the station and found this pencil case, which is identified by Miss Finch—last Tuesday evening I went with Pickles to Queen Street and found this bag—there were some aprons and chemises in it.</p>

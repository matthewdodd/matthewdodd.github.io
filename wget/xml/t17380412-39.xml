               <p>Turnham I was going Home that Night, and this Woman picked me up at Fleet-Ditch; she persuaded me to go with her, and I gave her 2 s. for her Company. We had no sooner laid down, but I caught her attempting to steal my Watch. I challeng'd her with it, and she slipp'd it down in the inside of my Breeches, and said, No, my Dear, I would not do such a thing for the World; Then she persuaded me to pull my Breeches off: I did so, and took off my Stock Buckle, laying all my Things on a Stool by the Bed-side. I had not lain down again a Minute, but Madam was dry, and must needs go get some small Beer, - I am a little confounded too - She went for the small Beer, and I did not see any thing of Madam for 3 or 4 Hours: My Watch and Stock Buckle were gone; I never got them again. The Neighbours persuaded me to stay till she came back, and then I got a Constable and secur'd her.</p>

This Man came into my Rents, and gave me 2 s. to lie in my Room all Night: he brought a Woman with him, whom he call'd Couzen. I know nothing of the Matter as I hope to be sav'd. <rs id="t17380412-39-verdict188" type="verdictDescription">

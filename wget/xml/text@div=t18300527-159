            . I am an officer. I took Clark on the 4th of May, on the complaint of the prosecutrix, because I understood she had been in company with Coleman - the prosecutrix came to me at half-past five o'clock, and gave the same account she has to-day; she knew Coleman by name, but not the other - she described their persons; Clark said she knew nothing of it, and very willingly went to find the prosecutrix - I went in the morning, but as I was a little too late Clark had been discharged; I had then found the prosecutrix, and went and took Clark again - the prosecutrix then said she had been robbed, and Clark was the person who was with Coleman; she had told me so before, but did not know her name; I took Clark to the Thames Police, and the next morning Coleman's mother came and spoke to Clark- I heard Clark say, "Perhaps, if she could have the money she would make it up;" the mother said she would go and see if she could find her - I thought if I followed the mother I should trace out Coleman; I went - she went into a house in Gravel-lane; I went in, and asked if Mrs. Coleman had come in - they denied it, but I went up stairs and found the mother and daughter; there was nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Coleman. That woman said at the office that she lost fifteen shillings; she stood godmother to my child - we all got intoxicated, and I took the watch from her for safety.</p>
               <p>JANE EVELYN. I did stand godmother to her child the same day, and after we left the church I bought this shirt, and a seal for my husband's watch, for which I gave 6d. - they called for a quartern and a half of gin, and I paid 7d. for it; I had a pint of beer - I swear I was perfectly sober; we were not long with the priest, and he scolded her very much - we went between four and five o'clock with the child.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner break into your house lately - A. Yes; I was at home, it was a little after two o'clock on Tuesday morning; I was alarmed by a noise at the shutter of my shop door; I sleep in the parlour behind the shop; I heard it, and immediately got up; the noise ceased, I stopped a few minutes, and then laid down. I heard the noise again; I heard the shop door open, I ran out naked, and looked to the left, I saw two men, they did not see me, I ran after them, and caught hold of the prisoner, the other ran away, I held the prisoner tight by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he was in the house - A. I heard the footsteps go out of the house, I was not a moment after them.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost nothing - A. No. They forced the shutter open, and broke the bolt. He was taken to the watch-house, we found a broken chisel in his pocket, and a knife; his companion had an iron crow, which he threw away in Howland-street, which was brought to my shutter; it exactly fitted the marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I offer to run when you called out stop thief - A. You had not time, your back was towards me, I was immediately after you, when I saw you, you were talking together; the other man saw me, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positive that they were in your shop - A. I am quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the chissel to the shop - A. No, only the crow.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD. I am a broker. I picked up this crow at my door about half after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my work about five o'clock, with intent to take a chissel to make a seat-iron. I am a shoemaker, the knife is a shoemaker's knife, I had used it that afternoon, I took it to be ground, and on my returning from the fair late, I was locked out, I had no place of refuge, I was obliged to walk the streets. I saw two young men talking together, I said, are you locked cut, they said, yes; this gentleman came out, they ran away, he came and took me in custody.</p>

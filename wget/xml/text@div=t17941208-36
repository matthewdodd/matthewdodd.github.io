               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Kilby? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing any shag cloth? - I cannot particularly say when.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - It may be three months, but the particular time I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what he said about this? - He said he was a cutter to Mr. Davison, and they had such a quantity measured to them to cut so many garments, and by their ingenuity what they could leave after was their perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase any? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy that piece? - I cannot pretend to say which piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy something of the same sort? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of that piece of shag cloth, is that the sort of stuff that you make use of? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that piece? - No I cannot say to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any entry in your book of any particular piece of cloth that has been delivered out to that particular cutter? Do you see who made that entry? - It was made by Kilby himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sheddon. Look at the cloth itself and see if there is any sort of number on it? - There is No. 341.</p>
               <p>Q. Look if there be any entry in that book of the No.341, by Kilby, as that? - Yes, he received it to cut, and there was two thousand pair of breeches when we began cutting out, the 2d of September, and they were all made by the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the entry furnish you with the date? - It does not.</p>
               <p>Q. You found out a number on that piece of cloth that you say you have a corresponding number found in the book, entered by Kilby himself? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other sort of cloth entered with the same number? - No, not of the same number.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not prove that the last witness received it. Kilby's entry only proves this, that of that number, that was one he had worked, but others might have took it away.</p>

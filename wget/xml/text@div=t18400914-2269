               <p>15th of August, I had a lodger named Miss Thompson—I came home that Saturday night after one o'clock—I had a watch and two chains—one chain hung round my neck—the other chain was attached to it, and a key, and a locket—I took the chain off my neck and laid the watch on the table in the parlour, and went to sleep on the sofa in the same room—I awoke before three o'clock, and then went to bed, forgetting that the watch was on the table—next morning, about eight o'clock, I missed the watch, and chain, and other articles—in consequence of suspicion, I discharged Julia Murphy, my servant.</p>

I am an old soldier, and lodge at the Blue Anchor, in York-street, Westminster—I am a pensioner at Chelsea Hospital—on Saturday night, the 29th of August, I was at the corner of Tothill-street, and saw four young men in company—the prisoner was one of them—I heard one say, "What have you <hi rend="italic">made?</hi>"—the prisoner said, "I have made this here," (drawing a watch out of his trowsers pocket,) the other remarked, "A very good day's work"—in consequence of that I followed them about a hundred yards, saw a constable and told him of it—we fol<lb></lb>lowed them through the churchyard, and sent another to cut off their retreat—they were all secured and taken to the station-house—I attended at the police-office on Monday, and saw Julia Murphy there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140044"></xptr>
               <p>—I asked who of—he refused to tell, and said he would satisfy the Magis<lb></lb>trate—I asked his own name—he gave his own name and address correctly, "51, Marsham-street, Westminster"—he was not locked up, as his name and address was correct—he came to the police-office at Queen-square, on Monday, to claim the watch—Murphy was there, she saw it in my hand, and said it was her mistress's watch—I then secured the prisoner and took him before the Magistrate, and as soon as she saw him, she identified him as having been at her mistress's house—he was among other persons—she immediately tapped me on the shoulder, pointed him out, and said "That is the man there"—I believe what he said before the Magistrate was not taken down, but I will not swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th of August, I was living as servant to Miss Ivers—Miss Thompson lodged there, and came home about half-past eleven at night, with a person—the prisoner is the person, I am certain—I had seen him there once before—on the Saturday night I saw him in her room—I was three or four minutes in the room with him and Miss Thomp<lb></lb>son, and had an opportunity of looking at him—I was there when my mis<lb></lb>tress came home—the prisoner had not left the house then—I am quite sure he did not go out till half-past one o'clock—I did not let him out, but I did not lie down before half-past one, and he could not have gone out before that without my knowledge—in the course of the night, I was called up by a policeman, who said the street door was open—I did not tell my mistress of that—next morning I heard of the watch being stolen, and was sent away—on the Saturday night, a week after, I was taken up on suspicion, and was discharged—I was afterwards at the Police-office on the 31st, about a friend of mine who was taken up for being drunk—I saw one policeman showing the watch to another—I immediately said, "That is my mistress's watch"—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is it, and the chain I am sure is mistress's—I asked the policeman if there was not a small chain to it, and found there was—I was afterwards taken into the office, where there were several people standing, and the instant I saw the prisoner, I recognized him as having visited Miss Thompson—I am quite sure of him.</p>

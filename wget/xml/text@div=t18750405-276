                  </hi>. I live at 109, Mildmay Grove—that is about a mile and a half from Eden Grove, Holloway—I have known the prisoner for five or six years—I have been for twenty years manager at Docwra and Sons, the contractors of Balls Pond—the prisoner was employed there between three and four years at different times put together, and I had an opportunity of seeing him daily—I had discharged him four or five months before 6th March, and had seen him once in the interval, when he came to the office one morning and asked me to employ him—I told him I would not as he was a worthless vagabond, and told him to go about his business—that was before Christmas—I generally take money to pay the men on Saturday mornings, and it is my habit to leave home at 5.15 a.m. punctually—the prisoner knew that when he worked at the firm—he knew the hour of my arrival—I usually left by the area door, but. I have not done so since—there are eight steps up to the house to the front door and three steps down to the area—on 6th March I opened the area door to come out, I closed it after me, and did not notice anyone—at the instant I closed the door this paving stone, which weighs 261bs. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), came down from the prisoner's hands from a height of 11 or 12 feet—he was standing at the top of the steps leading to the house—it struck me on my hat and on my shoulder, it bruised my shoulder very much—I thought that part of the portico had fallen down, having no idea that the prisoner was secreted there with this stone—I was greatly alarmed—I found the prisoner on top of me in an instant; he must have jumped down and come down three or four steps on top of me—the stone had brought me to the ground—I knew then that his little game was plunder, as he knew that I had money—I closed with him as well as I could till we got out on the footway—he tried to escape, we had a struggle, and I knocked him down, but he got up instantly—I think I must have held him by his jacket, it was a kind of fustian jacket—he jumped up and ran away—I ran after him shouting "Murder," and he deliberately stopped short, struck me on the shoulder, and knocked me down and kicked me about the body—I was then about 40 yards from my own door—he made a groan when he gave me the last kick, but he did not speak—he got away—the stone does not belong to my house, it was brought there by him—there is a place on Newington Green, which would be on his way, where there are similar stones, and he had a basket which he carried with him large enough to contain this stone—it does not belong to my neighbourhood—I have not the slightest doubt about his being the man, I knew him well.</p>

On Saturday morning, 6th March, I went to a lodging-house, 1, Eden Grove, Holloway, between 9 and 10 o'clock, with Clark, one of Mr. Docwra's men—I sent Clark into the house to bring the prisoner out—he came to the door, and Clark told me he was the man—I said that I was a detective and should take him for throwing a large bit of stone upon Mr. Godwin's head, at 109, Mildmay Park—he said that he knew nothing at all about it—Mr. Godwin afterwards gave me the stone, it weighs 241bs.—the prisoner was wearing the clothing he has now—the jacket and basket have not been found.</p>

I am a night man, at 1, Eden Grove, Holloway, a lodging-house—on Friday, 5th March, the prisoner lodged there—there was a direction on the slate to call him at 4 o'clock on Saturday morning, and I called him at 3.45—(the directions are put on the slate the night before)—I cannot say whether he got up—I called him and saw no more of him till the officer took him—I had seen him sometime before in possession of a fustian jacket, but not lately—I saw a basket in his possession, about a week before, large enough to contain this stone, it had a piece of cord through the handles—I searched for the basket and jacket when he was taken, but could find neither of them.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the station on the 6th, about 10.30 a.m., and while he was sitting on a chair I took his hat off to look at him, and he said "How do you think I shall get I on"—I said "I do not know, I am sure"—he said "Well, I did get up this morning with the intention of going to Billingsgate Market; I came down about 4.30, and considered for three or four minutes whether I would go or not; but I did not, I went back to bed; I had an old jacket, but I had it stolen from me"—I said "Did you make any complaint to the police about losing your coat or jacket T"—he said "No"—nothing had been said about a jacket before he mentioned it to me—he said nothing about a basket.</p>

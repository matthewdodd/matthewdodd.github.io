            . I am one of the presidents of the Inland Department, at the General Post-office. - On the morning of the 24th of November, the prisoner was employed there as a stamper - I observed him put a letter before him, which he should have taken to the sorter - his duty, after stamping a letter, is to place it before the sorter; in a short time I saw two letters before him, one of which I knew it was his duty to take to the lobby. I watched, and observed him take both letters in his hand, and go towards the lobby with them in his hand - and when he got to the lobby door, I observed him hastily slip one of the letters into his right hand inner coat pocket: he then went into the lobby - and on his return, I told him I wanted to speak to him in the Inspector's-room - and when we got there, I desired him to empty his pockets, which he did - and produced eight letters out of his pocket - these are them, (looking at them) - they are all stamped, and bear the stamp of that morning; there was another stamper at that table, but he used a different stamp - these letters bear the impression of the stamp the prisoner uses; here is a letter among them, addressed to Samuel Williams, Esq. No. 13, Finsbury-square, London - it is taxed as double, and shows that it is double. I put my initials on it - it came from Liverpool, and is a ship letter; after marking it I left it with Mr. Wood, the Inspector of letter carriers, without breaking the seal. The prisoner said he had only taken the letters for the purpose of delivering them, and receiving the postage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was employed as a stamper, was he not also a letter carrier? A. Yes; they are both inferior situations in the office, and filled by inferior persons; the whole eight were not all ship letters, the other seven were single. It is easy to ascertain whether letters contain money or notes - the postage on this letter is 3s. 2d. - there is a postage on all the others.</p>
               <p>Q. If the person wanted to take the letters, and deliver them to receiver the postage for himself, without putting them into the hands of the sorter, could he do so? A. He could - he is a letter carrier himself; the seven single letters could be of no use to him, except to get the postage on them. I did not open the letter - the lobby is a room adjoining the Inland-office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where are the sorters? A. They stand at a table very near the stamper - he had occasion to take one letter into the lobby - it contained shipping intelligence, and should be delivered early, it was in a blue cover, which attracted my attention - that was not one of these eight.</p>

            . I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers, and was stationed at the Inland-office, in Lombard-street, which is in the city. On this day, the letter addressed to Mr. Williams was delivered to me, sealed by Mr. Vandergucht. I took it myself that day to Mr. Williams's, in Finsbury-square, and he opened it in my presence - it contained bills of exchange, which I did not examine. Mr. Williams sealed it up in my presence; the prisoner is a letter carrier - his walk is Titchfield-street, Mary-lebone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the letter carriers generally known to the persons to whom they deliver letters? A. Very probably - I have since seen the bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it the busines of a stamper to deliver them to the sorter? A. Yes; they then go through two or three different hands to the carrier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. This is a ship letter? A. Yes; I cannot say whether Bank-notes usually come from America.</p>
               <p>MR. VANDERGUCHT re-examined. The prisoner stamps the letters, and delivers them to the sorters - there are twenty-four sorters; they are first sorted into different divisions, then into subdivisions, until they come to the proper delivery; the sorter then delivers them to the teller, who reckons the amount of postage, and gives them to a messenger, who puts them into each letter carrier's box; the letter carrier is then called in to see that the account of postage agrees with the teller; he then takes them away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it unusual for the stamper, in taking a letter to the lobby, to carry a letter in his hand? A. It is not usual - but unless I had some particular suspicion I might not think any thing of it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 24th of November, I received a letter from Mr. Woods, addressed to Mr. Williams - that produced is the same. I accompanied Mr. Woods to Mr. Williams', in Finsbury-square, handed the letter to him - he opened it, and took out bills of exchange, which I marked - these are the same - (examining them.)</p>
               <p>MR. WOODS re-examined. The Titchfield district extends nearly to the New-road, and nearly to Oxford-street; it would be greatly out of a person's way to go by Finsbury-square to Titchfield-street - the stages go that way; one of these letters is addressed to Nortonfalgate, another to Somers town - which is not in the General Post-office delivery - it is not far from the New-road; here is another to Middlesex hospital, which is out of his district, but not far from it - he might go that way if he pleased; here is another to Buckingham-street, Fitzroy-square, which is in his district; one to No. 357, Oxford-street, which is a few minutes walk from his district - one to Gower-street, Bedford-square; he could go that way to Titchfield-street; and one to Cumberland-street, Portman-square. I saw him produce the letters from his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Are there more than one of these letters in the prisoner's delivery? A. Only one; the direct way to his delivery would be by Cheapside and Holborn. Norton-falgate is quite a different way.</p>

Ball, on Uriah Rowe, and endorsed to me; they are transmitted to me by Edward Clarke and Co., of America - his partner is David Badger; this is the letter which contained them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the receipt of this letter, you had unfortunately become a bankrupt? A. Yes; Mr. Wiggen, Mr. Alzedo, and Mr. Hughes, are my assigness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these bills sent to you for acceptance? A. They are remitted to me by Messrs. Clarke and Co., for acceptance - here are three of 1000l. drawn on me, they are not accepted, the other two were accepted at the time. I know nothing of the hand-writing of the acceptors. I should think they could not be negociated by a man in a low situation of life; I generally receive remittances from America in bills.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. None of the five bills were accepted when they arrived? A. No; the 167l., and 67l. 16s. 3d. have been accepted since; they are both specially endorsed to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On what day did you receive the letter? A. On the 24th of November. These two bills, in my opinion, were not negotiable by a person in the prisoner's situation of life. Norton Falgate is a little to the northeast of Finsbury-square, and two or three minutes' walk from it - a person would come through Finsbury-square from Norton-falgate to go to Titchfield-street.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Are either Norton-falgate or Finsbury-square in the way to Titchfield-street? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it your practice to pay the person who delivers letters to you? A. No, I have the early delivery, and keep an account against the postman, and pay him about once a week. I pay the regular man belonging to my delivery. I never saw the prisoner deliver letters to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you take in letters yourself? A. They are brought into the counting-house and laid on my desk; I am generally there, and know the postman who delivers them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive letters by the early delivery? A. Yes, a regular postman comes - they sometimes change their carriers. If a stranger brought a single letter I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen sometimes that letters are mis-sorted, and not all sent by the early delivery, and then sent afterwards? A. Yes, and then I pay the person who delivers it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you, on the 24th of November, the control over bills of this kind? A. I had not - none of the bills are stamped.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you open all the letters which came to you? A. I did not; one of my assigness generally opened them; they remain unopened till Mr. Timothy Wiggen, one of my assignees, comes. Mr. Henry Hughes has once or twice attended - Mr. Alzedo never attended.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never intended to steal the letters, but to transfer them as mis-sorted, and receive the postage of them.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Have you been in the habit of receiving Bank-notes from America? A. In a few instances, but not often; the probability is against their coming.</p>
               <p>MR. VANDERGUCHT. This letter came from Liverpool - it is stamped "Liverpool, ship letter;" that is done at Liverpool; the charge is made in town - all the eight letters are of that morning's arrival.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I receive a great many letters from America - they come by Liverpool - I know the handwriting of the drawer of the bills.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a general shop, at 5, Little Peter-street, West-minster. I know the prisoner, and have bought paper of her at various times—these are the description of papers that she brought—I gave the officer the paper I bought of her—one parcel has writing on it—I cannot say whether I bought this the last time I bought paper of her—I paid her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I may have bought about a quarter of a hundredweight of her—some of it has been used.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father, in the House of Lords—this is an appeal case in the House of Lords—this writing was made on it by myself in Oct. last, at my own house, and sent down to the House of Lords—these papers are made up in sets of six copies, to be deposited in the House of Lords—the judgment was endorsed on the other five copies in the same way as this is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the House of Lords. This paper has a judgment endorsed on it in my son's handwriting—I have seen this in the House of Lords since the judgment—the last time I saw it was about the latter end of Oct.—when these cases are brought to me in the House of Lords, they are placed in a room appointed for them—sometimes they are locked up—they are deposited there for public purposes—supposing any one wished to have one, it would be given out by me—I am the clerk in whose custody they remain.</p>

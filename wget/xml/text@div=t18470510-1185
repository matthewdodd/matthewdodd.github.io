                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, and live in Bermondsey-street. I was on London-bridge on Tuesday afternoon, the 4th of May, between twenty minutes and a quarter to four o'clock—I saw the prisoner and three others standing by Wallis's ale-shop—I looked into a tobacconist-shop, think<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>they were after no good—they went on the bridge, towards the City, and when they were about the centre of the first arch, I saw White go up to the right-hand side of a lady—one of the others went on her left side—two were behind this one, and one behind the other—I cannot say which was on her left side, but I can swear Jones was one of the three—I saw White, with his left hand, take a purse out of the lady's pocket—it was a light blue or grey one—White instantly darted across the road, still keeping the purse in his hand—it was projecting out of the side of his hand—they all went together—White was first—I crossed over—they all took the steps down to the wharf where the steam-boats go from, near Alderman Humphrey's—I went into Alderman Humphrey's, and Mr. Marchant came out to assist me—when I got in sight of the arch I saw the prisoners and three other persons standing under the arch—Mr. Marchant stood where he was—I went up to them—be<lb></lb>fore I got to them they ran away, and went up the steps on the other side, still running, and Jones, and one of the others who has not been taken, got into an omnibus which still kept going on—I went up to the conductor and told him he had got thieves in his omnibus—he still kept on—I told him I should take his number, if he did not stop, and while I was doing so they got out of the omnibus, and proceeded off—I ran and took White—he resisted very much.</p>

               <p>with something in his hand, which looked like paper, and I saw White pass something, which looked like a purse, to one other of the party—the witness went towards them—I went with him—on our getting towards them they moved towards the steps leading to Fenning's wharf, and ran up the steps—I went up and saw three men running away—I followed after them, as fast as I was able, and I saw one of the policemen had Jones in custody—I returned to the wharf—I am certain the prisoners are two of the party.</p>

On the afternoon of the 4th of May I was on London-bridge—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the two prisoners and a third person run into an omnibus, as it was proceeding on—White opened the door and got in, and the two men followed him—they immediately left it, finding Thompson close upon them—they made towards the City—I followed them, and caught Jones—I kept him till the policeman came—he asked me what I detained him for—I said, "For picking a lady's pocket"—he denied it—after I had him a few minutes he struck me on the arm with a stick—I have not the least doubt the prisoners are two of the three men.</p>

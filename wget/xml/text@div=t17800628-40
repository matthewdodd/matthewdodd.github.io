             sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon the 16th of June I had been to Billingsgate to buy some fish for my master; returning home with it, in a narrow court, I saw the prisoner standing at a door. She said she wanted to speak to me. I went through a passage into a kitchen. I stood in the middle of the kitchen, she stood by my side; she put one hand to my basket to see what I had in it, at the same she put her other hand into my breeches pocket and took a purse with a guinea and eighteen pence out of it. I had the purse and money in my pocket a very short time before I came to the house. I did not perceive her take it; she ran away then I had a suspicion of her. I put my hand into my pocket and missed it; she ran down the court. I asked another woman where she was gone to? She said, to the Swan, I went in search of her but could not find her. Then I went home with the fish and returned again; I got a constable; we saw the prisoner near the place; we took her before Justice Clarke who committed her. She said, she had not got my money but she knew who had it. We took another woman before the justice. She said there that the prisoner was the person who had robbed me; I never saw that woman before the second time of examination, which was on the Tuesday following; she denied she ever saw a farthing of the money.</p>
               <p>Was she committed? - Yes; but I never swore against her.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of it; there was another woman confessed before the justice that she had taken the money.</p>

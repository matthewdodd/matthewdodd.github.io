                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Mead-street, Bethnal-green. On Wednesday evening, 9th July, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Mead-street, going home—I am a commercial traveller—I had just been settling a little transaction and had hired a porter to carry a load for me to White-chapel—this porter is an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner—there was a female in the public house where we came in contact—I was knocked down in the street and robbed—the female robbed me, and the prisoner and another held me—I saw the prisoner and am positive he is one of the men—this happened about twenty yards from my own house—it was done quickly—I was not drunk—I was dragged across the road into Vincent-street—the woman took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my pocket, or thereabout, not lest; it might be a little more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker in Vincent-street, Bethnal-green. On Wednesday evening, 9th July, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw Mr. Boden in Sarah-street between the prisoner and another man—the other man appeared to be intoxicated, but he was not—all of a sudden I saw the prosecutor thrown or knocked into the road—he fell on his side and the two men instantly closed upon him in the road—the other man caught hold of the prosecutor by the collar and dragged him across the road underneath my window—in an instant afterwards a woman sprang from I do not know where, but she went close to the prosecutor, thrust her hand into his breast, as if she must have known where the money was, took something out and disappeared—as soon as the woman had taken the money the prisoner left the road, walked on the pavement, and walked away, and the other man after him—I knew the prisoner before by sight, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ever speak to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I have seen him about for this twelvemonth past, up in that neighbourhood—it was perfectly light, quite daylight out of doors—it was from the first floor that I saw this—it did not take long—I am sure it was daylight—I was examined before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated that this seemed just at dusk</hi>)—I saw the prisoner at the police station on the Saturday after—I was taken there by the police to see whether he was the man—to the best of my belief I stated before the Magistrate that I knew him before by sight, I will not be positive that I did.</p>

I keep the Prince Albert beer shop in Lower Whitecroo-street—I remember Wednesday, 9th July—I saw the prisoner that day—the first time I saw him was, I should say, from half past 10 to 11 o'clock in the evening—that was not the first time I saw him, he was in rather earlier than that—I cannot say what time it was that he first came—I first saw him about 9 o'clock in the evening, I cannot say positively for half an hour, it was about 9 o'clock—he remained till half past 10 or 11 o'clock, when there was a disturbance—there were three or four others with him, one was his sister.</p>

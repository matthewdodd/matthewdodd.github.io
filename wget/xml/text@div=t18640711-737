I keep the Cornwall Arms, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—on 21st June, the prisoner and another man came, and called for a quartern of gin, which came to five pence—the prisoner gave me a half-crown—I gave him the change—two women then came in, and called for half a quartern of brandy—one of them gave me a bad half-crown—I gave it back to her, and told her it would not do for me—the prisoner then took it, and gave me a florin—I gave him the change, and they all four went out together.</p>

I keep the Admiral Vernon, Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars—on 21st June, the prisoner came with another man and a woman—they called for two glasses of rum, and a glass of gin—the prisoner drank some of the rum—the other man gave me a half-crown, and I gave him the change—I had no other half-crown—they then went into the tap-room, and in about ten minutes they returned to the bar, and the other man called for a pot of beer and a quartern of rum—he laid down 3 1/2d for the beer, and the prisoner said, "I will pay for the rum," and put down 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said that that would not do, and he laid down sixpence—the prisoner then took out a half-crown and let it fall—he picked it up and put it on the counter—my daughter took it up, handed it to me, and said, "Father, this is bad"—I bent it, and told the prisoner it was bad—he said, "Give it to me again"—I said, "No, I never return bad money, except to the police"—they then paid me with a good sixpence, and went out—I sent my man to</p>

I keep the Flying Horse public house, Blackman-street—on Wednesday night, 7th May, the prisoners came and called for a pint of beer, for which one of them paid twopence; after a short time they called for half a quartern of gin, and one of them, I think it was Ann, gave me a counterfeit shilling—I put it into the till where there was no other shilling, and gave the change—they went away and I took all the money out of the till, there were two florins and the shilling I had received from the females—I put that money on one side, and left the bar in charge of Eliza Case—late in the evening I saw the prisoners again in my bar, and my wife said in their presence, "Here is another shilling, a bad one, which I have taken from these females"—one of them said, "You must not say anything against me"—I went directly to the till and found one counterfeit shilling, and three good sixpences—Miss Case pointed to the prisoner Ann, and said, "That female gave it me"—I went and got a police-constable and gave</p>

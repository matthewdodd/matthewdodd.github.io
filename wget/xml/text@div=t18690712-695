                  </hi>. I am curate of Christ Church, Streatham—on 23rd Jane I showed a friend over the church, about 5.30 in the afternoon—I fastened up the church, and took the keys to the vicarage—next morning I was called to the church—I found the surplices on the floor—my gown had been torn, and a part was missing—I afterwards noticed the clock was missing—I went into the church and found that one of the stained glass windows was broken, and there was a hole large enough for a man to get in at, and I found this large crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—as far as I can identify a piece of black cloth, I should think these sleeves belonged to my gown.</p>

I am the parish clerk of Christ Church, Streatham—this clock was standing on the mantelpiece in the vestry before it was stolen—I made a private mark on it, and know it to be the dock—I have compared the sleeves of the gown with the part that was left, and they correspond—these towels were missed, too.</p>

On 24th June last, about 6.30 in the morning, I was on duty in St. James's Park, near the Duke of York statue—I saw the two prisoners and arrested them—Williams was carrying a bundle—I asked him what he had, and he made no reply—I pulled the cloth from under his arm and saw a clock—I asked him who it belonged to, and he said his mother—Fisher was with him; they were talking when I first saw them—I asked Williams where his mother lived, and he said he should not tell me—I then took him to the station—on searching him I found two parts of a gown, and two book-markers, wrapped round his body, and a thermometer in his pocket—the clock had stopped at 1.30—Fisher said he had accidentally met Williams, and he knew nothing about it.</p>

At the Month's End I let her have 20 s. and then I got her out of my House, and glad I was to pass with her so. The same Day a former Servant of mine came to see me, and I being without a Maid, desired her to stay with me a Day or two. I gave her my Keys, and when she open'd my Drawers, she told me every thing was out of Order; and what's become of your Gold Rings, says she, and the Money that you used to keep here? Became of 'em? says I, why there should be 2 Gold Rings, and 15 Pounds. Well, says she, here's neither Rings nor Money. I found what she said was true; I got a Warrant ; the Prisoner was apprehended, and committed the Poultry-Compter. I and Mr. Bennet went to a Tavern near the Compter-Gate, and sent for her, and an Officer brought her to us. She told me she had not got my Money, but that it was in such a Place in my House. I was called out of the Room, and at my return I saw my 2 Gold Rings, 7 Moidores, 2 Broad Pieces, and 2 Guineas lying on the Table. This was all the that I had lost, except 1 Broad Piece. She said she had no more.</p>

            . When we had got a Warrant, I went with the Prosecutor in quest of the Prisoner; we found her in Southwark, she deny'd that she knew any thing of the Money. After she was committed, she sent to the Prosecutor, and he and I went to a Tavern near the Compter, and she was brought to us: She confess'd that she had taken the Money out of the Drawer, but not out of the Room; for she said it was left in a Tin Box behind the Chest. The Prosecutor was call'd out by a Woman, and while he was absent, she told me, that she had the Money about her, and would deliver it to me if I would persuade her Master to be favourable.

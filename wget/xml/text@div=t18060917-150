               <p>Q. How soon did she return. - A. In less than a quarter of an hour. She then produced to us ten counterfeit shillings, folded up in a piece of paper; I produce them, I have had them ever since, and kept them separate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her for the remainder of the money that you had marked. - A. She gave them to me, the three shillings, they are marked.</p>

I apprehended the woman instantly in her own room Saffron hill; her husband was standing by her, and another woman, whom she said was her sister-in-law. I searched her, and found nine shillings and two sixpences counterfeited money; much like these Mrs. Allcock gave me.

She and her husband came in together, they seemed to be quarrelling, she told me to go down stairs, and she would follow.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known Mrs. Miller before had not you. - A. Only on the 5th of August, that was the first time I was there. When I went down stairs she followed me down di- directly, she asked me what I wanted, I told her I did not mind particular, she might let me have five shillingsworth of bad money, she put her hand in her pocket and gave me ten shillings, she put them in a paper, I gave her four shillings and two sixpences, part of the money Mr. Rogers had given me; I put the money she gave me in paper in my bosom, and kept it there till I gave it to Mr. Rogers in the street. I then went with him to the Northumberland Arms. there I gave him the three shillings, the remainder of the money he had given me.</p>

Examined by Mr. Knapp. Mr. Powell, you are an assistant to the solicitor of the Mint, you are acquainted with bad money and what is good, will you look at these ten shillings, are they good or bad. - A. The ten shillings are counterfeit, they appear to have a composition upon them, which is the last thing they do before they put them into circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the shilling produced by Brown. - A. That is a counterfeit also. I believe them to be of the same manufactory.</p>

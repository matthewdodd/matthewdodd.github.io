On the 11th of October I locked the warehouse and left the premises between two and three o'clock, leaving him on the premises, with May and McDonnell; I gave Evans directions to bring me some oil that evening to my residence - I went home - he did not come with the oil - he did not come next morning as usual to fetch the key, which I had brought home, but I found he had absconded without even asking for his wages - four days' wages were due to him; I came to town about half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th, and found the street door open, as it usually is; my warehouse door was open, and the padlock taken off - no violence had been used, it had been opened by keys, and I found the keys on the premises; I examined the workshop, that had been unlocked, and a key left in the door; I lost the property stated in the indictment out of the counting-house - the whole amount is between 1400l. and 1500l. I have recovered none of the property in the indictment; I did not see Evans until the 26th of March, when I saw him at the station-house - Pike was taken into custody on the night of the 15th of October; I saw him at the Police-office, and heard some conversation between him and Higgins, and heard him say to Higgins, that 50. or 100. was no object - that was all I heard; it was not intended that I should hear it at all: after some examinations Pike was discharged; but before that I went back in a coach with him to the prison - I asked him to tell me the truth about it - he said he could not do it there, but he would in prison, if I could get an order to see him, which I did; he then said he could do nothing about it in that prison, but if I could get him to Clerkenwell prison he might see his friends there, and something might be arranged; about a week after his discharge I met him in Hatton-garden, and said to him,"Well, Pritchard, we disturbed you again on Saturday night" - he said, "Yes, but if you keep disturbing us we shall not be able to do anything, but if you let us rest quiet a while, very likely there will be something done for you." There was a drawer belonging to a pair of scales in the warehouse; on the 11th of October I called Evans to that drawer - there was a parcel in it containing two old seals, an old chain, and an old key, which had been cleaned up; it was for Mr. Page - I called Evans' attention to that parcel; it is very seldom I keep property there; among other things taken that night, that parcel was taken out of that drawer - nobody knew it was there but Evans and me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you ever found these things since? A. No; the money was in an iron chest, about half a yard from that drawer. I never heard of a woman threatening to swear a child against Evans - I am a goldsmith and jeweller - I am also a hackneycoach master - my wife manages that for me - I keep seven hackney-coaches, but no coachmen, nor any weekly servants - I have men to take the coaches out - they never come to the premises in Serle's-place - I had two men in my employ at Serle's-place, and have had ten before now, but they had no knowledge of the premises - they were never in the room by themselves.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did Evans know where your iron chest was, and that you kept your money there? A. Yes; the chest was under the counter - nobody could see it without going behind the counter; Evans knew I kept money in the iron chest, and where the precious stones and all the property was.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the workmen go behind the counter? A. Not unless I was there - I never knew them behind the counter when I was there; I do not recollect anybody ever going there.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MAY. I was in the employ of Mr. Half-penny on the 11th of October - I remember his going home that day perfectly well; I locked up the workshop, and put the key in a secret place in the passage - Evans knew where it was, because he put it there himself at times - it is a place known to me and the persons in the establishment, but to nobody else, to my knowledge, except to the prosecutor; John McDonnell, who is about forty years old, was there also; about four o'clock I sent Evans with a seal, to take with a parcel given to him by Mr. Halfpenny - he left the workshop for good at four o'clock - he was to take some oil to Mr. Halfpenny's house at Islington, but not to return; his work was over at four o'clock; I left the premises at half-past five, as it was impossible to see to work, and we had no lights at that time - when I left, the back parlour (which is the counting-house) was safe as Mr. Halfpenny had left it, when he took away the key - the padlock was on it, and it was to all appearance safe; McDonnell left about five o'clock - I was the last person there; about half-past seven next morning I went to the premises, having a job to do - I went to where I had placed the key of the workshop the preceding evening - it was gone; I crossed the yard, and found the key in the lock of the workshop, and that lock was unlocked: Evans generally came to work about nine o'clock, but he never came at all that day; I discoverd about half-past ten that the counting-house was open - I went and looked at the cupboard, which was open - I found a phosphorus-box on the counter, and some gold filings about - the place was rausacked; I went and told McDonnell; I then looked at the iron chest, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110011"></xptr>found that open - Mr. Halfpenny came in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many apprentices has Mr. Francis? A. I do not know; he has young men working for him, I cannot say how many - I was working there as a jeweller; I am a jeweller now and a cheesemonger - I set up a cheesemonger's shop in Kingsland-road on the 12th of November, and from 1829 to May, 1832, I was also a cheesemonger; I do not consider mine an extensive trade.</p>

             (Police-constable F 35). I know Pike; I heard of this robbery on the 13th of October, and on the 15th of October I saw Pike in Middle-row, Holborn, with the prisoner Evans - I knew Pike well before; I had seen him a few days before in a fustian jacket very shabby - on the 15th of October when I saw him with Evans; they both had new clothing on - apparently every thing was new, shirts, stockings, clothes, and every thing; they walked very quick past me - I was in company with our serjeant; they did not run, but walked very fast past us - I ran and got up to them; Evans put a handkerchief before his face, and turned back as if to pick something up - they turned back down as far as Glo'ster-court; they then both ran off like a shot as fast as they could run, and in Fox-court I lost Evans all in a moment; I secured Pike, and asked him who it was that was with him - he said he had no knowledge of him; I said, "Your name is Pike" - he said, "What do you want with me? my name is not Pike; I know nothing of the name;" I said, "I want you on a charge of felony;" he said,"I am a respectable man, and live at a bookseller's in Bow-street;" I said that was all in my way, and he would have an opportunity of seeing his friends, for I was going to Bow-street; we went along, I and Stace having fast hold of him - he said he was very thirsty, and in Long-acre I consented to his having some porter, and in the house he took a purse out of his pocket - he refused to let me look at it - I forced it out of his hand, and found four sovereigns in it; we went along, and I said, "Now this is the shop you say you live at, I will go in with you" - he said,"It is of no use telling a lie, I don't live there at all;" I took him the following morning before the Magistrate, and in the outer office he said, "It is of no use your pursuing the charge, and if you don't there will be a friend of mine here in ten minutes who will stand 50. or 100.;" Mr. Halfpenny was close by me (I wanted him to hear it) - I said, "What did you say?" and he repeated the words again; he was examined and remanded from time to time for six weeks - he told me at two different times, in Mr. Halfpenny's presence, that it was no use keeping him there, for the man who had the property he should not have an opportunity of seeing as long as he was kept there, but if they had him turned up, or let him out on bail, he had no doubt he could make it all right; I was unable to apprehend Evans up to this time - I had been looking for him all the time; after repeated examinations the Magistrate discharged Pike; I saw Evans in custody afterwards, and Pike was taken the same evening again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When you took him you told him it was for felony - he made various excuses, and said if he could get out, there was a man who would stand 50. or a 100., and he could do no good in that prison; but if let out on bail he could make all right? A. Yes; I had charged him with being concerned in breaking into this house - I charged him with Mr. Halfpenny's robbery - he made these observations afterwards; he was present when I signed the charge.</p>

On the night of the 26th of March I took Pike into custody, hearing that Evans had been taken; on the 27th they were both brought to Hatton-garden, and locked up separately - I went with Mr. Halfpenny into the lockup place, and asked Evans what he had to say about his master's property; he said he could not say any thing till he saw his uncles, Joe and Jem, and asked me to go after them - he said, would Mr. Halfpenny lend him any money, and if he behaved well to him he might not be at all the loss - Mr. Halfpenny would not lend him any; I took out 1s. and lent it him - he was at that time charged with this robbery, and Mr. Halfpenny was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had any body sent him 6d. worth of brandy? A.

            ; we live at No. 8, Serle's-place - we let the back parlour and workshop to Mr. Halfpenny. On the evening of the 11th of October, a little after six o'clock, I heard a voice, which I knew to be Evans' - I knew it perfectly well - the voice came from the passage which leads to the counting-house or warehouse; it appeared to be about six yards from the counting-house - the voice was speaking to somebody else, and I heard another voice answer; but I did not hear what they said - I can be certain the voice I heard was Evans' - I stated that at Hatton-garden; and while I was saying that, Evans replied that he could account for being there - I knew nothing of the robbery till Mr. Halfpenny came in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many apprentices has your husband? A. Three boys; he has no men - the first door in the passage is my husband's counting-house, where our apprentices work till nine o'clock at night - further on in the passage there is a middle door, which you must pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110012"></xptr>through to get to Mr. Halfpenny's counting-house - the kitchen stairs are between that door and Mr. Halfpenny's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any of your apprentices abscond? A. No.</p>

            . I am the husband of Eleanor Francis. I was at home on the evening of the 11th of October, and saw the reflection of a light over the shutter of Mr. Halfpenny's counting-house; the shutter does not come within six inches of the top - there was a light, certainly, in Mr. Halfpenny's warehouse - it was from ten minutes to a quarter after six o'clock; it was a very unusual circumstance - I went down and mentioned it to my wife.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLET. I am clerk to the Magistrates at Hatton-garden. I took this examination of Evans from his own mouth, and afterwards read it over to him, and it was signed by Mr. Rogers, the Magistrate - Evans did not sign it; he was not asked - (read)</p>
               <p>The prisoner. Evans, says, "I went for the gallon of oil that evening, and to the two places, Mr. Evans states; I left at a quarter to four o'clock, and, on account of it being so early, I thought I must come back again, and I just went to the yard door. - I saw the shop was locked; I could see no key in the door, and went out again; that convinced me there was nobody at work - it was about half-past five o'clock. I took the oil bottle home to my father's. I might have muttered something to myself in the passage; when I came to the middle door in the passage it was open, and I recollect saying to myself - oh! this door is open for a wonder! that is all. I am quite innocent of the robbery."</p>
               <p>MRS. FRANCIS. I heard two voices - I cannot tell one word that was said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it must have been something like a muttering? A. No, it was not; it was ten minutes or a quarter-past six o'clock - I am certain I heard two voices.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prosecutor's premises about half-past ten o'clock on the 12th of October; here is the padlock of the outer door, and the key in it; I found a crow-bar or jemmy, a phosphorus-box and matches, and three skeleton-keys, one of which fitted the padlock of the warehouse door, and the other opens the iron chest; the other will not fit the iron chest - there was a wax candle, which was not lighted, but one seemed to have been burnt.</p>
               <p>MR. HALFPENNY. These skeleton-keys do not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Evans' Defence. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Pike's Defence. I have very much to complain of the prosecutor and Policeman making the statements they have - it is very easy to impute words to me, and very difficult for me to reply to them; there has been a gross perversion of words: Is it likely I should offer an officer 50l. or 100l., in the presence of a prosecutor, not to press the charge? Is it consistent with common sense? it appears Mr. Higgins is always offered money by every body he takes; when I first met him I said my name was Pritchard which certainly was false, but that is my mother's name, and she actually lives in Bow-street; Stace said he thought there was a bookseller of the name mentioned in Bow-street, and when they took me to Bow-street I requested them to let me call on my friends, but they refused till they went first, and it is not very probable I would allow them to alarm my friends, unless I went with them - I said I would not let them go at that time of night, but next morning I asked if he had been - he said he had not; he says I said I expected a friend in ten minutes - now, he knows I could not send out to any body at all: as to my promising to make it all right, I appeal to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18330411-15-person264">Flower</persName>
             the solicitor, whether I said so; he came accompanied by Mr. Halfpenny to the House of Correction; Flower asked whether I was able and willing to give them information - I said it did not lay in my power, and that I had said over and over again I knew nothing of the robbery: Halfpenny said, "You have said so twenty times, but I know better"- Flower said, "Are you willing to give us information?" I said I was willing if able, but I knew nothing about it - I was always beset by somebody; I said if I was at liberty and could get information, I would certainly do it, if able- I had several with me about giving information; but as to saying if I was out I could see the man who had got the property, it does not stand to reason that I should say so: I was eight or nine weeks in custody, and then discharged - since that there has not been another shadow of evidence produced but what was on my examination then; as to being with Evans on the 15th of October, it was not Evans; there was a witness at Hatton-garden who was of consequence to me, but they found her deposition was not of advantage to them, and she is not here; she could prove Evans was actually destitute, and in want of victuals and money, and she supplied him with food and 7d., instead of being in new clothes that day.</p>

            . I was with the officer when Pike was taken, and am sure Evans is the man who was with him - they were both dressed in new clothes.</p>
               <p>Pike. That man has worked for the prosecutor three years; he did not come to any of the examinations to state that Evans was the boy.</p>
               <p>Evans. What Higgins says is false; he apprehended me once for picking pockets.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. HALFPENNY. Q. Is this paper your hand-writing; it has just been sent to me anonymously - look at the name but do not unfold it? A. I do not think it is - it is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Read the document now, and tell me if you will swear it is not your hand-writing? A.This appears like my hand-writing - it is mine; I did not lose any houes; I signed this paper to get part of my property back - I got some of it back, but none of that which is stated in the indictment; I believe the person's name who I signed this for is Jackson; I did not think it was my writing at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.This is dated 21st December, 1832, and says "I hereby agree not to prosecute any party connected with the robbery of my house, which took place on the 11th of October," who did you sign that for? A. A man named Jackson, because he promised to bring me my property back; I signed it with that view,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110013"></xptr>and to get a conviction against him and all the parties; I expected to see all the parties; I have recovered about 170l. worth of my property; I obtained it from a cabman, who rode up my yard, and rang the bell - it was stones of different descriptions; when I said I had recovered none, I meant none of the property in the indictment - I understood that to be the question asked me.

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. On Sunday, 14th June, I was in Cutler Street, Houndsditch, between 11 and 12 o'clock—the prisoner came up with another gentleman—the prisoner produced a gold chain out of his pocket, and appeared to be talking about it—the other person then left him, and as he was going away he offered him some pounds for it—the prisoner said it was not half the value—he then came to me, and said, "People here expect to get anything for nothing; do you want a gold chain?"—I said, "No"—he asked me again, and said it was a beautiful gold chain, and he would give me a bargain of it—I said I did not want it, and I had no money to buy it—he asked how much money I had—I said I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the</p>

               <p>people were going backward and forward—he looked in my breast, and said, "Come on one side, we will have a bargain"—we went to Seven Step Alley, he showed me the chain, and said it was a beautiful gold chain; it was more than two ounces of solid gold—he told me to feel it, and asked me if I had got a watch—I told him I had—he asked me for the sight of it—he examined it, and said he would give me the gold chain for my silver watch and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a silver chain to my watch—I refused to let him have it—he then offered me the chain for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the watch—I refused it—he then asked what sort of a chain I had—I said a silver chain, and he said he would give me the gold chain for the silver chain and what money I had—I gave him the silver chain from round my neck, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, for his gold chain—I should not have done so unless I had believed that the chain was gold—he put the silver chain in his pocket, and the money, and went away—I made inquiry, and found the chain was not gold—I went back, and the prisoner was in the same street, talking to the same man that he was with before—I was looking for a policeman, and the prisoner caught sight of me and ran away immediately—he was taken on the follow<lb></lb>ing Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 6). On Sunday, 21st June, I was in Cutler Street; I saw the prisoner coming out of White Street, running, and the prosecutor after him—I pursued the prisoner, and caught him in the crowd—the prosecutor came up, and charged him with having defrauded him on the previous Sunday, with having sold him a chain which he repre<lb></lb>sented was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "I am not the man."</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know this neighbourhood pretty well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is near Cutler Street, and near Petticoat Lane—it is a resort of bad characters, and especially on Sunday mornings—that is the only morn<lb></lb>ing that they can resort there, up to 2 o'clock—it is the resort of thieves and other bad characters, what are called fences—there are good bargains to be had if you like to run the risk—there was an immense crowd—I should say from Petticoat Lane to Cutler Street there were a thousand per<lb></lb>sons—there are many bad characters there, but the Irish are worse than the Jews—this is the chain I received from the prosecutor.</p>

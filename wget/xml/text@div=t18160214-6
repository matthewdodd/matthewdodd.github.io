On the 11th of February, Sunday evening last, I left my house at half past six by my watch; I shut my door, and doubled locked it, and as was customary, I kicked at the bottom; the window was bolted with two bolts and a brass catch; so that the house was quite shut up. I returned at eight o'clock; when I returned, I found my door broken open; my wife and children were with me when I returned: when I found in, I found my table laying on the floor, and my looking glass gone. Then I entered my upper room; when I came up stairs, I found that my feather-bed and the clothes were all gone, and my wife's baby linen. I work for Mr. Simms. I had been up stairs before I went out; my bed and blankets and other things, and all my wife's and my own clothes were gone. When I missed these things. I ran about to try if I could hear any thing about them; I ran to the Commercial-road, and I afterwards saw the bed, the blankets, a pocket-book, and a three shillings token.</p>

            . I am an officer, belonging to Shadwell. On Sunday, evening, the 15th, at about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in company with Butler and Partridge; we were in the middle of the road, and I saw the prisoner on the pathway, carrying the bed, which I will produce; I stopped him, and asked him where he got that bed; he said it was his mother's, and they were moving. I know Hawkins's house, and this was about two hundred yards from it, scarcely two minutes walk. I asked him the street, and he said he could not tell the street, for they had not lived there long. I told him he must go with me to the public-house, and that he must shew us the street where he brought the bed from, and that would be a satisfaction; he then said a man had hired him to carry it. We searched him, and found a knife and a comb on him, and a pipe with some tobacco. I saw Butler, the other officer, take a pocket-book out of the prisoner's pocket. We afterwards learned the prosecutor's house had been broken open.</p>

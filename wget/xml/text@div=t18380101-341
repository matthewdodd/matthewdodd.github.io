                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman and general outfitter, and live at No. 112, Upper East Smithfield, near the London Dock. On the 18th of December I missed a pair of blankets and a rug, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, from inside my shop—I had seen them a very few minutes before, placed on a seaman's bed by the door, inside the shop—they were near enough to be reached without coming into the shop—I saw them again a few days afterwards, at Lambeth-street police-office—it was on a Friday—I lost them on a Monday.</p>

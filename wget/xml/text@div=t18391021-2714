                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. I went to Ann Coup<lb></lb>land on Thursday, the 3rd of October, and took her—I asked if she had not got some carpet shoes on her feet—she said, "No"—she then said, her husband was an innocent man, and she had thrown the bag into the New River—I took a person named Davy into custody, and he told me some<lb></lb>thing, in consequence of which I went to a pawnbroker's in Gray's Inn-lane, and found a handkerchief, which I have produced—it is one the prosecutor has sworn to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-man. On the 6th of September I was fetched by John Allen, and took him up in Bream's-buildings—he brought a large bundle, put it into the cab, and said, "Drive towards Westminster"—he got on the box with me—in Chancery-lane a man stopped him—he got down, and told me to go on—he overtook me in going by St. Clement's church—he hailed a woman (not the female prisoner)—she got in, and he ordered me to drive to No. 12, Charles-street, Drury-lane—they got out, and took the bundle—I then drove them back and as they were getting out, the woman said, "I have pawned a handkerchief in Gray's Inn-lane for 2*. "—John Allen paid for the cab.</p>

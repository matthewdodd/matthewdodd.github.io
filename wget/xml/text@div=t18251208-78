The prisoner was in my service for a fortnight, which ended on the 28th of November. My wife had sent him that afternoon, while I was out, to a Mr. Watkins, in Carnaby-street, with some bread; I was at home about four o'clock, and saw him return with an empty board; I said to him "There was a mistake in Mr. Watkins' account last week of three loaves, what have they had now?" he said "Eighteen now and sixteen this morning;" I booked them before his face; I went to Mr. Watkins in about an hour, and on my return I had him taken to the watch-house - he had nothing to say.</p>

On Monday, the 28th of November, I met the prisoner, who is lame, and I assisted him to carry twenty 2lb. and eight 4lb. loaves to Mr. Watkins'; he took six 2lb. and six 4lb. loaves; - he said he had got another customer to serve, and he would take them to him, as it would save him trouble - they all appeared to have come from one batch.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What did the prisoner say when he returned? A. He said nothing about it; but I took him to the watch-house for embezzling nine loaves of bread.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master serves a person named Corban; I went to take the bread there, and had the misfortune to slip, and throw it down; I was afraid to take it home, and I sold it for what I could; when I got home my master scolded me about something, and I was afraid to tell him then; I had not the money about me or I would have paid him; I meant to have told him in the night, when we were at work together. When I was taken to the watch-house I was not told what my charge was.</p>
               <p>JAMES JONES re-examined. He told me to book the bread to Mr. Watkins.</p>

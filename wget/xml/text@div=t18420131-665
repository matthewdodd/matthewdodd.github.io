On the 7th of January I had information of a shirt being stopped at Mr. Burford's—I went there and saw the prisoners—Hannah, the mother, claimed the shirt as hers—it was mine—I gave them into custody—I saw another shirt at Burford's, which was also mine—I went with a policeman and searched the mother's house, and found the duplicate of a silk handker<lb></lb>chief there—I found a sheet and handkerchief at Jones's, at New Brent<lb></lb>ford—the prisoner Sophia had come to our shop three times in the interval of two days about purchasing shirts—she was also there that morning, and I then lost a shirt with our mark on it.</p>

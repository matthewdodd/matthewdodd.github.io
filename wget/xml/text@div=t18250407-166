The prisoner left my service on the 28th of February, and left part of his clothes, which he was to call for. In consequence of information which I received from Hickmott, I desired two officers to watch his motions, when he came for his clothes; I cannot very easily miss property. On the 13th of March he called about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I saw him go out, and when he had got six or seven houses further I saw a quantity of pork found upon him; Read searched him, and found three belly pieces and two legs of pork; he had them tied in an apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any mark on it? A. I had marked it with a knife and fork.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Forbes. On the morning master turned the prisoner away, he came to me, and said if I liked he could put me in a way to get 10 s. a week; he took me to a public-house, and gave me a glass of gin; his brother came out: he told me to go away - he then told me to go in doors, and take two bellies, tie them on each side of me, and he would give me 5 s., and if I would do it again he would give me 6 d. a pound for it - I said I would think of it. I immediately went and told master; Read was desired to watch him. - On the 13th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, he came in; I saw him take the pork, and tie in his apron - he went out; I told master, who followed him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was on the opposite side of the market, within view of the prosecutor's door. I saw the prisoner go in; he came out with a large bundle under his arm; I stopped him, and insisted on knowing what he had got; he said,</p>
               <p>"Go back, and it will be all right," and when he got near the door he dropped the bundle, containing two legs and three belly pieces of pork, which weighed 33 lbs.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

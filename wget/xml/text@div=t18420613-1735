About twelve o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of December last I was in Church-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch, and heard the springing of a rattle, which took me to Nicol's-court—when I got there I saw my brother officer, James Carroll, <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 160—he had hold of a man, who was struggling to get away—I went to assist Carroll—there were other persons around them—I and Carroll succeeded in getting the man about thirty or forty yards along—whilst we were doing that, the persons around were hallooing, and closed in on us, trying to get our prisoner away from us—when we got near the Knave of Clubs I saw a person named Thomas Smedley—he knocked Carroll down, struck me, and rescued our prisoner from us—I told Carroll if we could not have the prisoner, we could have the man that rescued him from at—we followed Smedley, and succeeded in getting him to the station—he was committed, and convicted here—while I followed Smedley the mob were crying out, "Don't let the b—s take any of you, give it to the b—a"—they fol<lb></lb>lowed us when we were taking Smedley—we never lost sight of Smedley—we took him in Turville-street, and took him along to Old Nicol-street—the mob still followed, making the same noise—when we got to Turville-street, another constable, named Ffelan, came up and took hold of Smedley, who made several blows at Carroll, over Ffelan's shoulder——he did not hit him that I could swear to—while he was doing so, I saw the prisoner, and beard him say, "Give it to the b—s, don't let them take any of you"—shortly after he said that, Carroll fell—I cannot say what made him fall—there was a great mob—they were very violent—I and Carroll were struck, but by whom I cannot say—I do not know who lifted Carroll up again—I saw him when be was up—I saw him bleeding from the head—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and put him into it—I afterwards took Smedley to the station.</p>

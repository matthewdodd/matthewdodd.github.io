I was called by a witness on the 18th of February, who told me he believed I had lost something; we went in pursuit of the prisoners, and over-took them about two hundred yards from the house, in company - I asked if they had not got something belonging to me; Cogle said he had got something which a boy had given him - he gave me a brass cock; I took it home, and took them into custody. A person must have come into the shop to have taken it - it was on the counter.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker: my house is near Mr. Glaysher's, on the opposite side of the way. I saw the prisoners with another person pass my shop, and look very hard at the window; I went to the door, and looked after them; they looked into every shop which they passed - when they came to Mr. Glaysher's, Collerly went up the steps into the shop - the third person stood at the end of the window; Cogle went a little way on; I saw Collerly come out in a short time, with something in his right-hand; he gave it to the third person, who put it under his coat. I immediately told Mr. Glaysher; we pursued them down the town, and took them altogether; Cogle had then got the cock.</p>

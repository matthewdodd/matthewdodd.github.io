I had her character from a particular friend of mine - a very good character, and during the time she lived with us she conducted herself very modestly and very civilly.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact no sheets had been missed? - A. No, not till after the sheets were produced, and then I looked them over and missed them.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Peltran.) Are these Mr. Griffin's sheets? - A. There is part of the marking picked out, there is the J, and the G is picked out; there is the mark of the thread that the G was marked with; there is the print of No. 1, that is picked out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. It is a common mark J. G. it may be J. Griffin, or J. Green? - A. I cannot swear to linen, only J. G. and the number.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact the G and the number is picked out - you only speak from probability? - A. From the appearance I should suppose they are Mr. Griffin's; it is not impossible others may mark with the same letters; if they were not marked I certainly would not swear to them.</p>

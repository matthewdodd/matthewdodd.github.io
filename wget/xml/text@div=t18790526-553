I live at 169, Marylebone Road, and am an accountant—on Saturday, April 12 last, I returned home about 8.15 p.m.—there was no one in the house—I saw the prisoners at the door; seeing that I was going up the garden path they left the door, and walked down the path, met me, and would have passed me, but I stopped them, asking them what they wanted—Underwood said "I want Mr. Williams, a solicitor"—I told him that no person of that name lived there or near, but that Payne lived next door, and another solicitor two doors off whose name I forgot—he said "I know Mr. Payne, but I don't want him"—I said"I live here, and I don't want you"—they went out at the gate, and turned eastward—I had a particularly good view of their faces, because there is a street gas lamp immediately at the end of my garden—I placed my latch key in the door; it did not turn, and with a slight push the door opened—the beading of the door and the catch of the lock were wrenched off—there were marks on the wood as if made by a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>—I went to the police-station and gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion—early in the morning of 22nd April I was called out of bed by a police inspector and taken to the station, where I identified the prisoners amongst eight or nine other persons.</p>

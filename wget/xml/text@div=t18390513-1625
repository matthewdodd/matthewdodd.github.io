                  </hi>. I live at High-street, Shadwell, and am a pawn<lb></lb>broker and jeweller. The prisoner had been in my service between two and three months—in consequence of what my wife said, I went down to my kitchen last Wednesday, and found the prisoner there drunk—I said, "Cook, you appear to me tipsy"—she said, "I cannot be tipsy, for I have had nothing to drink"—I had a few friends with me to supper that evening, and I said to her, "You will not be able to cook the supper"—she said "Yes, I shall"—I left her—the same night, in consequence of what my son told me, I had her called up from bed, and asked her where she got the wine and spirits she had concealed in the clock case—she said, "I will tell you the truth, I took them out of your wine-cellar"—I neither threatened nor made her any promise—she was rather more sober then, and knew what she was about—I asked her how she got the key of the cellar—she said she took it from the closet in the parlour, went down to the cellar, took the wine out, and placed it in the clock case—I asked what she meant to do with so much of it—she said she meant to drink it—there were three bottles of port, one of sherry, and three parts of a bottle of gin—I said I did not believe she meant to drink it, but to give it to somebody else—she</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse boy to Mr. Campbell. On Monday night last I saw the prisoner intoxicated, about half-past eleven o'clock—I went up stairs, leaving her in the kitchen—I afterwards went into the shop and returned to the top of the kitchen stairs, and looked down into the kitchen—I saw her at the clock case with a light—I could not see what she was doing—she afterwards went to bed—I got a key that fitted the clock case, and found five bottles of wine there, and called master.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown and Anchor in Farringdon-street On the night of the 10th of June the prisoner walked into my house—when he came down stairs a person said something to me, and I went after the prisoner to Shoe-lane—I met him, and said I wanted <hi rend="italic">to</hi> speak to him—he ran away—I followed him to Crown-court—I caught hold of him, and the policeman came up—I lost nine ivory balls—they were safe in the house two minutes before the prisoner came in.</p>

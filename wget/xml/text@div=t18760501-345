                  </hi>. I am a printer in Lovell's Court, Paternoster Row—I print the "Sewing Machine Chronicle" for the defendant—I printed the number of January 15th, 1876—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the original., it is in the defendant's handwriting—I printed from 400 to 500 copies—I had nothing to do with their distribution—I delivered the whole bulk to Mr. Jones—I also printed the number of 27th March, 1876, containing a report of the proceedings at Guildhall—I can't say who supplied that MS.—I supplied the paper to Mr. Jones; about the same number of copies—I had some conversation with him about the article on 15th January; I really forget what it was—I thought it was a matter that should be pointed out to him; I felt it to be a dangerous thing—I told him we could not print it—he said he would take the responsibility—he simply said the article referred to a person once in his employ, nothing further that I remember—the words" contemptible hound "Stood originally in the MS.; those words were evidently scored out by the writer of the article, for it is in the same coloured ink; that must have been done before the conversation, or else it would have been printed—I can't say who scored out" like master like man;" that was done before the printing, certainly—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is a proof that was submitted to the defendant—these alterations are in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The libel was put in and read as follows:</hi> "There is at the present time engaged in the sewing machine trade as traveller, a man, who, having tried his hand at many callings at home and in the Colonies varied with some experience of the civil and criminal tribunals of the country, is now directing his energies to selling sewing machines. It is to be hoped that the sewing machine trade in this country may not become a refuge for the destitute, and that the trade will only care to be called upon as chiefly heretofore by <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi> of character and ability. It certainly is not honoured by including among its members those who, having been several times helped on in life by late employers, at last gain a position by flagrant breaches of honoured trust that a thief would disdain to use, and bend their energies to maligning the character of friends. As the tongue of one of these worthies has been busy for some weeks with the reputation' of his late employer, this public warning is given to him either to learn gratitude and the wisdom of silence, or to establish his virtue and honour by having his antecedents proved in a court of law. He can do no harm to those who served him and his with kindness for thirty years, and he is worthy of the service of firms needing business so much that they engage him instead of men who would scorn to sell knowledge gained in previous employments.") The alterations were made by the defendant before our conversation, before the issue of the publication—I did not call his attention to it after the alterations had been made, I let it go to press—I happened to be away at the time it was issued—it was an application to give the name of the writer that induced me to look at the article, until then my attention had not been called to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nearly thirty-six years of age—I have known the defendant from boyhood—my second cousin was at one time his partner, and he was with my uncle previously as servant—Jones and Gann were hosiers and outfitters, in Fenchurch Street, about sis years ago they commenced selling sewing machines in addition—I entered their service in 1874—I was their shop clerk, traveller, and collector, and I called on shippers to sell other goods, besides sewing machines, goods that he used to receive in payment for advertisements and such like—after I was in the service he received consignments of sewing machines from Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co., of Boston, and particularly the sewing machine known as the Dolly Varden—during the latter six months I was there I called on persons in the retail trade buying sewing machines—at that time Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co. had no place of business in London—"The Sewing Machine Chronicle "Was a publication published by the defendant, whilst I was in his service, it was published about three months before I left, it came out once a month, and was circulated amongst the retail sewing machine dealers; I received this letter dated 21st August (Saturday); on the following Monday morning, I found it in the letter-box. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi> "Dear Sir,—Accept this as a week's notice from me on Saturday next, the 28th, that our business con<lb></lb>nection on the present basis will terminate; if you at all see your way to any arrangement on terms that will pay you, and will submit same to me; I will give any such proposal my consideration. If you see any other way let me know how I can serve you and I will gladly do all I can to advance your interests in any direction I can; the only consideration I ask at your hands is that you consider the continuance of our business relations upon the old basis is impossible, but I expect any other proposition to emanate from you; if you have nothing to propose retain my regards and let me know how I can serve you.—Yours truly, Thomas Jones.") I carried the envelope in which that letter came, in my pocket for some time until I think I wore it out; it was destroyed in that way—it was addressed to me as "J. Horlock," up to that time I had been on perfectly friendly terms with Mr. Jones—he had made no complaints whatever in reference to my conduct; I have not had one angry word with him while I was there—I was called Horlock, because as he said the firm of Jones Gann was about being dissolved; it would be awkward, and he proposed that for a short time I should be called Horlock, and I agreed to it—it was understood to be only for two or three months—in consequence of that letter there were negotiations with reference to my remaining in the service of Mr. Jones—I said I was not a weekly servant; I was a monthly servant, and he said "Very well, say a month," and it was during that month that negotiations went on—we had arranged terms satisfactorily, except that I made it part of the arrangement that I should have six months' notice, he would not agree to that, and I said I would not stop, and I left—I left quite on friendly terms, we shook hands, there was nothing between us at all unfriendly, not a word of difference had occurred between us—I left a month from the date of that letter—about the middle of November, the same year; I entered the service of Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co., my salary commenced from 1st November—their place of business in Queen Victoria Street, was opened about the 14th or 15th November—I had nothing whatever to do with the opening of that branch establishment,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605010020"></xptr>
               <p>except that it was arranged before hand that when the premises were opened I was to go there, perhaps three weeks or a month before—before I left Mr. Jones' service there were business relations continuing between him and Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co.—I think they had not delivered machines for two months, or so before I left; I don't say they had said they would not supply any more—he had a contract to take so many a month, and not to supply anybody else in the United Kingdom—he told me that in the course of conversation; I don't know that there was any contract, there was an understanding; I did not learn from him that there was any interruption of the good terms between them—during the sis months that I called on the trade in London and that district, I had a list of all the people to call on; I did not make a special list during the last month for the purpose of using it against him; I compiled a list from the Directory at different times, for the purpose if I went into another sewing machine firm, or they would not employ me; not a list of customers, but a list of persons in that particular trade; they are not numerous, under 1,000 in the United Kingdom, I should think—I saw Mr. Jones once, between leaving his service and going to Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co.; that was at his office; we parted them on good terms; he was complaining to me that somebody had been to his bankers, and said he had not paid his rent—he said he would not insinuate that it was me; he should not like to think such a thing—I saw him afterwards, before the libel was published—that was in Mr. Braunsbeck's office, he came in while I was there; I think that was just about the time that Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co.'s place was opened, or a short time before—he said "How do you do?" that was all—there was no complaint or disagreement at that interview—this paper containing the libel was sent to the office of Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co., on the Monday morning, after the Saturday; 16th January—we never bad a copy sent there before—I con<lb></lb>sulted my solicitor, I think within the next fortnight—I have been insolvent three times, once about 1862 I think, in Scotland, I was then a wine merchant, the creditors took what estate there was, and there was nothing more done, the next occasion was about ten years ago, that was at Croydon; I was there a hosier and had a shipping business in addition—I think the total debts there was something about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., principally family debts, my own relations—I gave up my property to my creditors—on the third occasion I was in business in Mark Lane, as a shipper of bonded stores, wine, spirits, and tobacco, in bond—that was about three years before the smuggling matter—the greater part of my debts then were the old Croydon debts, that I had never paid a composition upon; I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, which was accepted by the majority of my creditors—those were the only occasions—no proceedings were ever instituted against me for any breaches of the bankruptcy law by any of my creditors—the smuggling matter was this, I was supplying ships with bonded stores, we used to ship a great quantity of brandy to America, and now and then we used to have a case landed from the ship and taken to my house for my own use, which the defendant knew, because he used to have a bottle from me occasionally and knew where I got it from; I found it was so simple that instead of letting two cases of cigars go I brought them on shore again, it was found out that they were not shipped and they traced it to me, and one evening they came to my house and arrested me, and I was convicted and fined—the defendant knew all these matters before I entered his service—I was in</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Custom House matter was heard before Mr. Alder<lb></lb>man Phillips, who is now on the Bench—I was fined 248<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; I think the extreme penalty is three times that amount—I was not charged with con<lb></lb>cocting a bond in order to get the cigars; that was not gone into—I don't know that it was necessary to do so and that it was done; it was never attempted to be proved—I decline to answer whether it was done—I did not do it; of course I must have been interested in it—it was most de<lb></lb>cidedly done with my knowledge. (<hi rend="italic">The learned counsel read what purported to be a report of the transaction.</hi>)I did not get the bond, it was got in the ordinary way by taking it out at the Custom House; no representation was made, none was required—it might have appeared on the documents that the goods were going abroad—no doubt they were documents concocted by me—I did wrong, and I have been punished for it; I was in gaol nearly nine months—during that time my family was not supported by the de<lb></lb>fendant; he may have sent something home now and then to the children—my wife was in the City; she would not take a gift herself, she was-not in want—I sold a portion of the cigars to a person in Westminster named Carter—I did not inform against him to the Customs, they found it out themselves; they compelled me to give evidence; they took me up on <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>—I went to Scotland to take the benefit of the Act—I was only twenty-two years old then, and I did foolish things—I no doubt went there to avoid my London creditors; a good deal of it was my own family's matter—I can't say how much I paid, the accountants had so much—I have not, since I left the defendant, abused him and uttered reports prejudicial to his credit to different persons, only in the course of conversation explain<lb></lb>ing matters, not for the purpose of injuring him—I have not stated to cus<lb></lb>tomers that he would soon be done up; to the best of my belief I have not; I can't recollect saying so; I should not like to injure him by saying so—I have not said so to persons from whom I have solicited orders for my pre<lb></lb>sent employers; I don't recollect doing so—I never went to his books to take the names of his customers—I obtained a few addresses from an ad<lb></lb>dress-book, no doubt belonging to my employer—I did not obtain from that book the names and addresses of his customers, I obtained the names of persons in the sewing machine trade—it was not taken from a private book, it was a book lying about the counter anywhere, a common address-book that he would refer to for sending out circulars—I took those names and addresses for the purpose if I went-to anybody else in the trade, a list of persons to call on—I did not think there was any harm in that—no house would take me as a traveller unless I got names of persons to call on—I did not take from the address-book the names and addresses of my master's-' customers; probably they might be his customers, because they were sewing machine dealers—you could not refer to a list of persons in the trade with<lb></lb>out their being his customers—no doubt I have called upon some of those customers since I have been in my present employment—I could not help doing so, calling on the trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

Mr. Gann's commission might be both upon obtaining advertisements and the sale of sewing machines, but that would only relate to a few customers in the City of London—he had no business outside—he was in the habit of signing his name "J. Horlock"—I think he also had a commission for what he could sell amongst merchants and shippers of other goods that Mr. Jones dealt in, but all within the radius—Mr. Jones mostly paid the money to Mrs. Gann—I have seen him pay her money.</p>

I am a sewing machine merchant of 66, Jackson's Road, Holloway—I know Mr. Gann or Horlock by dealing with Mr. Jones when he was in his employ, not in any other way—he called on me one day after he had left, soliciting orders for Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co.—I have not dealt with them—I have bought goods of Thomas Jones and Co., and which, I believe, came through that company, but I am not certain—</p>

               <p>Horlock did not tell me how he camo to leave Jones, but he said he could sell me some sewing machines called the Dolly Varden, and asked me if I wanted any; I said I did not at present; I asked him the price he could sell them at, he said 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I never paid more than 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he said "Well, you will not be able to get them any more, because Johnson, Clark, and Co. have taken them away from Mr. Jones—I said I believed Mr. Jones was making some others—he said "Oh, they are entirely rotten, they are no use at all, in fact, the firm—won't last long, it will soon be broken up—I said "It is very strange that you travellers in general turn round upon a good master and run down his goods, it seems a regular system of yours."</p>

I am an auctioneer at Ashford and deal in sewing machines I also sell furnishing ironmongery—I know the prosecutor by his calling on me and soliciting orders at the latter end of 1875—I was then a customer of the defendant's—he asked me in the first instance whether Mr. Marriage had been—I said "No, but I expect him"—he said that he had heard he had started to come to Ashford—a long conversation ensued, in the course of which he told me that I should not be able to get any more of the Dolly Varden machines from Mr. Jones, that they had only a few on the premises, and Johnson, Clark, and Co. bad refused to supply them any more, or something to that effect—he said several things that were prejudicial to Mr. Jones—I cannot recollect the exact words—he said the reason-Johnson, Clark, &amp; Co. would not supply them with any more machines was because he had let some of his bills go back, and that they were obliged very often to add up their banking account on both sides to see which way their bills were and they could not last long; it was merely a matter of time—he solicited orders for Johnson, Clark, and Co., and I gave him orders.,</p>

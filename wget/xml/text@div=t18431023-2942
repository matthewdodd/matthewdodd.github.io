                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Grafton-street, London Uni<lb></lb>versity. On Monday, the 14th of Aug., I had arranged my shop, and I left it perfectly safe, about twenty minutes before one o'clock—the outer door stands open—there is an inner door leading to the shop, and another leading to the dwelling-house, which opens with a latch key—I left all safe, and was sent for in forty or fifty minutes—I examined my shop, and missed a vast quan<lb></lb>tity of articles—broadcloth of different colours, invisible green, and brown, two almost whole pieces of doe-skin, and some velvet, both black and olive—I saw a portion of them on the 16th of Sept., in the house of the prisoner Morley, at No. 36, Dean-street—I went there in consequence of information—I did not know it was Morley's house, but merely seeing his name up—I found a piece of invisible green cloth, and some doe-skin, that I can identify—here is this small remnant of doe-skin, and this other piece, which I can prove, under very particular circumstances—in cutting out I had two very awkward remnants, and these are them—these other pieces I have examined, and can undertake to swear to them all—I had left them all in my shop that day—I am not able to tell how my shop bad been entered—I found the door fast, but my wife had found it open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Sussex-street, London Uni<lb></lb>versity, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor. On the 14th of Aug. I had just had dinner—the window was up, and I was looking out—I saw a man come along the street with a quantity of cloth, without any covering or wrapper on it—another man came just after with a quantity of cloth, and apparently some velvet or satin—I could not tell which—they came as from the direction of the prosecutor's house, from the corner of the street—one of them crossed the street under my window—one went on one side the way, and the other on the other—Fellows was the last man that came with the cloth—I saw him sufficently well to know his person—he was facing me, and I thought he was some tailor moving—I watched him all down the street—I had a better opportunity of seeing his face, as the satin or velvet that he had was rather slippery—it slipped, and whether he tried to get it on with his hat I do not know, but his hat slipped on one side—I can say conscienti<lb></lb>ously that he was one of the men—the other man I cannot identify.</p>

I live opposite Mr. Dykes, and have a full command of Mr. Dykes' door—on the 14th of August, I saw two men two doors from Mr. Dykes—my attention was called by seeing them make a stop—they divided, and one of them went into Mr. Dykes's lobby, and returned immediately—he came to the other man, and they walked off—I saw no more of them—I could not swear to their features; but from what observation I made through the white curtain at the window, Fellows resembles the man I saw go into Mr. Dykes's—I was shaving at the time.</p>

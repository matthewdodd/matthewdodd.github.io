                  </hi>. I am a captain in the army, and am barrack-master of St. James's. I have the superintendence of the Wellington barracks—Sir Rufane Shawe Donkin, Knt., James Whitley Deans Dundas, Esq., and the Hon. George Anson, are the board officers—the prisoner, Knight, was superior barrack-serjeant—there were ordinary barrack-sergeants under him, of whom Allcock was one—on the 1st of July a contract was made with Messrs. Cory for coals—it was my practice to send a written order to the contractors for coals which were wanted for the public service—I allowed no one to apply to the contractor without my written order, which was the contractor's authority to supply the quantity there stated—it was Knight's duty to see that the quantity ordered was properly delivered—Allcock assist<lb></lb>ed, if he had no other duty—there was no necessity for more than one—Knight might receive and check the quantity himself, or desire Allcock to do it, or if Allcock was doing it, Knight might send him away and do it himself—this is the order which I sent to Messrs. Cory, on the 11th of July——(<hi rend="italic">The order was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th July, desiring Messrs. Cory to send, on the</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th, to the Wellington barracks twenty-four tons of coals, for the</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd battalion of Grenadier Guards, and twelve tons to go into the barrack-masters store</hi>)—it would be the duty of Knight or Allcock, whichever attended to the receipt of the coals, to receive the tickets sent with them, to see that the quantity mentioned in the tickets was received, and to file the tickets in my office—the account is made up quarterly from the tickets, and I give a certificate for the quantity so certified as having been re<lb></lb>ceived—these tickets (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>) refer to that order of the 15th July—I keep a double entry of these things, one in a private book and the other in a public book, in which entries are made by Knight in the office—that entry—(<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—represents the coals ordered on the 15th to amount to twenty-four tons, received for the use of 3rd battalion of Grenadier Guards, and twelve tons as received into my store.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140011"></xptr>
               <p>—I told Allcock that he was to superintend the delivery of coals from the commencement of July—I gave him a written order to that effect—I told him he was to be present at the receipt of all coals, candles, wood, and straw, commencing on the 1st of July—that was to enable Knight to attend more to my books—he had before that occasionally attended to the delivery of coals, not always—if Allcock was otherwise engaged, he might attend—if Allcock could attend Knight need not be present, but he could send Allcock away to any other duty, and attend himself—one or the other must see them delivered—I have been barrack-master at the Wellington barracks about four years and a half, and have known Knight during that time—he always gave me every satisfaction before—I had no fault to find with him—he was there before me—we occasionally take stock of what remains in the barrack-master's store—no deficiency has ever been dis<lb></lb>covered—there has sometimes been a surplus in some trifling articles.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am in partnership with my father, as coal-merchants, and carry on business at Barge-house Wharf, Lambeth. On the 11th of July Allcock came to me with this order for twenty-four and twelve tons of coals, at 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton—he came into the counting-house, closed the door, and said that a saving could be effected; that, instead of twenty-four tons, we need only send twenty, and instead of twelve, eight; but that we should send the tickets for the twenty-four and the twelve tons, and that receipts would be given us for those quantities—our suspi<lb></lb>cions had been excited before this, and I was instructed by my father, in case a proposal of this sort was made, to dissemble my feelings, that we might expose them—I therefore told Allcock that he must see my father—he said nothing further to me about money—I said as little to him as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Cory. I was on the premises on the 13th of July—Knight and Allcock came there together, and asked for Mr. Cory the elder—I told them he was at the market—Allcock said, in Knight's presence, that there were coals to go to the Wellington Bar<lb></lb>racks, that they should not want so many as were ordered, and he asked me if I thought Mr. Cory would give them the money for the coals that they did not want—I said I thought he would not—Allcock said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton was what they expected—they were there about a quarter of an hour—Allcock said he was barrack-sergeant, and Knight was his superior, and that it was usual for other contractors to do so—I referred them to Mr. Cory, and said he would be back by half-past four o'clock—they waited till he came—I did not hear what passed between them—I afterwards received instructions from Mr. Cory how to act, and next afternoon Allcock came to the counting-house, and took two tickets from me for four tons each—Mr. Cory had told me he was coming for them, and to give them to him—Allcock told me he had come for the tickets—the delivery took place on the 15th—twenty tons were sent for the troops, and eight tons for the barrack-master's store, and I sent tickets corresponding with that quantity—in the afternoon, after the delivery, the prisoners came to the counting-house both together—Knight said he had come to give the</p>

               <p>receipt for the coals—I took a piece of paper and wrote a receipt, which he signed in my presence—this is it—Allcock said nothing—he stood by—(<hi rend="italic">this receipt was signed, "James Knight, superior barrack-sergeant" and acknowledged the delivery of twenty-four and twelve tons of coals</hi>)—after Knight had signed it, they still waited about, and did not seem disposed to go—I asked them if they expected the money—they both said, "Yes"—I said I thought it would be time enough to pay them when we received the money—they said they had given the receipt, and every thing would be right—I still declined to pay them, and said I must consult Mr. Cory before I could do so; upon which, Knight said Allcock should come over next day—they then went—next day Allcock came, and I then paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in doing that, and every thing else, I acted under Mr. Cory's directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this the first contract Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a partner with my son. We had the contract in question—on the afternoon of the 13th of July Allcock called on me, and said he was aware that contracts were taken at a low price, and therefore it would, no doubt, be acceptable to us to make a saving—he then stated that he had brought two orders, one for twenty-four, the other, for twelve tons, and out of those two a saving could be effected of four tons on each, and they should expect an allowance for the coals not delivered—he did say who he meant by <hi rend="italic">they</hi>—he said former contractors had done the same thing—I told him I must take time to consider of it, and he might see me next day—I had suspicions, and appeared to humor the thing—I felt I had no other course to pursue, as an honest man—I had had no commu<lb></lb>nication with Government about it at that time—he seemed alarmed, and said he hoped, if I did not consent, that I would not expose him—Mr. Hawes, M. P. for Lambeth, lives next door to me—I went to him, and communicated what had passed—I had appointed for Allcock to come next afternoon, which he did, and I consented to his proposition—I stated that I thought he wanted a very large proportion of the benefit arising from it—he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—he observed, "Oh, but you save the cartage on the coals you don't deliver," which had never occurred to me, and I thought it very ingenious of him—the cartage would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I think that was all that passed—I let the coals be delivered according to their desire—I was authorized to do so, and I gave instruc<lb></lb>tions to Mr. Park how to act.</p>

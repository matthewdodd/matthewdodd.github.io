            . I live at No. 4, Brunswick-street, very nearly opposite the prosecutor's. On Sunday evening, the 31st of October, I happened to be at the window, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw several people about Dawes' premises - it was bright moon-light; I afterwards thought I saw a light in the top front room - I thought it was a dark lantern, as it moved about in different directions, and seeing the reflection of it on the walls like a sun, I came out of my house, went, and alarmed Mr. Ball, my neighbour; we both came out with Penn, a lodger of his - when we came out, I saw the prisoner open Dawes' door, and come out; he walked on about two doors, and Ball spoke to him - he was walking on then; Ball said,"Halloo! Stop! who are you?" he immediately set off running - I pursued him with Ball, and we were in the road even with him, but about three yards off him; he turned round Cambridge - street - three persons attempted to stop him there - he turned back and said to us, "Have you got him?" I said No; I laid hold of him and said, "Now we have;" he had not been out of my sight one minute - we took him; he then took something in his hand and flung it over the wall in Little Cambridge-street, into the gardens of Wevmouth - terrance - we gave him in charge of Herrington, the Policeman; we took him back to the house, and left him in charge of several people; some stopped in the shop below, and some went up to view the premises - I did not go up; the door was ajar - it shuts with a spring lock- the premises below did not appear at all in disorder - I left him in the shop, and went to find another constable; I am sure he is the man who came out of Mr. Dawes' house, and I took him; I never lost sight of him during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You seem very positive? A. I am so; I had never seen him before, to my recollection - I might be twelve or fourteen yards from the house; it was very moon-light - I believe the moon was full: I have always said I was sure he was the moon, and that I never lost sight of him - he was apprehended about fifty or sixty yards from the house; he had only made one turning -Dawes lives in Brunswick-street; he was taken in Little Cambridge-street, which runs across Brunswick-street - when he turned the corner I was on a level with him, sideways: I was in the road, and he on the payement; I am positive I never lost sight of him - I went with the Policeman to the gardens the same evening; I had seen the movement of his hand, as if something was flung, but saw nothing go from his hand - we could find nothing; we looked next day, and found about an inch and a half of candle - I did not state this to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked before the Magistrate if any thing was found, and did you not say you could find nothing? A. I did not say so - he was searched immediately on his apprehension; he could not open the door with a piece of candle.</p>

            . On the evening of the 31st of October I was called by Rawle, went across the road, and saw Dawes' door open, and the prisoner come out; I hallooed out, "Halloo, stop! who are you?" he mumbled something, walked about two doors rather sharply, and then took to running; I pursued, and never lost sight of him - I took him into the custody; the evidence of the last witness is perfectly correct - I went into the house, and found every thing in confusign up stairs, the drawers open, and the contents scattered and rumpled about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You swear you have no doubt of his person? A. Not the least - I did not observe any body else running at that time: the street appeared very clear at that moment - the prisoner turned back towards us, and said, "Have you got him?" I had been in doors all the evening, and had not observed whether it was a dark evening; there was a good light in the street.</p>

            . I came out with Ball - two well dressed men, apparently, attempted to stop me as I came out of the door; one of them immediately called out loudly, "Do you see him? Do you see him?" instantly pulled out his watch, and went towards Dawes'house; I said, "That is a signal - look to Dawes' door;" I immediately went towards the door, and the prisoner came out - Ball said, "Who are you? and what are you?" the man directly took to his heels, and turned short round Little Cambridge-street, running - he immediately after turned round, and came towards me, saying, "Have you got him?" Yes (said I) d-n me, I think we have;" directly he saw I was going to take him, he turned again; three persons in Weymouth-terrace put their hands out - he turned again, and we secured him; I lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

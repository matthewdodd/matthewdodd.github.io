             thus depos'd. In Lincolz's Inn Fields about 3 in the Afternoon; the Prisoner and one John Cooms, pray'd me to change half a Crown, which I laid I could not, they follow'd me thro' Russel street, into <placeName id="t17260302-25-crimeloc106">Charles-street</placeName>

Cooms made off, but I knockt the Prisoner down, he presently got up again, and run into the Bear Inn, in Drury-Lane, and there I took him. He desir'd me to be easie, and he'd procure me the Watch again; upon which he sent a Porter to Turnbull-street. When the Porter return'd, the Prisoner told me at first, that the Watch could not be had, but afterwards said, that if I'd be favourable he'd help me to it, and accordingly pull'd it out of his Pocket. <rs id="t17260302-25-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

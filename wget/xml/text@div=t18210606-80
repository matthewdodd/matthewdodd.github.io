            . I am a tailor, and live in Still-alley, Houndsditch. I saw the prosecutrix - her bundle was then gone. I had a heavy load on my shoulder. She complained of being robbed of a bundle; the man was then gone up the court; I did not pursue. I had seen the prisoner pass me directly before that at the corner of Fire-ball-court, with a bundle. I knew him well before, and am certain of him. I went home, and next morning informed the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running - A. Yes; rather swiftly. I knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>DAVID M'COMBIE. I am an officer. On the evening of the 4th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I was on duty in Houndsditch, and was informed the prosecutrix had been robbed. I went up, and found her quite exhausted. Fire-ball-court is a dangerous place to pursue in. On the 2d of June I was in Castle-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! towards Bury-street - the prisoner came running towards me, he jumped aside, and was stopped close by Fire-ball-court.</p>

            . On the 27th of July, the day of the execution of De la Motte, about one in the afternoon, when I came home, my shopman was shewing some lace to the prisoner. She bought some. Several other people were in the shop at the same time. As she was going out, the shopman came and told me he suspected her. I desired the shopman to follow her, and I ran to the door. I saw her a few yards off, looking over her shoulder. My shopman took hold of both her arms, and turned her round suddenly: then I saw her open her cloak, and take a card of lace from under her arm, and offer to give it to the shopman. She held me round the waist, and would not let me go, for five minutes, declaring it was her first offence, and she would pay me any amount for the lace. I had her searched, and there was nothing else found upon her. As she was carrying away in a coach, some persons rescued her. She was afterwards retaken. After she was retaken, I told her, if she cried out again, so as to have assistance to rescue her, I would prosecute her with the utmost rigour, and hang her. I know the lace to be my property.</p>

               <p>When I went into Mr. Thompson's shop, I bought two yards of lace, which came to 7 s. at 3 s. a yard. After that, the shopman pulled out some cards, and shewed me three. I bought one to the amount of 4 s. a yard. He gave me change for the first lace, but had not given me the change of the other guinea. I had eight guineas in my pocket. He came out and scandalized me, and said I took the lace. I had a bill of parcels of the next shop, where I laid out 12 l.</p>

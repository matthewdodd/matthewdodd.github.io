There were several persons drinking there. When I went out, three persons followed me-the prisoner, Scott, was one of them. As soon as I got a few yards from the house, he took hold of me by the side, and took my money out of my pocket, which I tried to prevent; he laid hold of me behind, and put his arm round me-Chapman was also about me. He felt me, to try if I had a watch, or any thing of that kind, and then struck me a blow between my eyes, which knocked me down. I immediately called out,"Watch! I am robbed!" The patrol came up: I thought they had got my hat also, but that was on the ground. When I came to the door, I found Scott in the custody of the patrol. We all went back again into the house, Chapman was sitting there. I am sure both the prisoners were the persons who robbed me - They had been forcing their conversation on me before in the house. They took from me half a sovereign, a 3s. piece, one shilling, a sixpence, and three halfpence; I was perfectly sober, and had drank only two pints of porter and some tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was not in any bad company that night. I do not know two girls of the town of the names of Fortica and Richards-there were women of the town in the room; one of them came to me, and asked me for sixpence to buy a quartern of gin; I asked her why she supposed I should give it her? - I at last gave her sixpence, they then brought the quartern of gin to me, and wanted me to drink, but I would not. The blow that was given me was after I lost my purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I always swore that Chapman was one; he was taken from the public-house. Scott was taken to the watch-house first.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Seven Star-court on the night of the robbery, crying the hour of one, and heard the captain cry out that he was robbed, at the same time, the prisoner, Scott, and another man, ran against me. I called out to the patrol, "I believe the thieves are gone up Seven Star-court." I had seen Scott about the neighbourhood, and am sure he is one of the men who ran by me. I had heard something like a blow, but could not make out what it was until I heard the captain cry out he was robbed. I saw the captain on the ground, and pursued the thieves - I saw him again in about ten minutes; Scott made a little round, and came back again into Seven Star-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I went to the watch-house with him when he was taken-Chapman did not go with him the first time, but we came back for him. The captain was sober.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 13th of December Tarson told me of the robbery; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140014"></xptr>went through Seven Star-court and stopped Scott - He was running, and another man passed by me just as I stopped Scott - A stout man with a dark dress on; I cannot say I should know the man. We went to the Seven Stars, public-house. I took him there, and found the captain outside the door; he was making for the door, I believe. The prosecutor swore to Scott directly as the man who robbed him. The captain's nose was bleeding, he had received a blow between the eyes. He pointed to Chapman, who was in the house, as the other man - He was sitting down. He did that before Scott was taken to the watch-house - I did not take Chapman at that time. The landlord said he would be answerable for the appearance of Chapman for 50l. When Scott was in the watch-house, he seemed grieved because Chapman was not brought with him; we then went back and fetched Chapman. A man of the name of Burt gave in a canvas purse, containing the money in question. The captain did not appear to be in liquor, he was confused from the blow, A woman came, who used to cohabit with Scott; I have seen her with him.</p>

            . I was in company with Simmonds that night, when he laid hold of Scott. I found the purse in Seven Star-court, with the money in it. The captain said he believed Chapman was another one; that was before we took Scott to the watch-house. The captain's nose was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Chapman was sitting down smoking his pipe - We went away, and left him there. There was a shortish man run by us when we were taking Scott - He run back to the public-house by the back-way-there is a back-way. I did not see any women running at the time Scott was laid hold of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SCOTT. Q. Was I not running towards the public-house when you stopped me - A. He was running towards the Seven Stars public-house; but there are many turnings, and he had been all round.</p>
               <p>SCOTT'S Defence. I was running up the court facing the house, and was stopped by the patrol, but know nothing of the robbery. It is not likely that if I had done the robbery. I should be going towards where it was done.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. Scott was brought in first, by the patrol and the watchman, and the prosecutor came in with them. The patrol said that there was another at the public-house, but that the publican was answerable for him - I told him that could not be, as it was a highway robbery. Accordingly, I went down, and brought him up. When Chapman was produced, the prosecutor said he could not take upon himself to swear to him, but, to the best of his belief, he was one of them.</p>

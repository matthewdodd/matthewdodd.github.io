                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 352). On 3rd March, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Foley watching in the middle of Cobb's-court, Ludgate-hill—I went up the court and saw Taylor and the prosecutor in a corner of the court, about three yards off Foley—I followed them all three out of that court—Taylor laid hold of Plume's arm, and Foley walked behind them—I caught hold of Taylor, and asked Plume whether he Had been robbed—both the prisoners were near enough to hear—he said he had not—I got Taylor away from him, and she immediately followed him again—I afterwards received this purse from I son (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ireland-yard. Between 1 and 2 o'clock I was going home through Broadway, and met the two prisoners near St. Martin's-court—they wished me to go with them, and walked through Cobb's-court, and it seems I lost my purse—I had had it safe at half-past 12, and I had met with no other persons but them—it was in my right hand trowsers pocket, and contained five shillings, a half-crown, and fourpence—I missed it in Shoemaker-row, not many minutes after I had left Cobb's-court—this is it—Taylor had been feeling me about—the policeman came and took them both into custody.</p>

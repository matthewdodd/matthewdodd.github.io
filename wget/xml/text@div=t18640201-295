                  </hi>. I am the widow of John Seers, and live at 6, Pleasant-row, Essex-street, Southwark—my brother, William M'Donald, was a labourer in the Borough-market—he had been earning his living that way on New Year's Day—I took a walk that day with my sister to see the new street which was opened, leading from London-bridge to Stamford-street—we went into the Southwark Arms tavern about 8 o'clock, and saw my brother there, and the prisoner—the prisoner put his arms round my sister's waist—my brother said, "Don't you take liberties with her, because she is a married woman"—the prisoner said, "You b——<hi rend="italic">hoppy</hi>, I will give it you before the night is out"—I took my brother out, and my sister and I went home—I went round again between 10 and 11 o'clock, to get my brother to come home to his supper—I said, "It is very cold"—he said, "What will you have to drink?"—I said, "A little drop of gin and water"—he called for it, and I drank it—while I was drinking it my brother went out of the house—I went out to look after him, and found him insensible upon the ground—he never spoke to me afterwards—I saw the prisoner in the place the second time, but not a word was said by him to my brother—my brother was found to be dead, and was carried home—he used to support me and my four children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 4, Star-court, Mint-street, Borough—on 1st January, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was standing at the corner of the new street, opposite the Southwark Arms tavern, and heard a female call out, "Don't kill my brother, he is a cripple"—I went over to the place, and saw my brother fighting with the deceased, whom I knew by sight, but not personally—they were having a regular fight, and the prisoner knocked the deceased down—I saw them both come out; the prisoner hit the deceased first, and he fell down by the force of the blow—it was under the ear—I picked him up, and seated him against a door-post—the prisoner hit him twice on the mouth before he fell—while he was leaning up against the window I held him up, and the prisoner came and hit him again, and made a kick at him, and then went round the corner—it was not I who told him that the deceased was a cripple—I picked him up and found he was dead—the prisoner ran towards the Borough-market—the prisoner kicked him violently when he was down, towards the chest, and it was a very forcible blow that he struck him on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith's hammerman, of 9, Queen Charlotte-street, Bankside, Southwark—I knew the deceased, William M'Donald—on 1st January I went into the new tavern, the Southwark Arms, at the corner of the new street—I saw the deceased there—I called for a pint of beer, and asked him to drink out of it, which he did—the prisoner came in shortly afterwards, and they began to fall out about a half-crown that M'Donald had had given him for a Christmas-box—I finished my beer and walked out through the bar—I afterwards had half a quartern of gin and some water, and then went back—I returned in twenty minutes, and they were still fall<lb></lb>ing out—I said to the landlady, "I am not accustomed to be where there is wrangling," and as I was going out the deceased's two sisters came in—I went to the side bar and heard them wrangling, but could not see them—I saw the barman jump over the bar and attempt to put the prisoner out, but there was no fighting then, because I went outside—I went in and came out again, and found them lying in the passage of the side bar fighting, some<lb></lb>times one was uppermost and sometimes the other—I did not see who began it; they left off when I parted them, and went into the house again—I could not see who was the most violent—I had a pint of beer and a pipe—I went out—the place was all clear then; there was nobody there—I do not know whether the occurrence had taken place then or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 54, Union-street, Southwark—on Saturday morning, 2nd January, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was called to 6, Pleasant-place, Essex-street, and found McDonald perfectly dead—I opened his body the same evening; the chest was perfectly healthy, but there were nine bruises on it outwardly—I do not know how blows could have made them, as it was on the part protected by the arm—I can only account for them by kicks—there was an abrasion of the cuticle on the right elbow and left knee, all the viscera were perfectly healthy—the face was very much bruised, the left eye was very much swollen, and the right very livid—on</p>

               <p>opening the scalp the vessels behind each ear were congested with black blood, which I attribute either to a blow or some such violence—a blow would undoubtedly have caused it—it must have been by the fist or some blunt instrument—I cannot say that it would be likely to be occasioned by a fall, because there would have been more abrasions and cuts—the brain was perfectly healthy; there was no lesion and ho effusion, but the vessels at its base were very much congested with black blood—it is undoubtedly my opinion that death was not produced by natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Looking at the state of the brain and scalp exter<lb></lb>nally, is it not consistent with your experience that he might have fallen on the kerb or some hard stony substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Falling on some blunt instru<lb></lb>ment, such a thing is possible—I cannot for a moment conceive that a man's skull falling on a hard granite kerb would be sufficient to cause the appear<lb></lb>ances I saw, because you would have had it on the upper part of the head and not in the soft part of the neck—nothing would hinder a man falling on the soft part of the neck, but it would not produce such an effect—if he fell from intoxication heavily on the kerb, it is possible, but very improbable that it would have produced that injury—I have seen many blows, but I never saw an abrased skin on the chest from a fist—I have never examined a man after a prize fight—death was due to the injuries at the base of the brain—there was no extravasated blood on the brain; it was a congested state of the vessels.</p>

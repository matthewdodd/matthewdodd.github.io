He was entrusted with the keys of the shop, and coal storeroom, in which was a quantity of copper and iron tubes, about which a dispute had arisen, and they were put there till it was determined - he had no business to move them. In consequence of something I and Maggs watched the premises. On the 10th of February, as the watchman was going past four o'clock, the prisoner entered the premises with a candle in his hand, went into the shop, and unlocked the door. I entered the manufactory. I could hear him filling a hamper with coals, which he brought out, and went to the passage door - we could see him go home; he returned in a few minutes, and from a different place in the yard collected a vast quantity of iron in heaps, took one lot of it, and went off the premises with it. We then went to the bottom of the stairs - he came and took another load in his leather apron, and we seized him with it as he was going out at the door; we gave him in charge. He had about 50 lbs. of iron then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When did he usually go to work - A. At two, three, or four o'clock - he was late this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not ordered him to come early to make some gun barrel pliers - A. Yes; but he would not want such iron as this to make them. He did not light a fire that morning. I never stopped his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not put one Harris in gaol for stealing iron - A. I told my master about him.</p>

I was watching with Green, and saw the prisoner come on the premises at four o'clock in the morning; he took some coals out of the shop into the street, then returned, and took a bundle of iron from the yard into the street, came back again, and took a second quantity - Green stopped him in the passage with it, called me down, and gave him in charge of the watchman.</p>

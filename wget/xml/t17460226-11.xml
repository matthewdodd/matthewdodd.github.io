When we came to search her, there was nothing but a Cap found, but by farther Search we found two Pillowbears and a Towel.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Roberts. There were a pair of Ear-Rings lost. My Master keeps six or seven Servants. I desir'd my Mistress to search their Boxes and Trunks. Accordingly we all went up Stairs together. But there was nothing to be found of the Ear-Rings. I told my Mistress as nothing could be found here, I begg'd we might all be search'd in the Room. I first turn'd out my Pockets; then the House Maid, then the Cook and another Servant or two; then we came to the Prisoner at the Bar. She refus'd. My Master had his Child by, a Youth. What is the Reason you won't search your Box. Then she turn'd her Gown a little on one Side, and the first Thing my Master saw was these two Pillowbears, the next was a Towel, and this Handkerchief, in which were five Candles conceal'd: And my Master was angry with her for concealing these Things. And the Justice, when we went before him, ask'd her what Reason she had to keep these Things in her Pocket. She answer'd, to keep them clean. Five or six Candles in them, fine Things to keep them clean indeed!</p>
               <p>The Prisoner had little to say for herself.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Mulcaster, pawnbroker, in Chandler's-street, (produces a table cloth;) I took it in on the 23d of August, of a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the har; she said, she pledged it for her mother or sister, I cannot say which, I did not know her before, it was a shortish young person.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your only reason for believing it to be the prisoner? - A. Yes, I cannot swear positively to her person; I lent her seven shillings and sixpence upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that duplicate? - A. This is the duplicate that was given upon the pledging of the table cloth.(The property was identified by Mr. Doratt, and his mother.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Doratt. The man prisoner has lived with me since Christmas; the other prisoner, from respect to my father, with whom she had lived, and from charity to her, I took her into my service upon his death.</p>
               <p>Allamby's defence. The pin was given me two months ago by this young woman, and the table cloth was left in my box by mistake; the duplicate I don't know any thing of, my box has been left open many times.</p>
               <p>Prosser's defence. Mrs. Doratt told me, in removing from one house to the other, if there was any thing in the litter worth my acceptance, I might take it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Allamby called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

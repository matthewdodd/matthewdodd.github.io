                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of the Metropolitan police, and am now employed under the Mint authorities—on Wednesday afternoon, 15th January, I went to No. 5, Wilson's-place, Flower-and-Dean-street, Spital-fields, accompanied by Inspector Fife and other officers, seven in number—as me went there, I noticed a blind on the second floor drawn aside, and a face there, which I believed to be a female's—the house consists of three floors, one room on each floor—we went round to the back door, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded up stairs to the second floor, forced the door open, and saw the prisoners sitting in their shirt sleeves by a clear bright fire—I heard some<lb></lb>thing drop, as if thrown down with some force, and saw Barratt stamping on what turned out to be the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould for making half-crowns—I produce the pieces—I pushed him back, and he fell partly into a chair, but clung to the fireplace, and kicked me with both feet—he was seized by Inspector Broad, and a desperate scuffle ensued while they were on the ground—Gouldbourne was sitting at the table; he seized and upset a jar which contained solution and ten counterfeit half-crowns, and in the jar I found another half-crown—they were undergoing the process of electro-plating—Gouldbourne tried to push the table between me and Bow-man to prevent my getting to him—the jar fell on the ground, but did not break—there was a little acid left in it, which I produce—he was secured after using every possible means to prevent my getting at Barratt—on the table I found a file, with white metal in its teeth, as if recently used, and by the fireplace I found a ladle with white metal in it warm, almost hot—I found on the shelf another jar containing acid, some plaster of Paris in the powder, another file, and all the necessary implements for making and colouring counterfeit coin—I said to Barratt that I received instructions from authorities to look after him for coining—he said, "You have got all there is; if you search till this time to-morrow, you will find no more; it is a b——shame to take the old woman, she is innocent"—that was the woman who was sitting at the window—she was charged, remanded, and discharged—I believe the prosecution was withdrawn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, H</hi>). I went with Mr. Brannan, and saw Barratt stamping, and in a stooping position by the fireplace, as if treading upon something which he broke to pieces—I found four half-crowns in the chair which Gouldbourne was sitting in; after he was shoved over by Mr. Brennan—they were secured, and I handcuffed them both together, but before that I heard something fall from one of them, and saw this open pocket-knife picked up by Inspector Bryant</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to Her Majesty's Mint—these are fragments of the obverse and reverse sides of a Victoria half-crown of 1849—I have been enabled to put them together by collecting the small fragments, and on the obverse side I find certain marks which are conveyed on to these counterfeit half-crowns, produced on the coin itself thereby proving that these half-crowns are all cast in that mould—it breaks with the greatest ease, whether a man has slippers on or not—the solution in this</p>

What could we two little men do against seven, and one of them with a sledge-hammer, and another with a stick loaded with lead? I did not upset the solution. Mr. Brennan was unmanly enough, when we were handcuffed together, to punch Mr. Barratt on the side of the face. I had not been in the room halt an hour.</p>

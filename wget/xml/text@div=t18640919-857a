I live at 6, Farmer's-folly—on 10th September, about half-past 2, the prisoner went into the house with me; the last witness was there then—the prisoner asked me if I was engaged—I said, "No," and he followed me into the kitchen—I asked him if he had any money—he said, "No"—I then said, "You must go out if you have not got any money; I am not going to sleep with you"—he refused to go, and I called Lizzie, and she asked him to go out—he said he would not go, and then he followed her and struck her with a knife—I did not see him strike her the first time—I heard her cry out, "He has stabbed me," and he said, "Yes, I have, and I will do it again"—he was going to strike her again, and he caught me in the arm with the point of the knife.</p>

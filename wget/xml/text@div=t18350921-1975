The prisoner was in my employ—I had dealings with the last withness and his partmers—on the 8th of June I sent the prisoner to him for two silver French watches—he brought back two of that description—I sold the four-guinea one, and returned the other by Pool on the following morning, but did not send him for any other—I did not receive any other watch by the prisoner from Mr. Stauffer—I never heard from the prisoner any thing respecting that watch—I should not have known it, had I not sent my man down to know if they kept a large musical box of mine—I know nothing whatever of any third silver watch.</p>

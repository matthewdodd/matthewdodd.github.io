I am a surgeon, and live at 87, Newington Park Road—on 24th October, in the evening, I was fetched by a policeman—I went to Penton Place and there found a man lying on the path; he was in an unconscious state; he was lying slightly on his right side, more on his back, in the roadway—I bad some brandy fetched, but he was unable to swallow it; he died in a few minutes—I made a superficial examination then; afterwards I made a more careful one, on Thursday, 26th—at the mortuary I extracted a bullet which I gave to Sergeant Underwood at his request—there were noticed on the surface of the body seven wounds; the first was a contused wound over the left eyebrow, that extended to the bone; the second was a graze over the bridge of the nose, I took those wounds to be caused by the fall, they were front wounds; the third wound was a circular one, one-third of an inch in diameter at the back of the neck, about 4 inches below the base of the skull, it was a punched out wound, slightly lacerated—I should judge that was produced by a bullet, I am speaking of the wound where the bullet went in, it was a little to the right of the middle</p>

               <p>The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows:—" My intention was to call witnesses, but as I have no means of paying witnesses, I had better reserve my defence. My intention was to make as statement which was the outline of my defence, but as I have no witnesses to prove it, I shall adjourn it. I have no confession to make, because I made a confession at first, and I repeated it in this Court. I intended to give the outline of my defence if I had the power to call witnesses to prove it. Why I applied to the Russian Consul was through the Russian press to take notice of my case, on account of my relatives. I have witnesses, but I am like a sheep tied ready for slaughter, and am only surprised at so much interest having been taken in the case, having given myself up to justice, but I suppose there must be some black patches in the case."</p>

I am a saddler and harness maker, and live at 3, Blandford Street, Manchester Square—I occupied half of the shop with the prisoner at one time; he occupied the other half since last Christ<lb></lb>mas till the time of the murder—I have noticed that at times he was. very strange in his manner; sometimes he was very desponding, at other times very violent—I have seen him standing outside his shop on many occasions in a sort of mute state, and if persons spoke to him he did not answer them; he would stand outside in a sort of desponding state, and when persons spoke to him he did not seem to notice them, and they would walk away; and at other times he would walk in and bang the door in their face—I have known him leave business many times in the middle of the day and not come back; he would sometimes shut up his portion of the shop all day—he has sometimes almost insulted his customers, and he has complained of his business being so bad—he was almost under my sight all day—I have not known him to remain all day without food—I have known him to be asleep in his chair when people have entered his shop, or appear to be asleep; he has not noticed them—he slept in the shop in a chair. bedstead—he frequently used the same coffee-house that I did, and I have seen him sit with the newspaper before him, upside down, for half an hour, with his head on his hands—he once remarked to me that there was nothing left for him but the water, or something to that effect—that was about six weeks or two months ago, or perhaps a little longer—on one occasion I saw him walking up and down the shop rather in a desponding state, and I think he went upstairs and down stairs and turned the taps on and let all the water out of the cisterns, without giving any cause to me—I have seen him violently slam the door in the faces of persons I believe to have been customers, after but a few words—I did not hear what was</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 29, Manchester Street—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner occasionally at sales—I am independent and reside in my own house—I am a collector of curiosities—I had no transaction with the prisoners until about four months since, I was looking in at his window and he asked me to go in and see a picture which he called a "Moreland"—I went in and said "What do you want for it?"—he said "Something like 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>", it was a rubbishing painting, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in my estimation—I said it was ridiculous to ask such a price; with that he got in a rage and said that I knew nothing at all, and to get out of his shop, or he would kick me out, and so on; he was in a fury, in a perfect rage, and I went out of the stop in case he should assault me; I had never spoken to him before—I did not wait to see whether he shut the door, I was afraid of him in fact—that was the only occasion on which I went into his shop, but I frequently passed the shop and I have seen him walking up and down in a seemingly demented state, as if he was not right in his head, and everybody who was about, and the man next door, who was an artist, said that he was mad—I saw that frequently, almost daily—I had seen him at sales, but did not pay any attention to him till I went into his shop.</p>

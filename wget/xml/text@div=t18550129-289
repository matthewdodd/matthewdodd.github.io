                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Chingford. Last Thursday night, I went in my stable about half past 5 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing; I saw the prisoner who worked for me standing at the corn bin, in the act of filling his bag with oats—he had no business there—there was nothing for him to do at that time of night, and he had a candle which we never do have in the stable—he had no right at any time to go to the corn bin—I think he saw me, and he went to the chaff bin—he was then coming from the corn bin to go out—he had his bag in his hand—I said to him, "You did not eat your dinner to-day?"—he said, "No, I was not very well, I did not eat it"—I took hold of the bag, and said, "These are oats, where did you get them?"—he said, "At Cash's"—that is a corn chandler's—I said, "No, you took them out of the bin, I saw you"—he said, "That is a lie"—I took the fork to strike him, but he ran amongst the horses—I sent for an officer, but he did not come so fast as he should; I said I would go for him—I left my man at the door to mind the prisoner, but before I got out of the yard, he ran away—I know the oats to be mine—they were worth about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On March the 25th I was at home and my lad came and told me that a lad had taken away an ox's head from my shop, and that he had got it again, I can only say the head was my property.</p>
               <p>James Purchase. On the 25th of March I was sitting minding my master's shop, and saw the ox's head lying on the stall, but presently missed it, and going behind the shop saw two lads walking up the back of the market, the prisoner being one of them; he had the head in his apron, and I took him. He told me the other was concerned with him, and desired I would run after him; but having no assistance I secured the prisoner only. He afterwards owned that they were both together, and that the other lad took the head and put it into his apron, and he was going to sell it.</p>

               <p>I did not take it. The other lad took it and put it into my apron, and I was going away with it, but was taken, and the other ran away.</p>

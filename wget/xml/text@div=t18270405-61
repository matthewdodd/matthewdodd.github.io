            . I am a bookseller and stationer, and live at No. 4, Brompton-terrace - I keep a subscription library - I know the prisoner's person. I first saw him about a month or five weeks before the 26th of March - I sent to his house, and he subscribed to my library, by the name of Cope - he then lived at No. 4, Grove-place, Brompton - I have sent books from my library there, and saw him frequently - he often came to my shop twice a day to change books. On the 26th of March, at near three o'clock in the afternoon, he came and asked if I was going into the City, as he did not feel very well, he had a pain in his chest, and thought he had caught cold; he asked if I would get a cheque changed for him - he then looked out a book, and directly said, "If you will give me a piece of paper, I will write the cheque;" I gave him a piece; he came round the counter close to me, and wrote it at my side - I saw him write it (looking at it) - this is the cheque - after he had written it, he said, "Perhaps you can give me something, as it may be some time before you return;" I said certainly, and gave him a 5l. note, first writing on it the name of the gentleman I had taken it of - I went into the City, but being detained on business, I had not time to go to Lombard-street, and called on Mr. Ottley, my brother-in-law, in Fleet-street - I gave the cheque to him, and he gave me the cash for it; this was as near five o'clock as possible - the prisoner said, when he had the 5l. note, that he would have the remainder when he came to the shop again, but he never came again- Mr. Ottley brought me the cheque next evening, and gave me some information about it - I then went to No. 4, Grove-place, where the prisoner lived, but he was gone from there - I presented the cheque myself at the banking house the following day, the 28th - it was refused payment - this writing was on it when Mr. Ottley brought it back to me, but not when I delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what time did you go to Ottley's? A. Within a few minutes of five o'clock - it was too late to present the cheque that day -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050030"></xptr>I myself know of no presentation, till the 28th - I did not see this writing on it till Ottley returned it to me - I saw the prisoner write the whole of this cheque - he could not write on the other side of the counter, on account of a rail, and he came round to me - I made no mark on it when he gave it to me, nor have I made any at all - I speak to it from the writing and the signature, which I noticed - it is written in the usual form of a cheque.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is the cheque drawn in your favour? A. It is - I kept it in my possession till I delivered it to Ottley.</p>

            . I live at No. 159, Fleet-street. On the 26th of February, about ten minutes before five o'clock, Mr. Taylor asked me to give him the cash for this draft(looking at it) - I have not the least doubt of this being the same - I put it among my cash in my money bag, and kept it till the next day; I then sent my servant Ray with it to the bankers', about three o'clock, or a little after - he brought the cheque back to me, with this writing across the back, which was not on it when I gave it him; I immediately set off to Brompton, and gave it to Mr. Taylor - we went to No. 4, Grove-place, and the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many other cheques had you in that bag? A. Not any; there was nothing but sovereigns; I put it into my bag as soon as I received it, locked the bag in my desk, and nobody had access to it but me - I did not see it again till next morning, as I had been out all the evening - the desk was locked - I made no mark on the cheque.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any doubt of its being the same cheque? A. None whatever, from the appearance of it altogether.</p>

On the 27th of March he gave me this cheque(looking at it) - I took it to Sir William Curtis', No. 15, Lombard-street, and gave it to one of the clerks, who took it in to Mr. Curtis, and asked me into the room - I saw Mr. Curtis write this across it - it was then returned to me - I took it back to my master; I am sure it is the same cheque as I received from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it out of your possession, from the time you gave it to the clerk, till it was returned to you? A. About three minutes; I remained in the shop a short time before I was taken to Mr. Curtis; when I went in Mr. Curtis had the cheque before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the difference between a cheque and a bill of exchange? A. I cannot say that I do.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the partners in the house of Sir William Curtis &amp; Co.; Sir William is a Baronet, and the senior partner; I have seen the cheque produced, and have examined our books; no person named James Cope keeps cash at our house - we have no such account- there is no fund in our house, out of which James Cope has authority to draw (looking at the cheque) - I did not write this on it; the witness must have mistaken my person - Mr. Robarts is the person he saw, and this his is handwriting - I was in the house at the time, but not in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been a partner in the house some years? A. I have; I do not keep the books- all the customers of the house come under the observation of every partner - I speak decidedly, on my oath, that no James Cope has an account at our house - the clerks keep the books, but no new customer is taken without the knowledge of all the partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of every customer? A. The greater part of them - I say generally I do - I know there is no such name as James Cope in the books - it is possible the name of one customer may escape me; I attend to the business daily, and see the books daily, in which the names of the customers are entered - there cannot be a customer whose name I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you looked over every book in your house, in which the name of a customer would appear? A. I have, and if such a name had been in the books, I must have seen it - there is no such a name; no account is ever opened without reference to the firm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person opens an account at your house, does he write his name in a book? A. He does, in what is called the signature book; the clerks always go to that book if there is any doubt about a cheque.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you searched back? A. The whole of this year, and for a considerable time back - I will not say that I have looked back all the last year.</p>

I saw the prisoner when he was in custody - I was not present when he was apprehended - I asked him his name; he said, I should find certificates or papers in the box which had been taken from him, which would state who he was - I said, if that was the case, and the box was not there, he could have no hesitation in giving his name; he said his name was Lancelor Cooper - I examined this box, and found two certificates in it, signed John Gore, certifying that Lancelot Cooper had served in two different ships of war.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you, you would find certificates which would identify him? A. I have stated correctly what I said to him; I did not say under all the circumstances he might as well give his name - I used no inducement or threat to induce him to give it.</p>

            . I am Vice-Admiral in the Navy. I know the prisoner - he served under me for several years; the signatures to these certificates are my writing - I never knew him by any other name than Lancelot Cooper - I have not seen him since 1814, to my recollection - I had communication at that time with him - he then used that name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you now a perfect recollection of his person? A. Perfectly so: I recognised him the moment I came into Court; before I saw the certificate - I do not mean to say positively, that I have not seen him since 1814.</p>
               <p>These two documents were here read. One was a certificate of the prisoner having served as a clerk in the navy, under Sir John Gore, from July, 1801, to February, 1806, and his good conduct during that time. - The other, as having served as clerk on board the Revenge, from February, 1806, to the 1st of August, 1808, and of his good conduct during that period.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live at No. 167, Bond-street. On the 14th of March the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I let private boxes for Covent-garden Theatre - I told him I did - he asked if I had a box for that evening - I said Yes; and he engaged one; he asked the price, I told him three guineas; he looked down the shop and said, "I bought some books of you last year; there was a copy of Rasselas which I gave to my youngest daughter - I want two more copies of the same book for my elder daughters;" he then saw a complete set of Washington livine - he came to the desk where I do my business, and said, "I have no money in my pocket, will you take a cheque on my bankers?" and from his appearance I agreed to take it - I furnished him with pen and paper, stood by him, and saw him write a cheque and sign it; (looking at one) this is it - it is signed Geo. Crofton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before, to your recollection? A. No; he was in my shop, I should think, twenty minutes - I was the only person who spoke to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you give him any box ticket? A. I gave him this box ticket (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. What makes you speak to that ticket? A. It is a box which I had to let, and it has my own signature - I never sign two for one night.</p>
               <p>MR. GATES. I found this box ticket in the prisoner's trunk.</p>
               <p>The cheque uttered to the witness Andrews was here put in and read - it was drawn on Messrs. Praed and Co. Fleet-street, payable to Mr. Andrews, dated the 14th of March, for 10l. 3s., and signed Geo. Crofton.</p>
               <p>WM. CURTIS, ESQ. re-examined. Here is our signature book - I have examined it; there is no such name as James Cope in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any other signature book? A. There is one which I have sent for - I have searched through the whole of this, which embraces a period of about twenty years - I have examined the other, which has been very recently taken into use; those two are the only signature books we have.</p>

Jackson, Thomas' Hotel, Berkeley-square; here is the direction which I saw him write - I also saw him write the other paper - the goods he bought came to 18l. 15s.; he bought an onyx ring on the 24th, which brought it to that sum; I gave him 1l. 5s. as change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Morgan—we are corn-chandlers, and live in White Lion-street—the prisoner was in our service about seventeen months previous to 8th April—we received a communication, and I kept watch—on the morning of 8th April, I saw a cart driven to my premises by Lovejoy, a greengrocer, who lived two streets off, and who, since this has absconded—he drove opposite our premises, and went into the shop—I could not see what took place—the prisoner was in the shop at the time—Lovejoy came out with a sack on his back, which looked like a sack of oats—he placed it in the cart—I next saw the prisoner at the loft door, over the shop—he threw down a truss of hay and a truss of clover—the value of a sack of oats would depend on the quality; from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this turned out to be a sack of barley, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at cost price—the hay was worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the clover 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner then came down from the loft, went into the cellar, and fetched up a truss of straw—he placed that in the cart—that was worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say where the prisoner was when Lovejoy drove up first, he was somewhere handy about the shop—I had seen him in the shop just before—there was no one else to serve in the shop—in about three-quarters of an hour I went into the shop—I took the slate on which it was the prisoner's duty to enter any sales, if the goods were not paid for, and if they were paid for he was to give me the money—I asked him three times if he had sold anything—he said no, there was nothing else to put on the slate but half a peck of barley to Davies—I asked him if there was anything else sold, and he said no—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he had taken, at least, it was in the till, and "Davies" was entered on the slate—Lovejoy has not had credit at our place of late—my partner had given direc<lb></lb>tions to the prisoner not to trust him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in White Conduit-terrace, near White Lion-street. I know the prisoner and Lovejoy—I have observed them together very frequently—I made a communication to Mr. Morgan on 1st April, and on the 8th April, Lovejoy drove by my house with a truss of clover, a truss of hay, a truss of straw and a sack of something, in his cart—Mr. Smith was then in my shop watching.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Morgan. I had my attention drawn to the prisoner—I was watching, but was not in the same room with Mr. Smith—I saw Lovejoy's cart come up, and after he had driven away, I saw the prisoner doing his usual work—he did not say anything to me about any sales he had made—after I returned from dinner at two o'clock in the afternoon, I asked him if there was anything to put on the slate—he said no.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Smith. Lovejoy had been a customer of ours some time back, but I had given directions to the prisoner many times not to trust him—the prisoner has never paid me for these articles that went that morning, nor has he entered them—a balance of an old account was paid by Lovejoy of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. some time before—I had repeatedly sent for it—I gave the prisoner into custody on 8th April in the afternoon, and on that afternoon I went to Lovejoy's stable—I found a truss</p>

               <p>of hay, a truss of clover, a truss of straw, and a sack of barley—"Ash and Co." was on the sack—the barley resembled ours, being damaged, and the clover and hay resembled ours—I should like to know what has become of Lovejoy, we cannot find him anywhere—I believe he is the worst.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

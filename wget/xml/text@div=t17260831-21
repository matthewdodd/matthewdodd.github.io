Not long after which the Prisoner, and another Woman or two, went into a Mercers Shop, the backside of St. Clements, to cheapen some Goods, and soon after they were gone, a Piece of Silk was missing. These Women, and others of their Profession, had been often at Several Shops in that Neighbourhood, so that they were pretty well known. He acquainted several Shopkeepers thereabouts with his loss, and it was not long before one of them saw the Prisoner, and one of the Woman aforesaid, as they were making another Tour; He gave the Mercer notice, who traced them to the House of - Johnson a Victualler, at the Thistle and Crown, in Denmark Court. Where he searched for his Goods to no purpose, but he found the Brocaded Silk in the Indictment, which was made into a Gown, and Lin'd with a Pink colour'd Mantua. The Prisoner own'd the Gown to be hers, and said that she bought it of the Maker, at the George Ale-house by Stocks Market, (a House frequented by Weavers,) but her Husband being a Journey-man Shooe-maker, he thought such a Gown was too fine for her, and therefore threatned to burn it, to prevent which, she had persuaded Johnson to let it lye at his House. Several Mercers were sent for, to see if they knew the Silk, Mr. Moone was one of that number, and found the Brocade to be his.</p>

We went to Mr.Herbert's Shop, I cheapen'd some Straw colour'd Mantua for an Apron, for which they asked 3 s. and 2 d. a Yard, and I offer'd them 2 s. and 10 d. In the mean time the Prisoner took a Piece of Pink Mantua, and we went away undiscover'd. We measur'd it at her Lodging, and found there was 42 Yards, which we equally divided. She bade me 3 s. for my half, but I told her I could have more for it, she said she'd line her Gown with part of her own half, and I believe this Lining to be the same. - I afterwards sold my half to Ann Green, who is not yet taken. <rs id="t17260831-21-verdict94" type="verdictDescription">

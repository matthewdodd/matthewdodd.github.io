            , thus deposed: I am Servant to Mrs. Fell; and my Lodging is in her Garret. I went up Stairs about Ten o'Clock at Night, made the Door of my Garret fast, and so went to Bed, and soon fell asleep. About Midnight (as I afterward found it was) I was waked by the creaking of my Chest, which stood by the Bed-Side. - Who's there? says I. - No body answer'd. - I jumpt out of Bed, and laid hold of a Man. Who are ye? says I; but not a Word would he speak. - I beat him about as well as I could. He still remain'd Silent, and made no Resistance. I was wondring at it, when, all on a sudden, he cut me across the Face with this Pocket Knife. The Stroke I believed was aim'd at my Throat, but luckily mist it. The Blood ran into my Mouth, and almost strangled me. However, I held him fast, got to the Window, and called the Watch, who quickly came to my Assistance, being let in by some of the Family, whom the Disturbance had by this alarm'd. When the Light came, I was surprized that the Man that had treated me thus, was the Prisoner; for I knew him very well, he having, not long since, been a Fellow-<rs id="t17250827-43-deflabel179" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

His Penknife was found hard by my Chest; which, I fancy, he was feeling for when he made no Resistance; but not finding it, I suppose he took the other (that he cut me with) out of his Pocket.</p>

            , thus deposed: I went with the Watchmen, according to the Prisoner's Directions, to fetch his Hat and Wig, which he had left by the Common-Sewer that is betwixt our Warehouse (as we call it) and Workhouse; and by that Means we discover'd the Way by which he got into the House. Mrs. Fell's Business is <rs id="t17250827-43-viclabel180" type="occupation">boiling of Tripe</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17250827-43-victim254 t17250827-43-viclabel180"></join>; and in that Place called the Warehouse, we put Offal and odd Things of little Value. There is an open Place over the Door of this Warehouse, at which a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172508270005"></xptr> Man may easily get in. There had been wooden Rails nail'd across; but I can't be sure whether they were broke down that Night as the Prisoner enter'd, or any time before. This, however, I take to be the Place of his Entrance. Then going a cross the Common-Sewer, he comes to the Workhouse, which has two Folding-Doors; and whether these were fasten'd or not, I cannot be certain. The next is the Kitchen-Door; and this has a Light over it almost like the Warehouse Door; at which we presume he enter'd, by the greasy Marks of his Shooes upon the Dresser; and that Grease is another Sign that he came thro' the Warehouse. From the Kitchen he must go up Three Pair of Stairs to the Garret; but how he got in at that Door, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence: I ask'd Brooks to let me lie with him that Night, and he told me I might if I would. I happen'd to be in Company with some Friends at an Alehouse a pretty way off, and they kept me till Twelve at Night. I came directly from them to Mrs. Fell's, and knock'd at the Door, and Brooks himself came down and let me in. I was got a little in Drink, and some Words passing betwixt us, it occasion'd a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>All this was positively contradicted by Brooks; and he continued to assert, that he made his Garret fast about Ten o'Clock, just before he went to Bed, and knew nothing of its being open'd again, till he found the Prisoner at his Chest. To which other Witnesses added, that they saw the Prisoner sauntring about Mr. Fell's House, from the Time her Family went to Bed, till almost Midnight: Besides which, were repeated the Circumstances of his Hat and Wig, and the greasy Marks of a Man's Shooes upon the Dresser. <rs id="t17250827-43-verdict181" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>On Thursday night, between ten and eleven, I was informed there was a thief in the house; I went to this house of mine, and up stairs in the room where the boy sleeps, there was this lead, and a horse-cloth on it; I bid him get up, and sent for a constable; I asked him where he got the lead? he said, he took it off my gutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox, Prisoner's Counsel. Did he tell you he took it off, or found it there? - He said, he found it there; I let this house all in apartments; I do not live there myself; I have not been at the top of the house a long while.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. My Lord, I submit there is an end to the indictment, because the lead is laid to be fixed to his dwelling house, not to a building of his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Luckett, a land-drainer, living in the parish of Hillingdon. In the month of January I was wash<lb></lb>ing, and hung seven pairs of worsted stockings and a table-cloth in a barn—I saw them safe at four o'clock—I missed them at twenty minutes past four—the policeman brought them to me the same evening, about nine—the whole of the things produced are mine.</p>

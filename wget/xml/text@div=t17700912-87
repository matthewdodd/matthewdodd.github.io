               <p>Mills. I am informed so. She complained on the 23d at night of having lost some money. The next morning I charged her with robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your wife's going out that day?</p>
               <p>Mills. Yes; about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a dispute about a gentleman that came there, an acquaintance of yours?</p>
               <p>Mills. Most people are acquaintance in a publick house.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120037"></xptr> I gave the prisoner leave to go out on the 22d of August; she said she had some money due to her; she said an uncle allowed her six shillings a month; first, she said it was her father. She went out without her hat; she said, she had a ready furnished room. She went out about one, and was to come back in two hours. She did not come home till about eight o'clock. She made an excuse for staying; she said she had had some dispute with her mother in-law, but that they had made it up. She said she should have no more occasion to go out for her money, but that her uncle's footman would bring it, and she desired me not to say any thing about her living with us as a servant. She went up with the maid to make the bed; there was a bundle brought her when she was at supper. I went out the next day to see my mother; when I came home again, I went up stairs with the prisoner to have my bed made, as I always chuse to be present whilst my bed was making. I went into the prisoner's room. I saw a box open with a good deal of money in it; she told me the night before that she had fetched some check out of pawn; she said that she had not money enough to buy it. When I looked at the money, there was one particular shilling that I knew to be mine. I brought it down to my husband; he desired me to bring it all down, which I did. I went up with the prisoner when she went to bed; she said she had lost some money out of her trunk; she said about 23 s. and 6 d. she said she had left it open. The money I carried down to my husband, was 23 s. or 24 s. and 6 d. My husband told her he would find it out. She said her father gave her two guineas. My husband said if she could prove that, she should not be a loser; he would find out how it was gone. We asked her where her father lived, but she would not tell us. She said he traded to Ireland. I said I wondered she had so much silver; she said there was half a guinea in gold, She said she went to Peckham with her father, and that she changed gold, in order to oblige her master with some silver. I told her she had wronged me of it, but that if she would tell us where her father lived, that we might be satisfied that he had given her any money; that if she would shew us her ready furnished room, and where her uncle lived, I should give her no trouble about it. I went to Mrs. Mackmar's according to her directions, and I was surprised to find that she was her mother, as it was she that gave her a character to my place, as no relation.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These two shillings I put into a pewter pint pot upon a shelf, in the bar with other money, about ten days before my wife found them in the prisoner's room. Here is a mark that I put upon one; the other shilling I remember from a mark in it, which I took notice of when I put it into the pot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in her defence denied the charge, and called six or eight witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

The doctor came, he pulled the deceased's shirt of one side and looked at the wound, he tried to put the bit of flesh in, he could not; he touched her arm; they went to the door of the bed room together, he spoke to her two or three words, I could not hear what it was; then he said the man must be sent to the hospital immediately; she was crying freely; the doctor went away; there was a coach got; after a black man came in, he began scolding the woman, I said it is of no use you saying any thing more about it; she sent for some vinegar and washed his face and gave him some vinegar and water to drink.

            . - Mr. Pooley. Where do you live. - A. I lived in the same house with the prisoner at the time. On the Saturday night this accident happened, I was at the public house, the sign of the Kettle Drum in the neighbourhood, I was asleep there; a man awaked me, he said there was murder done at home; this was between eight and nine o'clock at night. I went home with him, I saw the deceased in the front room, I went for the doctor; when I returned he was in the back room; the doctor ordered the man to be sent to the hospital. The prisoner told me he had been ill using of her, which he frequently used to do; she told me he had been beating her. I had seen him beat her many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you that he had been beating her in the hearing of the deceased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you have been witness of his ill treatment to her. - A. I have, but not at that time.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITH. - Mr. Pooley. You are a police officer. - A. I am. I know nothing of this transaction but what the prisoner told me. I apprehended her on Monday the 28th; I was informed that a man lay dead at the hospital that had been murdered; I went to the hospital to make enquiry, I found that the man lay dead there. When I went to Denmark-street I found that it was a black man that lived at No. 9, that was murdered; I went to the prisoner's house, her room was fast; I went up one pair of stairs, there I found the last witness with another girl, she said she expected her home every minute; she did not come; then I desired her to go with me to shew me where she was; she was at a neighbour's house a few doors off. I took her in custody and took her to her own house; she opened the door, and the window shutters; I searched the house, I could not find the knife; I asked how this man came by his death, she said they had been quarelling, he had beat her, she got him out of the house into the street, she then bolted the door and the shutter to keep him out; then he got round the house, over some paling; he pulled a pane of glass out of the back window and came into the bed room, then he began beating her cruelly, and no person was there but themselves; in the scuffle she said it was done. I asked her if she recollected taking up a knife, she said she could not recollect whether she did or not; she then shewed me her knee, she was very black on one side of her knee and bruised, she said he had given it her by beating her; she was likewise bruised across the eyes and nose. I took her to the office. I received the knife before the coroner at the London hospital, it was produced by the young man who gave evidence here; it was swore to then; that knife I have kept ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH JACQUES. - Mr. Gurney. Did you lodge in the same house with the prisoner and the deceased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night the accident happened did you come home. - A. Yes, between seven and eight o'clock. I knocked at the door, the deceased came then to the door, she would not open it, she said she would not open it even for her mother; the deceased went right down the street and I went away; that was an hour before the accident happened, as nigh as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would not she open the door. - A. I cannot say; the deceased was outside of the door as well as me. I was there first.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you keep a public house in that neighbourhood. - A. I do, I have known the prisoner five years and a half; I never saw any thing amiss by the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she and the deceased had both been in your house in the evening. - A. He had been in my house two or three times in the course of the evening; I think she was there about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased sober that night. - A. He was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed at your house in the evening. - A. Yes, for a few minutes; when she was there I saw the prisoner very much agitated; the deceased exclaimed against her, says he, I will be with you presently; she left the house, he followed; he appeared to be in anger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. You say that the prisoner seemed to be agitated, and the deceased seemed to be in anger, he said he would soon follow her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about nine o'clock. - A. It may be a few minutes over or under; he had been in my house three hours, backward and forward; I live about an hundred yards from the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she and Walker were in the house were they drinking together. - A. I do not think they were drinking together; there were two or three neighbours with this man; he had been singing and hooting, I called him to order once or twice; when she came in he sat at one end of the box and she at the other; he was in and out in the course of the evening; when he went out he might be gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he left your house was it that you heard there was murder done. - A. I believe it was twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she been saying to him when he said that he would be after her. - A. I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether she asked him to come home. - A. She exclaimed against his coming home, she said to him I have kept you long enough; you shall not come any longer. In about twenty minutes after they went out I heard of the accident.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. In this case you are to consider whether you are satisfied that the account the prisoner gave of the matter, and the witnesses severally and respectively give, who as they happened to have business, did meet this man in a very angry and intemperate state of mind, one of them hearing a rumbling as if something had been thrown, and some of them hearing the prisoner cry out murder - if you should be of opinion any such scuffle happened between them, and in fact that there was enmity between him and this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130028"></xptr>woman, and the story to be true, that he had been beating her before - if you believe that to be the case, and that this woman under these circumstances committed this act of violence, although perhaps she might have gone further than she ought to have gone; - in consideration of human infirmities, persons under these circumstances not having their recollection and reason and government of their passions, as in cooler moments they would have it. The law in that case extends the crime to manslaughter only. That they had been engaged in a dispute and a scuffle is manifestly proved by the witnesses; I must own that they do not say enough for you to be sure it was of that nature that called upon her, as a human being, to protect herself in that way which she has done. - If you see there is malice plain and clear in this case, you will find her guilty. I own it does not appear to me to have been done with that malice which the law requires to constitute murder; - if you should be of that opinion it reduces the crime to manslaughter.</p>

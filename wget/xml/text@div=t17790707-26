               <p>Was you the last up over night? - No, Mrs. Benton went to bed last.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the fastening of the doors that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you lie at home? - Yes; as the watchman went past two o'clock; I heard two men under the window where I lie, which is over the shop. I heard one say to the other the hatch is open, it is well if the people are not robbed, we will call the watchman. They called the watchman to take care of the house. I jumped out of bed and said my lads what is the matter; they said your hatch is open, it is well if you are not robbed; I went down and found the door was broke open, and the glass case opposite the door wrenched open and a great number of things taken away; among the rest these mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) which are only what has been since found.</p>
               <p>When did you discover any of the things? - Not for some time after. I was obliged to go that morning to Gravesend. Some bills were sent to Justice Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken? - No; I saw him when he was in custody? he had a pair of my buckles in his shoes; I saw him take them out and give them to Justice Sherwood's man; he was in the dark cellar at that time. I then went with them to the prisoner's house, and there I saw Mr. Sherwood's man take a pair of silver buckles off his wife's feet; they found a pair of child's set shoe buckles, and a pair of set knee buckles at his house; they also found a parcel of skeleton keys in the house. Just as we were come out one of them said he would have another look, and went back and in the coal-hole found the things that my house had been broke open with; there was a stock and center hit.</p>
               <p>How did they get into your house? - A hole was bored just above the bolt of the door, and the bolt pushed back.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that hole was not there the day before? - I am sure it was not there that night.</p>

               <p>Fletcher. I found a receipt in the house in the prisoner's name, for a quarter's rent. The prisoner told me the house was his; I asked him how he came by the buckles; he said he bought them of a travelling Jew, whom he did not know.</p>

On the 4th of May at night, I met the prisoner and another man in Shadwell, seeing them there at that time of night I asked them what business they were about, that it was time for them to be at home, and if they did not go home I would take them to the watch-house, upon which the prisoner said I seemed to be civil, would I go and drink with them; I went into an alehouse with them to drink, and stayed about ten minutes; the prisoner went out and left the other man drinking with me; the prisoner was taken that night; he had a light coat on, and to the best of knowledge, a light corded silk waistcoat.</p>

               <p>I am a wheel-wright at Bow. The prisoner served his time with me. I have had five apprentices; I never had a better. I never knew any thing against him in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say to these things which are produced? - It strikes me very much.</p>
               <p>Did you employ him at this time? - No; he has been a master himself since he left me, which was about six years ago.</p>

I keep the Anchor, at Whetstone—on 23rd July Mackle stood at the door, and Riley came in and called for a pint of half-and-half—I served him—he gave it to another man, not Mackle, and said, "Drink, old fellow"—he gave me a bad shilling—I said, "This is a bad one," and he gave me another, which was bad also—I said, "Have you not got a better?"—he was a little saucy, and the other ran away—I had the two bad shillings in my hand, and went after Riley, who chucked himself under the Bull water trough—I caught him, gave him to the ostler, and then ran and took Turnbull, and gave them both in charge—I was after<lb></lb>wards taken to a place where some coins were picked up—that was within a yard or two of where I took Mackle—after I came from the station, I picked up Mackle's cap, close to where the money was found—he threw himself on the ground, and kicked me on my knees.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he brought it to my place, and I went with him to Mr. Dempster's, in Union-street—he stood outside while I pledged it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I pledged it in the name of Price—I gave him the money and the ticket—he gave me the ticket back, and told me when the shawl was got out, it should be mine—I do not know whether there was any mark on it—it was quite new—he brought it home one Saturday night in April, between nine and ten o'clock, and we pledged it the same night—I kept the ticket, it is the same the policeman has.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Joseph Smith and several others, at 31, St. Martin's-le-Grand. I found this shawl at Mr. Dempster's, by the ticket the policeman has—I cannot positively say I had seen that shawl before, but we had the whole of that pattern, it has never been sold by any other house—we have sold several of them—I cannot tell how many—it must have come from our warehouse—it is worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was in our employ as entering-man, and had access to where the shawls were.</p>

            . I am a constable of Islington. On the 3rd of February, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Chancery Lane, with a person whom I knew. I watched them, and saw Mr. Cresswell and a lady pass the end of the Lane, in the direction of the Strand. The prisoner and his companion crossed over to a print-shop, near which Mr. Cresswell was passing, and they followed him. I had met Reardon just before, and asked him to go with me. I kept up with them on the opposite side of the way, and continued to watch them. I saw the prisoner's companion take a handkerchief from Mr. Cresswell's right hand pocket; the prisoner was close by at the time, and his companion gave it to him; I crossed the road, but they saw me coming. The prisoner seemed not to know what to do with it. I made a catch at him, but they both got away; I pursued the prisoner, who ran by the side of the coaches, and saw him stopped at the corner of Beaufort Buildings. I could not find the handkerchief. I am quite sure he was with the person who picked the pocket.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, Grenville Street, Somers-town, and am a plasterer. I was coming down Chancery Lane, towards Fleet Street, when I saw Colton. I saw the prisoner in company with another person taller than himself. I watched them for perhaps twenty-five minutes; - I did not part from Colton from the time I began to watch the prisoner; - he remained in company with his companion all the time. I saw Mr. Cresswell on the opposite side of the way. I went to the coaches, and looked through the wheel; - I saw the prisoner, or his companion, who were both quite close to Mr. Cresswell, take a reddish coloured handkerchief from his coat pocket; before I could get across the road, Colton cried out, "Stop thief!" I saw the other running, and I ran after him towards the City; I believe the prisoner ran towards Charing Cross. I could not see what became of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was taking a walk, and saw the man who was with me - he asked me where I was going. I said, merely walking about to get myself round, having been ill. I know nothing of the robbery - it might be so, that he picked the pocket, but I did not.</p>

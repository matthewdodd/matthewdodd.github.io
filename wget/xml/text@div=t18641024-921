Herzoff and Herman; that was in June last—he asked me to take a cheque from my master—he said if I took a cheque from my master and learnt to copy his handwriting, and wrote it out for a sum of money; if I gave it to a commissionaire to take to the bank, he would wait outside till the commis<lb></lb>sionaire went for the money; and if anybody came out with him he would come and tell me at once, and I could leave the office and get away, so that they could not take me in charge—it was about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June, I think, that he first spoke to me about doing that—I took one of my master's cheques—it was one, I think—we used to frequent an ice-shop, and we used to try and copy Mr. Alexander Watt's writing—we did that a good many times, every evening after we left our office, for about a fortnight before the cheque was sent to the bank—we used to lay the. name of Mr. Watt underneath the piece of paper—we got Mr. Watt's name from a circular of Mr. Watt's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the circular—at last be took the paper from me, and said I could not copy it well enough; he would take the paper and keep it, and give it to me the next morning—I gave him the cheque, and he went home; and, I believe, copied it at home, and he brought it to me next morning written out—it was "Pay to order," I believe, 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not this cheque—he gave me that cheque and told me to give it to a commissionaire, and he would wait outside, and if anybody came out with the commissionaire he would come and tell me, so that I could go away—I don't know what has become of that cheque—I beg your pardon, I gave it him that evening—when the commissionaire came from the bank he came to Mr. Watt's office, Mr. Watt was not in the office, I took the cheque from him and told him I knew there was something wrong in it, and I took it away from him—I left the office that afternoon, and I met Brown in the evening—he took it from me, and said, "Oh, that is no go," and he tore it up—he then told me had got a plan in his head—I told him I could not go home any more, I had disgraced myself; I would keep away from Mr. Watt's office and from home—he said, "Don't be a fool, go home and see if anybody has called from Mr. Watt's office; if not, they will not take any notice of it; if they have not taken any notice, I will tell you what the plan is"—I asked him what it was—he told me if I went and got three or four cheques he would copy one as well as he could, of Mr. Alexander Watt's—I had found out that Mr. Watt did not sign his name "Watt and Oust"—by seeing him write another cheque I found it was "Alexander Watt"—the 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was signed ' Watt and Oust"—I copied the name of Alexander Watt myself on a piece of paper from the copying letter-book, and gave it to him to copy on the cheque—he took it, and told me that if I gave him another cheque he would</p>

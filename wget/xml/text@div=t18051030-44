               <p>Q. How far had he moved it from where he had taken it? - A. It hung up in the shed in various parts; the bag I returned to him by order of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your hemp? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He never saw me take any thing; he cannot say I ever took any thing away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He says you had removed it from where it was - what business had you there? - A. I got in there and laid upon that hemp and was going to put it up again.</p>

               <p>"What is the matter, mistress?" and the maid-servant came out. In the mean time the prisoner came down stairs. I stood with my back against a pair of folding doors in the passage, he came up to me; I said to him,</p>
               <p>"Where have you been?" he said,</p>

            , who was sitting in the tap-room, he came out, and laid hold of him - the bustle and confusion became general. A young man, who lodged up stairs, came down - he fell over something on the first landing-place, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Here is a table left in the passage!" By that time the prisoner was taken into the tap-room. I told them to hold him fast, and sent the maid up stairs to see if my room was safe - she ran up, and in less than a minute called out,</p>
               <p>"Mistress, here is your room-door open, and the club-box standing in the passage!" I ran up, and found it standing on the landing-place - it was removed from my side of the bed, where it always stood, and on to the landing-place. I ran into my room, and missed a small red trunk, with its contents, which was the plate - they were gone entirely. On the bed I found a small Tunbridge-ware box, which was emptied of its contents, which were a watch, a picture, necklace and lockets, and my husband's will, which was thrown on the bed with it. I then went down stairs, and said I was robbed. In the mean time Hooper had searched the prisoner in the tap-room, and found ten skeleton keys, a dark-lanthorn, an iron crow-bar, and a phosphorus bottle. He was brought into the bar, stripped, and searched further; a skeleton and a picklock key were found on him, with 1 s. 2 1/2 d. None of my property was found. There were marks of the iron crow-bar on the club-box, as if he had attempted to open it - it had not been opened. There was another club-box in the room, which had marks of the crow-bar on it. I sent to Marlborough-street for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I had not been in my bed-room after half-past three o'clock. We have a great many lodgers in the house. None of the property was found on the prisoner. Hearing a noise created my suspicion. I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Persons going up and down stairs would not have created your suspicion - A. No, it was the noise. I lost all the plate stated in the indictment out of the red box, and have never recovered it. The money was in the club-box.</p>

I was at the prosecutor's house - I went there about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and saw a man very much like the prisoner, standing at the door as I went into the tap-room; he stood outside the house. I went out again in about ten minutes - he still stood there. Dean asked me what that man was looking over at the house for? I told him it was nothing to him, and to come in and have some beer. We went in, and was there until a quarter after eight o'clock. Mrs. Stevens came to the door, and called out

I went into the passage shortly after, and saw Mrs. Stevens, the prisoner was coming along the passage from the stairs - she and Mary laid hold of him. I got behind them, to prevent his getting out of the street-door - I collared him, and told him to come into the tap-room if he had done nothing amiss - he said he would not. I told him if he was the d-v-l he should come in. I pulled him in, and sent out to Mrs. Stevens, to go up and see if she had lost any thing. While they were gone up stairs he tried to make his escape. I threw him down by the fire-place; he then said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ill use me." I told him if he offered to move again I would knock his brains out. I then sat down by him, and took hold of his right-hand coat pocket, in which I found the crow-bar. Mrs. Stevens came in, and said she was robbed. I then searched him, and found a dark lanthorn in his left-hand coat-pocket, and took ten skeleton keys and a crow-bar out of his right-hand coat pocket. We afterwards took him into the bar, stripped him, and found another skeleton and a picklock key, with a phosphorus bottle and matches. Jeffries came in, handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

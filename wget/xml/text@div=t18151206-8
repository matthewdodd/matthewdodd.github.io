The prisoners came to my shop on the 2nd of November, between three and four in the afternoon; Williams and Kent came into the shop, and asked to look at some Irish linen; some was shewn to them, which was too narrow; another piece was shewn, which was not fine enough; in the art of taking down a third, I looked round, and saw the prisoner Williams, as I supposed, tying her garter, but bad not the least suspicion. I served them with one yard of linen, at two shillings and ninepence, and took the money for it. When the prisoners were going out, I was much struck with the awkwardness of the walk of Williams. I immediately told my son to go and watch their conduct, for I feared they had got something which was not their own. My son followed them, and traced them to different places, and then came back, and then he and I went into Bishopsgate-street, where they had arrived, and where the three were arm in arm at the corner of Old Bethlehem. When I came within about three yards of them, they looked round; seeing me and my son so close to them, they parted; I immediately seized hold of two of them, and my son seized the other. I thought if they had any property, that it would be dropped. Simmonds opened her cloak, and immediately the cotton fell, and I picked it up. They have changed their dresses. The property was seventeen yards of printed cotton, and it cost me one pound fifteen shillings. Then we brought them towards my own house, and met the constable and gave them into his custody.</p>

            ; I remember the two prisoners, Williams and Kent, coming into my father's shop on the 2nd of November. As soon as ever they were gone out, my father sent me after them in consequence of some suspicion he had. They went round Union street, and at about twenty yards from our house, they were joined by a third; they went along Union street, and into Duke street, and then into Sandy's row, leading into Petticoat lane; then I saw the two prisoners, Williams and Kent, standing with their backs against the wall Simmonds stood before them; I saw Williams drop something from underneath her clothes, and Simmonds picked it up, and put it under her cloak. They then went down Widegate alley, which leads into Bishopsgate street; Simmonds kept on the one side of the way and Williams and Kent went on the other. When they got into Bishopsgate street, I ran home and told my father. He and I came out in pursuit of them, and caught them all arm in arm, just by Old Bethlehem. My father caught hold of Kent and Simmonds, and I caught hold of Williams. Then we met Mr. Sapwell the constable, and I saw the piece of cotton lying by the side of Simmonds; but I did not see my father take it up. My father gave them in charge of Mr. Sapwell; I was not twenty yards from the house, when I saw Simmonds.</p>

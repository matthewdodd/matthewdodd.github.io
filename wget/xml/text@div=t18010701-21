               <p>Q. Did she say whether she had taken the watch? - A. She owned it to the gentleman she pledged it with, and told me she was very sorry; I took out the watch at Mr. Windsor's, and paid one pound fifteen-shillings for it; they would not let me have it without.

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Windsor; this is the watch that I took in from the prisoner at the bar, on the 23d of May, for thirty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not let the woman have it without paying the money? - A. The prisoner was not found.</p>
               <p>Q.What is it worth, do you think? - A.Forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. It would be very adviseable for your master to return that money, every farthing of it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SOWERRY sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; there were three handkerchiefs pledged at my shop, but I know nothing of it; I did not take in the things.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is the servant that took them in? - A. I received a subpoena only last night at seven o'clock; it was directed to me, and I thought my attendance would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you so extremely dull as not to know that the person who took in the article was the person to come here; you must send for him; did you never receive a subpoena before? - A.Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Roussell. I was obliged to pay this gentleman four shillings for the handkerchiefs before he would let me have them.</p>
               <p>Court. You must return the four shillings immediately.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WILLETT sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, No. 95, Rosemary-lane: The prisoner pledged two shirts with me on the 23d of May last; I lent her twelve shillings upon the two, I should suppose them to be worth fifteen shillings a shirt; I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Roussell. These are the shirts that I lost; they have the gentleman's name that they belonged to; here are two that are the fellows to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went out of this woman's house, and as I came to the top of the court, I picked this bundle up; I was very much distrest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010021"></xptr>for want of money, and I parted with these things at the pawnbroker's; she came to me while I was in Newgate, and said, she would not hurt me by any means whatever, if I would pay for them; but this woman is jealous of me, and her husband, because her husband, as soon as he saw me, said he would not hurt me.</p>

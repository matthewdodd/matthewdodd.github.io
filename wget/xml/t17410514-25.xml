               <p>Alexander. They were East-India Bonds, for 100 l. apiece .</p>
               <p>Coun. Do you know any thing of the Prisoner's taking them?</p>
               <p>Alexander. We found it out by very good Witnesses, that she took them; she acknowledged it, and paid back part of the Money.</p>

               <p>Sedgewick. They were India Bonds for a hundred Pounds a piece, the Numbers were 11734, 11736, and 11737, and the Penalty of each Bond was 200 l.</p>
               <p>Coun. To whom did you deliver these Bonds?</p>
               <p>Sedgewick. To Mrs. Way, and she paid 300 l. 16 s. and 4 d. for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire Mrs. Alexander may be asked how these Bonds came into her Custody?</p>
               <p>Alexander. Mrs. Way who was my Aunt, was troubled with Fits, and lost 2 Gold Rings, so she desired me to look into a Chest for them, and I found these Bonds there in a Tin-cannister; I expected her to die, and so I took them from thence.</p>
               <p>- Bradshaw . I am a Trunk maker by Trade, but my Father keeps a Public House in Leadenhall Street and I live with him. On the 3d or 4th of last April the Prisoner came to one Mrs. Russel who lives at the Back of our House, and told her she had 3 Bonds to dispose of. Mrs. Russel brought them to my Father, and I fetched one Mr. Lyon a Broker to our House; - The Prisoner was there at the same Time. Mr. Lyon said the Bonds were very good, and if she came honestly by them, he would purchase them: he said the Interest was due the 6th of April, and if she would go and receive that, he should be satisfied that they were honest. She received the Interest, and then desired me to go with them to Lyon's, and bring her 300 l. for them, and I went with him to a Banker's and he paid me for them directly.</p>
               <p>Coun . What Day did you sell these Bonds to Lyon?</p>
               <p>Bradshaw. It was on the 6th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sedgewick . The Premium at that Time was upwards of 4 l. so that there was 12 l. lost by them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140017"></xptr>Bradshaw . The Numbers were 11734, 36, and 37, and she desired me to get her 300 l. for them.

               <p>Coun. What sort of Money did Lyon pay you the 300 l. in?</p>
               <p>Bradshaw . It was in three Pound twelves, and Thirty six Shilling pieces.</p>

She would not own any Thing 'till Bradshaw came, and then she began to squeek, and said to Mrs. Alexander, '' Patty, I '' always had a Value for you, and I can give you '' above 200 l. of the Money back again.'' She said the Money was at a Relation's of hers, who was a Distiller in the Maze, Southwark. Then her Box was fetched from thence and brought to the White Lyon in Aldersgate Street, and the Prisoner broke it open herself with a Poker. There was about 250 l. in the Box, and the Attorney asked her if it was the Property of Mrs. Alexander, and she said it was.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did she say it was the produce of these Bonds?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, and that it was all that was left, but she would make Satisfaction for what she had spent when it lay in her Power.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I break the Box open, or Mrs. Alexander?</p>
               <p>Roberts. She sat near the Fire, and rose up, and broke it open herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mrs Alexander who broke the Box open?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Alexander. At first she said the Box should not be broke open, but afterwards she took the poker out of the Fire, and I broke it open myself with her Leave.</p>

I was at the Death of Alexander's Uncle, Mr. Way, and I was attentive (attended) in the Way of my Business on Mrs. Way: she was not capable of looking after her own Business, but was taken to drinking, and I have known he to go to the Bottle 14 or 15 Times in an Hour When Mr. Way was dead, the Brewer came and got Mrs. Way when she was not in her Senses to go, and he administered to her Husband's Will, whereof after they had led the old Woman up in Ignorance for 3 or 4 Days, they brought an Execution into the House; and there was a Country Boy that was a Servant there one Day called me, and said he was afraid his Mistress was dead, whereof I got up, and the Woman was as good as dead indeed, but we smoked a Pipe of Tobacco under her Nose and brought her to herself: whereof she had another Fit, and then the Kinswoman, as I may call her, went to Mrs. Way's pocket Apron and took out the Key of the Chest: then she opened the Chest, and took out 14 or 15 l. 2 silver Spoons, and a Ladle; then she took a Tin Box, and took out of it something which I could perceive was a Bond. She then went to another great Chest, and took a Box of Silver Pence, and went away. She came in again soon afterwards, and took some other Things away, and two more papers out of the Tin Box; whereof she came to me afterwards, and said, that Mrs. Reason had stole the Things which I saw her take out of the Tin Box, and she would hang her, if there was not another Woman in the World.</p>
               <p>Coun. Are you sure there was an Execution in the House?</p>
               <p>Stokes. Yes, Mr. Maydon brought it in, while I was in the House.</p>
               <p>Coun. What do you call an Execution?</p>
               <p>Stokes. Indeed I can't say, - but I know, when the Execution was brought in, Mrs. Alexander fill'd her pockets with Money. Mr. Way is dead, and after her Husband's Death, there was a false Will made, and I was a Witness to it.</p>
               <p>C. to Alexander. When did your Aunt die?</p>
               <p>Alexander. I can't justly tell the Day of the Month, but she was buried on St. Mark's Day, and died the Wednesday before. Mr. Way died the 23d of March.</p>

            . I lived at Mr. Way's. My Master died on Friday and the Sunday following, I was sent down into the Cellar, for a Shovel of Coals, and found some papers in the Coal-hole , and gave them to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Coun . How came you to give them to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I don't know what they were, for I can neither write nor read: - I thought they might serve to light pipes of Tobacco. I know nothing, but that I pick'd them up.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of papers were they?</p>
               <p>Hatton. They were 3 single papers, like Letters.</p>
               <p>Jury . Were they written on both Sides?</p>
               <p>Hatton . I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any Seal upon them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174105140018"></xptr>Hatton. I believe there was , but I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>C. to Alexander . Did the Prisoner live with your Aunt?</p>
               <p>Alexander. She lodged there 2 Years, and was a Servant at the Death of the Man, but not at the Death of the Woman. She paid 2 s. a Week for her Lodging, and used to work for 2 s. 3 d. a Week, because there was a Score between them.</p>
               <p>C. When did you put these Bonds into the Coal-hole?</p>
               <p>Alexander. On the Saturday Morning.</p>
               <p>C. How long was this after your Uncle died?</p>
               <p>Alexander. It was the Saturday after he died; and I missed them the Sunday following. I asked Hatton about these papers , and he said he had not seen any; and the Prisoner said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maydon . Did Hatton ever tell you, that he took these papers out of the Coal-hole?</p>
               <p>Maydon . No, he never pretended any such Thing. The Prisoner denied she had seen them, 'till Bradshaw came; and then she said the Boy gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Hatton. As soon as I picked them up, I gave them to the Prisoner; she was then standing at the Coal-house Door.</p>

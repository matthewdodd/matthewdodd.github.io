                  </hi>. I am an assistant, in the employment of Messrs. Swan and Edgar, the silk mercers, of Piccadilly; I have been in their em<lb></lb>ployment about ten years; I reside in the house. On 24th April I supped with the rest of the establishment, at my employer's house—I went out after supper, at about a quarter to 10 o'clock—I had been employed in the house the whole day—I had written a letter in the evening, which I went out to post—according to the rules of the house we are obliged to be in at 11 o'clock—I proceeded up Piccadilly, and posted my letter at De Castro's, the grocer's, nearly opposite St. James's-street—I then strolled on to Hyde<lb></lb>park; it was a fine night—I went in at the Hyde-park Corner gate, adjoin<lb></lb>ing Apsley House, and walked across the open part of the park towards Bayswater—I then turned round; I had then got about three parts across the park—I turned in the direction of Stanhope Gate—when I was about 400 yards from the gate the prisoner accosted me, by asking the way to the Duke of Wellington's statue—I directed him—I pointed, and told him that was the way—he left me soon after that, and a tall gentleman passed down the broad walk towards the Marble Arch, and the prisoner put the name question to him, and followed him a little way, and then turned round, came up to me again, and asked was I sure that was the way—I told him it was—he followed me on still, and he said it was much warmer—I said, yes, it was—he then came near me, and pushed up against me, and said the trees were budding out—I said, yes, they were—he still kept near me, and when we had gone some distance, twenty or thirty yards farther on, he asked me if I had any money—I made him no answer, and further on he asked me if I would give him something to drink—I made him no answer to that—we were then, perhaps, twenty yards from the sailing which sepa<lb></lb>rates the path from the rest of the park, and about forty yards from the outside railings of the park and the gate—when we got to the gate it was closed; the park keeper was there and opened it—on the oath I have taken nothing had taken place between the prisoner and myself down to the time of my leaving the park by that gate—when the gate was opened we both went out—about the middle of the road the prisoner seized my collar, and said he would serve me out—I pushed him from me, and he let go of my collar—he followed me across the road, and I said, "I will soon settle this; a policeman will be up;" or, "with a policeman"—I am not sure which were the words—I waited at the corner of Stanhope-street for about ten minutes, no policeman came, and I said, "I am going towards Piccadilly, no</p>

               <p>doubt we shall meet one"—we had gone about twenty or thirty yards when we met a policeman, and as soon as the prisoner saw the policeman he again seized my collar—I then said to the policeman, "I wish this case investi<lb></lb>gated," and the prisoner at once said, "I give this man in charge"—the policeman asked him for why, and he said it was something private, he would explain it—the policeman said he could not take me in charge unless he gave the reason, and the prisoner then stated that I had taken him round the waist and kissed him, and took hold of his person, and tried to put my hand in his breeches—we then went on to the station house, and he made a similar statement there—I attempted to speak several times—I said it was false, and began to explain it to the inspector, and he wished me not to say anything—he said he could not hear what I had to say, or I had better not say anything—he said he must detain me—I said, "Not on the word of a man like that"—he said, "Why a man in his habiliments, if he makes a charge like that, I am bound to detain you"—he said I must be locked up, and detained for the night—I wished him to send for my employer, Mr. Hope, of No. 45, Regent-street; that is his private house—I gave my own name and address, Robert Bendall, 51, Regent-street—I was detained at the station house that night, and taken before the Magistrate the following morning—the prisoner did not appear, and I was discharged—I heard Inspector Webb give him directions at the station house, over<lb></lb>night, as to where he was to come on the following day—it was given in writing—the prisoner was dressed in livery—I had never seen him before.</p>

On 24th April I was in Park-lane, near Stanhope-gate, about half past 10 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor there, the prisoner, with his hand, having hold of Mr. Ben<lb></lb>dall's collar—Mr. Bendall spoke first—he said, "This man wants to give me in charge"—I asked what for—the prisoner at the same time said that he had a reason for it—I asked what was his reason—he said he had a reason for it—I told him I must have an explanation before I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—he then commenced telling me that he was coming across the park from towards Oxford-street, and he was accosted by Mr. Bendall, stating that it was a very fine night, and how beautiful the trees were budding out; that he still went on across the park, when Mr. Bendall kept very close by the side of him, with his hand and arm rather under his coat; that after walking some little distance, he (the prisoner) thought he had missed his way, and he asked the prosecutor if he was in the right direction for the Duke of Wellington's statue; he told him that he was, and he walked a little farther, thinking he might be in the wrong direction, and met with some other man; he asked him the same question, and he told him he was in the right direction for the Duke of Wellington's statue; that he pro<lb></lb>ceeded on a little farther, thinking he was mistaken, and he made a stop, when the prosecutor put his arms round his waist and attempted to kiss him, and at the same time he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at his trowsers, trying to force his hand inside; that he could not succeed in so doing, and he grasped hold of his privates, and gave them a <hi rend="italic">grip</hi>—I told him that it was not a case I could decide on in the street; I could not settle the affair in the street; I must take it before the inspector—Mr. Bendall said, "That is right; we will have an explanation before the inspector"—I then took them before the inspector.</p>

The prosecutor and prisoner came to the station house on 24th April, about a quarter to 11 o'clock at night, accompanied by Rowning—the charge was made by Richards against Ben<lb></lb>dall for indecently assaulting him in Hyde-park—I asked the prisoner to explain how the assault was committed—he said that he was returning across the Park to No. 52, Eaton-square—I asked him where he had been, what brought him in the Park—he said he had been to see his wife, I understood him, at No. 2, Somers-place, Bayswater; that he was returning to Eaton-square when he met Bendall, and being after night, and not knowing the Park, he inquired his road to the Duke of Wellington's statue; that Bendall walked by his side some distance, and remarked that it was a fine night, that the trees were budding; that he walked by his side, and continued shouldering him, so much so that he was afraid of him; that as he was about to leave the Park, Bendall threw his arms round his waist, kissed him, and tried to force one hand into his trowsers, which he resisted, and that he then caught hold of his person, outside of his trowsers—I said, "Are you certain that he attempted to force his hand into your trowsers, and that he took hold of your person outside your trowsers?"—he said, "I am"—I said, "Will you give him in charge; do you insist on charging him?"—he said, "I do"—I said, "Will you attend the police court in the morning?"—he said, "I will"—Mr. Bendall continued to interrupt, and said the charge was false—I entered the charge in the usual way (<hi rend="italic">producing the charge sheet</hi>)—the prisoner signed it—I explained to him that he would have to attend the police court at 10 o'clock in the morning—he appeared to hesitate, and was confused—I was then under the impression that he had been drinking—he was about to leave the station, and I said, "Wait, to avoid any mistake, I will put it on a piece of paper for you"—I wrote on a piece of paper the date and the hour that he should attend—Bendall again con<lb></lb>tinued to interrupt, and said that Richards asked him for something to drink, and he thought it was only to come to the police station, and the matter would be investigated, and he should be allowed to go—the prisoner denied having asked him for anything to drink—I told Bendall that he would be detained—he said, "Surely I can explain the matter; you won't</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before we go to the next day, did Bendall wish to make a statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that Richards had asked him for something to drink—I told him that he had better reserve what he had to say; I must detain him on the charge that was made—he said, "Very well"—he was quite sober, but excited—10 o'clock was the hour appointed—I wrote on a piece of paper as distinctly as I could, "Be at Great Marlborough-street police court, at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, Wednesday the 26th"—we waited until a quarter to 12 o'clock; the prisoner did not appear, and Bendall was dis<lb></lb>charged—Mr. Wontner was then in attendance on behalf of Bendall—about a quarter to 3 o'clock that afternoon, I went to Eaton-square—I found the prisoner standing at the steps of No, 52, Eaton-square; a car<lb></lb>riage was waiting at the door, and he was apparently in readiness to go away with the carriage—I was in private clothes—I asked him if he knew me—he said, "No; I don't remember you, but I know that fellow," looking at Bendall who was with me—I said, "You did not attend the police court this morning"—he said, "I know I did not"—I said, "This party, Ben<lb></lb>dall, now prefers a charge against you for having endeavoured to extort money from him last night, by your accusing him of having committed an indecent assault upon you"—he asked me to walk inside, and to be allowed to speak to his master—I went in, and when before his master, he said the reason he did not attend the police court was, because it would have either interfered with his master's business, or with his business: I will not be certain which; and he was anxious to avoid bringing his master's name in question—I then brought him away—he was in livery—I allowed him first to change his dress—on the way to the station he appeared anxious to have conversation with Bendall, which I prevented; he continued addressing himself to Bendall—when in Grosvenor-place he said he thought Bendall would have been satisfied with being locked up all night; that there the matter would have ended, and that he (Bendall) might have thought himself lucky to have got off so easily—I cannot say what it was he said to Bendall, he wished to have some conversation, but I kept one on my left, and the other on the right, and would not allow it; he kept muttering to himself—whenever I found he was about to speak I prevented it, I would not allow any conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was on duty on the night of 24th April—the gate is closed at 10 o'clock—we do not let any in after that, we allow persons to leave, up to half past 10 o'clock—I open the gate for them—I remember two persons leaving the park by that gate on the night in question, from 10 minutes to a quarter after 10 o'clock—I opened the gate for them to go out—one of them was in livery—I should not have recognised Mr. Bendall as one of the persons if he had not come to me—neither of them spoke to me as they went out—after they had gone through the gate, I saw the servant lay his hand upon the gentleman's shoulder, and walk on the opposite side of the road; there was a carriage passing at the time—it was in the centre of the road that he first put his hand upon him—they were nearer to the park than the car<lb></lb>riage was—when the carriage passed, they went on the opposite side of Park-lane—I saw them there for five or ten minutes, and then lost sight of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Blagrove, of Shalford, near Guildford, in Surrey. I am acquainted with Mr. Bendall, the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I have known him for nearly twenty years—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) from him by post, on 25th April last, it came by the after<lb></lb>noon post.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Swan and Edgar. I remember the night of 24th April—Mr. Bengall supped with us that night—he left the supper table about 20 minutes to 10 o'clock, and went out about a quarter to 10—I observed that he had a letter in his hand; I lent him a postage stamp.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the receiving house, No. 65, Piccadilly, I attend to the business; it is next door to the White Horse Cellar, immediately opposite St. James's-street. This letter does not bear the Piccadilly stamp; we tie up the letters in bundles of fifty, and only stamp the outside one—the postman collects the letters at night, from 10 to 10 minutes past 10 o'clock—that is the last collection; the collection previous to that is at half past 5 o'clock—a letter posted then would be received in the country in the morning, but if posted at 10, it would be received the next afternoon.</p>

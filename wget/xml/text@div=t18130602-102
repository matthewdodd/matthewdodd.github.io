            . I work with Mrs. Jackson. On the 14th of May I had the watch in my loom: at nine o'clock in the morning the prisoner's fetched it from my loom; I heard Mrs. Jackson speak to the prisoner about it; the prisoner told her he had pawned it at Mr. Sowerby's; he told me he had not pawned it, nobody would take it in of him; he had thrown it in the New River.</p>
               <p>ELISHA ARCHER. On the 14th of May; about nine o'clock in the morning, I took the watch from Mrs. Swain's loom; I hung it at my loom; I left it at my loom; between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning some men came there, we all went and had gin and porter together; we all got intoxicated: I and Mrs. Swaine were obliged to lay down, we could not work; Mrs. Jackson was also intoxicated. On the next morning Mrs. Jackson missed her watch; she asked my boy about it; he said he was innocent of taking it. Mrs. Jackson threatened to send him to jail; my boy cried, and said he pawned it.</p>

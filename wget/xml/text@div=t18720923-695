I am house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on Sunday morning, 25th August, about 1 o'clock; she was perfectly blanched, she had lost a great deal of blood—I ordered her into the ward immediately; she was in a state of collapse—there was a bruise all round under her chin, and her temples were bruised—I examined the vagina; it appeared as if there was a large tumour projecting between the labia; I sent for the consulting surgeon—I did not like to interfere without his advice, and when he came we put her under chloroform and examined the state of affairs, and he, in trying to pass his finger up, accidentally ruptured the tumour, it was composed of blood clots; he put his hand further up and found a wound at the side of the vagina—he could pass his hand right through the wound; one labia was very much swollen—the tumour was certainly not the result of natural causes, it was the result of injury—we thought at first the wound hid touched the peritoneum, and thought she would die in a couple of hours, and sent for a Magistrate immediately—I continued to attend her for some weeks—she vacillated between life and death for about three weeks—she was pregnant, and gone about six months—I have seen her here to-day, and consider she is in a fair way of recovery now, quite out of danger—I should imagine the wound was incised—I thought it was done by some pointed instrument; falling on the floor or on a broken dish would not cause such an injury; a kick would cause the tumour, but the wound could not have been caused by a kick.</p>

I have heard of the bar the constable has described—it would be very improbable that that caused the wound, assuming it to be standing up—if the bar was in an upright position in the tub and the woman fell over the tub and on to the bar, it is possible it might have caused such a wound, but very im<lb></lb>probable—it must have been caused by a pointed instrument; it need not have been sharply pointed—it is possible the leg of a chair might have caused it, if the chair was upside down—I think it is absolutely impossible it could have been caused by a bit of broken dish, from the position of the wound.</p>

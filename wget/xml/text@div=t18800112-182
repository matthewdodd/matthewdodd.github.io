                  </hi>. I am a painter by trade, and live at 42, Baleman Street, Deptford—I have known Stephens for about four years—I was formerly manager of a running ground at St. Helena Gardens, Rotherhithe—during that time Stephens was in the habit of coming there to run—he told me that he was something in the chemist's line—after that I lost sight of him for about three years till last November, when I met him at St. Helena Gardens again, and I undertook to train him for a race that was to take place in january—no particular arrangement was made between us as to how I was to be paid—he did not come to me; I went to him at his house in Theobald Street, New Kent Road—he first took me there to show me where I should call for him every morning; that was in November—I was to call for him, and take him, and take him to the Lambeth Baths to train him—he said 'I shall soon move from here, as there are so many <hi rend="italic">D's</hi>, meaning detectives,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120133"></xptr>
               <p>coming to live about here"—I thought that a strange remark to make—I called for him every morning—on Monday, 1st December, as we were walking up the road from his house we met Harbord—that was not the first time I had seen him; I had seen him once before at St. Helena Gardens in November, where I was four years ago—I knew he was a com<lb></lb>panion of Stephens—there was another man speking with Harbord when we met him, and that man went on one side, and took Stephens on one side, and had some conversation—he then came back to Harbord, and the other man went away—Stephens said to Harbord "What do you think, he offered me 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them bottles that are worth 96<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—Harbord made some reply which I did not catch—we walked up the road, Harbord and the third man left us at the Elephant and Castle, and Stephens and I went on to the Lambeth Baths to train—while we were there Harbord came, and had a little conversation with Stephens—I did not hear what it was—we then all three left—in consequence of what had occurred on this day I went to try and see Inspector Phillips at Greenwich, him—on Tuesday morning I called at Stephens's house as usual; he showed me a bottle of pepsine, and said "This is one of the bottles that that man offered me the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozzen for"—I looked at the bottle, and saw the name of Morson on it—he also showed me a bottle of castor-oil or something to that effect—we then went out together, and called for Harbord at his house in some buildings called the Palatinate in New Kent Road—I stayed at the corner, Stephens went to the house, and Harbord came with him, and joined me, and we went on to the Baths, but Harbord left us again at the Elephant and Castle—after I had done training Stephens that day I parted from him, and went to Morson's, the chemist's, in Southtmpton Row—I saw Mr. Morson, and made a communication to him, and they telegraphed for Mr. Phillips—on the following day, Wednesday, the 3rd, I again called at Stephen's house—Harbord was there, and we three left together—when we got outside, Harbour left us—as we were walking along, Stephens said "I cannot go to the baths to-day, as I have got to go and meet a pal of mine in Holbourn, of the name of mott, to get some morphin, he works at Morson's," and in further conversation he said "We have got another pal, a night-watchman at Messers. May and Baker's. Battersea, where we can get red pri<lb></lb>cipitate and white calomel"—I said "How do you manage to get get it?"—he said "We get it when the police are changing between nine and 10 o'clock" that was all he said then—I left him—Iwent to his house in the evening, and he gave me a bottle of pepsine as a sample, and asked me if I would try and sell some—I took it away and showed it to Inspector Philips; that was not far off—next day, Thursday, I called on him again—I gave him back the bottle, and told him I thought I could sell some—he said "I shall be frightened to have anything to do with it, as the <hi rend="italic">D's</hi> turned my pal Mott over yesterday, and, as luck would have it, he had nothing on him, as there is not a night that he comes out but, as a rule, he brings something, little or much; now we will let it lay by for three or four months, till it gets blown over, as we have cleared everything out with respect to that"—we then left the house; Stephens put a bottle of pepsine in his pocket, and a bottle of pepsine lozenges—as we were going along, he said he was quite at a standstill for money, and could not go on with his training—he said "You can have any amount of red precipitate and white calomel, as we can get any amount</p>

               <p>of it; we have already filled up our customers"—we walked up to Harbord's house, and he left me at the corner a few doors away—he returned to me, and brought me a sample of red precipitate and white calomel; there was a very small amount, a little sample, in separate papers—he gave them to me, and said "These are samples"—Harbord had come out, and was standing by—we then all three walked down the road together—something was said about the price, and how much they could get by to-morrow morning, Friday; this was Thursday evening—Stephens said they would go to Batter-Bea that evening, to Messrs. May and Baker's—Harbord said "I don't know how much we shall be able to get you to-morrow morning, as I do not know whether Tom will let us have two or three runs or not"—we walked up and down the road—Stephens could not go to the baths that day, because they Were shut up, and an arrangement was made about the morning—Harbord said he did not think they would require a cart, as they would manage to get just as much as they could nicely carry, but by Monday they could manage to get between two and three cwt.—I said "Well, it was arranged that 1 should meet them on Friday morning at the Waterloo station at 8.30 with what they could bring—they said they left the stuff at a place at Battersea, but they did not say where; I can't exactly say which said that, it was in con<lb></lb>versation—they said they were to give a shilling a pound for it—on this occasion Harbord told me about the Greenwich affair—he said "We were charged at Greenwich last summer with having the same sort of stuff in our possession one night as we were going home, we were remanded for a week, but I talked to the Magistrate like a lawyer, and we regularly gulled the police by telling them that it was white lead; old Francis the detective got into the witness-box, and asked the Magistrate to keep it for another fortnight, and on the very day the fortnight was up we went and fetched it away; we sold it"—I told Inspector Phillips of the appointment I had made for the Friday morning—I went that morning about 8.30, just outside the station—Inspector Phillips was there and a police-sergeant—Stephens came out from the station alone—I said "Where is Harbord?"—he said "He is not quite so quick as I am"—the police then came forward and took Stephens into custody—he was carrying a black bag—I did not see Harbord come up; I went away at once as soon as the police took Stephens.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> R). On 13th June last I took the two prisoners into custody in Kender Street, New Cross—they were each carrying a flag basket—the one Harbord was carrying contained two small bags, and the one Stephens was carrying contained one bag—I did not put the stuff on any scales, but the total weight I should think was about half a cwt.—the prisoners said it was white lead; I could not tell but what it was—they said they got it from a watchman at Battersea—I did not have it analysed—I have examined this stuff now in Court, it was similar stuff to that, but it was not in the same sort of bags.</p>

I live at 53, Hope Street, Battersea—I am an engine driver at a quinine factory—I am the brother of the prisoner Harbord—I know this bag and basket; they were brought to my house at the latter end of July or the beginning of August, and they were there till the morning of 5th December, that was the morning the prisoners were arrested—my brother came down on a visit to me perhaps once a fortnight or once a mouth—the bags never left my house; they remained there till the morning of 5th December, when my brother and the other prisoner came down and took them away, the bag and the basket.</p>

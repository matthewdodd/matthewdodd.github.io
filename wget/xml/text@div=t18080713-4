               <p>Q. Your father is an attorney, you keep his house - A. Yes, I do. On the 13th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to go to my sideboard drawer in the dining room up stairs where I keep my laces: I took up my card of lace, I found it had been cut - three yards of this broad lace, two of this narrow lace, and one yard from a third card.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this drawer kept locked - A. Yes, and the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what number of yards was on each card - A. On the Sunday before I had seven yards of one piece of lace, seven yards of the other, and nine yards of another.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which did you find the greater number of yards taken away - A. From the broad lace - that was nine yards; it was all Valenciennes lace. I am sure I never left the key in my drawer, and I am quite sure I saw them there on the Sunday; I had measured it shortly before the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that on the Friday there were three yards deficient of the broad lace - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On your thinking they were something deficient on the Friday, did you take the trouble to measure them and see how much they were deficient - A. I did; and I found that quantity I have mentioned deficient: I came down and said, Mary I have been robbed of my lace and by you; she was very insolent and offered a great deal of abuse; she asked me if I meant to make her a thief; I said she undoubtedly was the thief, there was nobody in the house to go to it but her. After denying it repeatedly, she said Miss Combe I have stole the lace, if you will not tell your father I will bring it every bit back again, it is at my aunt Murray's, it is safe. I had never seen her aunt Murray then. I said run Mary and fetch me back my lace, and I will not tell my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else was by but yourself and her - A. No; she went out as if to go to her aunt's to fetch me back my lace; of course I exported it; she returned with her aunt, they both came in together, and said they had sold it to two strange men.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before that - something must have been said - A. The prisoner said this is my aunt Muray, she has something to say to you. I said, May have you brought back my lace that you promised me, she said no, I have not; then I says, if you have not I must go and tell my father, and immediately I went and made him acquainted how I had been robbed; my father said, Mary if you have pawned the lace give me the duplicates, and there is the door for you, and he would have paid her her wages; she said, and her aunt also, that they had not the duplicates, they had sold the lace to two strange men; they did not know how much for; at last they said they had burnt the lace; she told two or three stories at that time; she first of all said, that she had sold the lace to two strange men; then she said that Mary brought it to her on Wednesday morning; that she said in the hearing of the prisoner, and told her to take care of it till she called for it; that she never saw the prisoner afterwards till the Friday; on that day the prisoner came to her and said aunt I want the lace, for Miss Combe has missed it. and for fear you should be in trouble and the lace should be produced against me, here goes, and crammed it in the fire, and her aunt saw her burn it. My father not believing it, sent for an officer to take charge of her; Mr. Perry came, he took charge of her. I asked the prisoner how she came to rob me; she said she took the key slily out of my my pocket, cut the lace, and put the key slily in my pocket again. I never missed the key out of my pocket. I believe she said that in the presence of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you used to leave your bed room door open - A. She used to call me of a morning; she might have had an opportunity of taking the key out of my pocket; she did not say how she took them out, only that she took them out unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give a yard for this lace - A. Thirty shillings a yard for the broad lace, and eight shillings a yard for the other lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any person here that knows what lace you had - A. No; the lace has not been found; if she had returned the duplicates I should not have come here. I missed the lace about five o'clock; the prisoner was taken up the same evening about five o'clock; she had her hearing the next day. I always looked upon her as a very honest girl before this, and I hope mercy will be extended to her; I took her from the recommendation of a friend who knew her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long has this girl lived in your family - A. About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the lace - A. I suppose these four years; I bought eleven yards and a half of the broad lace; I have used two yards and a half of the broad lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Murray is not here - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did you cut the two yards and a half from the broad lace - A. About four years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. After your supposed loss - did you ascertain by measure whether any was taken off - A. Yes, it has been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you cannot misunderstand the question, I will repeat it again lest you should - you say you saw the lace on the Sunday before the Friday, then it contained nine yards - we are correct about that - A. You are.</p>
               <p>Q. And shortly before that Sunday you had measured it, it contained nine yards then - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the Friday, when you found it deficient<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130005"></xptr>measure it again - A. I did; in my father's presence; I did not measure it in the prisoner's presence. I said how many yards I had been robbed of before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell her how many yards you had lost - A. Because I did not know till I had measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to measure the lace behind the girl's back - A. My father charged her in custody immediately and I measured the laces the next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did it neither occur to you nor your father to measure the lace before you took the prisoner in custody - A. No. I told the constable it was about two or three yards of the Valenciennes lace; and that I missed lace to the value of five pound; I did not say how many yards, nor did he ask me.</p>
               <p>- PERRY. I am an officer of the Thame police. The prisoner was given into my charge; Miss Combe charged her with stealing four or five yards of lace, of different sorts; the prisoner and her aunt were present, they seemed to be very much alarmed. No lace has been found. Mrs. Murray was bound over; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She told you there were four or five yards missing; that was all she said - A. Yes; she did not say of the value of four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

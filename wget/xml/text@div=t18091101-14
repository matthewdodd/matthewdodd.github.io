               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, I had no acquaintance with him; I saw him once before; he was acquainted with a servant I knew; I desired the prisoner to call upon me any time that day, as I thought he was in distress, I would give him some meat; he knew where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought he was in distress, you would give him something - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of him after this time - A. My master sent me out to order the curricle to come.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out - A. A little before four; I happened to meet him at the corner of St. James's place as I came back, I desired him to call upon me when he saw my master and mistress were gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master and mistress go out - A. Yes; and that very instant they were gone the prisoner came into the hall to me, he seemed to be rather shivering with the cold, in consequence of that, I knew there was a fine fire in the drawing room, I brought him up to warm himself by the drawing room fire, I desired him to stop there a bit, 'till I brought him up some meat, and put it in paper for him. I left him sitting at the drawing room fire while I went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the watch hanging there - A. To the best of my knowledge it was there; I had seen it there that morning; I believe it was there at that time, after he was gone I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you down stairs before you missed it - A. Not five minutes; I returned with some meat in paper to him, and the prisoner seemed to be in a great hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. He was sitting by the fire when you returned, was not he - A. No, he was not; I left him sitting by the fire, when I returned he was near the drawing room door almost.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was he appearing to be coming out of the room - A. No; he did not appear to be coming out of the room; I asked him what made him in a hurry; he said he did not like to stop, he was in a hurry, he had four miles to go from Whitechapel somewhere. Then he pulled out one halfpence, he said if he had some more he would give me share of a pot; I told him I would not take it, but I would give him share of a pot. Then I saw him down stairs; as soon as I had put some coals on the fire I went along with him to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; I did not stay with him there more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave him there in the public house - A. No; he came out along with me; we parted at the corner of King-street, in St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted did you go back again immediately; I went into the drawing room to lay the cloth for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before your master and mistress came home - A. Yes. It occured to me that the watch was there, but I could not swear that it was there; it usually hung there and I did miss it; I did not know but my mistress might have taken it out with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you say it was after the prisoner and you went out together to your returning to the drawing room - A. He was not in the house five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent from the house - - A. Not ten minutes all together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about the watch to your master and mistress when they returned - A. Not till they spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not know but your mistress might have taken it with her - A. I thought she might have taken it with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was mentioned to you did you tell your master and mistress who had been in the drawing room - A. Not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You were conscious you had done wrong - A. Yes; I thought so.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought very right - when was it mentioned it first to your master and mistress that the prisoner was brought up by you into the drawing room - A. In a very short time after; I thought it right to acknowledge that I brought such a person up there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again, or the watch after this - A. Not till about nine o'clock the next morning.</p>

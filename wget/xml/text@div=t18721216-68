I am a sailmaker of 45, Ratcliff Highway—on 22nd November between 10 and 11 o'clock, as I was going into my house, Sullivan came up to me and snatched my watch from my pocket—I laid hold of him, other men came up, and he knocked my leg a from under me and I fell—I lost my watch and am sure I saw him take it.</p>

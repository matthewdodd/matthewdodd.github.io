                  </hi>. I keep the Bagnigge-wells Tavern, and I live there; it is in the parish of St. Pancras. On the night of the 29th of May, I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock—I saw that all the doors and windows were fastened—the house had been open, and company in it till half-past twelve o'clock—about two o'clock the following morning I was alarmed by the policeman—I got up and came down—I found two inner doors broken open by some instrument, and saw a poker there—they had broken out of the kitchen into the bar-parlour, and then into the bar—the drawers in the bar-parlour were lying about empty in a great measure—I consider that somebody had concealed themselves in the kitchen before I went to bed—I did not see any marks of violence outside the house—I believe no glass was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 30th of May, in the neighbourhood of Bagnigge-wells Tavern, and heard a noise inside the tavern—I went to the back of the house, looked over the fence, and saw a man getting out of the lower part of the window, which was open—it is a ✗ window—a wooden pane in the window opens large enough for a man to come through—he was coming through that place—I pursued him, and took him about twenty yards from the place—I found all this property on him (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—also a brooch and a box of lucifer-matches—I examined the outside of the house, but saw no marks of violence on it—I could not ascertain in what way he had got in—he might have got in at the same wooden pane he got out at—it was open.</p>

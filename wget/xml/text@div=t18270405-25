On the day of his Royal Highness the Duke of York's funeral, I left the house between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - my mistress, and a young lady who was visiting there, went out before me - I left no one in the house - I locked the door - I returned about a quarter past nine with my brother, whom I sent for the key which I had left at the greengrocer's - I stood at the street-door waiting for him, and heard a man in the passage - I looked through the key-hole, and saw one man there - I tapped at the door with my knockles, and the prisoner opened it from within - I am certain he is the man - another man then appeared - they were both strangers - I said, "Good God, is my mistress come home?" the other man said Yes- I said, "How long since?" he said, "Not long." I said,"Where is she?" they said, up-stairs. I said, "What ill?" they replied, "Yes, very ill." I asked if they had come home with her? they said, Yes. I opened the street door; they both walked out and said they should return presently, but never did. I ran up stairs and found it was all false, for my mistress was not at home, nor any body in the house. I missed a silver tea-pot and silver creamjug from the kitchen, which were safe when I went out; a plated tea-pot from the pantry cup-board, two large silver forks from the kitchen; a salt-spoon, mustard-spoon, and tea-spoon; I missed a silver desert knife from the kitchen - the silver tea-pot was a nice large one, worth full 9l. as old silver; the property was worth 25l. The prisoner was brought to our house on Monday evening last, the 2d of April - I recollected him well - I am quite positive he was one of the two men - I never had a doubt of him - they must have picked the lock, or used a false key.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's-shop. I was coming by on the morning of the Duke of York's funeral, and saw the prisoner standing close by Mrs. Farmer's house; I knew him before, and called to him, saying, "Halloo young man, you don't speak now;" he turned his face half round; I called to him on purpose that Buckeridge, who was with me, might notice his face - he was alone - I saw no more of him that day - this was about ten minutes past nine, and I heard of the robbery a very few minutes afterwards - I saw him again on Tuesday evening last, about nine o'clock, and took him into custody - I was quite certain of him - he wanted me to go into a public-house and have something to drink, to see if we could not settle matters - I said, that was more than I dare do - I had told him it was for a case in Manchester-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A trimmer. I gave him to understand he was in custody. I heard the house had been robbed a very few minutes after I saw him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the Duke of York's funeral I was returning home with Smith, and passing through Manchester-street, by the Marquis of Hertford's wall, I saw the prisoner standing, and looking up George-street, this was a quarter or twenty minutes past nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect - Smith pointed him out to me - I had a full opportunity of seeing his features - Smith spoke to him to draw his features into my observation - I am certain he is the man - I went to the office, and in a few minutes I heard of this robbery - he was apprehended last Tuesday night, and brought to the office - I went into the lock-up room and saw him - this house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw? A. Yes. I cannot be exactly certain as to the time. I suppose he was waiting for another person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not bad time to bring my friends here - the servant says she saw me in the passage at the same time the others say I was in the street.</p>
               <p>S. HARBUT re-examined. When he was taken he was brought to the house, and begged of me for mercy several times, saying he had a wife and family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken to the house she said she believed I was the man, and she believed that was the coat I had on.</p>
               <p>W. H. BUCKERIDGE. When she first came to the office, she was positive of him, and mentioned his dress; she never expressed a doubt about him. I heard him ask her to show him mercy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Shore, a farmer at Feltham. The prisoner was his labourer and drove his teams—I manage the chief part of the business. On the 30th of March the prisoner was going from Feltham with an empty cart, to get dung at Knightsbridge—he left Feltham a little before three o'clock in the morning I should expect—he had a cart and two horses—he ought to have been back between five and six o'clock in the evening—I tied him up three parts of a truss of hay for the horses—besides that I gave about a bushel of the regular feed, oats, beans, pollard, and chaff—I did not give it out—I allow them take it themselves—he has frequently done so—he had gone up to town two or three times a week—this was amply sufficient for two horses—we never feed with barley, and he had no authority to have any at all—the police-man showed me what was found in the cart—there was a truss of hay that weighed 65lbs.—he had no business with that—that did not include the three parts of a truss—there was about two bushels of mixed corn over the bushel that was allowed, that he had no right to, and a bushel of barley—there was a sufficient quantity to bait them three days.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> 27.) I met the prisoner driving his master's empty cart on the Staines road, going towards London—I saw he had some hay on the side of the cart, and a sack in the cart—I asked the boy who was driving where they were going—he said, to Knightsbridge—I thought all was not right—I detained him, and gave information—the barley was in the bottom of the sack, and the mixed food was above it—</p>

               <p>there was nothing to prevent their mixing together—I asked the prisoner how he came to have so much hay—he said he was allowed to tale what he thought proper, that his master tied some of it up, and he allowed him to take what bait of corn he liked.</p>

               <p>is about 100 yards from the prisoner's stable—he is a greengrocer, and has horses—I saw a track of crushed oats from the prosecutor's to the prisoner's stable, such as would be left from a hole in a sack—I went to the prisoner's stable, Foley stood on a cart and looked through the fanlight, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said I went to the prisoner's shop, 400 or 500 yards from the stable, and said that he had a sack of oats and a truss of clover in his stable, and I wanted him to give an account of how he became possessed of them—I was in plain clothes, but he knew me—he said "I bought them last night of a man called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I walked with him to the stable—he said three or four times in Foley's presence with an oath, "I am done"—I found this sack with a hole in it in the stable, with Mr. Cowan's name on it—it was tied above the hole—I took the prisoner to the station, and went to his house and found in his bedroom, on the first-floor back, 12 towels, 42 table-napkins, 2 sheets, 3 window-curtains, 2 oil paintings, a piece of a carpet, a sofa cushion, 2 pillows, a dressing-case, a woollen dress, one jacket, a shawl, 5 chair-covers, 2 yards of silk, a piece of cashmere, 2 table-covers; and a crumb-cloth—they have been identified by Mr. Nash—the sheets were between the bed and mattress, not wrapped up, but chucked in in a hurry—the other things were all strewed about the room, some in boxes and some on the floor—the room was in confusion—I went back and told him I had found all those things—he said "Yes, I bought them"—I found in that room two shawls and a timepiece which have been identified by Mrs. Roberts—I told him I had found them—he said that he bought them, but he did not say of whom, or what he gave for them.</p>

On the morning of 8th December I went to the prisoner's stable, stood on a cart, looked through a fanlight, which I shoved back, and saw Mr. Cowan's sack—when Bryers came back with the prisoner the door was opened—we went in, and the prisoner said, "God strike me dead, I am done"—we found some hay and oats in the stable, and had two men to take them away—we found two bushels of provender there, and another empty sack corresponding to this, with the name on it—I said, "How do you account for this sack and this provender!"—he said, "It came as the same time as the other"—he was asked about the other, and said that he bought it of a man named <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> last night at 12 o'clock, whom he had seen hanging about Rotherhithe Wall.</p>

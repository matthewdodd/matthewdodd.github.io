Some papers and a key of a desk belonging to my master, and a pen knife of my own in my coat pocket, and a pocket book, and within the pocket book there were two duplicates, one for a pair of small clothes, pledged for seven shillings, and the other for two books, and a one pound note, with sundry papers, the property of a banker, which had been given to me to collect the debts; there were other articles in my coat pocket, what is mentioned in the indictment; I went to bed about a quarter after nine o'clock, I fell asleep immediately, being fatigued with work; about eleven o'clock my wife came home, she asked me what the door was open for, I said I did not know; I told her I had fastened the door, I looked up and I asked her where my clothes was, she said she did not know, I said then they are stolen. I found every thing was gone; I was obliged to lay in bed till six o'clock, and then my wife went and borrowed some clothes of my landlord, who lived opposite; I went to the pawnbroker's in Long Acre, and informed them what I had lost, and of the two tickets that were in my pocket book, one for the breeches, which I had pawned at Mr. Murray's.</p>

I said I get old now, I must not drink any gin, she then said come along with me and have a little brandy, she gave seven pence for a quartern of brandy; she then said will you take this into the pawnbroker's, my sister sits over the way, I would not wish her to see me; I went without a thought, she told me to ask seven shillings for them; the young man in the shop would not lend any more than six shillings on them; she then said come with me to Mrs. Butler's, I will make you amends to-morrow; on the next day I went to Mrs. Butler's, she was there, she gave me these tickets, she said you may as well sell them, I went directly down to this man at Leicester-square, I told him that I had some tickets that I had of a woman, and he might as well have them as any body, she bid me ask four shillings, I said I do not think they are worth it; if you will give me three I think she may be satisfied; the man says I will give you a shilling, now, after dinner I will go and look at them, and you call in the afternoon, I did not know they were clandestinely got; I took the shilling and went back to this woman; I went to the man again the next morning, and he said they were stolen, I never was down in the street where the man lost his things above twice in my life.</p>

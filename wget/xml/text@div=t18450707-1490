                  </hi>. I am a steel and ironmonger, and carry on business in Old Fish-street. I took the prisoner into my service in May, 1844—I was to pay him 2 1/2 per cent, on some articles which he sold, and 5 per cent, on others—he was to account to me for all money he received the next time he came, which ought to Wve been next day—he lodged close by me—as soon as goods were supplied, if he wanted money he always had it—he certainly had no right to deduct from the money he received—on the 10th of May I discharged him—he sent in an account that day—he did not account to me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as received from Mr. Payne, nor for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received from, Mr. Cobley—they were customers of mine—it was his duty to account to me for these sums—I cmnot say whether he had received his commission for these orders, but whenever he asked for money he had it—by the account he gave me he made himself debtor to me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I entered his service as traveller in 1844, and was to make sales at 5 per cent, commission; I required an agreement, which was refused, and he said he would pay me weekly; in March he asked me for an account of sales made by me, which he entered, and the cash received—he then made out one list at 2 1/2 per cent., another at 5 per cent., and another for which he allowed no commission; this I remon<lb></lb>strated against, as in many cases I made sales at high prices, where he could have afforded 7 1/2 per cent.; I was desired to make out a statement, which I did, but I can show you it is wrong-the balance there against me</p>

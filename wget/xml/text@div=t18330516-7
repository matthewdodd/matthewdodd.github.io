On the night of the 18th of April, I went to bed about ten o'clock; the house was safely shut up - early the next morning I was awakened by the Policeman knocking at the door, I came down, and found the kitchen-window had been broken open, the shutters were forced, and two panes of glass were broken, which would enable a person to put their hand in to open the casement; there are iron bars, but they are wide enough to admit a small person through them - I went to the Police-station, and saw the articles mentioned in the indictment; I then missed them - I had not missed them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Who fastened the house up? A. I expect my daughter did; she is not here- this window was fastened before we went to-bed; I had seen it fast perhaps half an hour before we went to bed - I am married - my son was at home, and in bed before me - I did not see him in his room, but he was ill, and had some gruel, and went to bed half an hour before me.</p>
               <p>ITHIEL PRICE, JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. I don't know the prisoner - I did not see her in my father's house that night - I never saw her in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Upon the solemn oath you have taken, were you not in your father's house with this girl? A. Never; I did not get her through the kitchen-window that night - I had never seen her in my life - I never took any female of this sort to my father's house in my life - I did not give the prisoner 6s. - I never saw her in my life to my knowledge - when I got home that night, I went down stairs, and had some gruel, and went to bed at half-past nine - I did not get up till I was called by my parents the next morning - my brother-in-law, and my five sisters, were in the house - I have no brother - I was subpoened here by the solicitor for the prisoner - there is only one lodger in the house, which is a female.</p>

            . I was employed to watch some premises opposite the prosecutor's house - at an early hour in the morning of the 19th of April, I was standing opposite the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner come out of his kitchen-window with a parcel of things; she stood some time, and then came towards the door, and as she came she made some answer, as if she was speaking to some person in the kitchen - I crossed the road towards her - she concealed the parcel under her cloak - I could not see what it was - she went on, and turned down a court; I went and brought her up with the assistance of the private watchman, and gave her to the Police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any person put a bundle through the bars? A. No; I think the prisoner saw me - it was a few minutes before four o'clock - I did not see any man near there.</p>

            . (Police-constable K 72.) I was on duty at Stepney-green on the morning in question - the last witness gave the prisoner to me, and this bundle - I took her to the Station-house, and then went to the house - I saw two panes of glass broken, which would admit a hand to open the window - I cannot say how the glass had been broken, or how the window had been opened, it was open.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to ITHIEL PRICE. Q. Were there inside shutters to your kitchen window? A. Yes, which were fastened with a bolt at the bottom - the casement opens outside, and fastens with a turn buckle - there are some upright iron bars, which are rather too wide to prevent a small person from getting through - there was a bolt at the bottom of the shutter, which bolted into the cill, and that bolt was forced off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it such a bolt as it was possible for such a person as the prisoner to force off? A. I think she could - I never saw the prisoner before - I was at the Station-house; my son came there immediately after me - she made no remark of what the learned counsel has suggested- she said before the magistrate, when he asked her what sort of a man it was who took her into the house? that it was a good-looking middle-aged man, and she then had 6s. but the Policeman had searched her at the Station-house, and she had no money there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated, and in going down Mile End-road, a man stopped me close by this place, and took me into this house; he put some rubbish down for me to lay down on, and gave me 6s.; I had not put the 6s. in my purse, but between my stays and my bosom; the Policeman did not find it; but before I went to the magistrate the officer asked me if I had the money, and I showed it to him.</p>
               <p>COURT to ITHIEL PRICE. Q. Was any other man in the house? A. Only my son-in-law, who is here.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son-in-law. I was sleeping in the house with my wife - I certainly did not invite any one through the window - I never saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ITHIEL PRICE. These articles are mine, they were in my kitchen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What state was the fastening in inside the shutter? A. There was a small bolt in a very good state- I think a girl like the prisoner could have pushed it in with her foot while she was in the area, the bolt was not of that strength which it ought to be.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the bolt been put on with screws? A. No, it was an old bolt nailed on - I found the bolt, it appeared as if a person had shoved against it, the cill had given way a little, and the bolt had come off; but I had always trusted to the iron bars; the area is two feet six, or three feet wide.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what state did you find the kitchen-door that opens into the passage? A. That was bolted in the morning, no one had passed through there.</p>

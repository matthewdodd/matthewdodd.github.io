                  </hi>. I live in Thomas-street, Commercial-road. About 2 o'clock in the morning of 16th October, I was in Whitechapel-road—I met the prisoner's brother—I afterwards met the prisoner, he gave me a blow across my nose and knocked me down—he said I was the instigation of his brother being locked up—I fell on my hand and sprained it—when I was on the ground he kicked me on my right side—I was hurt a great deal—I went to the London Hospital, and had my hand bound up.</p>

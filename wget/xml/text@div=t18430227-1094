                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Camden-street, Newington. On the morning of the 11th of Feb., about seven o'clock, my journeyman left me—he had given me no notice—I went with the officer, on the 11th of Feb., to Camplin's house, which is next to mine—the officer knocked at the door—Camplin refused to let him in—he said, if she did not open it, he would break it open—she then opened the door, and said, "O my God, what shall I do?" and she offered me a sovereign to say nothing further about it—I found there twelve 2lb. loaves on a bed, partly covered over—I have every reason to believe they were mine—I had directed some one to watch my premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 181.) On the morning of the 11th of Feb., between six and seven o'clock, I was watching the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>mises—about seven I was at the back of the premises, and I saw Brown opening the bakehouse door—she had a pail in her band, which she placed outside the door—she then stood in the doorway—I saw Radford bring a quantity of bread, and give it to Brown—the yards of the prosecutor's house and Camplin's join each other—I did not see any thing of Complin at the time—as soon as Brown received the loaves from Radford she ran into Camplin's back-door immediately—I went to the front directly—I there saw Camplin standing in front, talking to a servant girl, who was taking down the shutters—Camplin then went in—I stopped a few minutes, and saw Camplin come out the prosecutor's shop-door in front—(I know the premises, she could get from the bakehouse out that way)—she then began to take down some of the pro<lb></lb>secutor's shutters—I then called the prosecutor, and went with him to Camp<lb></lb>lin's house—I knocked several times—Camplin would not let me in—she said at first there was a person in the house who was undressed—I knocked again, and she said she would not let me in—I began forcing the door, and then she opened it—I found twelve loaves on the bed, covered over, with the exception of three or four—they were quite hot, and some of them partly destroyed—I did not find any person undressed, but there was a girl there—I asked her whose bread that was—she said it was hers—I called in the prosecutor—Camplin was then greatly confused, and said, "O God, what shall I do?"</p>

I saw Brown bring some bread from the bake-house—Camplin was walking about in the yard, apparently watching—Brown came and joined Camplin—they both went into the back of the home occupied by Camplin, with the bread.</p>

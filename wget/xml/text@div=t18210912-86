            . I am a marshalsman. I was with the witnesses. I had told Wells to leave the fair; he turned round as if to go; but Hayward said he had as much right to be in the fair as any body else. We laid hold of them, and two others who were with them, escaped. I found five bad shillings in Wells's left hand pocket - they appeared quite fresh.</p>

               <p>HAYWARD'S Defence. Nobody was with us. I came to the fair with my family, and went into the Ram, to have a pint of porter, and found a parcel under the seat, containing this silver; I enquired whom it belonged to, and shewed five to Wells, he said he thought them bad - I said, "If so, we will not attempt to pass them." They were in a paper, which was written on</p>
               <p>"Give the sergeant 12 s. and the corporal 2 s. 6 d." We were walking round the fair, and the officers came up. I never offered to pass any of them - I had good silver enough to bear my expences.</p>

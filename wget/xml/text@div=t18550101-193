I have known the prisoner some years—he brought me this bill on 23rd Dec., and asked me if I would pay it through my banker's—it is dated at San Francisco—he said that it came from California, and that he came by it unexpectedly—I did not ask him on what account, or any particulars about it—I was not inquisitive about it, or interested in it—it had some few days to run because there was a grace upon it—I consented, and advanced him 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at different periods in the course of those few days—there was a funeral at the time for which he wanted an advance—I afterwards, on 27th Sept., wrote him a cheque for the balance, 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the indorsement of D.

I am butler, at Arthur's Club, St. James's-street, and was a friend of Donald Ross—he fell into distress, after keeping a public house, and went to live with his wife and child—he had no rela<lb></lb>tions in London that I know of—I am acquainted with his writing—this indorsement, "D.

                  </hi>. I have been in London on this business since 16th Sept.—I have seen the little girl just now—I have been endeavouring to find her often, since I have been in London—I was always looking for her, but could not find her—I went to the prisoner for the child, and he said he never would give her up, or anything belonging to her; that he would not give me a stitch of her mother's clothes, and told me not to lay a hand on them—I said, I <hi rend="italic">ken'd</hi> that there was plenty of clothes, and he said that there was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The child was with you for a week? 4. Yes—she</p>

               <p>did not run away, but she would not come back again—she was lodging in the same lodging with me, at Limehouse, for a week—that was after the death of the mother—it was the week I came up—I found her in the lodging—I live in the same parish with Mr. Campbell, in Scotland—he did not advise me not to come up—I did not see him—they call me <hi rend="italic">Aunt Peggy</hi>—when I came up to London, I went to the prisoner's, and the prisoner immediately came to me, to where the child was living—he left me there, and paid for the lodging—I took the child to him one day, and she would not return—I was not for her to stop with him—I wanted her with me, and she would not come—I had not corrected or whipped her, I had no occasion—I never laid a hand on her.</p>

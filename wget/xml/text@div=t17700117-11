            . I rent a room of the prosecutor, and work in the same room he does. I saw the box and things in it. About a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner came up to me as I was at work. I said, Where is my landlord (knowing he had been drinking with him all the evening ). He said he just came from him at the public-house. He asked me where his wife was. I said she is gone out to see one of her acquaintance. He wished me a good night and went away; and in about half an hour he and another man came up again; he took a chair and sat down. He brought a pair of old shoes to mend. He got up from his chair and began cursing and swearing to the other man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170010"></xptr> that came with him. They frightened me to death to hear-them cursing and swearing so. The other man walked behind me and took the box in his arms. Gentlemen, said I, what do you mean by that? The prisoner came and leaned over me and said,</p>
               <p>"Not a word by Jesus!" He stood over me till the other man got down stairs that I should not stir. He did not lay hold of me, but it is my opinion if I had offered to stir, he would have killed me. Then he said, Light me down stairs. I took the candle and lighted him down. I was so much frightened that I returned to my own garret and was afraid to leave my room all night. I sat up till the watch went twelve, and my landlord came home about half an hour after. Then he called to me to know where his box was. I told him what had been done. He made me get up: then we went to the prisoner's house: we found he was in bed. He said he knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Davis. I never saw him before. He was about five feet seven inches high, and had had the small-pox. After the prisoner was taken up, one

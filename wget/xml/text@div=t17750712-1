Some time afterward, I recollected that I had not taken out of the pocket, a canvas bag with three ten pounds, and a twenty pounds bank note. I went to his house, and asked for him; he was not at home; I asked the man for my coat, I unbuttoned the pocket where I had forgot before to search, and the bag and notes were gone. I was much vexed, Mrs. Bates asked me what was the matter; I told her, in the cloaths there was a canvas bag and bank notes. She asked me if I could remember the numbers; I told her I could not just then. I went to the bank, and enquired of the clerks whether any body had been there with the notes for cash; one of the clerks examined, and told me there had not; I told him I had sent my cloaths to the taylor's to mend, and there were some bank notes in the pocket; I desired him, when they should be brought, to take notice of the man; that the taylor was a tall man in a dark grey coat. I saw him come home. The clerk of the bank came and informed me the prisoner had been at the bank with a note. He said he passed him in Honey-lane market; I went to seek him, and I presently saw him go by. I called him; at last he turned about and came over; I took him into a parlour, and said I gave him my cloaths, that in an inside pocket there was a canvas bag with fifty pounds in notes. He said he saw nothing of it. I told him, he had it. He said no. I told him I knew he had been at the bank, and bid him go home and bring them to me. He went, but did not come back. The next morning I charged a constable with him, and took him to the bank. He said, he never was there in his life: this was on the 20th, the day after he had changed a ten pound note. The clerks said they knew him. He still denied it. They told him they were sure he was the man, and told him what a dangerous thing he had done, and desired him to go with me and make it up. I said, if he would give me sundry notes for the ten pounds he received at the bank, I would make it up, but he refused to do that. We went; and had a hearing before Alderman Hopkins, who sent him to Wood-street compter.</p>
               <p>On the Prosecutor's cross examination, he said that it was before breakfast he sent for the prisoner, and delivered him a coat, waistcoat, and breeches to repair; that after breakfast he went to see after the notes, and found the prisoner at work on the cloaths; that he did not examine the pockets before.</p>

            . I live just by the prosecutor; I was at his house the morning he lost the notes, and he acquainted me with the affair. He told me one was a ten pound note he had given me cash for; it was an old note with a good deal of writing upon the back, and the inside had writing on it. I do not recollect the number. I told him if I could see the note I could almost be positive to it. I saw it afterwards at the bank, I was sure it was the note, for I changed no other note with him.</p>

This bank note being an old one, he was ordered to go into the accountant's office, and have it examined, which he did; then he brought it in to me to mark for payment; I gave it him again, and told him to write his name and place of abode upon it; he went, I saw him write on the note, Brown, Stanhope-street, May fair; he only wrote Brown at first, I asked him whether he had a Christian name, he hesitated a little, and said John; I put the word John to Brown; he went and received the money for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boults on his cross examination said, that the prisoner came with the note between eleven and twelve o'clock; that the prosecutor had been there ten or fifteen minutes before to describe him; that when he saw the prisoner come in, he told them the taylor was come, and that he was positive the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court to Mr. Haywood. Is this the bank note you sent to Mr. Bates?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I believe it is by the number of writings that are upon the back: there was a scruple when I changed this note, there was so much writing upon the back; I did not take so much notice of the names.</p>

            . I am in the service of the bank. On Monday morning the 19th of June, the prisoner offered this note for payment; it being an old note, he was to get it examined; after it was examined, he wrote his name, John Brown, Stanhope-street, May fair; before this, Mr. Bates had been with me, and had given me a description of a man he suspected had these notes; in consequence of which, Mr. Boults desired me to step after this man, and see where he went; turning up an alley which leads to Honey-lane I missed him; I went and told the prosecutor the man he described had been. The prisoner came by soon after in the dress I had described him in; he was called into their house, and charged with it, but he denied it. I saw no more of it till he was brought to the bank by the constable.</p>
               <p>George Hall. I am a teller at the bank of England. I paid the prisoner a ten pound note in the name of John Brown. I asked him if his name was Brown; he said yes; I paid it about eleven o'clock.</p>

There wanted several places mending in the lining; he said, do what is to do, and let me have them; I told him what there was wanted doing. My man did not come to work that morning at six, I went and called him, he came to work some time after; then I went to White-street, and measured Mr. Hunter for a waistcoat and pair of breeches, I did not leave him till half after eleven o'clock; then I proceeded through Lincoln's Inn and several other places, and we parted on Snowhill. I never was in the bank before Tuesday morning in my life.</p>

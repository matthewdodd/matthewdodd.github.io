               <p>HUGH EVANS Sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Clipstone-street, No. 2; I keep a shop. On the 13th of May, I was serving a person in the shop, and I noticed the prisoner turning into my passage; knowing my yard was full of linen, I suspected he wanted to steal the linen. As soon as I had done serving the person, I stepped out of the parlour; there is a door that opens out of the parlour into the passage, and I opens this door, and I see the prisoner standing near to the top of the kitchen stairs; I asked him who he wanted? he told me that he wanted a person up stairs; that was all I could get out of him. I took hold of his collar and told him, I believe you are a thief; he had his right hand under his great coat; I perceived some bulk there, and I felt it, and found it was a quart pot; I looked out to see if I could see any of Mr. Llewyn's men about the door, he lives opposite me, and I see the boy, and I desired the boy to send his master over to me; and in the mean time, just before Mr. Llewyn came over, the prisoner stooped down and put the pot on the ground, and said that he had no pots. When Mr. Llewyn came over I told him that I catched that man stealing his pots, and I shewed Mr. Llewyn the pot that came out of his pocket; Mr. Llewyn took up the pot and said it was his property; Mr. Llewyn took the pot in one hand and him in the other, and led him out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the pot had been before this man came into the house? - Some of my lodgers, I suppose, had beer in it; I had not seen it till he pulled it out of his pocket. I thought he was going after my linen in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the back door open? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not catch the pot on me; It was set down in the passage.</p>
               <p>Llewyn. After I had dragged him into the street, I took him twenty yards, and I felt something else come against my knee; and I said, you have more pots about you; and there were two more quarts and three pints on him at that time, none of them belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had no more pots about him? - Yes, he did say so before we took him out. After the neighbours came, and we took him into our own house, tied all the six pots together, and went to the public office; we marked our pots with different marks at the bottom, and he was committed from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you serve Mr. Evans's lodgers with beer? - I serve some of them, and some of them I do not; I believe there is one in the house I do not serve.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that pot is your's? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200140"></xptr>Q. To Evans. Was it the same pot that Mr.Llewyn took up that he put down from under his coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I picked up these pots and put them in my pocket. I work for Mr. Cliff, in Swallow-street, he puts me in possession very often; he has attended these two days, but to day he has got an appraisement. I have a wife and six children; and I have been forced to be beholden to a friend to keep me since I have been in this predicament.</p>

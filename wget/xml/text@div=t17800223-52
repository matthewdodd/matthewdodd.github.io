               <p>On the 15th of January I was going into the country with two ladies; I stopped at Mr. Smith's in Eastcheap. I went in and left orders with his clerk for him to send some things into the country; when I came out I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner running, I pursued him, and at a little distance a gentleman stopped him. I brought him back to the chaise; he made an attempt to bite my hand; I let him go, and some people took him, and brought him into Mr. Smith's compting house; the trunk was dropped a little on one side the post-chaise. While he was in Mr. Smith's compting house he offered to go for a soldier or a sailor.</p>
               <p>Did he confess cutting the trunk away? - Not before me.</p>

I said, d - n your eyes, what are you doing of? and immediately he dropped it; the prisoner crept from under the chaise and ran away. I cried out, stop thief, and another man took the prisoner by the collar.</p>

               <p>To Thorpe. Are you sure the trunk was fixed to the post chaise? - Yes; and very fast. I felt it as soon as I came to the door.</p>

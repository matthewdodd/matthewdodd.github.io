               <p>Q. Have you heard the indictment read over?</p>
               <p>Walter. I have; I lost all those goods on the 25th of December last. I went out to dinner on Christmas-day, the prisoner lodged in a ready-furnished room at two shillings a week in my house, I left my room-door locked, but when I home found it broke open, and several other locks; I left her at home, when I returned at about a quarter after ten at night she was gone, and all the things mentioned in the indictment. I found some again at the prisoner's lodging, and some at a pawnbroker's, by her directions, where she said she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to be taken?</p>
               <p>Walter. She sent me a letter owning the fact, and after that came to my house, but I was so much affrighted I could not bear to see her, and bid her go out of the house; she did, and was not taken till last Wednesday. I was informed she was a patient at St. Bartholemew's hospital,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090017"></xptr> there I took her. I took her before my Lord-mayor; I gave in a list of all the things I had lost, and she owned she had taken them all before my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the list read over to her?</p>
               <p>Walter. I gave it to some of the people, whether it was all read I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure all these goods were left in your house when you went out on Christmas-day ?</p>
               <p>Walter. I am sure the greatest part were, for aught I know she might have taken some away before.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before?</p>
               <p>Walter. There were many of them in a trunk, and the trunk was broke open that day, part of them were in a chest in my room, and part of them locked in a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that chest of drawers was locked when you went out?</p>
               <p>Walter. Yes, I can; I always kept them locked whether I was abroad or at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other lodgers in your house?</p>

               <p>Walter. I had men-lodgers, but they were out then; there are three of them, two came in after I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room you found the goods in an apartment in your house?</p>
               <p>Walter. No, it was in a lodging she went to after she left my house. She owned this letter she sent to me, and that she wrote it, and desired my Lord-mayor to read it through. (It was read to this purport:)</p>
               <p>'' Mrs. Walter,</p>
               <p>'' I think myself very wicked to use you in '' the manner I have, but had I been in my '' senses at that time I would have scorned to have '' acted such a thing by any body, much less to '' you; but I hope your goodness will bear me '' no ill, for I cannot enjoy one moment's peace '' till every thing is returned to you, and I think '' is my duty to let you know where they are '' pawned, it being out of my power to redeem '' them, that you may get them again; and as '' soon as I got a little money I will return yours '' first, and then to them. If you go to Mrs. '' Mullings's in Hare-court, you will find a pair '' of silver tea-tongs, three tea-spoons, a yellow '' stuff silk gown, another silk gown, the silk '' waistcoat and a cotton gown.'' Giving an account what they all lay for, and likewise where to find the rest of the goods; concluding she was heartily sorry for what she had done; and by way of postscript observed, poor Mr. Delerant is cast for life. Signed by her name, and directed to Mrs. Walters in White -horse-alley, Cow-cross, near West-smithfield, London.</p>

            . I live betwixt Aldersgate-street and Jewin-street, in a little square, the prisoner came to lodge in my house in the beginning of January last, and she brought a trunk and bundle with her. After she had been at my house nine days she went to an alehouse just by, and at her return there came in a man, and challenged her to be a thief; and when he went away, he said, he would go and get some help and take her up. When he was gone away she went and left her things behind. In about half an hour after she was gone away, Mrs. Walter came to my house and owned these goods here produced, (which were divers sorts of wearing apparel. )</p>
               <p>Catherine M'Lane. I live at the bottom of Cow-lane, near the prosecutrix; when the prisoner lodged at her house, I was in the court before the window. I saw a light in the prosecutor's room above stairs, about eight at night on Christmas-day; I called and asked if Mrs. Walter was at home, the prisoner came down with a candle in her hand to the door, and I observed there was no light in the room above, she answered me Mrs. Walter was gone out; she had been up stairs making her beds and doing her work. The next morning we had the account of Mrs. Walter's being robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you lock that room-door she speaks of above stairs at your going out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, I double-locked it.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Mullings produced a blue silk petticoat, a pair of silver tea-tongs, three silver tea-spoons, one yellow stuff silk gown, one India silk gown, one silk waistcoat, flowered, one cotton gown. )</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. I am a pawnbroker; my servant took these goods in, all but the tea-tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. I live at the corner of Hare-court in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your maid?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. She was brought to bed the day before yesterday.</p>

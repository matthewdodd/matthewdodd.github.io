             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a particular acquaintance of mine, and I was drinking with him one evening about nine, at the Black-horse, on the first of May, I said I was going to lay out of my lodgings that night, and I parted from him; the next day I went home to my lodgings and I missed my things, I went and found the prisoner in the New Road, and I took him immediately, and I told him he had taken these things of mine, and he owned it; he had my shoes and shirt on, and trowsers in his pocket, he told me he had made away with the rest, that he had pawned them or sold them.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promises of favour if he would tell you the truth? - No, I did not, I never found any of the other things, I lost the other things that are mentioned in the indictment, the constable took charge of the man, and I found the shoes upon him, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>(The shirt and trowsers deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you mention to him that these things were your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was drinking with him that evening, he told me I was welcome, he would lend them to me, he and my wife got intimate together and he deluded her away, on the 24th of April, I caught her and him together, and she in his room, on Tuesday I could find no tidings of them, and at eleven at night on Saturday I found her concealed in his room, I looked for them all day on Monday and Tuesday, and could hear nothing of them, when he lodged along with me, he used to wear my things and I his, so I made bold to put on a shirt, and I was bringing it back to his lodgings when he took me, he said before the Justice when I was fully committed, if I would give it from under my hand not to trouble him, he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to make away with the other things? - They had distressed me, and I did it for want.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Why is not your landlord here who saw this man as you say come to these lodgings? - The woman was at home, I did not ask her to come, I asked the Justice whether I had witnesses enough of it, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard what the prisoner has said about your going away with his wife and about your wearing his things? - Yes, when I lodged along with him, I wore his things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>Jury. What way was the prisoner going when you met him? - He was going to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Court. That turns out a very material question in the way in which it is answered, though it might not have been so material if it had turned out the other way, perhaps this may save the trouble of going on with this matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an electro-typer, of 6, Olney-street, Walworth—about ten minutes to 10 on the night of 17th November, I was in New Bridge-street Blackfriars, waiting for a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> just outside the door of the York Hotel—the prisoner accosted me, and I had some conversation with her—I observed two gentleman, in appearance, standing outside the hotel, one with a peculiar thick stick—I had a watch and short Albert guard attached—I pot my hand down and felt my chain hanging down, the watch was still in my pocket—I took it out of my waistcoat-pocket and put it into my trousers-pocket—immediately afterwards I felt a movement at my trousers-pocket, and saw the prisoner's hand leave there, with the watch in it—I seized hold of her hand, at the same time she gave a cough, and three men rushed round the corner—one seized me behind, and I immediately felt a blow on my head—my hat was completely crushed—they hustled me about, called me a villain, and requested me to leave the woman alone—the prisoner stooped and bit me on the hand, and I was forced to let go of her—the other two men pulled me about, and kept me away from the prisoner, and I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw her pass the watch to one of the men—I was being pushed about—I was pushed ten or twelve yards up and down—I watched the prisoner proceeding up the court, while two of the men had hold of me—when they let me go, I immediately pursued the woman—I overtook her at the top of the court near Ludgate-hill, and gave her in charge.</p>

            . As I came out of Grafton mews I saw the cistern at my master's door, I saw a man take it from the door and put it down on the flags.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the foot path. - A. Yes, this was the day before Christmas day. I saw this man speak to a milkman, what he said I do not know; the milkman put it upon the top of the prisoner's back, when I saw him go off with the cistern; I went round Fitzroy market and met him, I said what are you going to do with this cistern; by Jasus, he said, I do not know; I said, my friend carry that cistern back where you took it from and start off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry it there. - A. No, I told him to clap it down upon a bundle of hay that was just by, and start off directly; he took the knot off his shoulder and began to run, I knocked him down. I secured him myself and took him to goal.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is your master's cistern. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perform your promise with him, you told him to start off, and after he put the property down you knocked him down. - A. He tossed it off his shoulder and injured the cistern.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had put the cistern down upon the bundle of hay you would not have knocked him down. - A. I should not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

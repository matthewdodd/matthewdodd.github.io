On the 14th of August I was at Bell-wharf, Shadwell, talking to my sister; the prisoner crossed over, and asked me for a bed; I said if he would come with me he should have my bed, and I would sleep with my landlady - he did so, and next morning I let him out at half-past four o'clock, and went up immediately; I then saw a new bonnet destroyed on the table; I then missed the shoes, reticule, and scarf - I have seen them since.</p>

On the 26th of June, six years ago; I am a dress-maker and tailoress - I had not known the prisoner before, but we both came from the north; he had had a little drink, and I said if he would go home with me, I would give him a bed; I took him to a room up stairs, and left him there; I was not in the room with him long - I did not attempt to go to bed with him; he did not complain of losing any money.</p>

            . (Police-constable K 154). I met the prisoner at Bell-wharf, about half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 14th of August, about half a mile from the prosecutrix's - I had received the information soon after four o'clock; I found this scarf in his hat, and the shoes and reticule in his pocket; he said he would give me 5s. and the articles to let him go, as he had a large family at Shields; that he had had 10s. in his pocket the night before, and had been robbed of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been in company with my brother, and had a good deal of drink; this woman came and took my arm, and asked where I was going - I said,"On board my ship;" she coaxed me to go home and stay with her; I had four half-crowns, and some other money - she pulled off my things; I said, "If I can't sleep by myself, I will go out of the house;" when I awoke in the morning I had not a farthing, and I took these things out of vexation.</p>
               <p>MARY SHARPE. I did not pull off his clothes; he pulled off his jacket and trousers, and left on his drawers and shirt; I did not lead him from where I saw him; he took hold of my arm, and spoke to me while I was speaking to my sister; I had been to the doctor for a bottle of stuff for my cough - I did not take him home for improper purposes; when I awoke in the morning, I heard a footstep, and I said I thought it was that man; I asked my landlady for her shawl, I put it on, and opened the door for him; he said,"Good morning," and went away.</p>

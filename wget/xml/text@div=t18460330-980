                  </hi>. I live in Carter-street, Houndsditch, and travel the country with caps—I was at the Rose and Crown, at Wandsworth, on the 11th of March—I had some refreshment—I left between eleven and twelve at night—I was followed by the prisoner, who said it was too late for me to go on, and a man who had been in the public-house drew his hand across my mouth, and blackened my face, and one of them pulled my bonnet—I had another female with me, whom I had met in the street, and took her in to have some refreshment—these men followed me, advising me not to go into town, as it was late, but to go to a place they would take me to, where I could sit with safety till the morning—it was a shed in a yard—I consented, is I had no other place to go to, unless I came to London—when I got part of the way, the prisoner, who was with me, put his arm round me, and said he must have what I had—I had nothing but a small parcel, and the money in my pocket—he tore the pocket from my side, and the bundle from my hand, and my shawl off my neck—I ran away, screaming "Murder!"—he tore my gown in getting my pocket—I had a half-crown piece, one shilling, and two halfpence—he took that, pocket, and all—I saw him go into a house in the court, and I heard a loud laugh—I went to the next house I saw lighted, and saw two men with their hats on—I begged them to get an officer—they went to the station-house with me—I related what had happened, and the policeman went to the house with me—he found the things afterwards—the prisoner is the man—I told the constable I could swear to his voice.</p>

I went to Matin's yard with the prosecutrix—she pointed out where she had been robbed—I went into a water-closet, and found the prisoner—directly he came out she said, "That is one of the men"—we went into the house—I asked the prisoner if he had any money—he produced this bag—I turned it out, and found a half-crown in it—the woman said, "If it it mine, it has two dents On the edge," and it hat two dents—the prisoner said he got it from his master, and he had not seen the woman.</p>

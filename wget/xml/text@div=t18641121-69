                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house, I, Union-place, York-road, Batter-sea—on 1st November, about half-past 2 o'clock, Denman came in, and I served him with three pennyworth of meat—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him a florin and threepence, and he left—I kept the half-crown in my hand, and in five or ten minutes found it was bad—I went into a dozen beer-shops, and then to the police-station, and gave the half-crown to a con<lb></lb>stable who went with me, and I saw the two prisoners at a distance; that was an hour afterwards—I recognised Denman—Hunt was walking with him—Denman turned round, recognised me, and they walked on—he took a paper parcel out of his pocket and put it into King's right hand; King put it in his right pocket—the constable laid hold of both of them, and just as we got to the water trough, King swung the constable round, and I thought he put it into the ostler's pocket as I saw a paper pass from his hand—I laid hold of the ostler by the collar, but the policeman told me it was all right, and I let him go—the prisoners were taken to the station and put in the dock—King was then taken into the office to be searched, and Denman was put to the bar—I asked him what was in the paper he had passed to King—he said, "Only a piece of paper to light his pipe"—they both denied know<lb></lb>ing each other before.</p>

On 1st November, I was at the station and saw a half-crown produced—I went in search of Denman, and saw both prisoners walking together in High-street, Wandsworth—after Hunt joined me Denman dropped in rear of King a few yards, put his left hand in his trousers pocket, and pulled out a paper parcel which he put in King's right hand—I seized them both, and they swung me round—King bad this parcel in his hand, and it went either to the horse trough or on the ground—I took them both to the station—I searched King first, and found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good silver, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a token; on Denman four good shillings, a halfpenny, and a farthing—when I apprehended them they each said they had never seen each other before—the ostler came to the station and gave me a packet containing six florins, a half-crown, and three shillings, wrapped up separately and all bad.</p>

On the 2d of January my watch hung by the side of the shop-window-any person could get it by breaking a pane of glass, and putting their hand through. I saw it safe about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, it was then dark. I was in the back-room, and heard the glass break suddenly. I immediately ran into the shop, and missed the watch; I went to the door, and found it tied with a cord - I could not get out-the window was broken - A hand must have been through to take it.</p>

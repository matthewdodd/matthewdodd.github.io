               <p>Stringer.

               <p>Bowers. It is not worth three pound, but I suppose he took it for a gold one.</p>
               <p>Justice De Veil. The Prisoner when he was before me did acknowledge he was the person who broke open the shop, and let all the persons in who were concerned with him in this robbery: Those two watches and the key were produced before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know the key and the metal watch were found upon me; I can tell how I came by that watch; I did go to Mr. Bowers, and asked him to lend me eight pound upon the watch; I can prove how I came by all the things: The silver watch is my own, I broke the minute hand of it myself. Pmy ask the Prosecutor how many yards of cloth there are in those waistcoats, and whether the lining and buttons are his.</p>

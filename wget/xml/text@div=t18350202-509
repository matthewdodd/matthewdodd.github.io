                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Romney-terrace, Horse<lb></lb>ferry-road, Westminster. Early has been my foreman thirteen or fourteen months—the policeman produced a four-pound brick to me—I compared it with the other bread which I had—it was my bread—here is the one that came from it—it was joined to this in the oven—I saw the flour at the station—there were about thirty-two pounds of flour, allowing five pounds for the sack—I believe it was my flour—I could not swear to it—I had sacks of flour at home, which correspond with it—I could not miss it.</p>

About half-past six o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of January, I heard a tap at the bakehouse window—Early said, "Here is George come"—we both went up stairs together—Early opened the door, and I saw Jullion—I went out—when I returned, Jullion was in the bakehouse with Early—I did not hear what they said—I do not know how long Jullion staid—I was doing my work—Jullion took a handkerchief out of his hat, and put two of my mas<lb></lb>ter's loaves into it—he took them out of the bakehouse—I did not see him afterwards—I had seen him there twice before, and Early gave him some</p>

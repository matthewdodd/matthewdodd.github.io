            . I have been journeyman to Mr. Watts seven years: I was at dinner at the Griffin in Long-lane, on the 11th of June; going from thence to our shop, I saw the prisoner coming out of it; I said, William, what have you in your pocket, you seem to be loaded very heavy? Andrew, said he, I want to speak with you; he took me into a stable near the shop, and begg'd of me not to tell Mr. Watts, and delivered the iron out of his pocket to me; it was horse-shoes; I don't know how many there were, but they weighed twelve pounds three ounces. I said, it did not signify begging, for as soon as I saw my master I should tell him, which I did. I took the prisoner to the Griffin, and left him in the care of my fellow-servant till I got a constable and charged him.</p>

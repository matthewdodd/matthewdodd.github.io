            : Having missed a great many articles, I went to the prisoner's apartments, I think on the 28th of February, in a court in the Minories, and in one of the drawers found a paper parcel; when I asked him the contents of the paper, he informed me it was hops which his wife had bought in the Borough; but knowing it to be a sample of hops of my own, having no warrant, I asked his leave to take it home with me to compare; they were samples sent to me from Bristol; I found the marks corresponded with those I had; after that, I sent for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You keep fourteen or fifteen servants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there to know whether you had been robbed or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was confined to his bed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Mr. Davey.) Look at that sample of hops, how do you know it to be your property? - A. By the mark and number, which answers to the original invoice which I have in my pocket; it is one of a set of samples sent to me from Bristol, marked from No. 1 to 9, and this is one of the nine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of hops? - A. I believe about sixteen pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are two ounces? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you seen the inside of this parcel? - A. No, I have not opened it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you swear it contains hops? - A. From the appearance of it I conceive it to be hops; I have never opened it.</p>

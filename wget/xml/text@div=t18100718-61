            . I am a patrol. On that Sunday night I was on duty outside of Smithfield bars; I heard a voice call, stop thief, I made up to it, I saw the prisoner walking, I stopped him; the prosecutor came up in about two minutes, he said the prisoner was the man that had robbed him of his ribbon, seal, and key, the prosecutor had the watch in his hand, the pendant was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner did he appear to be out of breath - A. Not at all.</p>

On Sunday afternoon I was at the other end of the town, I returned at night; I was going up Long-lane, I went into a public house to get a small glass of liquor, before I drank it, I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prosecutor running after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180043"></xptr>a man, I followed them up St. John-street; and when I was taken in custody the man was before, and when the prosecutor left off running after the man, the petrol asked him if I was the man, he said yes; I then was behind the man.</p>

The man I seized said I squeezed him too hard, and hurt his arm; I loosened my hold, and sung out Watch! - he gave a rush, and got out of my hold, but did not run twenty yards before he was taken - he was not out of my sight. The watchman came up the moment he was stopped, and took him to the watch-house; my pocket-book contained five sovereigns. Hubbard is the man who put his hand into my pocket, and Rowe received the book - I am certain of him; it happened very near a gas-lamp: I could see Rowe's face, and he was taken in five minutes. I had sung out, "Stewart, I am robbed" - he came up just as Hubbard got from me; the other four escaped. I had been spending the evening at a club, but drank very little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. I suppose you were struggling with the man? A. Yes. It did not last five minutes; some of the men were between me and Stewart. I had drank very little. I said Rowe was the man, directly I saw him; I did not ask Stewart if he thought that man was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had you left your ship? A. About a fortnight; I was paid off at Plymouth, and had been in town three days. I had been at a baker's club with Stewart; I had not drank above half-a-pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that Hubbard did not come up when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140004"></xptr>you were struggling with another person? A. Yes - I struggled with nobody else. I had changed a sovereign, and spent 2s.; three of us drank together: I was not well, and drank very little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Stewart was behind you, and you called out? A. Yes - he came up in two or three minutes. - After Hubbard got from me I felt in my pocket, thinking my handkerchief might be gone also.</p>

            . I am a sailor, and lodged at the Edinburgh Castle. I took Dixon to this club, between five and six o'clock, at a house in Swan-street; as we returned, he was rather before me in Lemon-street - three men came up to him and three were behind them; Dixon called out, "James, my pocket-book is gone," and called Watch! I went up, and saw Hubbard hand the pocket-book to Rowe; Hubbard said Dixon was pinching him too hard - he then got away, and was taken by a man who stood by; Dixon caught hold of him again, and then the watchman came up; Rowe and all the rest ran away when they had got the pocket-book: I saw him give it to the others; Rowe was brought into the watch-house, and I knew him by his white coat - it was a clear night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. What had you drank? A. We had a glass of beer together, and drank some gin - we were quite sober. All six men were round him when he called me - it took us about five minutes to go to the watch-house. Dixon did not ask me if Rowe was the man; I am certain he is the man - I could not describe his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was there a sovereign changed at the public-house? A. Dixon changed one down stairs, and after that paid for a little ale. I do not suppose I was twenty yards from him when this occurred.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Lemon-street; Dixon called out and before I got to him Hubbard ran from him; Stewart stopped him: Dixon gave him into my charge for robbing him of five sovereigns and his pocket-book; as they were taking him along somebody said that was not the way to the watch-house; Hubbard said he would walk if they would let go of him - he let him go, and he ran up Lemon-street, towards the watch-house, for twenty yards, when Stewart and another man stopped him - we took him to the watch-house. I returned with one Mr. Scurr, to look for another man, and on my return found Rowe at the watch-house door; Scurr said he was one of the party - Rowe said nothing, and I took him into the watch-house; Dixon and Stewart said he was one of the men: they had both been drinking, but knew what they were about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. Did Dixon describe the man to whom the book had been passed? A. No. Stewart said there was a man there in a light coat; my meeting Rowe was quite accidental; he had a white coat on. Both the witnesses were rather in liquor, but knew what they were about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not Hubbard say that was not the way to the watch-house? A. I was not near enough to hear - he ran towards the watch-house when he got away.</p>
               <p>HUBBARD'S Defence. As I was going home I saw seven or eight people in the road - I crossed over - the prosecutor laid hold of me, and said I had robbed him - I told him to go away, for he was drunk; he held my arm so tight I wished him to let me go, which he did - I said I would go to the watch-house, and was walking away - he came after me, and I was stopped.</p>
               <p>ROWE's Defence. I was going home, and saw the prosecutor, his friend, and two or three more, walking up Lemon-street; I went up to see what was the matter, and when I got into the watch-house Mr. Scurr said, "I think you are one of the party, as one of them had a white coat on," but he should not like to swear to me; Dixon and Stewart both said they had no recollection of me - the watch-house keeper discharged me; I was going out, when Scurr said, "If I was not to swear to you I think I should tell a lie" - I was then locked up.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Suffolk-street, Borough. I was coming down Lemon-street, and saw an altercation in the road; I crossed to see what was the matter - a sailor-looking young man collared Hubbard, and accused him of robbing him; he said he was willing to go to the watch-house. I gave him my direction, in case I was wanted. Hubbard had come up at the time the altercation began - it was half-past eleven o'clock; I dare say there were fifteen or sixteen people round. I did not know Hubbard before.</p>

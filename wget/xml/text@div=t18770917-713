               <p>me, and Stannard leaning on some railings looking in an opposite direction—I was turning from Copenhagen Street with Sergeant Gorr—Marshall scraped the footway: Stanuard then looked towards us and then into a doorway, and immediately Hefford sprang from the doorway on to the foot way—they all came towards us—I asked them what they were doing there—Hefford said "I saw a key in the lock and went to see what it was. I tried to get it out"—we took them back to No. 53 and found a key in the lock—we roused the inmates and enquired of the lodgers in each room; the prisoners were there and could hear what passed—first Mr. Nettleton asked his wife, and she said she had not left a key in the door—Nettleton searched his pocket and found his own key—then we went to the lodgers in each room and they said they had not left their keys in the lock—this is the key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is too large, and I had some difficulty in getting it out of the lock, and when I did it was scraped as if it did not fit—Mar<lb></lb>shall was 4 or 5 yards from the door when I first saw him on the same side of the way, and Stannard about 1 1/2 yards—we took them in custody; they said they were out walking and were going to Highgate—it was quite daylight—they were taken to the Caledonian Road police-station—Hefford refused his address—I went to the address Marshall gave and saw his mother.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Highgate behind the coach Mr. Large was in. I observed the prisoner and another man stop the coach and rob the persons within it, but of what I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with the coach? - About two or three minutes, or hardly so much.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how they were armed, or whether they were armed at all? - They had pistols; they presented them to the coachman, when they first stopped the coach, and they had them in their hands when they robbed the coach; they used a great many bad words, and declared what they would do if they did not give them their watches and money; they blasted them and called them bloody buggers, and such other words. When they had robbed the coach they rode back towards Highgate. We stopped at Holloway turnpike. Mr. Oliver asked if I saw any thing of the other coaches coming up? I said, I did not see or hear any thing of them.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner was the person? - I know his person.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a hazey night; it was not very light nor very dark.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you, considering it was such a night as that, to swear positively to the person of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - On the Thursday night following at Sir

               <p>Did you express no doubt? - No. When I saw him in the publick-house I knew him to be the man directly. I told a man there so. He said I ought to take him or I deserved to be hanged myself. I said I would not take him without having Mr. Oliver's opinion, who drove the coach. I went to Mr. Oliver, he said he believed he was the man.</p>

I said to the person behind the coach, what is all this? He said, he did not know; the words were no sooner out of my mouth but that man came to the off side of the coach. he used rough language and bid me stop. As soon as he had bid me stop he rode up to the coach door and demanded their money.</p>
               <p>Was there another man with him? - Yes; the other man went to the other door; they robbed the people in the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what they said? - Not particularly; they used very rough language.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether they had any arms? - No. I turned my head behind me; they bid me look the other way. I cannot say I saw any arms.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with the coach? - I suppose three or four minutes; they were pretty quick about it; then they made the best of their way to another coach which belonged to the same company. They stopped the other coach just by the side of me; then they told me I might be d - nd and go along.</p>
               <p>Should you know either of the persons if you saw them again? - I cannot say I have any idea of their persons farther than their voice; I was obliged to look another way.</p>

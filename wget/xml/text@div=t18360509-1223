                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Thimbleby, and live in Old-street-road. I was standing in my shop between six and seven o'clock in the evening, of the 23rd of April, and beard the glass break; I turned, and saw the prisoner with her hands in the window, taking these rings out of the tray—I took hold of her by one hand, and picked up the rings with the other—I went outside, as soon as I heard the glass break—she had no opportunity of running away, because I was out so quickly—I asked her what induced her to break the window—she said she had a spite, and she was not going to run away—that she and her husband had been quarrelling, and if she was let go, she would do ten times more mischief—I cannot tell whether she was sober, she said she was—I gave her in charge—I took some of the rings off the pavement, and one ring she had on her finger, which was mine—she put it on the window; she said, she did this to be sent out of the country, to get rid of her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Old Nichol-street. On this after<lb></lb>noon. I saw the prisoner crying and asked, what ailed her—she said, she was going to break a window, and asked me to come see her do so—I said, "I will not, don't be a foolish woman"—I had hardly said so, before she went and broke this window—she is out of her mind, to tell you the truth; for her husband was drunk for a fortnight before, and even pawned the bed-cloths, and he had three young children—I think she was out of her mind at the time—she had nothing to cover the children, or anything to give them—when she broke the window, she stood still and was taken prisoner—her husband treats her very ill—he is very bad man, and a great drunkard, and spends all she earns; she is a hard-working industrious woman—I have known her two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I produce the rings—before she was committed, I inquired her character, which was that of a hard-working, industrious woman—her husband is the greatest reprobate in the parish.</p>

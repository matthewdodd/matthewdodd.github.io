                  </hi>. I am a packer to Henry Sturt, who has one partner, On Saturday, the 24th of July, the prisoner came with Mr. Barker's cart to our door in Wood-street to load—when loaded he was to go to different wharfs to deliver packages—he had a truss and a box to take to Hayes' Wharf—there was a direction on the box, "J. Footman and Co., Ips-wich" —he had another to deliver at Carpenter Smith's Wharf, to go to Penzance, and one at London-bridge Wharf—he was to pay the wharfage, and bring us back the receipts for it—he came back, and brought this shipping note from Carpenter Smith's Wharf, with a receipt on it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this one from Hayes' Wharf, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger at Carpenter Smith's Wharf. I remember a truss being found on the wharf, for Penzance—I do not re<lb></lb>member the direction on it—nothing had been paid for that truss, as no entry had been made in our books of it—I have he bottom was not written bill has come from our office, but the writing at the bottom was not written by any one authorised thorised by us—I am quite sure of that—there is no one in the concern whose initials are G.H.—it would appear that a blank bill was given to some person, and they have fabricated this recipt—any per<lb></lb>son could obtain one of these bills authorised applying at the wharf—I can say this is not the writing of any person authourised by us, from a knowledge of their hand-writing and signature—I think there are half a dozen per<lb></lb>sons authorised to sign receipts, clerks and pricipals—their names are, Richard Wilson, myself, Thomas Dare, Richard Martin Wilson, Thomas Wilson, and John George Dare—no one else is authorised to sign or such a receipt, and the money would in the regular course be paid to one or other of those parties, but to no one else—I found this truss in the warehouse—it might be deposited in the warehouse without its being perceived, or a car<lb></lb>man might pitch it down and go away, and the men on the wharf might take it into the warehouse, expecting he would return to pay the wharfage—it is usual when men bring goods to have a note—the man on the wharf receives the package, and signs the note in pencil, the note is brought into the counting-house, and from note the wharfage is paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you at this wharf on the Saturday in ques<lb></lb>tion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went there about nine the o'clock, and left about ten or eleven at night—I was there all day with the exception of going to my meals from one to two o'clock and from four to five—none of the other five persons who sign receipts are here—I am certain this "G H" Is not the singnature of any of those parties, from a general knowledge of their handwriting—every man writes differently at different times—I do and so do the persons at the wharf, but not so different as not to be able to distin<lb></lb>guish their handwriting from this.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Colley Street, Stepney Green, and am a carpenter—on Tuesday, 21st December, I met Pickford at Limehouse, behind the church, about 11.30—I had known him before; not as a friend, only by seeing him of an evening at the place I used to frequent—he had an umbrella with him—he said he was looking after a job—there was another man with him—it was not Morris—his name was William Sizely—I knew him, and had seen him frequently before—we went to an eating-house, and I lent him a shilling—we left there, and went to the arches in Bow Common Lane—we got there about 12.45—Pickford then said he was going to a woman for some money, and they went away—I waited four or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100039"></xptr>
               <p>five minutes—they did not come back to me, but I saw Sizely running first, and then I saw Pickford running after, and the witnesses after him—I went up and asked Pickford what was the matter—they had not told me what they were going to do before that—he had left his umbrella with me before he went away—he said, "You know where to take it to if we don't return in a quarter of an hour"—they never said anything to me about going to the house—Sizely ran outside the cemetery, under the arches, and got clear away altogether—Pickford had no beard on when he was with me, or when I joined him again—I asked him what had happened—he said, "Nothing, I will tell you another time/' and took hold of ray arm, and said, "Come on, come"—I said, "This is the way"—he said, "No, this is the way;" and we went to his father's house—the witness still followed us—I asked him whether he was following me or Pickford, and he said, "Neither"—I was with Pickford when he had the ale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known Pickford much before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Per<lb></lb>haps three months, only seeing him of an evening frequenting the place where I used to go—I have not given evidence before—I knew all the time that it was Sizely who was with Pickford—I did not hear that Morris was taken up until last Friday, when I was served with a subpœna—when we were in the public-house Pickford went out at the back—he went down the passage—I have stated before to-day who the other man was—I don't know Maritime Cottages, or the street where they went.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Spitalfields and am a master builder—the prisoner Morris is my son—I have ten children—I have been in business twenty years—I live at 61, Merchant Street, Bow Road—there was never anything against my son till this—I remember Tuesday, 21st December, very well—we left home at 7 o'clock and went to the workshop—we arrived there about 8—Maritime Cottages is about two miles and a half from there—my son was at work all day with the exception of a quarter of an hour, about 1 o'clock, when I sent him to fetch some tools from Crispin Street, Spitalfields—that about five minutes' walk—it was a public-house, the Horn of Plenty—I had been working there the day before, and sent him for the tools left there—he came back in about a quarter of an hour and was with me till 5 o'clock, when he went home with me and had his tea—after my son was committed I received a letter from him, in consequence of which I found out about Fleming—I communicated with the police—I told them I had the man who was; with Pickford, and they refused to go with me—they said they could not take him or do any<lb></lb>thing with him—I saw Fleming the Friday after the committal, and I sub him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the police who the young man was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told them about Fleming, but I did not know the other young man's name; but I found it out when I went to Fleming—my son works regularly with me, and has done for five years—we were doing a job at the Horn of Plenty—we were at work there the whole of the week up to Christmas Eve—two men were working for me as well—my son did not go away to get his dinner—he was only away a quarter of an hour when he went to get the tools.</p>

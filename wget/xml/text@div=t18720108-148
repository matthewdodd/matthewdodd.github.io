                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Wells, who keeps the Walton Arms beer-shop, High Street, Poplar—about 3 a.m on 2nd January, I was awakened by some noise in the bar—I called up my nephew, and we went down—a constable had the prisoners in custody—I was shown a tin can and stone bottle, which contained some ale and stout—they were my husband's pro<lb></lb>perty—I fastened every place up the night before, excepting the back door, which was left on the latch for a lodger—I bad closed the shutter of the kitchen window—when I came down, the window was half way open, as if the shutter had been tried.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not measure the ale and stout—I did not see the prisoners in the house, they were some yards off—the noise I heard was like water being turned on; instead of that it was the taps of the barrels, the beer running all over the bar, and it was like people rumbling about in the bar—it was not a great noise—anyone could open the back door—the name of the lodger is Mappin; he has lodged with us for years—my sister and a woman named Slade, a ship-keeper, were also lodging there—I had a friend from Liverpool staying there, but she has gone away—she was not living there with George Harris—I heard the prisoners say they were passing the house, and two girls came past at the time; they said they should like a drink of beer, and the girls said "You can get beer here at any time," and that they gave the girls three shillings to come in and get the beer—I took the police-sergeant up stairs to see if there were any women there—I know one of the prisoners—I think they were tipsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the sergeant came, he did not find anybody but the lodgers in the house—I saw no girls about my place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the nephew of the last witness—she called me up on this morning, and I went down—I saw Donovan with a can, and Sullivan with a stone bottle, going out of the front door—I called out, and the police came up and took them—they had got about twenty yards from the house when they were taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live in the house—I had been sleeping in the tap-room next to the bar—I generally sleep up stairs, but my brother and another little chap had got my bed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 607). About 3 a.m. on 2nd January, I was on duty in High Street, Poplar, and while passing the Walton Arms, I heard a bustling noise—I waited outside, when the prisoners came out, Donovan carrying a tin can, and Sullivan a bottle—I asked what it was; they said "Beer"—I asked where they got it, and they said "We paid for it"—I heard someone call out "Stop thief! they have robbed me"—I imme<lb></lb>diately seized them, and got them inside the beer shop until assistance came—they came out of the place rather fast.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think they were much under the influence of drink—Sullivan might have been, but Donovan was not the worse for drink—they did not say anything about an Irish wake that was going on that night—when they got to the station, they said they had given two girls three shillings to get some beer for them.</p>

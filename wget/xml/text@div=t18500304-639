                  </hi>. I live in Garden-row, Knightsbridge. On the evening of 4th March, a little after twelve o'clock at night, I was in Sloane-street, going home—I was quite drunk—I was knocked down in Sloane-street, and a man put his hand in my pocket—I am sure there was a man there, he came close in front of me; it was the prisoner—I had my senses sufficiently about me to mind the man so as to know him again—he got his hand in my pocket—I seized his hand; he got it away, struck me on the face, and knocked me down—what he took out I don't know—when I left home, about eight in the morning, I had two crowns, two half-crowns, and three shillings—I drank some spirits in the forepart of the day—I drank very little afterwards but beer—after I had been knocked down, the policeman came, and I told him that a man in livery had knocked me down—I know that I had changed one crown-piece—I cannot swear what was the last time I had my money—I left the Clock House about five—I think I then went to Pimlico—I think I must have been in some public-houses after that, before I was in Sloane-street—I was quite drunk, but my senses had not left me—I do not believe I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 62). At quarter-past twelve at night on 4th March, I was on duty in Sloane-street—I saw two men standing towards the garden; I thought they were in conversation—one of them, whom I did not know at the moment, knocked the other down by push<lb></lb>ing or kicking him—he fell from the kerb into the street—there were no other persons but those two—I ran across the street and saw the prisoner; he was one of the two men—he ran away; I overtook him, and knowing him previously, I said to him, "What have you been at? "he said, "It is all right"—I said, "I don't know that, stop!"—he said, "I have got the carriage to get ready; good-night"—I knew him to be a private in the Grenadier Guards, and servant to Captain West—he went on, and I went back to the prosecutor, who was endeavouring to rise—I knew he did not fall down himself, I saw the arm go out when he fell—his nose was bleeding very much—he was drunk, but still appeared sensible in what he had got to say—he told me what occurred, and 1 went to the stable where the prisoner was—I knocked, the prisoner came—he said he should not open the door unless I told him what for—I said, the man he had knocked down in Sloane-street accused him of robbing him of five shillings—he said, "It is only one"—putting his arm out, and giving me a shilling, he said, "Take it, and make it all right, as you know me"—I got my foot in at the door, and dragged him out with some difficulty—he persuaded me to let him go—I said, it was what I could not do—I took him to the prosecutor, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me, and knocked me down"—the prisoner said, "That is the fruit of getting into such company; I have been drinking with him at the Prince of Wales"—the prosecutor said he had the crown-piece, that he did not remember to have changed, and some other money—I searched the pri<lb></lb>soner at the station, and found two half-crowns and one penny-piece on him.</p>

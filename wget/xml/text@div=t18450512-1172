                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market; I have a slaughter-house in Sheffield-street, near my dwelling. I have a foreman named Kibot—the prisoner was in my service—it is the custom of the butchers to send various beasts to that slaughter-house to be slaughtered—on the 6th of May twelve beasts were killed—the prisoner and Kibot, my foreman, were there—it is the duty of my men to take a</p>

               <p>portion of the internal fat to the owners of the beasts after they are killed—they have no right to an ounce of it for themselves—I am responsible for every part of the beast—when the work of the day is ended it is the duty of the foreman to come to my house, and to book the number of the boasts that have been killed, and to whom they belonged—Kibot came and booked them, about nine o'clock at night, on the 6th of May—he had the keys of the slaughter-house then in his hand—they had then done work, and he had no occasion to go to the slaughter-house again that night on any business of mine—in consequence of my suspicions, I had got the policeman to watch, and in the course of that night I heard that somebody was in custody at the station—I went—I found the prisoner there—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Joe</hi>, I am very sorry to see you in this situation; you had no occasion to do this from the wages I paid you"—he said, "I have been linked into this"—I said, "What do you mean by being linked in?"—he said a man had given him the fat in Wild-street, close to the tallow-chandler's; he did not know the man, and had never seen him before—there was about 96lbs. weight of fat—amongst the beasts which had been slaughtered that day, there was one the fat of which was of an unusually high colour—I examined the sack of fat slightly that night, and more fully afterwards—it corresponded with the fat of the beasts that had been killed that day, and part of it cor<lb></lb>responded with that of one bullock that belonged to Mr. Johnson—I went down to my slaughter-house about one o'clock, and found the back door was fastened inside, which I thought could not have been done by a person outside; but I understand since that they had a method of fastening it through a hole, so that the prisoner might have fastened it behind him when he came out.</p>

In consequence of instruc<lb></lb>tions, I stationed myself in Bear-street, Clare-market, on the evening of tht 6th of May—there is a narrow passage there which leads to the back entrance of Mr. Wood's slaughter-house—I waited till about nine o'clock—I then saw the prisoner leave the slaughter-house, with a sack—he car<lb></lb>ried it into Wild-street—I followed him—he went into No. 20, which is a shop kept by the witness Mitchell—he put down the sack, and opened a flap in the floor of the shop, put the sack down below, and he followed it—I immediately went into the shop, and slipped down the flap, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the sack—I saw him take two pieces of fat from his left-hand pocket, and put them into the copper, where the fat was hot—Mitchell then came down the flap—he stirred up the fat in the copper with a stick—the prisoner said, "He will be here directly"—Mitchell said, "Will he?" and he returned to the shop again—soon after, Mitchell came down again, and the prisoner said, "I suppose I can go now?"—Mitchell said, Oh, yes, you can go"—the prisoner was then going away—I stopped him, and told him I was a police-officer, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market. I had three bullocks killed at Mr. Wood's slaughter-house on the 6th of May, and one of them was a peculiarly high-coloured fat—none of the others were of that colour—I was at the slaughter-house the whole of the day, and saw the prisoner engaged in dressing that very bullock—I have since been shown a piece of dark-coloured fat, which I compared with my own—it corresponds precisely in colour and quality—I think I can swear safely to it as mine—it ought to have been brought to me by the prisoner, or some one—the moment the fat is cleaned it is brought immediately—I have examined the interior of the bullocks, and have missed a portion of the fat of the three beasts which were killed that day.</p>

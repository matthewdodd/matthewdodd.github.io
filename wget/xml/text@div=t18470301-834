                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 38.) On the 15th of Feb. about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was watching, and saw the prisoner in Garrett-lane, Wandsworth—I saw a quart-pot hanging on a fence opposite Mr. Wilkinson's beer-shop—the prisoner stopped and looked at the quart-pot—some persons followed him—he walked on slowly until they passed him, then returned and looked at it again, then crossed the road, and appeared to be looking into Wilkinson's house, then returned, took the pot up, put it under his coat, and walked down the lane—I followed him, and on coming near him I suppose he saw me—he put it down on a low wall—I took him into custody, and asked what he had done with the pot—he said, "What pot? I never touched one"—I took the pot off the wall—it was about 100 yards from where</p>

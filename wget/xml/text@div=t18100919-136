On the 17th of this month I lost the mutton; I was standing at the front of my shop, my wife hear a rustling noise in the passage, she called me in, I immediately missed the neck of mutton, it hung inside of the shop, I had seen it two hours before, I hung it there myself, I walked out of the door, I perceived nobody but the prisoner driving a cart with two horses in it; I suspected him and followed him two hundred yards, I perceived that he had got something wrapped up in his apron, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said nothing. I took the mutton out of his apron; he then said, as to the mutton, I I bought just now, I gave a shilling for it; I told him he could buy mutton cheaper than I could, there was six pound of it; he said, take the name and number of the cart, you will find me there. He whipped his horses on, I could not stop him until he got into Fleet-street. I am positive of the mutton being mine. After I gave him in charge of the constable, I was ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190061"></xptr>used by a number of people for giving this man in charge.</p>

On the 28th of October, Mr. Cummings brought several pieces of brass and copper to me, which I immediately identified as ours, and ordered the prisoner to be taken into custody. He was in the workshop - he declared his innocence - nothing was found on him. His wife never came to the manufactory - they never buy goods of us, and these were quite new.</p>

            . I am an iron-monger and brazier, and live in Beech-street, Barbican. On the 26th of October, about eight o'clock at night, a woman came to my shop to buy a kettle, and produced this copper to be taken in exchange. I afterwards shewed it to Mr. Wood, who claimed it. There were seven or eight pounds of it.</p>

            . I am beadle of Holborn. On the 28th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Wood came to me; I went and took the prisoner at his factory; brought him into the counting-house, and told him he was charged with stealing copper - he said he knew nothing of it. I went with Mr. Wood to Cummings, and we all went to No. 5, John's-court, Golden-lane, and saw a woman who called herself Mrs. Goulding. I afterwards saw her with the prisoner, who acknowledged her as his wife. We found nothing at the house but two small pieces of solder in a box.</p>

            . I live in John's-place, Golden-lane, in the same house as the prisoner, on the first floor. I am a plasterer, and work for Mr. Trott. I was working at a sadler's in Goswell-street. About two months before the prisoner was taken up, I was going for a pail of whitewash, I found a bit of old rag, with some rivets tied in it, as I crossed from the pawn-broker's shop to the Pitt's-head, public-house - they were copper, and new, I believe, but did not take much notice, as I was in a hurry to get my breakfast. They looked fresh; there were 10 or 12 rivets, to the best of my belief. I took them home, and gave them to an old woman who lived in the house named Pettit. I have not seen them since, and should not know them again. There was no piece of copper with them; they were about the same size as those produced. This was two months before the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. WOOD. I am certain of the rivets being of our manufacture; I am certain they had not been made a week before he was taken; any one in the trade would say the same.</p>

            . I lodged in the same house as the prisoner did. M'Donald was coming home one Saturday night, and found these rivets, about two months before the prisoner was taken up. When he came home he threw them down, apron and all, and said he had found them. I did not open it, but gave it to Mrs. Goulding - I might open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open it or not - A. To be sure I did; it contained little nails of copper. I gave them to Mrs. Goulding, saying they might be of some use to her.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 14th of January, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was in Goswell-street, and saw Harmer standing on the curb stone, and saw Purcell come out of a baker's shop, go some distance, and then they joined company. I followed them to Old-street, and met Waddington, who assisted me in watching of them. Purcell went into a baker's-shop; Harmer waited lower down - I went into the shop; the person refused the money, and she came out; they then went to Slack's shop, in Barbican; Purcell went in; Harmer remained about twenty yards off. When she came out I went to the shop, came out, and followed them to a pastry-cook's shop - Purcell went in, and bought something; Harmer waited outside - she came out, and joined him. I went in, and Ware produced me a sixpence from the counter; she marked it before she gave it to me. They went to a cheesemonger's shop; Harmer was brought out to me by Waddington. Purcell was also taken while I was enquiring at the cheesemonger's shop.</p>

Purcell came to the shop about half-past six o'clock in the evening, for a halfpenny bun, and gave me a sixpence - I gave her change; it had a particular sound. I rubbed it on a piece of marble, and it being candle-light, I could not see it properly - I put it into the till with two more sixpences - Colton came in soon after; I selected it from the others, by the mark where I had rubbed it, and am sure it is the one she gave me. I produce it.</p>

I was with Colton, and followed the prisoner, and saw them go to Slack's and Clinton's - the woman went into the shops; Harmer waited outside for her; she always came to him, and I saw their hands close together, but saw her give him nothing. They went to Slack's and Clinton's, and then to a cheesemonger's in Beech-street - I there took them into custody. I took Harmer, and observed his left hand in his breeches pocket - a man came up; I said,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of his left hand;" he pulled his hand out, and I saw something drop - the man picked it up, and gave it to me; I found it contained nine shillings, separately wrapped up, and seven sixpences, all counterfeit. Purcell said she hoped I would he favourable to the man, for he was innocent - that she picked the money up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180028"></xptr>Somer's-town, and met the man at the Angel, thinking him distressed, and was going to treat him.

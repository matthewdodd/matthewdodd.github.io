               <p>I thought well of him—on the afternoon of 22nd January the prisoner made the remark to me, "I am going near Broad-street, and will take Benazuz's cheque and account sales," and some other account sales of persons who lived in that direction—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced—this was a cheque on Smith, Payne, and Co.'s for</hi> 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) was then lying on the desk—it is signed by me by procuration, the other part of it is written by Mr. Alexander—I gave it to him, and also the account sales—he was to take them to Mr. Benazuz, and also to go to Messrs.

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side</hi>) <hi rend="italic">urged that it was a stealing from Dalgleish, and that the opinion of the Jury must be asked upon that; that the form of taking the check to Benazuz was only a cover to what he meant to do with it; that he got it, in the first instance, from Webb for the purpose of stealing it; that the taking the check to Benazuz did not sufficiently disconnect the prisoner from the relationship to his master as to render him irresponsible for the criminal act he committed. The whole of the evidence evinced that his intention was to rob his master, and it was for the Jury to say whether at the time he handed the check to Benazuz he did not mean to act it back again; for unless the delivery to Benazuz was a bond fide delivery</hi> (<hi rend="italic">which was a question for the Jury</hi>) <hi rend="italic">it did not alter the relationship of master and servant.</hi>

               <p>Q. How is this shop part of the dwelling house, do you enter at the shop door - A. Not exactly so; the shop is a separate tenement, but we have a communication by a passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of the house - A. It has been a separate tenement for many years; it is not under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what communication is there - A. Through the wall of the house there is a door that opens from the shop to the house; my father has bought the house and the shop at the same time; I slept in the house at the time the offence was committed; the house was undergoing some alterations; the whole of the family intended to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the communication been made between the shop and this house - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it that this happened - A. The 22nd of March, between eight and nine o'clock; we had lit candles about an hour and a half, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time - A. I was, and my father was there; I was standing inside of the shop; there were lamps outside of the shop window. I heard a window break; I immediately ran out of the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this the window of the shop, or was it a shew glass - A. The window of the shop. I perceived the prisoner drawing his hand from the broken pane, and in his hand was two silver gravy spoons; I saw them, they had been hanging in the window against the pane which was broken; I seized him by the breast, and with the assistance of a neighbour we took him into the shop: The neighbour who assisted me took the spoons out of his hand. I went for a constable; the spoons were delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. When you heard the pane of glass break from the noise, was it like a person cutting a pane, or a person dashing his hand against it - A. Not like cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you have heard about the man, whether he has been deranged - A. I have heard so; but from what fell from his own mouth I should not suppose so.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMMOND. Q. Do you live near Mr. Chandler - A. I do, next door; I was standing in my shop on the evening mentioned; I heard a noise of glass breaking; I immediately ran out and perceived the prisoner standing by the side of Mr. Chandler's window, with the spoons in his hand; I took the spoons from his hand and dragged him into the shop; I kept the spoons and him till a constable came, and then I gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had your candles been lighted - A. About an hour and a half. When I went out it was very dark.</p>
               <p>- CRESWELL. I took the prisoner in custody, I took him to the watchhouse. The next morning, as I was taking him to Marlborough street - the prisoner was handcuffed to another - crossing Wardour street, he knocked me down and stunned me for a moment; he could not get away on account of the other man he was handcuffed to.</p>

            , ESQ. - Mr. Curwood. I believe, sir, you are deputy surgeon general of the land forces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he was assistant surgeon to the 35th regiment; he left that regiment in August last; from the official report he left that regiment on account of his being deranged in mind, and being incapable of attending the sick in that regiment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was that regiment - A. In Sicily. I had no acquaintance with him till he returned. I conceived he was labouring under that malady when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120018"></xptr>arrived from Sicily in August last. I saw Mr. Morgan within this last three weeks or a month; I observed he looked extremely aukward, and remarked it to himself. He lately has been appointed to the York rangers; I objected when he applied to be on full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago - A. About two months; Mr. Morgan has frequently called at the office; I did not consider him to be perfectly sound of mind; I understood that he went into the country afterwards; about three weeks ago is the last time I saw Mr. Morgan; he appeared extremely heated and hurried. I mentioned to the surgeon general my regret that he had been recommended upon full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Then somebody thought he was a fit person - A. There was a letter came from a relation and a medical man there, that he had been quiet during his stay there, six weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Did he appear to be a man that was not answerable for his actions - A. In such a state as that I was only sorry that he was placed in such a situation to have the charge of sick men; I did not think him fit for any thing in that line.</p>
               <p>COURT to Chandler. At the time that the prisoner was apprehended did you, from your own observations, see any thing that imported the least insanity - A. Not the least in the world. When he was brought into the shop my father asked him where he supposed he would go for this offence; he made answer, take me where you will, I have no place to put my head into. I perceived no symptoms in the least of mental derangement.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hammond. Did any thing occur to your observation with respect to the prisoner's mind - A. I should not imagine him to be insane; his conversation and language was quite different; there was nothing that led me to suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. to Creswell. When you came and took him in custody how was his behaviour - A. He appeared sullen all the way; he knocked me down the next morning; he wanted to run away; he wanted the other prisoner to run away; the other prisoner told me so afterward.</p>

               <p>MR. NEWMAN. Q. This man is in your custody - how has his behaviour been - A. His behaviour has been very extraordinary indeed; he has been in my custody from the 27th of March; he appeared sometimes quite stupid, and very indecent in his behaviour, so much so that he has been a disgust to all the prisoners; I have been obliged to lock him up by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. From the best of your belief do you think it proceeded from perverseness of temper, or from derangement of mind - A. I should rather think from derangement of mind.</p>
               <p>MARY EARLE. Q. You are chamber maid to the Bell Savage - A. Yes. I remember the prisoner coming there in August, he staid there ten nights, he very seldom went out of the bed room the whole of the time, and never dressed. What I saw of his conduct I believe him to be insane.</p>

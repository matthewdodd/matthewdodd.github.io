                  </hi>. I am now in service at Knight's Hill, Norwood. In July, 1855, I was in the service of Mr. Kitson, in Warwick Street, Pimlico—Ihad been in his service about five years—during that time Caroline Wal<lb></lb>ters had been in his service; she left in 1852—previous to her leaving, the prisoner passed a note down the area to her—I saw him from the kitchen window—I know that Caroline Walters left the service to be married—I saw her one Sunday evening after she left to be married, end on that occasion I saw the prisoner—she called one Sunday evening, and he was outside the door, at the back of the house—I heard him say to her, "Are you not coming"—hedid not address her by any name—my master was in the habit of going out of town each year, and at that he was in the habit of depositing his plate in the wine cellar—it was known to Walters where my master deposited his plate—my master was absent in July, 1855—on Sunday evening, 15th July, that year, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I had previously fastened all the doors and windows—I was reading after I went to my room—I heard a noise afterwards—I believe it to be between 11 and 12 o'clock—the room in which I slept is on the left side of the area; the cellar where the plate was, is under the foot pavement, opposite my bed room—when I heard the noise I called out three times to my grandfather, who slept on the first floor—he was the only other person in the house—he was an old man, and was very deaf, and has since died—I called "Grandfather!" three times, and then I called three times,"Who is there?" and no one answered—I heard some one strike a match; I believe it was outside the kitchen door, and then go to a cupboard under the kitchen stairs—the candle box was there—the prisoner then rushed into my room and struck me—he had a lighted candle in one hand, and something in the other hand, which I did not see—I was in bed—I could not tell what he struck me with—he struck me more than once; I had five blows—I was deprived of my senses by those blows—I recovered consciousness the next morning, when my grandfather called me at half past 5 o'clock—after the blows I felt a violence on my throat; I thought he was grasping my neck—Iwas all over blood—when my grandfather came to the side of the bed he said, "What is the matter?"—I said some one had been hitting me—he took a rope from my neck—my neck was sore for some days afterwards—I was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see him at the police court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six weeks ago—this occurred in July, 1855—I had seen the prisoner once, when he passed a note down the area to Caroline Walters; he had his hat on then—Ido not remember whether he had his hat on when he came into the room; I had only a slight view of him when he passed the note down the area—the other occasion was on a Sunday evening, when I saw him at the back of the house in the summer of 1853; that was about twelve months after I had seen him when he passed the note—it was daylight when I saw him on the Sunday evening at the back of the house—I was in the hall; he was as far off as to the end of this court; I did not pay much attention to him then—myview was so superficial, that when he came into my room with the candle I did not recognize him—I gave a description of him as rather tall, pale faced, dark hair, dark whiskers, and about the height of Mr. Painter; and the next time I saw him he was at Wandsworth—I do not think he was in my room five minutes before I lost my senses—I was in bed; he stood by the side of the bed, near the door on my right hand side; he did not speak to me—I am not aware that he moved from that place—after he struck me, he looked in my box—I did not see him; I heard him—he threw the bed clothes over my head—I did not see him afterwards—all the time I had to recognize him was when he came into the room with the candle—I was lying on my left side when he came to the door, and I turned to see him—he had not got quite to the bed when I turned round—all the time I saw him was when he was walking between the door and the bed—I saw the light on his face; I hardly</p>

I formerly lived servant next door to Mr. Kitson, in Warwick Street—I was there in July, 1855—I saw the prisoner and another man loitering about all the Sunday afternoon—Iheard of the robbery on the Monday morning, and it was on the Sunday before that, I saw the prisoner and another man loitering about at the corner of St. George's Row and Warwick Street—I saw them the best part of the afternoon, and I saw them again in the evening; they were in conversation—theother man came over with him—I and my fellow servant were standing in the area, and he came and had some conversation with us—we were talk<lb></lb>ing with him half an hour—I and my fellow servant then went in, but before we went in, he took a match and lighted his cigar—that threw a light on his face—he began talking to us about half past 8 o'clock, and continued talking till about 9—I afterwards went to let my fellow servant out, and the prisoner made his way over the road, as if he were coming to the door—I did not like the look of him, and I shut the door—about a quarter or twenty minutes after 12 o'clock, I went to the parlour window looking into Warwick Street, and saw the prisoner standing with his arms over the area railings at Mr. Kitson's—the other man was on the other side of the way—I then went to bed.</p>

On 16th July, 1855, I was on duty in Warwick Street—my attention was called to No. 114—I was called by an elderly person named Martin—I went into the house a few minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning—I went down the kitchen stairs; I found the place very disordered—on going to the right hand kitchen, I found Martha Rolfe lying on the bed, weltering in her blood—Ifound the house all broken—they had got in by forcing the window up—thefastening on the top of it was broken—I saw this poker found by the last witness.</p>

On the morning of 16th July, 1855, I went to Mr. Kitson's house—I produce this poker, which was found there, and also this piece of rope—I found this screw driver lying close by the wine cellar door—the rope was on the bed; it was not attached to the person of the servant—she gave me a description of the person.</p>

I had the prisoner in custody, and on 5th March I conveyed him from Horsemonger Lane to Wandsworth police court—he said to me, on the following day, "They have charged me with that burglary that I was speaking to you about yesterday; the girl swears it was me that hit her with the poker; so help me God, it was not me; it was the man that is now doing six years"—he said, "Fells knows all about this job; we were in Fells' house all the Sunday afternoon, looking out from the up stairs window; it was to have been done while they were gone to Church, but, somehow, they did not go, and so we did it at night"—I am sure that was what he said—I pat it down, and have the memorandum, and he said, "We took the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> to the old house"—he said, "There is a woman doing eighteen months at Wandsworth House of Correction that knows all about our being at Fells' House."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant</hi>). In July, 1855, I was not living nearly oppo<lb></lb>site No. 114, Warwick Street; I lived in that neighbourhood—the prisoner was not in my house on the Sunday afternoon before the robbery—I was living in the house, but I was not at home; I was down at Scotland Yard—mywife was very ill, and two nurses were in the house—there were no <hi rend="italic">plants</hi> taken to my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"Myself and another man, by the name of George Lewis, went to a house in St. George's Road, Pimlico, to a policeman by the name of Fells; we went with the intention of robbing a house, No. 114, Warwick Street, St. George's Road; the time we went was on a Sunday, I believe, at about 1 o'clock; Mr. Fells was then minding an empty house; we told him we had come to do the job in Warwick Street; he said we could go up stairs, and no one would see</p>

               <p>us hanging about, and we then could see the house we intended to rob; we watched the house all Sunday afternoon, till about 11 o'clock on Sunday night; we then left Fells' house, and went towards No. 114, Warwick Street; George Lewis then got over the railings, the one nearest the corner house; he then forced the window up, and got in; he had been in about five minutes when I heard the female scream; I then came back to Fells' house, and told him that George Lewis had got in, and I thought he was knocking the girl about, as I heard a scream; Fells then said, 'D—his eyes, he will not hurt the girl;' I said, "I don't know; he will not come out without the plate;' Fells then said he thought he should go to bed, and he said, 'If you get it, bring it down the area steps, and put it under there, and it will be all right, for no one will look there; you can then place a stone between the railings, near the gate; I shall know it is all right, and you can fetch it away in the morning;' when I came the next morning, Fells told me what there was; I looked, and said the dish covers were not right; I fetched it away in a bag, and I met George Lewis; we then went home to my place with it; Anna Gould was at home when we got there; myself, George Lewis, and Anna Gould looked to see if it was all right; I then told Anna Gould that George Lewis went in, and I thought he had killed the girl; Anna Gould then asked George what he had done to her; he then said he thought she would want a wooden box; Anna Gould then said, "Good God! you have never killed poor Martha; I am sorry I ever let you know anything about it;" we then took the plate away, and disposed of it; we took it to a shop just over Westminster Bridge, to a man of the name of By worth; we then went to see Fells; we met him by Grosvenor Place, near Belgrave Square; the place where we met Fells was at a corner of the Mews, leading to Tuldman's yard; we then gave him some money; we then went and had something to drink, and then left; the rope that was found on the girl's neck was Fells' rope;" "There is a policeman by the name of Fells, who conspired with me in getting Juliet Atkins' money; I, Charles Bennett, married the said Juliet Atkins, in the name of Charles Lewis; the said Mr. Fells supplied me with money to go on with; he was also answerable for a suit of clothes for the purpose, for me to go to church with the said Juliet Atkins, knowing at the same time that I was a married man; he came to see me, in presence of the said Juliet Atkins, in the name of Mr. Gregory, and said that he held a certain sum of money belonging to me, and he could not pay me back till a certain time; the time he proposed was till after the time that the said Juliet Atkins should have drawn her money from the Bank; when the money was got, he received apart of it."</p>

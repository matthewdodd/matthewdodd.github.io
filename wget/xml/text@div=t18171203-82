On Saturday, November the 8th, I went out at ten o'clock in the morning, returned about half-pst six in the evening, and found my stable-door about one-third part open; I went in, and heard a noise like men walking about; I went into the yard, and looked up at my sitting-room window, there was no light; I expected to have found one there. My rooms are over the coach-house and stable - I heard somebody go down my stairs and come up again; they then got a light, and looked at the clock - I saw all this from the yard; they went into my sleeping-room, and then into another room. I saw them in the sleeping-room two or three times; I then gave the alarm; they opened one of my kitchen doors, and ran out - I secured the two prisoners. They looked out at the door above the stable, and ran down - I secured them, and sent for Limbrick, the officer. I examined my premises, and found them in great confusion. My wife had the key of the street - door, she was out - I found they had got in at the stable-door, and up the rack; the stable-door was not locked, I do not know whether it was latched or not. They had forced the kitchen door open-it had been bolted inside before; one of the staples was forced-an instrument was found, with which, I suppose, they did it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. He went out in the morning; about a quarter before six in the evening a knock came at the door, and a person asked if Mrs. Catley lived there? I said, Yes; they said they had melancholy news to tell me, that my husband had fallen off the coach-box, the axle-tree was broke, and he was much hurt, and was taken to St. Bartholemew's hospital. I went up stairs, got my things, and came out. I found another man at the door, who began talking to me about it. I asked him if he was going back to the hospital; he said his mother was a nurse there, and I was to tell her he would be there as early as possible in the morning. When I got to the hospital I found my husband was not there. I returned home as quick as possible. When I got to Union-buildings I saw my husband, he said he was robbed; it was neither of the persons who came to tell me of the accident. When I went out I bolted the kitchen door inside; it was then about a quarter past six, it was quite dark; I had lit a candle, and left it on the stairs. I found a bundle tied up, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, which I had left safe in the drawers when I went out-the kitchen door was forced open.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the prisoner, Chandler, in the privy, and Bolton in the stable. I found a chissel in Chandler's pocket - I left them in Reid's custody, and went back and found Mrs. Catley there, and the bundle tied up, with a great many things strewed about the rooms; all the drawers were turned out, the kitchen door was broken open, and the staple forced off-the chissel fitted the marks exactly; a candle was close to the bundle, the wick quite soft, as if it was just out.</p>

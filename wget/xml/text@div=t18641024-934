                  </hi>. I am an omnibus conductor, and live at Kilburn-park-road—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September the prisoner got into my omnibus at Kilburn, and said that that she wanted to be set down at King's College Hospital—at Tottenham-court-road she said, "I think I will get out here," and tendered me this sixpence, saying, "I think that is your fare;" I said, "No, it is not, it is fourpence," and handed her twopence—the moment I had it between my finger and thumb I found it was bad, and bent it double—I said, "This is bad, have you any more"—she took out another sixpence, and I bent that double also—I said, "Have you any more money about you?" she said, "No, that is all the money I have got"—I gave her in custody with the sixpences.</p>

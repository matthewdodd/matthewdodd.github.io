            ; on the 19th we went out without any success; on the 20th, we arrived at a place near Weybourne; where we laid in wait till between seven and eight in the evening. I left two officers about a mile and a half from my station. About nine o'clock I heard some carts coming, and I went for the other officers, Cambridge and Gosling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Weybourne is on the sea coast in Norfolk. - A. Yes. I went for Cambridge and Gosling; it was more than half an hour before I came back, it might be near an hour; we followed them to a place called Castenwood-row-house; the carts stopped there, it appeared as if they were shifting their casks from them; when they went from the house, we followed them about the distance of a quarter of a mile from the house, there we come up to them; I suppose there might be ten or a dozen carts, loaded with half anchor tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how many horseman that attended. - A. There might be three or four or more of them, and some of them were on the carts, and some dismounted; there might be a score of footmen; when that were on foot, and on the carts altogether, besides the horseman; we rode on till we come to the foremost cart; Mr. Gosling stopped the first cart and seized the goods, and told the man, that the first person that attempted to rescue them he would shoot them; the man jumped on the cart, told him he might shoot and be d - d.</p>
               <p>Court. The driver of the goods. - A. Yes, the driver of the goods. I stopped at the second cart, the driver he got upon the cart and dared me to fire; we wen immediately round by the horsemen; I suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020053"></xptr>then there might be six, seven, or eight, I do not know exactly; the carts turned round, the horsemen filled up the road to prevent us from following them; we told them we were determined to follow the carts and to seize the goods, or we would fire upon them; they swore a great many oaths and dared us to fire upon them, and said we should not go any further; we broke through their ranks and passed them, and followed the carts, which had taken another road. The horsemen passed us and headed us again; I ordered every man belonging to me to cock his pistol; there were me, two officers, and an assistant, we came up close to them and headed them; they then ordered the footmen to come forward, there might be upwards of a score footmen; they came forward and encouraged the horsemen to unhorse us, we were on horseback; they said we should not have the goods, they knew of us being out, and they were prepared for us; we told them we were determined to have them, or we would fire upon them; they ordered the blunderbus to be brought forward, they told them to put in an additional ball; we advanced; and dared them to fire upon us; then the horsemen began to brandish their weapons over our heads.</p>
               <p>Court. What weapons were these. - A. Large sticks and bludgeons. I pointed my pistol into Abel's breast. Then there was another horseman with a large stick over my arm; I told 
               <persName id="t18071202-70-person699">Abel</persName>
             I should certainly shoot him, and I felt myself justified in doing it, if he would not let me pass. I asked him if there were nobody that wanted him; I knew he had a large family of children; he called me of one side.</p>

             GOSLING. - Mr. Gleed. You are an officer of the excise. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 20th of October were you out with the last witness. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information you received from him you followed the smugglers with the carts A. I did; at the time we came up to them I suppose it might be between ten and eleven; it was a bright moon light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon coming up to the carts how did you dispose of yourselves. - A. I was on horseback; Alsbrook and I went first; the other two were behind; how near I cannot say; I stopped the foremost cart.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were passing along to the foremost cart, was there any person that you paid particular attention on. - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar; I observed him, he was upon my left hand, the moon reflected upon his face, I had a full opportunity of seeing his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Having that opportunity of seeing his face, have you the least doubt of his person. - A. I have not the least doubt; he called out as we rode past; the words I have many times endeavoured to recollect what they were.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the substance of the words. - A.Hallon, how are you, gentlemen, good night; it was that, or similar to it; his standing up in the cart first attracted my attention; before he spoke I did not observe any one standing up in the carts but him, and the moon shone upon his face. I am sure of his person, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had elapsed before you saw him again. - A. I cannot say; I took many opportunities to endeavour to see him; I went down to Hedgfield for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did this transaction of you and the smugglers take place before you were obliged to abandon the carts. - A. About an hour. In the course of that hour I do not recollect seeing him again. I had an opportunity of seeing some of the footmen, that I should know again; after the horsemen headed us again, I cannot say I was in any fear, though I considered myself in danger. They prevented us from seeing of the footmen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Some time after this you went to the house of the defendant. - A. I did, he lives at a village called Hedgfield, he keeps a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the spot where this took place. - A. I never went back from that road; I believe from the observations that I made on the map to be seven or eight miles.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information you went to the defendant's house at Hedgfield. - A. Yes, I saw him; I cannot recollect what month it was in. I had been down several times for that purpose before I saw him, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now come to the time when you did see him. - A. The time I am not positive, I made no memorandum. I went into the public house; as soon as I got there that time I saw the defendant in his house; Mr. Alsbrook was with me. Upon my seeing him I knew that he was the man that I saw upon the cart; I have not the least doubt but that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Subsequent to this did you ever go to the same place with a warrant on purpose to apprehend this man. A. Once, Mr. Alsbrook and Mr. Tubby was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Hedgfield did you see him any where. - A. I saw him at work at a muck cart, on a piece of ground, it comes up to his yard, about twenty yards from his house; I saw him, I was in a one horse chaise with the supervisor; Mr. Alsbrook was on horseback, he rode in the piece, and rode till he came pretty near to the defendant; then the defendant ran through the hedge, leaving the cart and horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him. - A. No, Mr. Alsbrook ran after him, he did not bring him back at that time; the defendant escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Gosling, you tell me you cannot say what time it was you went to the defendant's house and saw him, was it spring or autumn. - A. It was summer.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell me whether it was the middle of summer or the latter end of the summer. - A. I cannot speak to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether it was six months after the transaction or one. - A. I suppose it to be more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you come to give evidence upon supposing, I can give evidence upon supposing as well as you. - A. It was a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to apprehend him. - A. I do not recollect, that was after Upcraft was taken; Upcraft was taken in October; to the best of my recollection I believe it was a few days before we were ordered upon Upcraft's trial.</p>
               <p>Q. The indictment of Upcraft was preferred in September, the trial was in October, you speak of this being a bright moon shiny night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was in the first quarter. - A. I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020054"></xptr>in the almanack; the moon was about nine days old.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The moon was in the first quarter. I sent out for the almanack for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after this transaction of your being obstructed in seizing these carts, did you see this man in his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was in the summer; he cannot remember the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. This transaction was in October preceding.</p>
               <p>Court. How many carts were there. - A. I cannot tell the number, they were all loaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. to Alsbrook. At the time you went into the field after Wiseman, did you tell him the cause of your coming after him. - A. I could not without holloa- it out loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went away without your explaining the cause of your coming after him. - A, He knew before.</p>
               <p>Q.When Wiseman made his escape did you tell him any thing. - A. I did not; he had told me he would give himself up whenever I came for him; he told me he was at an auction that night; I saw him alone, when he told me that he came to me in the summer some time before.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at him, and see whether you can safely say he was there, upon your oath. - A. I was as near to him then as I am now; that Wiseman was the man upon a cart I have not a shadow of a doubt that he was there; I know the man. It was quite a light night.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of October do you remember being at any sale. - A. Yes, it was about a mile and a half from the prisoner's house; the sale began pretty nigh twelve o'clock. It might be over about five or six; I went to Wiseman's house in the evening, somewhere pretty nigh eight; I was there three hours, I staid there till between eleven and twelve, to the best of my recollection; Wiseman was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. For what reason was it you went to his house and staid so long. - A. A young man of the name of Bishop told me he would meet me there; he did not meet me, and that was the reason I staid so long.</p>

On the next day I was thinking about it, I recollected seeing this hand bill on the settle, I went in and had a glass of ale, I saw the sale was on the 20th of October; I afterwards sent word to Wiseman there was such a bill stuck up, and he was right; Wiseman sent a man for me. I took the bill down from the board last Sunday sennight.</p>

I a detective stationed at Woolwich—on Thursday night, 23rd February, about 9 o'clock, I went to the Union beer-house in the Gardens at Woolwich, kept by the prisoner Brooks, with Serjeant<lb></lb>Major Osborn and Crouch a detective—I found Brooks there—I called him outside and asked him if he had bought any leather from a bombardier of the artillery on Tuesday last—he said, "No"—I then asked him if he had got any Government leather in his house—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you allow us to look over your house, to see if you have any"—he said, "Yes"—we went into the house into a room on the right hand, kept as a harness shop—I there found this half of a hide of leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), underneath a working bench—I also found in different parts of the shop</p>

               <p>these several other pieces—I saw the Government mark upon the leather, though very indistinct, and a number of places where something had been erased—it was "W. D.," War Department—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for having this Government leather in your possession"—he said, "I bought it of a harness maker near Sandy-hill, Plumstead, near the Fox and Hounds"—he gave a name, but I am not able to recollect it—he said he borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Vaughan, a builder, who lived next to the Fox and Hounds, to help to pay for it—we found some reins and several other things—there is a very indistinct mark on the reins, not so plain as the other—after searching down stairs, I said to Brooks, 'Now have you toy mere leather up stairs"—he said, "No"—I went up stairs in company with Osborn and a friend of Brooks' and in his private bedroom I found this skin of leather, with the broad arrow stamped upon it—I came down and said, "I have found some more in your bed-room Brooks"—he made no reply—I then told bin I should take him into custody for receiving a quantity of leather from a bombardier of the Royal Artillery, well knowing ii to be stolen—he made no answer.</p>

I am a sergeant-major in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Woolwich—I went with the last witness to Brooks' house, and saw the whole of this leather found—I have examined this leather and on these two pieces I find the Government mark, and several marks which appear to have been erased—I find the remains of the "W. D." on one piece and this piece is marked plainly. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>),—I put these ink rings round them to point them out better—I have looked at an old piece called quarter leather, that is marked as well—these two blankets were found in the bed-room, they were marked with the Government mark in the centre, the mark is apparently out of this one, but it is a Government blanket—there is a mark on this other one, you can't see it unless you hold it up to a bright light, it is "W. D." and a broad arrow, all Government blankets are made with the selvage in this way, the W. D. is a mark that has been used since the Crimean war,; formerly they were marked "B.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of police attached to the dockyards—on Thursday, 23d February, between 8 and 9, I went with the other witnesses to Brook's house in Union-street, Woolwich—the house was pointed out to me by Hooton—I did not go in at first, I stayed outside—I heard the sergeant-major say, "Here is the mark plain enough"—he was looking at the leather—I went inside—Randall and Osborn then went up<lb></lb>stairs, leaving Newton and I downstairs with Brooks—Newton said to Brooks, pointing to the leather, "I suppose you gave as much for this as you could buy it honestly, "or" honourably "for"—I believe the word was "lawfully"—Brooks said something, but I did not catch it—in consequence of his wanting some beer, I said, "You seem to take it very comfortably"—he said, "Well, I have got into it, and I must get out of it"—I then came away—I apprehended Harrison the next morning at the Artillery barracks—I told him I was going to take him on a charge of stealing a quantity of leather, the property of the Crown, on Tuesday last—he did not say any<lb></lb>thing—I told him that a man of the name of Brooks, who kept a beershop in Union-street, was in custody for receiving the leather—he said he knew nothing about the leather—Brooks appeared sober when I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am staff collar-maker at the Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich—I have examined the leather produced; I find Government marks upon it—the value of it altogether is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—such leather as this is never condemned and sold by Government.</p>

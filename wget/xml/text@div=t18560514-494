                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No, 5, Lauderdale-buildings, Aldersgate-street. Beckley lodged with me till some short time after Nov. last, and the prisoner used to come to see him, sometimes once a week, and sometimes twice—he came invariably on Saturday evenings, and occasionally on Tuesday evenings, and he invariably carried a basket; and on one occa<lb></lb>sion I saw in it something in a brown paper, parcel—one Saturday night, about 6 o'clock in the evening, it might be three weeks prior to Beckley, being taken, the prisoner came; I opened the door, and he asked for Beckley, I told him he was not within; he seemed vexed, and said that he had come a long journey, from Stratford, and was tired—I told him if he liked to leave his banket, which seemed to be heavy, I would take care of it till Beckley came—he declined leaving it, and said that he would go over to the public house opposite, and await Beckley's return, if I would let one of my children let him know when Beckley came in, and invited me to partake of a little porter at the public house—I told my children, and then went over with him to the public house where he put a brown paper parcel on a form, and I saw a brown powder which seemed to ooze from it, as it does from these parcels produced—I did not remain two minutes with him, I had no drink—I did not see him afterwards at my house, but my children told me something—subsequent to Beckley's apprehension, I saw him at my house and opened the door to him, and I met him in Barbican after Beckley'a apprehension, and noticed that his whiskers were shaved off.</p>

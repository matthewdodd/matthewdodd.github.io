                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Benjamin Nevill, and two others, of No. 11, Maiden-lane. On Thursday, the 5th of May, the prisoner came with an order from Mr. Stent, of Oxford-street, this is the order—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he. merely gave it into my hand—I was engaged at the time—he said nothing to me—I sent him down to another part of the warehouse for the articles named in the order—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>)—"5th May. Please send by bearer about half a dozen silk pocket hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, of the newest pattern you have, on approval, and three pairs of women's full size stockings.</p>

                  </hi>, 265, Oxford-street. To Mr. Neville."—I sent him down the warehousemen the stockings—I sent the order with him, and went down to the lower part of the warehouse, to where the goods would be entered—I then asked him from whom he received the order—he said another boy gave it him—he said, "I knew the order was false, but the boy told me if I took it, it would be all right, and we would halve what the goods came to, as he knew I was very poor, and wanted money"—we detained him and gave him in charge—he had been questioned at the end of the warehouse before I went up to him, I believe, but I did not hear what passed—I did not tell him I suspected it was false, but asked from whom he received it—we have a customer named William Stent, but not Charles Stent</p>

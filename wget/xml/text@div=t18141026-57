               <p>Q. Where is that house? - A. It is called the Folly House, Blackwall. It was six o'clock when I went down there in the evening; I was attacked by the prisoners when I came from the public house, between seven and eight The prisoners stopped me, there were three of them; one of them stepped back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when they stopped you? - A. In the middle of the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any of the persons that stopped you? - A. I had seen them before; they knocked me down me first. I lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had knocked you down, what did they next do? - A. They took my pocket book, one of them did, and my new clothes that I had in my handkerchief in my hand; my money was in my pocket book; when they had taken that they ran away; they ran away with the pocket book and the bundle. There was in the pocket book one English crown. three three shilling pieces, two shillings in silver, and the ten-pound bill that I got from the consul. It was my own property; there were three breast pins in my pocket book, two new shirts in the bundle, and in the pocket book my discharge from the ship; and in the bundle a pair of new shoes, and one pair of white cotton stockings; it was a new silk and cotton handkerchief; these are the whole of what they took from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see their faces? - A. We walked together from the public house; I saw them at the public house before I was robbed; they walked along with me from the public house until we came to the canal; they there took my things, and ran away, after they had knocked me down. I saw them in the public house; there was a light in the room, I observed their persons so as to know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the persons who knocked you down and robbed you were the persons that were with you in the public house? - A. Yes, I am sure that the two prisoners are two of the three men who robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes; they called on me the 14th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning. The prisoner Gardner tendered me a ten pound note, and asked me to change it for him, in the presence of one another. Looking at the note, I saw it was the Consul's handwriting. I asked Gardner how he came by it? he said he got it for his wages. I asked him what ship he was on board of? he said he forgot the name. I asked him the Captain's name? he also had forgot that. I told him then to put his name on the back of the bill, and to call in an hour, I would give him an answer. He indorsed the bill in the name of Westerland. They then went away. I immediately inclosed the bill in a letter to Mr. Tottel, the Consul:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260037"></xptr>the bill was returned back, and a letter from Mr. Tottel, saying it was stolen from a sailor. I am certain it is the same bill returned back with Gardner's indorsement. There is now the indorsement of Gardner upon it. Gardner called; I told him to stop a few minutes. I sent for the parish officers, and had him apprehended, and the other also; they both came together. Not being able to walk, I gave the bill to Forrester, the officer, to shew the Lord Mayor, I never had the bill since,</p>

            . I am an officer of Aldgate. The place described by the prosecutor where the robbery was commited, is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney, in the county of Middlesex. Mr. Murray gave me charge of the two prisoners. This is the bill that Mr. Murray gave me. It has been in my custody ever since. It is in the same state now as it was then. On searching Gardner, I found a paper that was in the pocket book where this note was.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell that the note was taken out of the pocket book? - A. No, only what the prosecutor said.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HENNERSLEY. I am an officer. On the 20th of September. I was sent for to Mr. Murray's to apprehend Osmond. I found him at Mr. Murray's home; I took him into custody. I asked Osmond going along to the Compter, if he knew any thing of the robbery? he denied it. The next day he said, he would tell me all he knew of the robbery. I neither promised him any favour, or threatened him; he said he had been drinking with the prosecutor, in company with Gardner; that Gardner had persuaded him to go and rob the prosecutor; he said he had plenty of money about him. Osmond said he would not go; Gardner said he had better come along, that he should have part: through his persuasions Osmond went with him. I asked him if he had seen any thing of a bill; he said they all run away when they had robbed him; he said he saw the bill in the begining of the bustle, but he never had seen any thing of it afterwards. I asked him if he had any part of the money. He told me he had. I asked him what became of the breast-pins? He said he saw Gardner give a girl of the town one or two. He did not know which it was; he said he was sorry for what he had done; that was all he said; he said he was persuaded by Gardner or else he should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Gardner's Defence. I picked up a draft in Ratcliff Highway, on Monday morning. This man was close behind me; he said, what have you picked up? I said, I did not know; I can neither read nor write. I shewed it to a clothesman; he told me to go with it to Mr. Murray, I should have money for it.</p>
               <p>Osmond's Defence. I saw him pick up something; I did not know what it was at the time.</p>

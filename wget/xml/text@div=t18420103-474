                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel-road. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 23rd of December, I was in Whitechapel-road, and met the prisoner—she asked if I would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some gin—I said I had got no gin money—I was going on—she snatched out my watch and seals—I saw her distinctly throw it from her into the middle of the road—I then got hold of her by the back of her dress—she <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with her right hand, and struck me in the mouth, and cut my mouth dreadfully—she had gone about half-a-dozen yards before I caught her—I ran after her—she threw the watch away as soon as she saw herself closely pursued—I held her, calling for "Police," about ten minutes before any one came up, and then I was found on the ground—how I got down I do not know, but there were two or three men about me—the watch-guard was round my neck, and it was broken in two—I did not lose sight of the prisoner for a moment—I lost hold of her just as the policemen came up—this is my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going up Whitechapel at half-past eleven o'clock at night, to the person's I am stopping at. This man and a whole crowd of persons were round him, and two men. He shouted out to these two men, "Stop thief." One of them turned round and knocked him down. He was tipsy. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was as sober as I am now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 152.) I heard a cry—I saw the prisoner about a yard or a little more from where the prosecutor was, on the ground—I stopped her—the prosecutor sprang on his knees, and said, "Stop her, she has robbed me of my watch, and thrown it into the road"—he pointed to the place, and she struggled to get away—she said, "I have taken nothing from him"—I sprung my rattle—some other policemen came up, and one of them found the watch—the prosecutor had not hold of her when I came up—he was sober—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking a little.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About half-past eleven o'clock at night I was coming home, and a person of the house told me to go for his mistress; she was at a wake. I was running up Whitechapel: as I ran past the crowd, this man stood up, covered with mud. He said, "You are the girl that took my watch." I said, "Me, sir?" he said, "Yes." The policeman did not come for a quarter of an hour. I staid, and the police-man searched me, but did not find it; he said, "She has not got it, she threw it into the road." I solemnly declare before God I am quite in<lb></lb>nocent.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the shop been without any person in it? - A. Not as I recollect.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: Between the hours of nine and ten the prisoner brought the watch to pawn, I am positive as to him; having received information that a watch had been stolen, and from the description, I stopped the watch, and detained the prisoner; he told me his name was Mortimer, and said it cost him five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Osborne.) How much did it cost you? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190041"></xptr>A. Two guineas and a half; I bought it of Mr. Black, in the parish of St. John, Wapping; I know it to be mine, for here is my name, and where I live, on the dial-plate; I have had it about six months.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pritchard.) Did the prisoner tell you how long he had had it? - A. No, he did not; he said, afterwards, he received it from a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In the first place, I was a customer to this gentleman's master, the pawnbroker; I used to pledge things there; I pawned a watch there twelve months ago; says I, you had a watch of mine for 1l. 11s. 6d. which cost me five guineas; there was a man coming by that saw me buy the watch of a soldier, and a woman; they were both groggy, and I asked the price of it, and the soldier said, a guinea; the woman said, she would not sell it; I walked off, but the soldier called me back, and said, I should have it; I bought it for fifteen shillings, and thought I could not be hurt if I had it raffled for.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before he stopped you? - Yes, about 20 yards from me, coming towards me, he and another.</p>
               <p>What passed when he stopped you? - Just before he came to me I saw something glitter from under his coat, which was a pistol, he put it to my breast, but not quite close, and said, damn you, your money, and your watch; I said, I have no watch, and I had but a little money, and they should have it, but not to use me ill; then they asked me how much I had, I said between six and seven shillings, and I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him, and he put his other hand to look it over, then he asked me if I had no more, I said I had not, and the other man who was in soldier's clothes said, look whether he has got a watch or not, and I said I had not, they might search me, and before that he said pass, and then as he was going away, he turned about, he says, there are two more men in the hollow, but if they stop you, you say bob; the prisoner was taken up the 3d of July; it was a very fine clear night.</p>

               <p>Was it dark? - No, far from being dark.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the countenance of the men? - Exceedingly of this man, but of the other I did not, because of the other man I had not an opportunity, this man held the pistol to my breast, the other man went round me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - I am very positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did his figure strike you at the time? - Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>If you had described him now when you went home, how did you describe him? - I described his visage, a black swarthy man, about five feet ten inches, he was dressed in a lightish coat and red waistcoat, but I could not distinguish what cloth it was, as to his lower part I could not see, he had nothing over his face, his hat was flapped.</p>
               <p>When you saw him ten days after was you sure of him at that time? - Yes, I was very positive of it, as he accosted me in a very odd manner.</p>
               <p>How so? - On the 3d of July, as I was going home, I had a great coat on my arm, and a large bundle in my hand, I met him this side of the Bunch of Grapes, by Brompton road; there are new buildings there just began, I was looking over my hand to the buildings, and he said good cheer, old man! and at the same time said, damn your blood, do not be sulkey.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - His voice struck me, and I stood still, but he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140025"></xptr> did not, I says do you know me? and he says, damn you, I know you, and the next time I meet you, I'll do for you; he said I will meet you, and kept on going, and uttered many more oaths that I did not hear distinctly, but I never heard any oaths pronounced with such vengeance; I ran home and was quite astonished at it, and there was a trembling came upon me.</p>
               <p>I thought you lived at Hamstead? - Yes, but I came to Brompton to see my wife, I went and told my wife I had seen the man that robbed me; I did not stay with my wife a quarter of a minute, then I met two men, and I asked them to assist me, and they said they did not like to do such a thing; then I met with a good stout lad, I sent him for a constable and bid them follow me; I saw the prisoner go into the two brewers, and there I followed him, and the constable came in just after.</p>
               <p>The night you was robbed going towards Hampstead, was you perfectly sober? - Yes, Sir, I had only part of a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man before? - Not to my knowledge; I was not so much frightened at the time, only afterwards his telling me there were two men to meet me frightened me; I am clear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Now Mr. Fletcher, you are a gardener at Hampstead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far may that be from Knightsbridge? - I suppose it does not exceed six miles.</p>
               <p>Knightsbridge is not the road to Hampstead from London? - I did not go by Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Is Knightsbridge in the road to Hampstead from London? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Now the first thing that drew your attention to this man on the 3d of July, was his speaking to you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Otherwise you would not have seen him? - No, I did not see him till he spoke.</p>
               <p>That put you into a sad trembling, that same swearing about frightened you dreadfully, even almost out of your senses? - It did.</p>
               <p>But when you had two russians accosting you, and one with a pistol, you was not affraid? - I thought by my using no resistance they would not use violence.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you or was you not afraid? - I certainly was a little, but not so much.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this story in Bow-street? - I did.</p>
               <p>They took down what you said there, did they not? - They did not take down all.</p>
               <p>Did they take down any thing about Bob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it is not here, not a word you see about Bob? (looking at the examination) - I am very clear there was.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold of this man? - The beadle is here.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the beadle left him at liberty till the next day? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that from the beadle? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired who this man is that is at the bar? - No, no farther than the account that he gave of himself.</p>
               <p>Have you searched his lodgings? - No; he had a red waistcoat on, and his voice struck me first.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was you robbed on? - Thursday, it was a very light night, the moon was at the full the day before.</p>
               <p>Now recollect whether the moon rose earlier than eleven that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You will swear that it was up, and shining at the full? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw this man before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What should you think about it if I was to call you six people to prove he was in another place? - I could not believe it.</p>
               <p>I believe these twelve gentlemen will, and that will be a better thing.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning this man came to the two brewers at Knightsbridge, and charged the landlord to take up the prisoner, whom I knew very well, he said I have nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140026"></xptr> to do with prisoners; what is the matter; says he, he has robbed me? then says he, you must get a constable; says he, take hold of that man; what man says I, what Belton! there the man stands, I know him very well, I laid hold of him, and we went before Mr. Justice Gilbert, the same day, and he was committed, then Mr. Belton said, I should be glad not to go to prison, let me lay at the public house, or at the constable's house; says Mr. Gilbert, I have committed you, but if the constable and you can agree, I have no objection, so we went and had a pot of beer, and I took him home to my own house, and kept him all night, and the next morning I took him before Sir Sampson Wright; I have known Mr. Belton for two years, he is a shoemaker at Knightsbridge, he lived along with Mr.

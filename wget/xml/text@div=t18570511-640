                  </hi>. I am a parcels deliverer to the General Steam Navigation Company. On Friday, 17th April, about 6 o'clock, I was in Woolwich, in a public house, the Star I think—I was with Ager, a friend whom I had been to see at the barracks, and we had some half and half—the prisoner was there drinking with another female; they asked Ager to drink, and he did so, and I think I did—they finished what they had, and went out, leaving us there; we went out about five minutes afterwards towards the Arsenal, and met them, and all went to the Mortar Tavern, and waited till 9 o'clock, when it was time for my friend to go into the barracks—he wished us good night, and I went with the two females to a public house about half a mile away, and from there to their home—I was in their room for an hour; I was with the prisoner, and a young man, who was a stranger to me, was with the other—we then all four proceeded to another public house, we went to a room at the back of the bar and sat down, and while there I fell asleep; when I awoke I found my waistcoat undone, and missed my watch and guard, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the girls were then gone, and this young man, whom the prisoner had represented to be her cousin from Dart<lb></lb>ford, said that they had only just gone out, and would be back directly—I first saw him at the Mortar Tavern; he came in, and the prisoner got up and had a slight conversation, and he sat down, and remained in our company till I fell asleep—he said, "I will go and see if I can find them, and you come with me"—he took me about the town, and when we were by the side of Woolwich theatre, where there is a little turning, he said, "Stay here, I shall not be a minute;" I thought he was a long while gone, and looked down the court, and found that he had gone—I found my way back to the green<lb></lb>grocer's shop, where the prisoner and the other woman lived, and a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> put her head out at the window, and said that they had gone—I left my name and address there, and they said that they had no doubt she would be there again, and they would give her in charge—I have seen my watch and guard since—I was perfectly sober; I had had no spirits, only half and half, and I did not take enough to make me in the least intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer and fruiterer, and am the landlord of this house. The prisoner lived there two nights—on the first night, the 15th, she took a single bed for herself and her companion, and next morning she took a furnished room, and told us that she was an arti<lb></lb>ficial flower maker, and that the other was a dressmaker—they came in on the evening of the 17th with Laing, at a little after 9 o'clock, but I did not see him till they came down—perceiving that things were not right, my wife went up and knocked at the door, and told her it was time for the com<lb></lb>pany to withdraw, for I did not like their proceedings, and the prisoner came down to know if I would allow the young men to sleep there in their bed—I said, "No"—she said, "Will you allow them to sleep in the bed we slept in the first nigh?"—I said, "No"—she said, "If you will not allow the young men to sleep, we will not stop"—I said, "You can do as you please," and they went out, but without their things—I and my family went to bed, and just before 12 o'clock the prisoner came knocking at the door in great haste—I said, "You. might have told us you were coming in, and I should have sat up"—she said, "My brother has come down from London, and has brought me a watch, my aunt sent it to me by my brother"—I said, "Go along up stairs to your room, I do not want to know anything about your watch"—she said, "I am not going to stop," and packed up her clothes, and was off in five minutes—I saw a watch at the police court, it was the same that the prisoner showed me.</p>

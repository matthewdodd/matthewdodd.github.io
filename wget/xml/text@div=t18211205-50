On the 31st of October we had a quarrel about some worsted, I went down to dinner about half past one o'clock, and when I returned, he shewed me a piece of worsted, which he had taken from my part of the shop and said it was his, and was in his possession before, I said it was mine, I went to the loom and caught hold of the worsted, he was working with it, and said, whether it was mine or not I should not have it, I said, I would, and kept my hold, he got out of the loom where he was sitting at work, and dragged me a yard or two, a scuffle ensued, he gave me two or three blows to get my hand loose, I struck him two blows, not more, neither of our blows were very violent, I cannot tell where I hit him, he struck me one or two more, and finding it did not good, he dragged me about two yards backwards, and called for a pair of scissars, he snatched a pair off my master's loom, grasped them in his hand, and thrust them into my breast; I endeavoured to pin his arms behind, but I had not much strength, as the blood came very violent from the wound, he changed the position of the scissars and ran them into my thigh, and then into my arm, in nine places; he then let me go. I was afterwards examined by Mr. Thomas the surgeon. We were not on good terms before, I thought I could beat him, he thought he could beat me; we fought several times, but it was never decided.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. BRODRICK Q. You first went to claim the worsted - A. Yes; be had taken it from my loom, and accused me of taking it from his, he was sitting in the loom when I came up, and shewed me the worsted, he was sitting in the loom when I caught hold of it; I did not strike the first blow, I did not bite him, I did not fetch a pair of scissars when we separated; after he wounded me I got a pair, and said, how could he be so cruel as to run a pair of scissars of that kind into any body; he said, "I am ready for you again." I did not offer to strike him with them, he continued to work there till he was taken, which was a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a quarrel with one Naggs - A. Yes; I did not threaten to stab him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he in a great passion at the time - A. Yes; my Lord, the scissars were about two yards from where he sat. Our worsted is not weighed out to us, it did not matter which used it. He got the scissars directly after I struck him, I do not suppose he meant to strike me with them when the quarrel began, he was in a passion at my not letting go of the worsted. I endeavoured to pinion his arms after he struck me, he had the scissars in his hand while he was struggling to get loose.</p>

            . I was in the shop at the time of the quarrel, Wood was at work at his loom, and missed some red worsted and went to look for it while Mattock was out, and when he came up, he said, "What did you take this for?" Mattock insisted on having it, and in the scuffle pulled him out of his loom, and they scuffled down to my master's loom, which was next to them, he found Mattock too strong for him, and got the scissars, but but in the moment of irritation, I suppose, he did not know what he was about. I saw no blows pass between them, they were scuffling for the worsted, I do not think he intended to strike him with the scissars when it first began.</p>

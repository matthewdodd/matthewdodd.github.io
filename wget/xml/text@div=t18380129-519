I know the prisoner—she came to my house on the 9th of October, and said she had no work—I lodged her, and victualled her, to do for my family—she remained there till the 12th, and then she went after I went out in the morning—I left my girl some money to buy some flour and potatoes—I went out about my business—when I came back, the prisoner had absconded—my trunk was broken open—the</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father. I remember the prisoner being at home that day—she was to make a pudding, but she did not do it—she asked me to go and fetch her half a pint of porter—when I came back she had got a bundle under her arm, and I said, "What ia that?"—she said, "What is that to you?"—she went away, and said she was going to my father—nobody else came there and broke the box—my brother found the box was open after she was gone—I do not know how long—my father came home before twelve o'clock, and it was before that that she went, a good while—no one else came to the house—I was gone ten minutes for the beer.</p>

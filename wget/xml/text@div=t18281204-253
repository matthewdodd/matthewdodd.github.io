            . On the 27th of November, about a quarter-past three o'clock, I went to Smithfield, and saw the prisoner dragging a truck; he had just left some person, who had been looking at it: when he came up to me I asked him if he had bought it - he said No, he had got it for sale; I asked what he wanted for it - he said 12s.; I said "It is not just such a thing as suits me" - he said, "I will sell it for 10s.;" I offered him 7s. - he said if I liked it at three half-crowns I should have it; I bought it at last for 7s. - I knew him before.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in Pitfield-street on the 28th; I saw the truck, and shewed the same to the prosecutor, who accused the prisoner of stealing it, which he denied.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOLTON re-examined. Q.Did you know him before? A. No; he was with me the first time about two minutes, and then came again and staid about the same time - I am positive he is the person; I met him in the street; I put my hand on his shoulder, and asked how he came to sell my truck in Smithfield; he said,"Don't handle me;" I saw the officer and gave him in charge; I knew Rowland; I met him, and told him I had lost my truck; he said, "I dare say I have bought it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made no resistance; I was at home that day from twelve o'clock, and never went out: I know nothing about it.</p>

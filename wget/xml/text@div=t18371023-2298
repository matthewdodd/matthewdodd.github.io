                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman, and live in Stacey street, Seven-dials. On Saturday morning, the 30th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoners, Szezygielski and Piotrowski, came toge<lb></lb>ther and asked me whether I bought second-hand clothes—Szezygielaski asked me the question—I knew they were foreigners, but I could under<lb></lb>stand</p>

               <p>them very well—I asked if they were foreign clothes—they said they were—I asked whether they were their own property—they said they were, and if I would go with them to their lodging I might see them—I went with them to their lodging at the Nag's Head, James-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden, and saw Dolubowski lying on the bed with his clothes on—they were all three together in the room then—there were some clothes lying on the floor—they pointed to them, and said that was what they wanted to tell as they were going abroad—they consisted of morning coats and other costs—there were five coats sound and whole, and one ripped to pieces, a cloak, two pairs of trowsers, and a yard and a half of red cloth—Szezy<lb></lb>gielski asked me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Szezygielski took the money—on the Monday afternoon the policeman brought Szezygielski H sod the prosecutor to my shop, and I knew him—I gave up to the policeman the property I had bought of them.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HUTCHENCE. I was present at the time the prisoner came and had a glass of gin, and offered the prosecutrix a bad shilling. I went out to watch him, he came out, when he got about 100 yards off, another man joined him - I followed them to the Nag's Head, in Aldersgate-street; they separated there-the other man went in-the prisoner went to the corner of Bull and Mouth-street. I met Goddard, and we secured him at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street, where he was waiting. I charged him with passing bad money - I saw him drop a bag, which a boy picked up and gave to Goddard in my presence, containing ten counterfeit shillings; another bag, containing seven more, was found on him, and 6s. 6d. in good money, separated from the bad.</p>
               <p>HOWEL GODDARD. I met Hutchence, and took the prisoner who was waiting at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street. Hutchence said he had passed bad money, and he believed he had the swag. I took him to the Nag's Head; he dropped a bag containing ten counterfeit shillings - I found another bag on him, containing seven more; he had 6s. 6d. in his pocket, of good money.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of Bow-street. On Tuesday morning, the 16th of July, about half past four in the morning, I met the prisoner with a quantity of fowls in a basket, he appearing to me to be a suspicious character I stopped him, I asked him where he brought the fowls from; he told me from Wemley, after further questioning him I asked him again; he said he brought them from Fleet Market; I then asked him if he was not a foreigner. He called me a b - y English b - r, and if I followed him he would give me this, taking this pair of scissars out of his pocket; I then drew back a little, but kept hold of the basket. When I got to the watchhouse I examined it, and found it contained fourteen fowls; I took two pair of scissars from him, he had them both in his pocket. I took him to the magistrate and found out the prosecutor, I shewed him the fowls, he swore to them at Bow-street. The fourteen fowls were all dead; I suppose they were cut in the throat by these small pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How were these fowls taken out of your place - A. On the over night the door was open till nine o'clock, and then the door is locked up. I know the fowls, I bred some of them, and some I bought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Fleet Market, I gave a guinea for them; I am a foreigner, I was taken prisoner on board a ship.</p>

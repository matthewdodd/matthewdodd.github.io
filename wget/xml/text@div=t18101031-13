               <p>Q. When did you lose any thing out of your shop - On the 18th of last month I lost five gold seals; I saw them at three o'clock, and missed them at five.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the house yourself all that time - A. Yes. There was me and my wife. The seals laid in the shop window; one pane of glass was broken, it was cracked before; I never perceived it broken till five o'clock. It was only cracked in one place before; when I saw it broken there were two small pieces out; it was broken in two pieces, they were knocked in the inside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it was done by force and violence, or as if it had fell out - A. It appeared as if done by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the seals placed - A. Close to the windows; when the two pieces of glass were out any person might put their two fingers in and take the seals, they laid close to the glass, I had observed them there before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were set in gold, were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them five seals - A. I should imagine about seven or eight pounds. I missed them all at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by the light of day at five o'clock, on the 8th of October, that you saw your window broken and your seals taken away - A. Yes.</p>

            . On the 8th of October, about a quarter past three, I saw the prisoners in Holborn, they were all three together, I knew them very well; I suffered them to pass me; I immediately turned round, I observed Mann give a gold seal to the prisoner Smith; I immediately catched hold of Smith's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Holborn was this in - A. Nearly opposite of Turnstile. I could see him putting the seal into Smith's hand; they were all three walking abreast; I being behind, saw the seal; Mann put his hand sideways to Smith, Smith took it; I caught hold of Smith's hand, he at the first instant put his hand behind him, and when he found I was getting hold of his hand he threw it into the street; I observed the seal drop; I dragged the prisoner to the seal and picked it up; I looked at it and asked him where he got it, he said he bought it of a boy, and gave two-pence for it; I then took him to the office in Bow-street; I searched him, in his fob I found three other gold seals. He was detained. I made it known to my brother officers, they took Berry and Mann in about two hours in Holborn. This was on the 18th of October, about a quarter past three o'clock; I saw them about three or four doors from the prosecutor's, they were coming down Holborn in a direction, as if from his house, on the same side. I produce the seals. The fifth seal was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are these four of the seals that you lost - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- LIMERICK. I am am an officer. I apprehended Mann and Berry in Holborn, a quarter after five; in consequence of information by 
               <persName id="t18101031-13-person224">Salmon</persName>
             I searched Mann, I found six shillings and six pence on him, and this knife; I searched the other prisoner and found four shillings and six-pence. When I had Mann and Berry going along to the office, Mann offered me five shillings if I would let him go. I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the name of Salmon, and that he had given you some information - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Smith. I told the officer that I found these things; will he swear that I said I bought it of a boy, and gave two pence for it.</p>
               <p>Salmon. He said he bought it of the other boy, that was his expression, for two-pence.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was going down Holborn about half after three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 18th of October, I kicked a piece of paper on the edge of the curbstone, a seal fell out of it into the kennel; I immediately picked up the paper, then I went and picked up the seal. There were two papers; there were three seals in the papers, besides the one that fell in the kennel; I put the three into my fob pocket, and I was wiping this one that fell in the mud. As for these two prisoners I know nothing of them, upon my oath, they were never with me, I never saw him before with my eyes. This gentleman laid hold of me, and jolting my hand, he knocked the seal out of my hand that I was wiping of; he asked me where I got them, I told him I found them. He then took me to Bow-street. I am innocent; I never saw the shop in my life, neither were these boys walking abreast with me.</p>
               <p>Mann's Defence. I never saw this boy before in my life, until I was at the office.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. I know

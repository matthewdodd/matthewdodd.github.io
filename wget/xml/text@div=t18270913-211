               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was at a club, was it not? A. Yes; there were fifty or sixty people in the room; Sullivan was chairman - I did not find the prisoner in another room.

I did not tell the prisoner I did not suspect him.</p>

            . I live at St. Giles. On the 7th of August, at night, in going to the Hare and Hounds for a pint of beer for my father, the prisoner spilt part of it in the house - I kept up to him, and asked why he did that - he did not answer me; I heard one Herring say to him, "Is it all right?" he said "It is;" I saw Shehan have a watch in his hand, the key and chain slipped between his fingers, as he put it into his breeches pocket - it was a silver watch, a brass chain, gold seals, and gold ring - he ran off as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been told how many seals the watch had? A. I used to see it every day - my father told me it was silver, and a brass chain; it was just after eleven o'clock - it is a dark place, but there is a gaslight - I was never in trouble; Donohoe sells fruit, and my father sells fish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you mention this? A. Next morning, when I heard the prosecutor had lost his watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of August, at nine o'clock, I was going my rounds, and met the prosecutor, who said he believed the prisoner had took his watch, for he had been seen with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that the following day? A. Yes - he said he had been talking to the prisoner, and he had offered to go before a Magistrate. I went and found the prisoner in bed.</p>

I was waiting at the door to see my wife, to get 6d., to go into the club-room; I went in, borrowed 6d., and the prosecutor called me to him; they were pushing one another about; Sullivan left the room with me about eleven o'clock - the prosecutor was then accusing Kilronen of taking his tobacco-box and watch; I went home, and next night heard I was accused; I went and drank with him.</p>

            . I was chairman at this free-and-easy club - I left the chair about a quarter to eleven o'clock, and went into the parlour; Shehan and two others went with me; he was in the room till I left the chair, I am certain; while we were drinking in the parlour the prosecutor came into the parlour, walked out, returned, and said he had lost his watch; the prisoner had not been out of my company: we went out together, and saw him at the bar, accusing Barney Kilronen of robbing him of his watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was no search proposed? A. None; Shehan sat near him. Kilronen was taken to the watch-house, and to the office next day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 469). On 26th Feb., about half put 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane—I asked him if he had any bad money about him—he said he had none, and he handed his <hi rend="italic">portmonnaie</hi> to me directly—I put that in my pocket, and asked him for the other money, and I took hold of him at the same time—he said he had no bad money—a struggle ensued between us, and we both fell—I instantly got up again, and Westley came to my assistance—we dragged the prisoner into the shop of Mr. Powis, a carpenter in Drury-lane—as we were dragging him along he dropped this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the step of a door—it contained ten base half-crowns—I picked it up—we succeeded in getting him into the shop—when there he still struggled to get away, and I was obliged to lash his hands—some one handed me a packet, containing twenty base shillings, and Westley handed me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers.</p>

On the afternoon of 26th Feb., I saw the prisoner and the policeman scrambling at a doorway—the policeman threw him down in the road, and called for assistance—I picked up a small paper on the pavement; I do not know who threw it down; it was about a yard from where I saw this man—the policeman reached out his hand for it, and I gave it him—I picked up 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence, and gave them to Mr. Powis's man.</p>

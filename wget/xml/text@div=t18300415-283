               <p>JANE HILLS. I rent two rooms in <placeName id="t18300415-283-crimeloc1558">Half Nichol-street, Bethnal-green</placeName>

On the 28th of March I saw this box of old iron in my cellar - the cellar is divided into two parts; I have the back part, the other is not used - my part was locked, but there is a hole from the front cellar which a boy could creep through from the yard; he could then open a door in my cellar, which is neither locked nor bolted; it is merely boards which form part of the partition.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ALLCOCK. I was an officer when this occurred. I now live at Bethnal-green. On the 31st of March I was in Half Nichol-street about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a boy coming along with something under his arm; I went over and found it was this box covered over - in consequence of what he told me, I went to the next house to the prosecutrix, where the prisoner's mother lives, and found the prisoner there; I asked if he gave his brother that box to sell - he voluntarily said that he did; I asked where he got it - he said out of the prosecutrix's house; he is older than his brother who I had met with the box; it contains old iron, and is worth 5d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it in my mother's cellar.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my uncle, Charles Cleare, in Blackman-street. On Tuesday afternoon, the 2nd of Feb., I was in the shop—the prisoners came in—Harrison asked for a border—she was shown some—she</p>

               <p>was standing at the counter—the other two prisoners were at a recess—Harrison said the collars were not what she wanted—I went to the end of the counter, and watched the other two prisoners at the recess—I saw Hoare drop a cap from her cloak—I saw it fall—I saw it at her side by her cloak—there was no cap on the ground before that—it was my uncle's—I had seen it before the prisoners came into the shop—my uncle charged them with stealing it—Hoare denied it, and said she picked it up from the floor—it could not have fallen—it could not have been brushed off by the cloak—it was too high for that—after Mr. Cleare had scolded the prisoners, they went away—he told me to watch them—they walked together, and went into a pawn<lb></lb>broker's-shop—they came out, and went into another pawnbroker's—two of them went in, and one stood outside—they went into a public-house n the Waterloo-road together, and then they went to Mr. Clark's together—Mr. Clark then followed, and gave them in custody—I saw the ribbon in the hand of Hoare at the time.</p>

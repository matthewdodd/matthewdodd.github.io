In consequence of information on Friday the 3rd of March, between the joists of the floor of the shop, and the ceiling of the cellar; I there saw an ox tongue; I took it out, made an incission and put a card in it with my own name on it; after I had marked it I put it back to the place, after which I went to dinner; after I sat down to dinner, I heard the door of the cellar either open or shut; I left my dinner and found that Levy and my other servant were both gone out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the house together - A. That I cannot say. I went into the street, and took the direction that went to Harris's house; I got sight of the man, which I suppose was Levy; I did not see his face, it appeared to be Levy from the size of him; I followed the same person into Harris's house; after he had been in the house perhaps a minute, I put my ear to the keyhole, I heard some voice, I cannot say it was either Harris or Levy, nor could I tell what they said; I went to get an officer, he was not at home; on the second consideration I thought I would leave it alone till the morning. On Saturday morning I went to Harris's house, he is a butcher in Petticoat-lane; I asked him if he had any tongues to sell, he said he had four or five; I requested him to let me look at them; he said he had sold them to another butcher. I took two tongues out of the tub.</p>

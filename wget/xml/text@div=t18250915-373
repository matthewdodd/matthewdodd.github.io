I made a bit of a stop to ease myself, and three women went before me - they were Gainsford, Porter, and one who is not taken. I went on, and the one who is not here said "Come old fellow, are you not going to have sixpennyworth to night." I said "It is a pity but you had sixpennyworth at the tread-mill." I turned my head, and saw Thompson and Brooks coming after me; they immediately struck me, knocked my hat over my eyes, and knocked me down, and began to ill-use me in a most cruel manner; one of them said "Cut the b - 's ear off, and frisk him;" they took my watch from my pocket, and 2 s. 1 d. from my right-hand waistcoat pocket. I knocked down Porter, and the one who is not here, and got the watch from them; they ran away into Little Moorfields - I followed, and said, I should detain them till I got assistance to take them. The whole five then immediately beset me, and ill-used me again. After I had been knocked about in a most horrid manner, and a great many persons collected, an officer came named Herbert. I asked him to take them into custody; he said he had nothing to do with it, I must go about my business, or he would take me - they all burst out laughing. In about half an hour, I got the assistance of some friends, and found an officer named Payne; he took the girl who is not here, searched her, and let her go. I then went to Cripplegate watch-house, and the constable sent an officer with me. I found Gainsford and Thompson in Little Moorfields; we took them to the watch-house, went out again, and found Porter, who ran away, and got in between the two horses of a hackney coach; we took her, and the next evening, I took Brooks in Little Moorfields. I asked her where she was going - she said, "To take a walk." I said, if she would go with me to the corner of Moor-lane, I would talk about that. I then gave charge of her.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of September I was at the watch-house. The prosecutor came and stated he had been robbed of his watch, and he had spoken to some officer, who would not assist him. I went with him to Little Moorfields, and we saw Gainsford. I told her I had a charge of felony against her; I told her to walk before me. I went down Little Moorfields, and there I took Thompson; I took them to the watch-house. When we were walking to Guildhall from the Compter, Gainsford and Brooks said they knew something about it. They said the prosecutor had asked a woman named Place to go down the alley for sixpence, which he gave her, but before she would go down she would spend it in gin, that as soon as she had drank the gin she would not comply with his wishes, and he struck her a violent blow, which caused her to cry Murder! and the others went up and assisted her; they admitted having struck him, but as to robbing him they denied it.</p>

               <p>GAINSFORD's Defence. I was going down Little Moorfields, and I met a young woman; she said she had been down a court with a young man, and would I have any thing to drink, and we went into a house; as we came out the prosecutor met us, and he struck her; they fought for some time, till fifty or sixty people were collected; she cried out Murder! and I went up to take her part.</p>

I said "For what?" and he said "You are one - your own words has done it." I staid at the corner of Moor-lane with him, and he gave a boy some halfpence to go for his brother and his wife. I stood there some time, and some persons said "Why don't you go, you are no prisoner." I then went to Mr. Barnes', and the officer came and took me.</p>
               <p>PORTER'S Defence. I was coming down from Finsbury-square, and the prosecutor knocked me down, and cut my arm; I was two or three minutes there; I was not in Little Moorfields at all.</p>

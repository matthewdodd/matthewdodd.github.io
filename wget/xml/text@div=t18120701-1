I stopped and looked into two or three shop windows; and when I was stopping at one I heard the cry of stop thief. I looked back and saw a crowd collected. I enquired the meaning of it. The officer (Martin) stepped up to me immediately, and told me I had lost something out of my pocket. I put my hand into my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone. The handkerchief was immediately held up by the officer, and I recognised it to be my property. I had the handkerchief in my hand a short time before, but I did not feel the handkerchief taken out of my pocket.</p>

            . I am one of the city constables. On the 8th of June, a little after seven, I saw the two prisoners in company with another youth, about seventeen years of age, at the corner of Hatton Garden. I first saw the prisoners and the other youth. I suspected they were there for the purpose of picking pockets. I watched them. I saw them follow a gentleman. They tried his pocket. I do not think he had any thing in his pocket. They turned round again then, and were in conversation together. I then passed them, and saw them follow another gentleman. They attempted his pocket five or six times, but they did not succeed there. They walked along together until they came to where the prosecutor and a lady were standing together at a shop-window. They all three surrounded this gentleman, and pretended to look in at the window; and the one that is not in custody went up close to the prosecutor. These two prisoners went close in, to prevent any person from seeing what he was about. The prosecutor moved away from the window, and the boys likewise. When the prosecutor first moved away, his handkerchief was out of his pocket about two inches. The boys had got on before the prosecutor: they stopped until he had passed them again. The one that is not taken drew up: the two prisoners covered again. He 
               <persName id="t18120701-1-person55">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief half out, and then the prosecutor walked on again. They then followed up as they had done the time before, and the one that is not taken 
               <persName id="t18120701-1-person56">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief clean out with his hand. The moment he drew it out he threw it behind, and the prisoner Lee caught it with his hand. I ran across the road: Lee saw me coming: he began to cry, and attempted to get away. I catched hold of him by the collar. The other two ran away immediately. I called out, stop thief. Tyrrell, after he ran a little way up the road, stepped on the pavement a little way, and walked. I dragged Lee, and ran and caught Tyrrell by the collar likewise. It was all done momentary.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of Tyrrell - A. No, not at all. I was in the road calling out, stop thief. The other boy got away. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that your handkerchief - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; nor called any witnesses to their characters.</p>

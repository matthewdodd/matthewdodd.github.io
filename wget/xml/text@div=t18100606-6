            , ESQ. Q. On the 18th of April last were you returning from London to your country house - A. I was riding on horseback, returning from London to Munden, in the parish of Hendon, between the four and five mile stone, between <placeName id="t18100606-6-crimeloc28">London</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18100606-6-crimeloc28" type="placeName" value="London"></interp>

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar - A. I do; I had a view of his person distinctly; he took hold of the rein of the bridle with his left hand, holding the pistol in his right.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner on foot - A. Yes, and alone; he said give me your money, or I'll shoot you; I did not give him the money that time, in a little time he repeated, if you do not give me your money I'll shoot you; in a little time after I gave him my purse, with my money in it; there were thirty-three shillings in it, in sixpences, shillings, and five shilling pieces, a half crown piece, as stated in the indictment. I believe that was the exact sum, but as I had been in London I cannot say to a shilling or two; there was a remarkable sixpence among the money in the reign of king William, 1698, was the date; it being a sixpence that had not been worn, I carried it in my pocket three or four years. He then asked me for my pocket book, I did not deliver him my pocket book; he said, if you do not give me your pocket book I will shoot you, my pistol is well primed; I told him I thought there was enough in my purse to content him; then he said to me, is there much in it, to which I answered, I cannot tell, you can tell by the weight of it as well as I can; then he took his hand off my bridle, and we parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe which way the prisoner went A. I did; I went over just the rise of the hill that he might think I was gone home quietly; I met with a young man, I told him I had been robbed, I asked him if he would go back and help to take the footpad; we soon after saw Mr. Dixie, to whom I mentioned the circumstance, he very regularly joined me, and in a few minutes we had possession of the prisoner; he was searched, Mr. Dixie pulled the pistol out of his pocket, without any flint or any charge, and he also pulled my purse out of his pocket; I looked at my purse and saw my sixpence there; the purse and money was given to the patrol of Edgware.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other sixpences of the same date - A. No doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you overtook the prisoner was he walking - A. I saw him turn down a lane. I must in justice say of him, for a crime of this kind, I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060008"></xptr>know how he could commit it with less offence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DIXIE. Q. In consequence of Mr. Parker communicating the circumstance to you, you returned with him and apprehended the prisoner - A. I did; Mr. Parker met me at the bottom of the hill, as far as what he speaks in my presence is perfectly correct.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Parker. You were before the same magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your purse - A. It is my purse; the sixpence corresponds with what I had; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would shoot you, at that time did you suppose the pistol to be loaded - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the terror of that threat you delivered your money - A. Yes, I did. If he had told me his pistol had not been loaded I should not have delivered it to him.</p>

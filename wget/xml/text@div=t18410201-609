                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 125.) On Saturday night, the 2nd of January, about twelve o'clock, or a little after, I was on duty opposite Ta<lb></lb>bernacle-row, City-road, and heard a cry of "Police" coming from the corner of Tabernacle-row—I went towards the cry—I did not see any one on the ground—I saw the two prisoners running from the direction in which the cry was—from what a woman told roe I pursued the prisoner John—I cannot say that I saw the other then—I overtook John, and took him into custody—I told him he must stop, as I did not know but what he was wanted, something was the matter, from what I had heard—the prisoner Michael then came up, laid hold of my collar, put his knees to</p>

               <p>the back part of my knees, and threw me down on my back—John ran away—he did nothing towards throwing me down—I immediately got up, ran after him, and took him again—he was very violent, struck me several times with his fists, and did all he possibly could to get away—after a little time Michael came from up a yard somewhere, laid hold of me and John, and tried to rescue him away from me—I laidn hold of him as well, and John tried to get away, and Michael to get him away—Michael laid hold of me and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me away, and struck me several times, and John also—they both struck me—finding they were too much for me, I let Michael go—I then took out my truncheon, and said, if he did not keep away I should have to use it—I struck at him, but did not reach him, I hit a witness on the finger—I then lost sight of him for two or three mi<lb></lb>nutes, when be came behind me and wrenched my staff over my shoulder—I brought him round in front of me—he then gave another wrench, and wrenched it from my hand—he then stepped back three or four yards, and with a flourish struck me over the nose with my truncheon—it knocked me down—I bled a good deal from the mouth and nostrils, and, I think, a little from the wound on the top of the nose—after I was knocked down, John ran away—I got up, pursued, and took him info custody again—he struggled very much to get away, and had very nearly done so, when Michael came up alongside of me, and hit me on the fide of the head—I fell down insensible—I believe I have a slight recollection that his feet were on me afterwards, but not enough to swear to, I was con<lb></lb>fused by the blow—I was conveyed to the station by some gentlemen, and when I got better I saw the prisoners there—Mr. Nott saw me about half an hour after the accident occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw Feet on the Sunday morning—he was covered with blood and dirt—he complained of a great deal of pain and exhaustion, dimness of sight, vomiting, and so forth—I examined him, and found a contusion on the bridge of the nose, with an abraised surface—the outer skin was only cut through—there was ecchymosis from the blow, about the eyes—no skin was broken any where, not even on the nose, merely the outer skin—it was certainly not a wound—a contusion is a wound, but not an abrasion.</p>

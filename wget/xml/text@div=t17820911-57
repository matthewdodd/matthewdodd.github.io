               <p>Court. What, the prisoner wanted to have to do with you ? - Yes, my Lord, against my will.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he cut you? - In the middle part of my leg, the wound is as long as my finger, I must go into the hospital tomorrow: After this the prisoner at the bar had his will of me, two of them more had their will; I cannot say who the others be that had to do with me, I am sure of this man, two of the others had to do with me besides.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this was about a quarter before nine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It must be pretty light at that time of the year? - It was light.</p>
               <p>Court. Was nobody coming in the road? - I did not see any body where they dragged me down, they had me about an hour, then it was quite dark; I am sure of the prisoner, I saw him at Bow-street about a week after, and picked him out from a great many more; I have recovered none of my things.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you prefer this indictment ? - I had it last Wednesday, I had not money before; I am more positive to this man than the rest, because he was using me ill for a considerable time.</p>

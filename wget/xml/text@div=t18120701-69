               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen them - A. On the Saturday before, the 13th of May. On the 24th or 25th, I saw them at the pawnbrokers, and I knew them to be mine. They were quite new. I kept them in my box.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMALLBOXES. I am a pawnbroker, 23, Tottenham-court-road.</p>

               <p>MR. SANDERSON. I keep the Oxford coffee-house.

            , and several of the gentlemen, I requested every servant to pay attention to endeavour to discover the robbery. I particularly desired the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010055"></xptr> to be attentive to find out the thief. He begged that he might go for an officer. I declined, and said, I should like to have better proof before I sent for an officer He had suspicion of another person in the house.

             informed me, that her box was locked, as she had left it. I concluded, it must have been false keys which was the cause of it. The prisoner was in the habit of going out in the morning, and then returning to his work. I inquired at the locksmith's, if any application had been made there for keys at Mr. Horton's. I found a mould, in soap, for the formation of a key, which had been carried there by Charles Bullock. I returned home, and found this mould fitted Virgin's key; in consequence of that I concluded

             must be the person who had done it. In a week after that I had Bullock taken up. I wanted to find the person that was in the habit of holding communication with Bullock in the passage and gateway. Her name was Jane Hancock: she was in the habit of calling upon him. Not being able to find where she lived, I sent for an officer of Marlborough-street. The two Foys came, and searched the boxes and persons of every servant in the house. The prisoner very reluctantly informed us where Jane Hancock lived, and, on searching Hancock. we found the duplicate of the tongs: this is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>MR. SMALLBONES. This is the duplicate that I gave to the person that pawned these tongs.</p>

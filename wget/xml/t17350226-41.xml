            , Constable. The Prisoner being brought to the Watch House, desired me to go with her to where she had been with the Prosecutor to see if he had not dropt the Case, I took four Watchmen with me. She carried us to a little passage in Gunpowder Alley. and said, the Case was there, but neither I nor the Watchmen could find it. She desired liberty to look for it her self, but I would not let her, for I thought she wanted to drop it, and I told her she had better confess. Who then to plain with you, says she, I have given it to a man in Brewer's Yard in Shoe Lane. We went thither, and down came the Woman in her Smock, she was one of the largest size and looked like a Grenadier. The Prisoner wanted me to let her go aside with this Woman but I refused, she said if I would not let them go together it would signify nothing. As we were going back the Prisoner owned she had got the Case in her Hand, and then I took it from her. The Jury <rs id="t17350226-41-verdict208" type="verdictDescription">

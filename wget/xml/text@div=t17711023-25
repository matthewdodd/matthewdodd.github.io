The prisoner and another man came into our shop, on the 22d of September, about nine o'clock in the morning; while I was serving the other man, the prisoner went into my back room; I could see him in the room, and I watched him all the time; he walked round the room, and then he went to the glass and seemed to admire himself: he came out in two or three minutes, and said your tea-kettle boils over, I will take it off. I said pray let it stand, it will do no harm. He went into the back room again, I saw him take the kettle off, and then he went towards the beaufet; I saw him put his hand to his pocket, but I did not see what he took. He came out in about a minute; the other man paid for his stockings, and they both went away. I went to the beaufet and missed the the spoon immediately; I had just wiped the spoon and put it in the beaufet before I went to serve them. (the spoon produced and deposed to.) I went immediately into the street and alarmed the neighbourhood; the prisoner was taken and brought into my house; we were going to search him, but the prisoner pulled out the spoon and gave it to me; he desired we would let him go.</p>

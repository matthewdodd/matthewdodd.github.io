                  </hi> I am a compositor, and live at Albany-road, Old Kent-road. On the 9th November, I was in Ludgate-street, at the corner of Ave Maria-lane about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw an immense crowd there, and the prisoner in it—I saw him with two others, push a man back, and the prisoner snapped something from the front of the man—I did not see the pin at the time—the two men were pushing against the other man, the prisoner was in front—directly the prisoner pulled his hand away, the inspector came up—the prisoner backed away from him, and I then caught hold of the prisoner by the collar—directly he got away from the inspector he passed something behind him to somebody behind some others.</p>

I am a law student, and live at 32, Maddox-street, I Regent-street—I was in Ludgate-street on the afternoon of 9th November, about 4 o'clock—I felt myself surrounded by a large crowd, and felt some one place his hand upon my collar, and some one else at one of my shoulders, holding me back—there was one man, I fancy, at the side of me—I could not see for the crowd—a third man rushed at me in front, and took from</p>

               <p>my scarf a breast pin, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man, or whether he is like the man—some one also hit me a blow at the back, of my head, and they tried to take my watch, but I caught it just, as it was coming out of my pocket—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket, and my coat buttoned up, but my coat was pulled open.</p>

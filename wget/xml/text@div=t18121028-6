            . I am shopman to these gentlemen. On the 10th of this month, the prisoner came with another man, with seven sacks of coffee. The man that came with him stood by the truck, and the prisoner caried all the coffee in, except one bag. The first sack he brought in, he put down by some chests of tea. I thought the prisoner was a longer time than was necessary, which induced me to look after him. The second sack he brought in, I observed the lid off the chest; and the third sack he brought in, he put his hand in the chest, he took the tea and put in his pocket; and the fourth time also, he did the same. After he carried the whole of it in, I accused him of the theft; he acknowledged it, and pulled off his coat with the tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea was it - A. Nine ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a servant of yours, was he - A. No, he was employed by the man that brought that coffee to our house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a soldier all the war. I have been in the city militia. I worked all the time I was allowed to work. I was never tried before, by the civil or military law.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

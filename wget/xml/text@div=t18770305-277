                  </hi>. I am a draper, of 125, New North Road on 28th January, between 2 and 3 a.m., the constable called me up—he had the prisoner, and asked me if he lived there—I said "No"—he said that he was attempting to get in at my parlour window—I found it open—I had fastened it at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I had two parcels of blankets standing about a yard from the window, and in the morning I found that one of them had been undone, but not moved.</p>

On the morning of 28th January, shortly after 2 o'clock, I was on duty in the New North Road, and saw two men loitering in front of the prosecutor's house—I went up to them—they crossed the road very quickly—I turned on my light, and saw the prisoner with his body and one <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> over the wire blind of the parlour window, and the other leg on the sill—I went into the front garden—he jumped out of the window and I caught hold of him—he tried to get away—I asked what he was doing there—he said a woman told him there was a fire, and he had come to see—he then said he lived there—I knocked the prosecutor up and asked if he knew him—he said "No"—I then took him to the station—I found nothing on him, but in front of the house I found a box of silent matches.</p>

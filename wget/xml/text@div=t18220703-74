            . I am the watchman. I was in Gray's Inn-lane - Groves called out, Watch! three times; I found him in the road; he gave charge of the prisoner for stealing his hat, and giving it to the other, who ran off with it - the prisoner said he had not got it; he said nothing about a frolic. When I got into Holborn, a party of about six young lads followed us; he looked round at one of them, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go and tell Bill to bring back the hat," and afterwards he took off his own hat, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is as good as yours."</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. He said he did not steal it. After he was locked up, he said the one he had on was the prosecutor's. In the morning he asked if the hat was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He got fighting with the others, his hat fell off, and a man ran off with it.</p>

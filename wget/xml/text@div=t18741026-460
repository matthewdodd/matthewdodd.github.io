On the morning of 9th October, about 4.50, I was in Mitre Street and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner turn down Mitre Square—the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's arm—they separated and the prosecutor went out of the square as though he was in a hurry—he afterwards spoke to me and I went after the prisoner with him—he said to her "You have stolen my watch"—she said she had not—I asked her where it was and she said "I will give it to you, I did not steal it"—she gave it me out of her stocking—she said she picked it up and put it there for safety and did not steal it—the prosecutor identified it—he was sober.</p>

I am a merchant's clerk—about 4.50 a.m. on 9th October I was in Mitre Street—the. prisoner followed me, put her arm under mine and dragged me into the square—she asked me to give her something for refreshment—I was in a hurry and to get her away I gave her a few coppers—I left her and had not gone twenty steps when I found my guard hanging loose—I told the policeman and we both went after her and she took the watch from her stocking—she said she did not steal it she put it there for safety.</p>

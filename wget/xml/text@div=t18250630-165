            . On the morning of the 21st of May, about ten minutes past four o'clock, Mr. Berridge came to me, and I went to the top of the sugar house in Carter-lane - I found Johnson standing on a bar in the top floor, with his head through the sky-light, half of which had been taken off; I whipped his feet off the bar - he fell down, and I took him into custody; he gave no account of how he came there. I saw another hat on the floor, and I asked him where his partner was - he said he had none. He was taken to the watch-house, and I commenced a search on the premises, with another witness. I went on the roof, and saw some person had gone down the pan chimney; I called, and desired him to come up or go down, but I got no answer - I then threw down some bits of tiles, and then some whole tiles. I then took a brick, and told him if he did not answer I would throw the brick down upon him; I held it three or four minutes, but as I got no answer I threw it down; some person then groaned, and Hack fell to the bottom, and was taken. I found on the roof a piece of lead cut off, and partly rolled up - it was quite served, and removed three or four inches; a rope was slung round it. I saw it compared, and it fitted exactly. I found a knife and a chisel on the leads, close to where it had been cut; in the lower part of the floor I found a basket, with three sacks in it, in the cock loft, and an old saw on the roof, and a piece of iron, which I had left in the lower floor, when I had been on the premises, two or three days before.</p>

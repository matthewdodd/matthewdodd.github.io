               <p>Q. When did you lose these handkerchiefs - A. On Thursday morning, between twelve and one o'clock, she came to enquire for Mrs. Forster; I left her in the passage, and went up to Mrs. Foster; the prisoner in the mean while went through the parlour into Mrs. Foster's shop and took these things.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that she took them - A. No. When I came down stairs I saw her go out of the door. I did not know that she had got any thing then. We did not miss the things for an hour or more.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. On Thursday, between the hours of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200043"></xptr>one and two, I was crossing by Bishopgate Churchyard to go to Moorfields; I saw a little girl, and underneath her tattered great coat I saw a piece of a handkerchief, and a piece of shawls. I asked the child if they were for sale; she said, no, they were her mother's, that lived in Whitechapel; I said, I want to know who your mother is. The shawls were taken from the child and handed to me. The child went off, I followed the child; passing up the middle of Bishopgate-church yard the prisoner made a stand. The child began to cry, and said she had got them things from Mrs. Forster's; I said to the prisoner, is this your child? she said</p>
               <p>"no, I know her, I do not deny what I have done." I asked who was Mrs. Forster; the child took me to Mrs. Forster's. At Mrs. Foster's door she said, I am the mother, and this is Mrs. Foster's. I took the property; I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Foster said they were her property.</p>
               <p>MR. SAPWELL. I took the prisoner into custody. These are the shawls.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Morgan. I know they are Mrs. Foster's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was in such a place before. I know nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Rumsey, and live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoners were in his employ—I gave information to the policeman on Sunday evening, having suspicion of the prisoners for a fortnight before, to stop the cart as it was going out—about half-past six o'clock on Monday morning, the 13th of July, they stopped the cart as it was leaving our yard, and I gave the prisoners into custody for stealing fifty-two neats' feet, which are bullocks' feet—on our road to the station-house Burnett said, "Master Tarling has brought me into a pretty mess, he has completely ruined me for life"—after my return from the station-house I searched the soaking tank where the feet were placed on the Saturday—I had seen them safe on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock—neither of the prisoners had any business with them—I believe the feet which were produced by the policeman to be those I saw on Saturday, and I missed them from the tank, but there were a great many others in the tank—I am certain some portion was taken.</p>

In consequence of information I watched, and saw Mr. Rumsey's cart, about half-past five o'clock on Monday, the 13th—Tarling came to the bottom of Gad's-hill, and looked up the street a few minutes—I then saw the prisoners both come out with the cart—I stopped it, and one jumped off one side, and the other on the other—Tarling said, "We had better turn the horse back and go back, it is</p>

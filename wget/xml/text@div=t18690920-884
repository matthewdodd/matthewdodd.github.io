                  </hi>. I live at 5, Russell Street, Rotherhithe, and am a clothier—about five minutes to 12 o'clock on 17th August—I came home with a friend—I wished him good night at my shop door, and he went away—a man came in and inquired the price of a pair of trowsers—he said he did not want to purchase them then—the two prisoners came in while he was speaking, and they then began to talk politics—I told them I was no politi<lb></lb>cian, and then they began talking about Gladstone making rules and regula<lb></lb>tions that foreigners are able to take possession of English ground—I told them I was no law maker or breaker, and asked them to be kind enough to leave, as I wanted to go to rest—with that they all throe began making use of very bad language—I said, "I don't want such bad language here"—they then began making use of worse expressions, and I told them if they did not go out, I should shove them out—Henderson was sitting on a chair—I took hold of Hasluck and the other, and shoved them out—Henderson said he would not go—I got him by the collar and shoved him out, and shut the door—he sang out, "My finger is in the door"—I opened it again, about an inch, and shut it again—they then began kicking and knocking at the door, until they burst it open—I went out to see if I could see a policeman, and give them in charge—I went about five or six yards down the street—they "to away when I opened the door—I saw thorn coming back towards me,</p>

               <p>and Henderson said, "Take this, <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> and put it into his b—head; he has squeezed my finger"—I got to the front of the shop, and Hasluck was from the other side of the road, with a knife, and stabbed me in the head over the left eye, and on the side of the eye—I put up my hand to defend myself, and got a stab in the wrist—there are several cuts on my coat sleeve, which I received in defending my head—I found I was bleeding, and ran across the road to a chemist's shop—Haaluck and the others all ran away, I knocked at the door of the chemist's shop, and the landlord from the public-house next door came on and took me in—he dressed my wounds; and from that I was insensible and remember no more until I found myself at home, next morning—when I went out, after the prisoners had burst the door open, there was no one else in the street—it was dark, and the shops in the street were shut—I did not use any violence to the prisoner, beyond shoring them out of the shop.</p>

               <p>other two men went about four doors from where he was standing—I did not see whether Lemon struck them with the bar—he turned back, and the two men followed him—they passed Henderson on their way back—I did not see the stabbing—I heard him cry out—Henderson was standing about five doors off at that time—I have known Mr. Lemon for about fire years, since he has lived in the street—I have had to put up with many insults from a man in his employment—his nephew—he had been in the place about four months—I went once to Mr. Lemon's door about it, and he threatened then he would give me fourteen days' if I did not leave his door—I have had a great deal to put up with from him—I don't know from what cause—I don't owe Mr. Lemon any enmity—Hanson struck my little boy, of eight months, one day, and I took him to Greenwich for it—they granted a summons for it—the charge was dismissed, and the Magistrate cautioned Hanson not to insult me again—that was about three months ago—I never endeavoured to get Mr. Lemon to dismiss him—Mr. Lemon threatened to have me looked up if I came annoying him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 45, Russell Street, Rotherhithe—I am a postman, and have been for twenty-five years—my house is almost opposite Mr. Lemon's—on 17th August, about 12 o'clock, my wife woke me up, and I heard a noise close by my door—I got up, and opened the window—I saw Mr. Lemon's door suddenly slammed to, and a poor fellow called, "My God! my God! they have broke my hand!"—he was standing With his face towards the door, and there were two men in the gutter—one of them went and kicked at the door very violently, and burst it open—that was not the man who had had his hand smashed—he went into the street after he got his hand out—the door was shut to again after that—Mr. Lemon opened the door, and came out with a weapon in his hand, about a yard long—he followed the men, and struck the one who had had his finger smashed across the arm with it—he was in the middle of the road, opposite my window—someone was doing something to his hand—Mr. Lemon struck one of them across the arm, and the other on the back—he then chased the other men down the street—I saw him return again to his shop-door—I can't say whether he had the weapon with him then—the men came up just as he got to his door, and I heard Mr. Lemon sing out, "I am knifed! I am stabbed! if you are English, fetch the doctor!"—I don't know what became of the men after that—I did not come down—I saw nothing else, and went to bed.</p>

Q.</hi> Had any kicking been applied to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of the men kicked the door, and he came out with the weapon then—I can't say whether it was kicked open or whether Mr. Lemon opened it—Henderson and the boy were under my window when he came out—they did not move from there until after the whole affair—they went away down the street after Lemon was stabbed—they moved a little further down after Lemon struck them, nearer Miss Carter's house—I don't know either of the prisoners—Henderson said nothing to Lemon after he was struck—I did not see Lemon do anything to the other man with the</p>

I reside at 4, Park Place, Rotherhithe, and am a Custom House officer—on the morning of 18th August I was on duty at the gate of the tidal basin of the Commercial Docks—I saw Henderson with a boy—he came up to the gate and asked the watchman on duty something—the gate was not opened—my attention was called to his hand, by his calling out—he seemed to be suffering pain—Hasluck and the mate of another ship came up, and Henderson and the boy walked from the gate on to the pier head, and sat on the capstan bar, about twenty yards from the gate—281 <hi rend="italic">R</hi> came running up to the gate, out of breath, and said to the watch-man, "Hare you let anyone in?"—he said, "No"—I fetched Henderson from the pier head, and gave him into custody—I said, "This man has had his finger cut"—he gave the other man into my custody, and we took the two prisoners down to Mr. Lemon's—204 <hi rend="italic">R</hi> came in after we had been in the shop about ten minutes—I did not know that Henderson was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Havelock</hi>—I can't swear that there was a ship of that name in the docks—when I went to him he said he had been hit on the back and arm, and if there was any stabbing it was done after he left—the policeman had said that Lemon was stabbed—I said to Henderson, "There is a Mr. Lemon down Russell Street has been stabbed, how did you get your finger hurt!—he said, "I will come along with you, I am innocent of it"—and so he said when I gave him into custody.</p>

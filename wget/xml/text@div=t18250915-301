I called an officer, desired him to do his duty and clear the way; I suppose the officer to be the deceased, but I did not know him then; he spoke to one of the coachmen, then went in front of the prisoner's carriage, and was speaking to him; the other carriage gave way a little, and the prisoner's carriage rushed with great velocity up the yard; I cannot say that he whipped his horses - I did not see him do any thing - I thought there must be a good deal of mischief done, but I was so struck with his conduct that I immediately followed the carriage, nearly to the door, and asked the owner's name - he said

            . I was attending Lord Westmoreland. His Lordship came out about half-past twelve o'clock - he came from the front door towards the gate; when I got to the gate I observed two carriages jammed together, in the gateway - an officer was called for - one came through the gate - he went to the front of the horse, with his staff in his hand, and desired both the coachmen to move back from the gate; he then took hold of the reins, and put them back. I cannot say whether he took hold of the reins of one or both carriages - one of them gave way, the other advanced on, rather furiously, at a fast trot; I did not see the coachman do any thing - there was hardly room to get out of the way, as the carriages came on in that way - I went with my back close against the wall - the carriage passed close by me, and struck the officer, who was on the right, and he fell; I went to his assistance, and found his leg broken - he was taken to St. George's hospital - the carriage passed within three or four inches of my feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The officer's right-hand, with his staff, would be in the direction of the carriage on the left of the gateway? A. Yes; I cannot say which carriage backed; if his staff was in his right-hand his left would be at liberty to seize the reins. I moved to the right hand going in - there are two gateways - this is the western one. I heard no intimation of the accident given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose the man, who backed, had been in the right line with a string of carriages behind, could he get back without endangering the carriage? A. I cannot say; I did not see the officer cling to the carriage pole.</p>

            . I am porter to Lord George Cavendish. On the 23d of May, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I saw two carriages in the middle gateway, which is the general entrance - there are three gates only - two were opened that night - the center is westward of the other - the two carriages were jammed together, and the coachmen were flogging their horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both flogging their horses or only one? A. I cannot say, but I observed the horses flogged - Lord Westmoreland came out, and desired the assistance of an officer, who tried to force them back - he tried to persuade them to go back to Picadilly - I did not exactly notice what he said - I saw him go towards the carriage, and persuade them to come in one at a time; one backed, the other came in with a rush, the officer was forced down - I stood at the end of the gate, the officer was down a little beyond where I stood four or five yards from the gate - I did not particularly notice in what way he fell; he was in front and fell; the carriage wheel went over him in a moment - it was Dawkins, whom Lord Westmoreland called up - I did not leave the gate to go up to him - I afterwards saw him taken away on a shutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not go out to see the line of carriages? A. Yes; this was the proper gate to enter; I found two in possession of the gateway, one made way which liberated the other, and it came in and drove the officer on, he was down in a moment, he fell four or five yards from where the carriages were entangled.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the horses went forward of their own accord, on feeling themselves at liberty, you cannot say? A. No; it was certainly an accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What occasioned the accident? A. I do not know; I did not see him hang by the reins or the pole - I cannot say whether the horses forced him forward; he fell a little way beyond where I was - whether he held by the people or reins, I cannot say.</p>

I addressed them in a loud tone, saying,"For shame - you cannot both get in together;" I then exclaimed much louder, "You scoundrels - you will spoil your master's horses and carriages too." I was disregarded; or possibly not heard; they persevered in whipping, though they could not stir. I was very much cheered by the people, saying, "Bravo, Sir - we want some such as you;" I then exclaimed, "Constable - officer." Some one within the yard, whom I could not see, but took for an officer, called out "Put back, stand back" - both carriages then backed a little; one of the drivers renewed his whipping, and darted in furiously; I then heard a cry of, "A man knocked down, run over." The multitude closed on the gate-way, and prevented my seeing what had happened. I passed on, and further I depose not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a clergyman, and aware that this is a charge of murder? A. Yes. I was a voluntary evidence before the Coroner. I was returning from dining in Burlington-street. There might be one or two hundred carriages; they were not in a line: both the men whipped furiously up together. There was no line within my view.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear - I give you notice there are two or three witnesses to contradict you? A. There was no line near the gate - none within my view - there were carriages behind these two, but not very close; they were so close as to preclude my venturing to pass behind them, for fear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150112"></xptr>of being run over - there was a continuation of carriages, reaching to St. James's, but not in a straight line - I cannot say which carriage had the priority - both drove up together - I was standing on the side of them, not within the gate-way - I think the horses had got within - the wheels were locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you see them whip their horses with the wall on your side? A. It was very light, moonlight. I was between the fore and hind wheel, on the side next the Arcade. I could see the coachmen, for they stood up to whip; the wall is too high to see over; one carriage put back, and the moment there was room for one, he whipped his horses and darted in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them whipping distinctly? A. I did; I did not think he could have got in, the other backed so little; one backed more than the other, which admitted the other to dart in; there was room for one to back.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that both backed a little to get disentangled, was it not the most prudent course for one to go forward? A. I suppose when one found room he should have gone forward, and did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had not driven furiously, and gone in without whipping, was it not proper for him to go in? A. Yes, according to my judgment - no foot passenger could pass till he had gone in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was on duty on this night, at Lord George Cavendish's, to preserve order with the carriages. I heard a noise between twelve and one o'clock, and went down to the centre gate, where Dawkins lay with his back against the wall, and his leg broken - he was on the left side of the gate going out. I went with him to St. George's Hospital, and next morning went to Lady Lambert's stables and apprehended the prisoner. I told him I had a warrant against him for running over a man at Burlington-house last night. He said he recollected driving against a man, but had no idea that the wheel ran over him. I told him the man's leg was broken, and he was in the hospital - he said he was extremely sorry to hear it. The carriages should have been stationed with their horses' heads towards Hyde-park, and not to come in till called - that is always the regulation in that place.</p>

The night before he died, he said he must go, that it was all dicky with him - that if the coachman had pulled up in a proper manner, he might not have been run over, if he had not whipped on so; he said so a fortnight before he died, and the night before also - he was aware that he should not recover - he said he went down by Lord Westmoreland's order, to avoid the carriages coming in in that manner - that he got them to back a little, and Lady Lambert's carriage whipped on - that he laid hold of the pole and reins, and down he fell, and the fore and hind wheels went over his legs.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospital. In May last, I remember Dawkins being brought to the hospital; he had received a compound fracture in the right leg; he was attended to immediately, and went on favourably till the 3d of June, when he was attacked with erysipelas, caused by the fracture; it extended up the leg and thigh, and terminated in the formation of an abscess, which was opened, as occasion required - there was a great discharge - his constitution suffered very much - he died on the 11th of August. I have no doubt of the fractured leg causing his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you pronounced him quite out of danger on the 11th of July? A. Yes, I considered him so at that time: he was a robust man, and not likely to be afflicted with erysipelas without injury.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased was under my particular care; he had a compound fracture of the right leg, both bones were broken, in consequence of which an attack of fever followed: on the 31st of May, or 1st of June, that fever subsided; on the 3d of June he had a relapse - abscesses formed in several parts of his leg and thigh - they were opened several times - I considered him then in considerable danger - fever followed, and he died on the 11th of August - the compound fracture was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In the state he died it is very probable that expressions of a hasty nature would escape him? A. The whole system was in a state of extreme irritation.</p>

            . I am footman to Lady Lambert. On the 24th of May I was in attendance, and received directions from her Ladyship - the carriage was called, and I went for it; I found it drawn up at the corner of Duke-street, with the horses' heads in a direction to come on - it was not close to the gate-way; I told the prisoner to draw up; he at that time was not in the line to come in, because he could not get up; I went again, a second time, and found him jammed in the gateway, with another carriage - I repeated to him the order I had received for him to drive up as soon as he could - there was a great quantity of carriages behind him, at the time; I said her Ladyship was waiting, and that the carriage had been called for, I supposed, half an hour, and he must come up as soon as he could. I went to the house, and in about a quarter of an hour he came up, her Ladyship got in, and he drove away - I did not hear of the accident till next morning.</p>

            . I am servant to the Honourable Mr. Cavendish. I was at the gate of Burlington house, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150113"></xptr>this time, and saw two carriages jammed into the gateway - I was within the gate, and saw the carriage come through - I observed no whip used, and must have seen it if it had been used. I got out of the way of the carriage myself without difficulty.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How near were you to the gate? A. About three yards. I saw no whipping, and if it had happened I must have seen it. I was not there when the carriages were jammed, but when it drove in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the carriages jammed together? A. Yes; and saw a man between them, forcing them back - they both receded, then one advanced, which occasioned me to go out of the way a little. I saw no more till I saw the man down.</p>
               <p>HON. LADY LAMBERT. The prisoner was in my service for two years, and bore a remarkably good character for humanity - I have every reason to be satisfied with him; I had been at Lord George Cavendish's, and waited, I suppose, in all, half an hour for my carriage after I had sent for it. I was anxious to get away, and told my footman to try and hurry him.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 129). On Thursday, 23rd July, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Wanstead, with a bundle—I asked him what he had got, he said some dishes which he had brought from his brother's, but I found it was part of a force pump—he said that he brought it from his employer at Wanstead, and was taking it to Stratford Bridge to be repaired—I told him he had better come with me to his master—he came about 100 yards to a lonely part of the road, threw down the bundle and said, "I will go no further"—I caught him, and he said, "If you will bring the bundle I will go"—I stopped to pick up the bundle, and he threw me on my neck, which has been stiff ever since—I cannot turn my head without turning my body also—another constable came up, and we conveyed him to the station—I was in bed six days.</p>

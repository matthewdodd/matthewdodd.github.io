                  </hi>. I am a carriage-trimming manufacturer, at No. 40, Drury-lane—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in the middle of June, I think—he, at that time or shortly afterwards, entered my employ<lb></lb>ment as town traveller, with a salary and commission—shortly after that it happened that I was short of money—I had a quantity of velvet in my possession—I had some conversation with the prisoner on the subject—he said that through some friends of his he could raise money for me on the velvets—I afterwards, by his instructions, sent the goods to Messrs. Werner and Falck, on 6th July, at Bury-court, St. Mary-Axe—the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards, on the same day, handed me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it came from Werner and Falck's as an advance upon the velvets—I said that it was a very small sum for the amount of the velvets, aud asked him if he could not obtain more—he said he would try, and on the next day he returned and said that Werner and Falck would not give more—I think he remained in my service about a fortnight after the 6th—he had told me that the period of loan was for one month—ou 6th August following, I received a letter from him about the redemption of these goods—I saw him in the City and gave him a</p>

               <p>cheque for 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being the amount of principal and interest—it might have been the day following the advance of the money that I learnt the interest was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was not at the time the money was advanced—the only conversation was that the rate would not be a very heavy one; perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for three months, and to my surprise I found it was a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for one month—I gave him directions to take the cheque to the Union Bank, Temple-bar Branch, get it cashed, and to pay over the proceeds to Messrs. Werner and Falck—I gave him directions to leave the velvets at Messrs. Werner and Falck's to my orders—I saw him subsequently on the day I gave him the cheque, about 4 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, and he stated that he had been to Werner and Falck's and neither of the partners were in, and that he had left the money with the clerk—I did not direct or authorize the prisoner to sell these velvets after giving him the cheque; I had done so previously—that cheque has been returned to me by my bankers as paid—the officer has it—the prisoner was not in my employ when I gave him instructions to sell; it was afterwards—the value of the velvets is 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid that for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you really mean that you did not give him instructions to sell after you gave him the cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I decidedly did not know that he was negotiating a sale after I gave him the cheque—I did not know that Mr. Cawley had given bills for them—I have been frequently to Mr. Michael's, but not about the velvets or the bills; I went merely because I did not know what had become of Mr. Muckleston—Mr. Michael said something to me about the bills—I did not see them, or what was written on them, or whether they were bills; he showed me some pieces of paper which he stated had been given to him, and which he stated to be bills, But I did not look at them—he offered to discount them if I would put my name to them—I did not ask him what arrangements he had made about the velvets—I do not think anything was said about them—I do not know why those papers, which were called bills, were produced; I did not know of their being in existence—Mr. Michael said that the bills were left with him by the prisoner for the velvets—that was about all that was said about the velvets—he asked me to endorse them, and I declined to have anything to do with them—I went there about 12th or 14th August—the cheque was given on the 6th—the prisoner, I believe, wrote several letters to me before I went there—I did not go there in consequence of any letter; I cannot explain why I went, but I was searching after Mr. Muckleston at the time—the prisoner said one day that he had been to Tottenham to Mr. Michael, and asked him to discount some bills he had—this was before I went to Mr. Michael—I do not think he said that those bills were for the velvets, but he said that they were bills of Cawley's; they were some which I expect were obtained by frand—I had nothing to do with the bills or the discount—I do not know whether I should or should not have refused to receive the money if I had not been asked to endorse them—I said that I would not recognise any bills in any shape or form; all that I wanted was an order for my velvets, and that is what I told the prisoner—I first knew on Friday the 10th, that the proceeds of the cheque had not been paid, and after searching for the prisoner for a long while, I saw him come out at Mr. Michael's door, and spoke to him about the money—he told me he had been into Michael's at that minute to get him to discount Cawley's bill—it was two or three days after that, that he told me he had been to Tottenham, and after that I went to Michael's on the 12th or Hth—I did not know at the time, that the prisoner gave a bill for the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards I did—that</p>

               <p>was before I gave the cheque; it was on 6th July that he gave the bill—I told the prisoner to pledge the velvets in his own name; that was for a trade reason, it was that people might not know that I was pledging—I did not wish the velvets to be brought back, that my clerks might not know that they had been pledged; they went into the books as bo much cash from Werner and Falck on account—I knew something about Cawley before I gave the cheque—the only thing I know is, that he made sales to Cawley while he was in my employ, and I understood that Cawley's character was not such as I could trust, and I did not wish to do any more business with him—I never knew of the bills being grven for these very velvets till the 10th—I cannot say whether I knew before the 10th that the prisoner was negotiating a transaction with Cawley—he wrote me some letters, saying that he could do something with the velvets; those letters are here—I did not know on the 6th that he had offered the velvets to Cawley—he said before the cheque was given that he could sell these velvets to Cawley, and I declined the transaction—he was authorized to sell up to the time I gave him the cheque, either for cash or for bills approved by me, but not Cawley's bills—I went to Cannon-street to Mr. Burke, to inquire about Cawley's reference—that was when the prisoner was in my employ, and about three weeks before I gave him the cheque; he then said that Mr. Cawley was proposing to buy the velvets—I consulted my solicitor a few days afterwards—I cannot tell you when the warrant was taken out, but it was a short time afterwards—I swear I did not say to Mr. Michael that I would not endorse the bills; and that if I did not get my money, I would have it in another way, that I would have the money or lock the defendant up; nothing of the kind; nor that I would shut his mouth, and the money would soon be brought forward, as Muckleston had some warrant for grain and some seed—I said that I had seen the person who sold some seed to him, but I did not say that I would lock him up, or have my money; nothing of the kind—I may have called there again afterwards going by—I do not think I called there between the time when the papers were shown to me, and the issuing of the warrant—I went with Newton once or twice either after or before the goods were shown to me, I cannot say which—I have no doubt I went there both after and before—I looked at some goods with Newton which Michael showed me, and Michael did not ask me to take those goods as part of the bills, but against the velvets—I certainly looked at the goods, but for no earthly purpose: there had been no end of propositions made by Michael, and I might have just touched the goods in a cursory manner, but as to looking at them I did not—I did not say, "When he is ouce taken, the money with all my expenses will be paid;" nor did I offer a reward of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said nothing about taking him, but perhaps I had the warrant out at that time—I might have said that I intended taking out a warrant, but nothing about locking him up; or about locking him up, and the money would soon be forthcoming—not on either occasion—the warrant was put into the hands of Haydon, the city detective, who I afterwards met on 28th August, and told him not to execute it at present—Michael was there—Poole was not there at that time—I found Michael and Haydon together at some place where I was referred to from the detective-office, and not by appointment at all—my reason for telling Haydon not to execute the warrant, was, in the first place, because we could not find the party—we had been looking after him for three weeks, and there was a certain matter entered into at the time, in which I was regularly done, and which I was foolish enough to sign—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—one name</p>

               <p>in it is, and also the u Dear Sir"—I have seen Mr. Poole on no end of occasions—he told me on one occasion, to tell Michael to come down—I called on Mr. Poole, who said, "Michael has heen hero"—I called as a friend, but for no specific purpose—I have known him for years—this was a week or ten days afterwards—I called on Michael to say that Mr. Poole wanted him—I might have had an idea what Mr. Poole wanted him for, but Mr. Poole did not tell me—I did not know perfectly well that Poole was to settle the matters between me and the prisoner, and that Michael and I were to see him on the other side—there was not a word about settling, but Michael was constantly upon Poole, to try to settle it—that I have heard since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you told Haydon not to execute the warrant at present? was not it because you had put the matters into Poole's hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a referee; I said to Haydon that it might be referred to Mr. Poole to know whether I had a civil or a criminal case, or it was said in his presence; Haydon and Michael were by—that was after the warrant had been out for nearly a month—I believe Haydon went out of town—I did not tell Haydon on that same day, the 28th, to have the name written off the police books—I told him to suspend the warrant, that was all—I have no recollection of his saying, "In order to do that, I shall be obliged to have the name written off at the station"—he did not execute the warrant—he did not Bay that it was handed over to Moes by mistake when he went out of town—he said that he had sent Moss in to apprehend him, while to remained outside—Poole is a private gentleman; he has an office in London—he does not live at Southend, but his wife was very ill, and he was staying there, and she subsequently died—I do not know that that was the reason that he could not go into the reference—I know nothing about it—I called almost daily upon Michael—the cheque was payable to the defendant—I understand that the acceptance that he gave was in his own name—I have not seen it—I have heard since that it was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not write a letter to him about Cawley's bills—I never wrote a letter—I did not write a letter asking for Cawley's bills; decidedly not—I never saw the bills, and do not know whether there was first a large one for 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was afterwards broken up into four small ones—I know nothing of any bills of Cawley's—if I have said, "Not for these last bills," it must have been a slip of the tongue—I never wrote to him to ask him for the one large bill—at letter has been destroyed by my request, or in my presence.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at 3, Bury-court, St. Mary-axe—I have known the prisoner four or five months before this matter was inquired iuto—in July last he applied to me for an advance on some goods—I made the advance on 6th July—I gave him a cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon certain velvet goods, and he gave me a promissory note and a memorandum of deposit in his own name—in the course of business that loan would have been repayable on 9th August, the bill was due on 6th August—I cannot say whether I saw him upon that day, I think it was afterwards—the bill was presented when due and not paid, and the prisoner came and asked for a renewal; the bill produced was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I granted it, and the velvets remained in my hands—he afterwards called again and said, if any one said anything about the velvets, I was not to say anything about his business to anybody—I retained the second bill of 9th August that was not honoured, and since that I have had the amount of my advance and interest paid to me by Mr. Onion, and the goods taken away—the difference between the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the interest.</p>

Q.</hi> You found upon him two letters, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Haydon accompanied me to the office and he stayed outside while I went in—the warrant was handed to me when Haydon was about leaving town—I told the prisoner it was for misappropriating a cheque, and he said that the matter was settled, and that he had letters to show that it was referred to Mr. Poole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that there was no case for the Jury: the cheque came from the prosecutor with directions to receive the money, but the money came from the banker, and the question was whether that was such a bailment as was intended by the Statute, as the prisoner received no specific coin from his master, and the money received from the banker would not be in the prisoner's hands as a bailee, it never having been in his master's hands; and further, that he took up the velvets by means of the renewed bill, so that after the cheque was given the object for which it was given was accomplished, and if any offence was then committed it was re-pledging the velvets.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on the same side, contended that bailment is made up of two things, confidence and delivery, and that here there was no delivery, as the cheque was payable to the prisoner or bearer—that there was no direction by the prosecutor to the banker to deliver any specific chattel, and that there was no confidence between the banker and the prisoner, it was between the prisoner and his master (See Reg. v. Bull, Foster's Reports</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">left it to the Jury to say whether the notes were given to the prisoner for a special purpose, and whether he, instead of that, fraudulently transferred them to his own use.</hi>

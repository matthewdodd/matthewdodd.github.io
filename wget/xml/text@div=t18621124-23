                  <hi rend="italic">Bean's Defence.</hi> About a quarter-past 9 on Thursday-night, I and Savage were sitting down by St. Katharine's plying place, looking for a living. A gentlemanly looking man, about five feet six, came up, and asked if we wanted a job; we said, "Certainly." He said he wanted two packages taken to Tower-street; that they were heavy, and we should want a trunk. We said we could not get a truck at that time, so we took a bale each—he gave us a glass of half-and-half each at the "Marquis of Granby," and gave us a lift up with the bales. We had several rests with them as we went along, and when we got into Tower-street we lost sight of the gentleman, and the policeman came and took us.</p>

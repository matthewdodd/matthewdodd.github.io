I was in the habit of seeing Mr. Hall during November and the early part of December—after my arrival in this country I was in the habit of seeing Madame Valentin—we were together at the Hotel de Ville de France, Dean-street, Soho—she passed there by the name of Madame Bertin—the intimacy went on,. I think, until the first day of November—I arrived at Berwick-street on 16th or 17th October, and she remained at the hotel—she was in the habit of coming to my house at Berwick-street—she was in the habit of talking to me at the hotel, in the presence of my wife and my three daughters about her private affairs, and at Berwick-street likewise, but I bad two daughters less there, my wife and my eldest daughter only were there—she has often said that she intended to leave England and go to Scotland and thence to America, and to travel a great deal—I cannot exactly tell you how often she made that statement, but at table and in her room she has told me so often—she assigned no reason for doing so—I have known Coulan since 1st October—he was present somewhat often at those conversations, as well as my daughters—he was examined against me at the trial last session—the defendant did not finally fix the time when she intended to leave—she said to me one day, "We must employ ourselves by selling those conpons"—she had shown them to me in Paris, but she never showed me any here—I went to Whitecross-street prison about May, 1860, and saw her there—she was alone when I arrived—she first reproached me by saying that I had sold myself to M. Bouillon, and she proposed to me to make a new affidavit in her favour so as to destroy the one which I had made with Mr. Hall—I said that I would not, and refused to give my signature for any purpose—Mdlle. rey then came in, the former conversation was then finished, but Madame Valentin was going on speaking, and was raying that Coulan had told her that I had sold myself to M. Bouillon—after the entrance of Mdlle. Rey we did not talk of anything more, and I do not suppose she heard anything that was said.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">intenpreted.</hi>) Mr. Hall told me to leave the Court a little while ago and go round; I did so and then I came in again—I have been in Court an hour and a half—I carry on the business of a French laundry, at 28, Leicester-square—Madame Valentin came to my place in October to get some linen for a little <hi rend="italic">I talienne</hi>, who was staying there; she did not come more than once—I got into conversation with her on the sub<lb></lb>ject of France; we talked for an hour—she said that all poor unfortunate Frenchmen were robbed in england, and that if she were staying in England she would not stop at the hotel because it was very dear, and it would be cheaper to set up a house for herself, and for that reason she would establish herself in London—she said that her intention was not to establish herself in London, if it was, she would have bought her own furniture—she said it was her intention not to fix herself in London.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she confide to you her intention of going to China? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No, nor Scotland—we talked about the foreigners in London—I reside at 28, Lisle-street—Jean Lafourcade was living there two or three months before his arrest for perjury—one of his daughters is in my service as a workwoman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shorthand-writer—i was employed in June to take evidence at a trial in which Madame Valentin gave evidence—she was sworn and examined through an interpreter—(<hi rend="italic">The witness read the following passage, from his notes</hi>:—"Mr. Serjeant Simon. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you propose to Lufourcade, when he visited you in prison, to make a fresh affi<lb></lb>davit on your behalf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What passed on that subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wanted to be convinced that he had sold himself to the Bouillons")—Then there are a number of interruptions by counsel, and the next question is, "Did Lafourcade say in the prison that he would not make a fresh affidavit or give evidence for you for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

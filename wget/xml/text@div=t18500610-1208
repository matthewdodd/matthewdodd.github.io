                  </hi>. I was formerly in the V. division of police. About three o'clock in the morning of 18th April, I was on duty in Southampton-street, Lambeth, and heard some one walking in the yard at the back of the Southampton Arms public-house—I pulled myself up to the top of a side gate, looked over, and saw the prisoner coming down the stone-steps leading from the house into the yard—I could see him plainly; I have no doubt about him—I have known him for years, he is the son of the person who used to keep the house—I got down from the gate and went back for three or four yards, and he came and put his hands on the top of the gate, and his feet on the top of the bar, and got up—I asked what he did there—he said he was waiting for some Norman cows that were coming up by the railroad—I told him he had no business there, and he instantly went back—I went and spoke to Howard, another constable, and in two or three minutes I went in by ano<lb></lb>ther gate, leaving Howard there—I found the door at the top of the steps where I had seen the prisoner, wide open—I went in and called up the land<lb></lb>lord, and we searched the place all over, but could not find the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Southampton Arms, Lambeth; I have had the house twelve months; I succeeded the prisoner's father when he left the house. On 18th April, about three o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the policeman, and found the front and back-doors open—(I had gone to bed about half-past eleven overnight, and left all the doors bolted)—I missed two papers containing copper money, eight half-crowns, and some cigars and tobacco—I had left them in a drawer—I know the prisoner quite well—I saw him in our house about seven o'clock the previous evening, the 17th—I have here a paper similar to that in which the tobacco I lost was wrapped.</p>

On the night of 18th April the prisoner was brought to the station on a stretcher, from the effects of swal<lb></lb>lowing a screw of tobacco—he was brought in for dead, insensible—I sent for a medical man, who recovered him, and he was taken home—after he was gone, in consequence of information, I went after him, and found him at 55, Mount-street, Westminster-road, a night-house—I told him I had received information from the B division station that he was wanted, for a robbery at the Southampton Arms—he made use of some words to his companion, which I could not understand, owing to the noise in the house—I searched the pri<lb></lb>soner, and found on him two half-crowns, two sixpences, 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, two screws of tobacco, and one paper which had had tobacco in—I have also produced a paper which was given me by Mr. Hippisley, and three others which I got as samples from the prosecutor's house.</p>

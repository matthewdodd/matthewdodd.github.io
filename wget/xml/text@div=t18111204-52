               <p>Q. Where you sober. - A. I cannot say I was quite sober, but I knew what I was about. When I first saw the prisoner, she was with a man, just turning out of <placeName id="t18111204-52-crimeloc294">Fore Street, into Grub Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property in his coat or waistcoat. - A. No, I have never been able to recover my property again. When I had hold of the man in the alley, the prisoner had hold of me, and said you bloody thief let him go, or else I'll do you, she followed me into the public-house, and then the constable came in, and she was secured, she was searched, and nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you had been attacked in this way did you perceive your watch in your pocket. - A. Just before I got to Grub Street, I fastened my seal tighter, it was loose, I am quite sure that I had it, because I looked at it. It was a silver watch, it was worth two pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you were not quite sober, how had you been spending the evening. - A. I was with a groom, we had a drop of rum and water, and half and half, between four or five of us, that was at the watering house in Oxford Road, near Bond Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go next to drink. - A. I might go into four or five public-houses in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go into the Old Bailey. - A. I went there after I put my horses up, I went to the Old Bailey before I was robbed, I came through the Old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040041"></xptr>Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to have it understood that you did not stop at any house in the Old Bailey. - A. I stopped with the waterman, and drank nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know a person of the name of Touchey, and you did not drink with any person in the Old Bailey. - A. I drank with a coachman, not with the waterman.</p>
               <p>Court. You positively denied that you drank with any body. Did you drink any liquor in the Old Bailey. - A. We went into the wine vaults just at the corner of the Old Bailey, and had a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. Had you any quarrel with any body at the Old Bailey. - A. Yes, I had a few words with a coachman that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you square with somebody. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Sir, did not you say two or three days afterwards that you were sorry that you struck the man, but you were so drunk you did not know what you did. - A. No, I said I was sorry I struck him, I was not so much in liquor; he began with me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Touchey you were sorry that you had struck him, you were so drunk that you did not know that you had struck him. - A. I said I was sorry, I did not know that I had struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not occurred to you that there is a forty pound reward. - A. I have heard that there was for a highway robbery, but not in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you indicted this woman for. - A. For throtling of me, and ill-using me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you have indicted her for a highway robbery. - A. Of course, it was in the street, it was in the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it is a highway robbery; do not you expect a forty pound reward. - A. I expect nothing at all.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to my father, at the corner of White Street, Little Moorfields. On the evening of the 6th of December I was in my father's shop, I heard the cry of stop thief. I went out and saw the prosecutor had hold of a man, he said he had robbed him of his watch, and I saw the shape of a watch in the man's fob, with whom the prosecutor was wrestling; the prisoner tried to get the man away from the prosecutor, she said let him go, or I'll serve you out, she tried to rescue the man away, the prosecutor conveyed the man into a public-house, I went with him, the prisoner followed, there was a scuffle in the public-house, the people were urging them on to fight, the man said he had not got the watch, the prosecutor said the man had knocked him down by Honey-suckle court, and robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the man not to be secured. - A. There was a set of people in the public-house that seemed to take his part, they made a sort of a lane for him to pass by, he pulled off his coat and waistcoat, to make a shew of being searched, there was a cry of bolt, the man ran away, leaving his coat, waistcoat, and hat behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman in the tap-room all the time. - A. Yes.</p>

This day three weeks I drank with Dukeson the prosecutor in the Old Bailey, we had a glass of gin each, there were four of us, he was very much intoxicated, indeed he was very riotous there, he hit one man on the mouth, and made his mouth bleed; a bill sticker came by, he began sparring with him, this was about two o'clock in the afternoon, and between four or five I saw him at the coach rank in Aldersgate Street, he was so drunk that he reeled from one side of the pavement to the other, he was by himself. About three days after I met him at the watering-house at Aldersgate Street, I said to him, you are a pretty sort of a fellow any how, you was beastly drunk in the Old Bailey, when you beat the man; he said, I wish to see him, to give him something to drink, to make it up with me, I told him he used him very ill indeed, I said, if it was me I should not have put up with it as he did.</p>

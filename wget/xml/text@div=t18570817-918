                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at No. 3, Finsbury Chambers. I had been acting as solicitor for the prisoner—on Wednesday, 8th July, I accompanied him to the Queen's Bench prison, for the purpose of seeing Mr. Robertson, a creditor, lying there—I was also accompanied by a gentleman of the name of Gower—this was nearly, or about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—some conversation took place between me and Mr. Robertson, and the prisoner, and Mr. Gower—Mr. Robertson came to his room and took a seat in an arm chair—the chair was with its back to the window—I had a seat on his left hand side—the prisoner was standing—he was stand<lb></lb>ing at the time, it might be about five feet from Mr. Robertson; he was in front of him, facing him—Mr. Gower was some distance behind, still fur<lb></lb>ther from Mr. Robertson—after the conversation had proceeded some minutes, De Salvi drew nearer to Robertson, and it appeared to me that he</p>

               <p>struck him with his fist—previous to that occurring, De Salvi was addressing Robertson on the subject of the debt which Robertson owed him—De Salvi said he owed the money, and the other denied it—there was an angry feel<lb></lb>ing between the prisoner and Robertson as to the debt—as he struck, the prisoner's left hand was on Robertson's shoulder, Mr. Robertson was seated at the time, and the prisoner struck with his right hand—he appeared to strike Mr. Robertson four or five times—he struck him on his right side, on his cheek, temple, and about the shoulder—Mr. Robertson was seated in a chair when the prisoner first struck him; he then went forward about four feet, and then he went to the ground—it was very quick, and I immediately jumped up, and De Salvi left—I immediately ran to the assistance of Mr. Robert<lb></lb>son—after the first blow was struck, Mr. Robertson went forward, and he had to sit down on the ground.</p>

On the day this happened, about 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in company with Mr. Thompson and Mr. Gower—I saw them go up stairs towards Mr. Robertson's room—about six or seven minutes after that I heard a scuffle in Mr. Robertson's room—after hearing the scuffle I saw the prisoner and Mr. Gower come out of Robert<lb></lb>son's room—De Salvi came out first, without his hat—I believe they both went along the corridor leading to the stairs—I went to the door of Mr. Robertson's room, opened it, and went in—I saw Mr. Thompson with his hand on his shoulder—I found Mr. Robertson bleeding profusely—I then went from the room, in the direction that I had seen De Salvi and Gower take when they came out of the room—as I returned to Mr. Robertson's room, before I arrived at the room, within about five feet of the door, I found a knife lying close to the wall—it was not in the same state that it is now—there was blood upon it—it was open, and broken—with the exception of the blood being wiped off, it was in the same state as it is now, as far as I can see—I went down stairs, instead of going to Mr. Robertson's room, and saw De Salvi and Mr. Grower surrounded by some inmates of the prison—I addressed De Salvi, and said, "Your name is Salvi; you are the assassin"—he did not make any answer; he started back involuntarily on my men<lb></lb>tioning his name—I delivered the knife to Dennis, one of the warders.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Queen's Bench prison about the latter end of June. I remember about that time seeing the prisoner talking to Mr. Robertson—he spoke of a debt due to him by Mr. Robertson, a bill of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he mentioned that if a satisfactory proposal was not made to him for the payment of it, that he would have his life—on that I called De Salvi's attention particularly to what he had stated—I told him that that was a very serious expression; that I should take particular notice of him, and that I would not leave the room while he was there, unless I was requested by Mr. Robertson to do so—I waited until De Salvi went away—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 8th July, in the afternoon, I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I was in my own apartment at that time; my door happened to be open—my apart<lb></lb>ment is not on the same floor as Mr. Robertson's—it is the passage below—on hearing that cry, I went out of my room into the corridor—I did not see anything of the prisoner on the stairs—I saw several persons running down the stairs, and I followed them—I saw the prisoner in the passage below, leading into the yard, without a hat—there seemed to be several persons round him—I immediately recognized him to be the person that had used the threat in the room previously, and laid hold of him, and asked him if he did not recollect me—he said, no, he did not—"Then," said I, "I recollect you very well, and I shall not allow you to leave my grasp until you are handed over to an officer"—I do not recollect that I had any more conversa<lb></lb>tion with him.</p>

               <p>not to be trifled with—in consequence of what De Salvi said, I communi<lb></lb>cated with other persons—in consequence of what De Salvi said, I did appre<lb></lb>hend personal violence from him—at the end of June, or beginning of July, De Salvi came, and Mr. Manson, a prisoner was present, and De Salvi then said I should regret it if I did not make terms—it was from De Salvi's general con<lb></lb>duct and language that I apprehended bodily harm—when De Salvi, Gower, and Mr. Thompson came, I asked Gower to sit down—he said, 'I will not sit down with such a villain'—I am positive those were the exact words—it was about five or six minutes after they came into the room before the first blow was struck—De Salvi and Gower were standing close to each other, and before any, blow was struck Gower pat his hand on De Salvi's shoulder, and said to him, 'As long as I have a sovereign in my pocket, I will not desert you'—Gower said I should find them ugly customers, and that they, would pull together—when the first blow was struck, Gower was close to De Salvi, with his left arm on the mantelpiece—the expression made use of by Gower, 'Give it to the villain,' was while I was in the chair, and before I was on the ground—I think I was struck three times on the ground, and Gower did not leave whilst the blows were given—I should think it was not more than two minutes from the first to the last blow—I had a straggle with De Salvi, by putting my arm out to prevent his striking me—Gower did not interfere—after the first blow way struck, I cried out 'Murder!' several times, directly I received the first blow, and continued calling out—Gower heard me, and did not interfere—after I called out 'Murder!' Gower said, 'Give it the villain.'—Robert Hender<lb></lb>son Robertson, his x mark."</p>

There was several of them at play. I knew the prisoner before, but never spoke to him or his companions. They gave the hat to each other, and kept kicking it about; the prisoner took it up and ran away with it on his head. I told my father. I saw it next day at the office.</p>

            . On the Sunday there was an Odd Fellow's funeral at the church, the prisoner was in the yard, I drove him out. I went next morning and asked what he had done with the hat he stole. He said he stole no hat; that he had on his head was his own. Upon taking it off I found it was the prosecutor's, but the hatband and seal that was in it were taken out.</p>

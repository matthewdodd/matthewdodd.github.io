            . I am a ticket-porter of the City, and live in Star-alley, Fenchurch-street - I usually stand at the door of the Elephant public-house, Fenchurch-street. On Monday, the 26th of July, I was standing there, and about twenty minutes or a quarter before four o'clock (as near as possible) a person came to me with a cheque; I swore to the person next day - the prisoner is that person; this is the cheque I received from him, it has my initials on the back - he came and touched me, drew me aside a few paces, gave me the cheque, and desired me to go to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd's, the bankers, and get five 10l. notes, forty sovereigns and a half, and bring them to him at Mr. Walker's, Mark-lane. and if he was not there, he should be at the Cornexchange; I took the cheque folded in my pocket, and went to the bankers as quick as I could - I stopped in my way, in Ball-alley, opened it, and saw who it was payable to; I went to Jones and Co., and payment was refused - I was asked who I received if from, and stated; when I saw there was doubt about the cheque, I immediately cast my eyes at the dial, and saw it was ten minutes to four o'clock; a person was sent out with me to to Howard, late Walker and Sons, No. 24. Mark-lane, I found no Walker living there - I did not find the person who gave me the cheque there; I went into several coffee-houses and taverns in Mark-lane, and then to the Corn-exchange, but did not find the person at any of those places - the person from the bankers then left me, and I returned to my stand; I had given Jones and Co. one of my cards - I heard no more of the matter that day; I went to the bankers next morning, and complained of it being hard upon me not being paid my porterage, and they gave me 1s. - I returned to my stand, and found a card at the public-house, referring me to Mr. Gates' office; I went there directly; I waited nearly two hours, and Mr. Gates came in - I was ordered into a private room, were Mr. Gates and several gentlemen were - Mr. Gates questioned me; I said a gentleman gave me the cheque, that he was about five feet four inches high, or five feet six, as near as I could tell, that he had a very remarkable nose, and was very quick in speech. that I belived I should know him again if I saw him; I went with Mr. Gates in a coach to Shoolbred and Cook's, in Tottenham-corut-road, but did not she the person there - I returned, went to dinner, and returned to Mr. Gates' office about four o'clock; I waited there some time - seven or eight gentlemen then came into the office, and I recognized the prisoner as the person who gave me the cheque: I noticed him directly he came in, but nothing passed between us - three or four persons might have come in before I recognized the prisoner; one man came in with him - I had not the least doubt whatever of his being the person; I am positive the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of going to bankers to receive cheques? A. At times, as gentlemen employ me who have counting-houses, but very seldom for gentlemen in the street; I went as quick as I could - I was at least twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour at the bankers'; I left there I think at a quarter or twenty minutes past four o'clock - I have at times been kept waiting while others are served, but there was nobody else there; I felt awkward at first at being the bearer of a suspicious cheque - I was, of course, anxious to find the person I received it from; I was once trusted with a cheque on Esdaile's, for 120l., nearly two years ago, by a person I never saw before - he gave it to me in the street, but I was to carry the money to a counting-house, which I did; I had been employed at that counting-house before, but never saw that person. I will not say whether I told Mr. Gates I believed I should know the person again; when I was waiting in his office the last time I knew it was for the purpose of recognizing the person from whom I received the cheque, if I saw him - I have not seen any of the other persons here who came in, but Mr. Gates and the man who came in last - that was the marshalman; I did not know him to be a marshalman - he was not tall: I have since heard his name is Forrester; I have seen several of the other gentlemen who came in - I do not know their names; they went before the Grand Jury - I did not notice whether they came into the room singly or not; I notice the prisoner coming in with Forrester - they came in together, apparently in company; I did not notice whether the other gentlemen came in singly or together.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you, on the day in question, uttered a cheque for any body but this one? A. I had not - I had my porter's badge on; Forrester was dressed in ordinary clothes, not in uniform: I have heard he is an officer - I did not know he was a marshalman; when I was called into Mr. Gates' private room, I told him I recognized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that in his hearing? A. No, he was not present; I was told nothing about the order in which the persons would be brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people who came in, remain in the office, or pass through into another room? A. Some remained, and some went into another room; the prisoner remained in the office a while, and Forrester with him - he was called in afterwards: they might remain there a quarter of an hour or ten minutes - I told Mr. Gates I had seen the person before they went into the inner room; I believe there were two or three besides in the office - they did not appear to be clerks.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Gregory<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160091"></xptr>Cook - we are linen-drapers, and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was in our employ in July, and for about a month before this transaction, as a temporary clerk, having two ill - he was in our service on the 26th of July, and left that morning, about ten o'clock, on the business of the firm, but I am not certain to half an hour; he went out to collect statements of account, debts owing by us, which we wished to pay; the persons he was sent to resided in the City - he had been employed in our service in filling up cheques on Messrs, Jones, Lloyd, and Co., and had opportunities of seeing me and my partner sign those cheques; our cheques are bound and numbered, consequently we should miss one if it was removed; the signature to this cheque is not my hand-writing - it purports to be my partner's; I should say it is not his - we had no occasion to draw such a cheque at that time; I believe the hand-writing in the body of the cheque to be the prisoner's- the cheque was first shown to me on Tuesday, the 27th, about three o'clock, by Mr. Gates; I recognized the handwriting in the body of it then, and an officer was left at our house to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner left about ten o'clock on Monday morning - did he return that day? A. He did not - he should have done so in the course of his duty; he did not return till about four o'clock on the Tuesday; he was then taken up stairs by the officer, accompanied by myself - when I took him up he said, "What is this for?" I said a forged cheque had been presented at our bankers, and that he was suspected to have something to do with it, or was concerned in it; he said, "Do you miss a cheque from your cheque-book?" I told him I had not any thing to say about what was missed - that he must go with the officer; I had looked at my cheque-book, and did not miss a cheque; I then asked why he did not return home the evening before, as he knew the importance of bringing the statements, and our anxiety to balance up all our accounts - he replied that he had more to do then he could manage, and continued at it so late in the evening, and was so fatigued, that he slept in the City, to be there early in the morning; he did not name the City, but his business was in the City - he inquired at what hour the cheque was presented; I replied that he must go with the officer, and did not answer him - I afterwards went with him in custody to Mr. Gates' office: he there made a statement how he had been employed the day before - that he had been at a friend's (named Capes) house, in Panton-square, from about two o'clock. I think, till about four - I am not sure whether he said four or five.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have a clerk named Powell? A. Yes; I never heard that my mother or sister ever mistook the prisoner for Powell, or Powell for the prisoner; there is certainly no resemblance - my mother is very aged, and might perhaps have done so; other clerks have also filled up cheques - I have heard that His Majesty reviewed some troops on the day in question; I should certainly have been very angry if he had gone there instead of attending to business - I do not know that I should have dismissed him: it is possible: he was about a month in our service - I did not know him before.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner always fill up the cheques? A. Yes; I or my partner are always in the way, and the cheques are generally brought to us to sign, by one of the junior clerks, or any body who happened to be in the way - I never remember their remaining a day or two without being signed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you ever remember their being an hour or two without being signed? A. No, my Lord; I sometimes sent him verbal instructions to fill them up, and sometimes gave them personally; we have two other clerks - the prisoner was there in Powell's absence, as he was ill; Baker and Anderson were the other two - if either of them had told him they came from us for a draft, he would fill it up - the cheque-book was in his keeping; there was no occasion for a cheque of this amount to be drawn.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.

No. I was there eight days up to the 29th of June, and after that went temporarily, I should think, six times - I was there the day the prisoner was taken; I had no knowledge of him till he was there - I first saw the cheque the day after his apprehension, at the Mansion-house; I did not know what he was charged with till the cheque was shown to me - I then said I believed it was his hand-writing; I then guessed he was there on that charge; I do not believe any of the servants of the house knew the charge, except the principals - there are three clerks generally, and about forty shopmen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 26th, on arriving at the prosecutors', I did not consider myself in their employ, as their clerk had returned nearly a fortnight - I had given up all the accounts and cheque-book, which book was always on the desk, and any body had access to it; I merely went that morning out of compliment and to thank them, more than any thing else - it was known by every one in the establishment that I went to the review in the park; I there met my brother-in-law, my sister, and my wife's sister - after the review I called at a public-house for refreshment, and went to Mr. Capes', Panton-square; I there lunched, and as their dinner hour was three they pressed me to stop - I was there till the bellman rang, which was after five o'clock; on the Tuesday morning I went about the business which I should have done on the Monday, collecting the statements, and was accompanied by my brother-in-law - after going to sixty or seventy houses I returned to the prosecutors', after five.</p>
               <p>MR. SHOOLBRED re-examined. Q. Had he discontinued his service on the 26th of July? A.

I said we had little occasion for him, but it would be a recommendation for him to stop, that he could say he had been stopping with us till he could get a situation, and he remained.</p>

            . I am a bootmaker, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road. I have known the prisoner about three years - we were in partnership for two years; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, on an average two or three times every week; our partnership dissolved on the 25th of February last - I have seen this cheque before, and do not believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. It is not like it, is it? A. I do not think it bears the character of his handwriting either generally or particularly; if I was asked, without knowing any thing of the circumstance, I should say I did not know any thing of the hand-writing - I do not think it like his writing, I think he writes bolder than this: the general character of his writing is a bold free hand - this is not like his hand-writing; I can only say it is so unlike his, I should not take it to be his - I saw the cheque in Mr. Gates' office; I went there by request of the prisoner's friends - I stated so to Mr. Gates; Mr. Gates said he did not know why he should not ask my opinion at the time - I said I had no objection, and told him my opinion; I am not in business now - I have not seen him write since the 25th of February.</p>

            . I keep a ready-made linen warehouse in St. James'-street. I have known the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years - he was formerly a clerk at Dew, Turner, and Co.'s, Newgate-street, with me for six or seven years; I saw him write daily - I have seen this cheque before, and do not believe it to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long ago is it since you were fellow clerks? A. About six years; I have frequently seen him write since - I saw him write about twelve mouths ago; I do not think it resembles his hand - the cheque is a much stronger bolder hand.</p>

            . I am an accountant, and live in Bread-street, Cheapside. I have known the prisoner about six years, and frequently seen him write; he was my clerk for four months, and left me three months ago; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write for the last three years - I saw this cheque at Mr. Gates' office; my opinion is, that it is not the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. In what respect do you think it different? A. I think the formation of all the letters different, except the letter P, which occurs only once - that certainly bears a slight resemblance to his writing; I think he writes an uncertain hand, sometimes bold and at other times weaker - I do not think him a skilful penman.</p>

             re-examined. On Monday, the 26th of July. I was at the review in Hyde-park - I saw the prisoner there about half-past twelve o'clock; I did not speak to him, as we were not on friendly terms - he was near the Foot Guards' barracks; the park was very crowded, and I should think it would take him about an hour to get to Panton-square.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it take three-quarters of an hour to get out of the park? A. I should think it would, it was so crowded - the roads and avenues were crowded.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Panton-square - I have known the prisoner about two years. On Wednesday, the 26th of July, he came to my house between one and two o'clock - he told me where he had been, and that he had seen a person who is here; he staid at my house, in my presence, till half-past four - I then went to my shop, leaving him in the drawing-room with my wife; he dined with us about half-past three - I attended at the Mansion-house to give evidence if the Lord Mayor had thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you answer the door yourself when the prisoner came? A. No; the servant who did is here; it was her duty to ring the bell for me, which she did, and I found him there; I did not look at my watch - I cannot say whether it was nearer one than two o'clock - he also lunched with us about two; I am certain I left him with Mrs. Capes long after four, and that it was on the day of the review, the 26th of July; our nurse, Hannah Stowe, saw him there.</p>

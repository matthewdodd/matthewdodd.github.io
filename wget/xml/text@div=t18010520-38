            .(The case was opened by Mr. Knapp)</p>
               <p>COBBY SALTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I went with Mr. Fraser, on Saturday, the 2d of May, about eight in the evening, to a butcher's shop in Grazier's-alley, Wellclose-square; then we went to Mr. Marsh's, a public-house, in <placeName id="t18010520-38-crimeloc204">Wellclose square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18010520-38-crimeloc204" type="placeName" value="Wellclose square"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you know him? - A. No; he told me his name was Smith; then we set down, and had a pint of beer; Fraser took out his watch to see what o'clock it was, Levy then made a snatch at the watch; seeing that, I took Fraser's watch from him, to take care of it, and put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Fraser sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes; I very often had his watch, he is my nephew, we missed our piece of meat, and we stayed near about half an hour; Levy was in the house all that time; Fraser and I went out of the house together, and at the end of Wellclose-square, there is a lamp, where we fell in with Burk and Levy, that was about ten minutes after we came out; Levy clapped Fraser on the shoulder, and said, so you are going home; upon that, he said they were going our way, and they would see us part of the way home; then we all went together along Ratcliff-highway to the corner of St. John's-hill, where we were going to turn down; directly upon turning the hill, I had the watch in my hand in my pocket; it was wrenched out of my hand; I struggled as long as I could, and the glass was broke; it was either Burk or Levy, I do not know which; there was nobody else near; upon that I screamed, murder, saying, Fraser, your watch is lost; he was about three or four yards before me, he walked faster than me; upon that, they both stew, they were gone in a moment; I have never found the watch since; on Monday morning, between twelve and one, I went to the Magistrate, and the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that the two prisoners were the persons who were in the public-house, and were afterwards with you at the corner of the hill? - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went to this public-house, after having been at the butcher's, and had a glass at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first you had had that day? - A. I had had nothing before I went in, without it was a little porter in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no liquor in the course of that day?</p>
               <p>- A. If I had been drunk. I should not have remembered these particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were quite sober? - A. I was sober and sensible; I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. At the public-house you had gin and beer?</p>
               <p>- A. A glass of gin, and three pints of beer; and three or four drank of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stop there? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a half; I had missed my meat.</p>
               <p>Q. You were an orderly good kind of woman; were you not rather noisy? - A. I was merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sing a song or two? - A. I might sing a few verses of a song.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not so noisy and drunk, that the landlord would not draw you any more? - A. He was going to shut up; it was twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, if you will not, I will go to

               <p>Q. How far was this place, where Levy joined you, from Marsh's? - A. About fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then with great difficulty you got fifteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200026"></xptr>yards in ten minutes? - A. It might be thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Who advised you to charge this man with a highway robbery? - A. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You, yourself, employed an attorney? - A. Mr. Fraser did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. There is an attorney employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he is employed by either of you? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is he not employed by the Police officers to get the reward? - A. I suppose I must pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that Burk was present at the corner of the hill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear before the Magistrate that he was one of the two persons at Marsh's? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear it as positively as before?</p>
               <p>Court. It is too bad, she swore before the Magistrate that she was not certain that Burk was one of the men in Wellclose-square; this is the way in which counties are endeavoured to be robbed of their money by rewards; there is no doubt but the attorney has been employed for the purpose of obtaining. 80l. reward.

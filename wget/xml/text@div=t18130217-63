            . The prisoner came in took up the boots and never spoke to me. They laid on the floor. A little boy had been playing with them. Our house is a private house. It was in the parlour where the little boy had been playing with them. The man came in and put them in his bag, and went off. He never spoke a word to me. I am sure he is the same person. The prisoner came in a few days after that. My mother said he was come upon the same occasion. He asked where the little girl was; he pulled out sixpence. He then offered eight-pence for the boots. He said I had sold him the boots for eight-pence. I had not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the prisoner in two or three days after this. When he came, I asked him where my boots were. He said he had come to pay my little girl for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth - A. I had not agreed to sell them. I would not sell them for eightpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wedensday, the 13th of January, I was calling clothes in Noble-street, Goswell-street; his daughter said, master, my father has got some clothes to sell. I went up stairs. He sold me to the amount of three shillings and sixpence. I called again on the Friday. The girl said, her father was not at home, She said a clothes man offered her nine pence for the boots. She said, you take the boots and bring me the money as you come by. On Monday following, I went again. I said, Mr. Davis, I come to pay you nine-pence for the boots that I bought on the Friday. He said, I want my boots back. I said, how is it possible for me to bring them back, when I have sold them. Mr. Davis said I will not take a farthing less then five shillings. He charged an officer with me. A little while after he came into the public-house, and said, young man, you had better settle it before you go into custody. The officer said, no, I will not settle it; I have got charge of him. I said I would sooner go to jail than pay him five shillings for the boots.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

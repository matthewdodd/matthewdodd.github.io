                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor, and reside in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. I have a client named Michael, of Houndsditch—in the sum<lb></lb>mer of last year I was retained by him to prosecute an action on three bills of exchange against Moses Myers—these, are the bills—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—Myers is an indorser of this one for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by procuration of the one for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sued Myers on all the three bills—I had proceeded against other parties long before—he had paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid the rest into Court—a <hi rend="italic">noli pros.</hi> was entered as to that bill—there had been a demurrer on the two bills—in Feb. last the action on the two bills was at issue, and notice of trial given for the Assizes—the bills were in my office, and the briefs preparing by Mr. Jukes, my principal clerk—he had the bills before him on the 26th of Feb. and for some days before—John Isaac</p>

               <p>Sidney is a relative of mine by marriage—on the 20th of Feb. he made a disclosure to me, and in consequence of information from him I immediately proceeded to inspector Todhunter, and made arrangements with him—between three and four o'clock that afternoon I was in an office where Mr. Jukes and myself are at times—Todhunter was in an adjoining office, and Jukes in the same office—the bills were on the desk in an office in which nobody was—there are three offices—on a certain communication being made to me, I opened the door, went into the office where the bills were, and found Sidney and the prisoner there—I said nothing—Todhunter followed me immediately, and im<lb></lb>mediately laid hold of the prisoner as well as Sidney, and commenced searching Sidney—he did not know himself which had the bills—he then commenced searching the prisoner, and found in his left-hand coat pocket this piece of paper with the particulars on it of the bill for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Myers on Cohen, which corresponded with the bill which had been settled, and these three bills were also taken from the prisoner's pocket—his hand was in his pocket—it was drawn out with the three bills clenched in his fist—they were pinned together on a piece of paper, as they had been all the time I held them—this paper had been given to me by Sidney on the Mon<lb></lb>day when he gave me the information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Sidney been related to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From his infancy—I married his sister—he has been engaged during the last four or five years with his father, who is an attorney residing in the City—his father apprenticed him to a furrier, but he had not constant employ—he was continually at my office endeavouring to obtain employ—I employed him to serve writs and notices—Jukes has been with me upwards of ten years—the business was never carried on in Jukes's name, nor in Sidney's name—I was not in practice part of that time, but no business was done then, my office was closed—I was absent about three months—Jukes did not carry on my business, and share the profits during that time—I never saw the prisoner before the 26th of Nov—nobody was present when Sidney handed me this paper—he requested to see me privately, and gave it me in my private parlour—he spoke to me first in my office—he was about half an hour in my parlour—I afterwards took him into the office where Mr. Jukes and my son were sitting, and I stated the account he had given me in the presence of Jukes and my other clerks—he came to me I think between eleven and one o'clock—I had no conversation with him on the subject before—I swear that most positively—the bills were generally locked with others in my iron chest at night—the chest is open in business hours, and the bills which are required taken out—there were no other bills on the desk—Sidney has accepted two bills for me, never more—I think one was about nine months ago, and the other four or five months—they were for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I knew at that time he was pennyless—I was at that time employing him to serve writs—I saw the bills on the desk, and believe Jukes had placed them there—they were among other papers relating to the case—Jukes and I saw the officer search Sidney—I did not suggest that he was not the person who took the bills—Mr. Jukes said he saw the prisoner take them, and to the best of my belief he stated it was no use searching Sidney as the other man had the bills—I will swear he said so—the Lord Mayor considered it best that Sidney should go to gaol for his own protection, and to insure his coming forward—I never had any quarrel with Mr. Myers—I was once his attorney—we had no dispute—I suppose he was dissatisfied, but he never expressed dissatisfaction.</p>

On Monday, the 26th of Feb., I was preparing a brief at Mr. Yates's in the case of "Michael against Myers"—I had got these bills before me—I had seen Sidney and the prisoner in the office five or ten minutes before they were taken into custody—the bills were lying at that time on the round table by the side of the fire-place, near Mr. Yates's desk, pinned together as they are now—in consequence of information I placed my self in the passage where there was a window which commanded a view of Mr. Yates's office—the pri<lb></lb>soner and Sidney came into the office—there was no one else there—they went up to Mr. Yates's table, and both began turning over the papers—they remained some short time turning over the papers—whilst they were doing so a little noise occurred which seemed to give an alarm, and Barnet sat himself down on a chair under the window for about half a minute—he then got up again and renewed the search over the papers at the table—they went round Mr. Yates's table to a table where I am in the habit of sitting, under the window—they then returned, and coming round the little round table at the corner where the bills were, they seemed to catch the prisoner's eye—he laid hold of them, looked at them, brought them round the end of Mr. Yates's table, pulled them over immediately, folded them up, and put them into his left-hand coat pocket—I gave an alarm, and the inspector came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where had these bills been kept the previous week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a recess in a book-case to the left of my desk, with the whole of the other papers in the cause—I had had them out at different times for several days—I had done part of the brief, and then put it on one side to go on with other matters—I had them out day after day for some days before—I think I saw Sidney come in one day in the week before—I am sure he was there once—I am rather doubting whether it was once or twice—I did not see him more than twice—when I saw him he was sitting at the side of the fire-place—I have always been in one office latterly, and was so up to that time—he sat by the fire probably half an hour—I cannot tell—the hills were then either in the recess or on my desk—I cannot positively say, for I do not know exactly what I was upon at the time—I cannot positively say whether these bills were ever on my desk when he came—they were pinned together as they are now—I think he came to the office about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one on the Monday—I cannot say where Mr. Yates was on the Saturday or Friday—he was about his business that week, and at the office, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday—during that time Sidney inquired for him—I do not know whether it was Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—I think it was early in the week that I saw Sidney there—I do not think I saw him there either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—I think it was earlyier in the week, but I cannot take on myself to say—when he came on the Monday he said he wished to speak to Mr. Yates—Mr. Yates was then in his own office, and he and Sidney went out together into the front parlour I believe—they went out into the passage—I do not know where they went after—they were absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour probably—they then came back into the office—I think one, if not both, of Mr. Yates's sons were in the office at that time, but I cannot take on myself to say—I think one of them was—I should say Sidney staid in the office probably half an hour—I did not see him again till I saw him in the room with the prisoner—I saw Sidney partly searched, and also the prisoner—he did not say to Sidney at the time, "You villain,</p>

               <p>you have led me into this"—he made no observation at all—I never knew Sidney to accept bills for Mr. Yates—I have known Sidney nearly ever since I have been in the office—I cannot say what he has been doing for a living—he has been occasionally employed in our office to serve writs, notices, and those sort of things—I do not know of anything else—I do not know his affairs at all—we had received instructions from Mr. Yates not to encourage him in the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was his appearance very bad? that of a distressed, impoverished person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very bad—I think those instructions were given by Mr. Yates some three or four weeks back—his state and appearance had become so deplorable that Mr. Yates said it was not fit—I always considered Mr. Yates had been kind to him before that—when he and Mr. Yates re<lb></lb>turned into the office, Mr. Yates called my attention to this piece of paper, put it into my band, and said, "What do you think of this, Mr. Jukes?" and he said with regard to the robbery, "You had better let it be done;" and that it was to take place, in order that the party might be apprehended—measures were immediately taken to have them apprehended; inspector Todhunter was sent for, and received some directions from Mr. Yates in my presence—I believe he had received some directions before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City-police. On Mon<lb></lb>day, the 26th of Feb., between three and four o'clock, I went to Mr. Yates's office, and in consequence of an arrangement that was made I was secreted in a room where I could command a view of the office—after waiting for a few minutes I saw the prisoner and Sidney come into the office—I saw them go to different parts of the office, more particularly the prisoner—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take up various papers, in different parts of the office, from the deaks, at which be looked, putting them down again—I lost sight of him for a mo<lb></lb>ment, owing to the partition of the wall between the windows of the office; but immediately afterwards I rushed into the office—I there saw the prisoner and Sidney—I searched Sidney first, because he was nearer the fire—I found nothing on him—I then searched the prisoner, and found the three bills of exchange, which I had previously seen in the office, in his left-hand coat pocket—he had his hand in his pocket, and was clenching the bills in his pocket—I also found on him this paper relating to the bill lor 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then took him to the station.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">On the paper handed by Sidney to Mr. Yates was written, "Two bills, one for</hi> 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn by S.

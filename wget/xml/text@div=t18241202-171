            . I am servant to Mr. Ross, a pawnbroker, and live at Paddington. I have a saw, which was pawned by the prisoner, on the 6th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, for 2 s.; he said he bought it from his father, and gave the name that was stamped upon the saw. On the Monday morning the officer brought him to our shop; he said I was the person who took it in of him. He did not then say that his father had given it to him.</p>

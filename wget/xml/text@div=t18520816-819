               <p>of the prisoner, in Haydon-square, where they are pulling down the ware-houses, and building the Blackwall Railway—I saw them there, and asked a man if they were for sale—he said, "I believe they are; there goes the foreman," and I went and asked the prisoner if he had any old bricks to sell—he said, "Yes, wait till I have set the men to work"—he then showed me the bricks, and asked me if they would do—I said, "Yes"—I went and brought my cart—he and his lad helped me to load it, and I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. For the load—I went again the same day, and when we had got about three hundred in the cart, the foreman of the masons came up, and said, "Do you know what you are at here; do you know which is the foreman?"—I pointed to the prisoner who had left as soon as he saw the foreman coming—they told me to go and look after him, but I did not see any more of him till that day week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mason in Mr. Myers' employ, and live at 14, Crown and Shears-court, Minories. On 1st July I saw the prisoner help<lb></lb>ing to load the cart with bricks in Hay don-square—I asked the prisoner where the bricks were going to—he said he did not know—I asked if it was Mr. Myers' horse and cart—he said he did not know—I asked who autho<lb></lb>rised him to load the bricks—he said he had nothing to do with it, and walked away—that was at about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Somerset-place, Dalston, and am foreman to Mr. George Myers, who has the contract for the branch railway, at Haydon-square. We had a quantity of old bricks there, Mr. Myers' property—on the afternoon of 1st July, I missed about two load of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How could they belong to Mr. Myers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because they had been measured by the Company's inspector, and I had booked them myself—I am not aware that Mr. Myers is here—the prisoner has been in his employ off and on, perhaps eighteen months—a Mr. Goodman had purchased some of these bricks previously, but he bought the building, and pulled them down himself—these were not bricks which belonged to Mr. Goodman, which were not worth his taking away—they are our own, and worth perhaps 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are just as they were taken down, brickbats and bricks.</p>

I asked if he had received any money for the bricks, and he said he had not, and he knew nothing about the bricks.</p>

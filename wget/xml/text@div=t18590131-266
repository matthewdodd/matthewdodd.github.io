                  </hi>. I reside at No. 10, Upper Porchester-street, Paddington. On 10th November, about twenty minutes past 7 in the evening, I was returning from Bayswater to my own house—the gas was alight—I met the female prisoner in Hyde Park Street—my watch was safe a few minutes before that—it had a chain to it, and was in my right hand waistcoat pocket—the chain passed through my waistcoat button-hole, and the key was attached round my neck—she came quite close to me, and said, "I know you, Sir"—I said, "How do you know me?"—she said, "I live in this neighbourhood/' that she was a servant, and I think she Raid a ladies' maid, living in Hyde Park Square—at that time I saw Wilcox—he rushed round the corner of Hyde Park Square, and pushed the woman, as I thought by accident, against me—I thought she was frightened—I felt her hands about me, but could hardly say where—Wilson then came up, with a stick in his hand, as if he was walking, and said, "Which is the way to Hyde Park Square?"—Wilcox said, "This gentleman" (meaning me) "knows the neighbourhood much better than I do"—the female then disappeared—Wilson went down Hyde Park Street, And Wilcox in a different direction—about 10 o'clock the same night I missed my watch and chain—I believe the prisoners to be the parties—I believe I can say I am sure of them—Wilcox pushed the woman against me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was the woman in your society; longer than the others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it might be three or four minutes—I believe her to be the party; I have not the least doubt about her—I believe Wilcox to be the person that came up next—Wilson was further off than the others, and being somewhat foggy, I named him as 60 years of age at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson.</hi> I am 37 years of age.</p>

               <p>I stated Wilcox to be about 40 (<hi rend="italic">The gaoler here dated that 40 was his age</hi>)—it was a foggy night, but I went for a walk down Hyde Park Street, right up Hyde Park Terrace, round the Edgeware-road, and after that I went home—I was in company with no one, and nobody came up against me—the Edgeware-road is crowded with people at that time in the evening, and people passed me, but they could not see my chain, as it was under my coat which was buttoned—White took no liberties with me before the others came up—I missed my watch before I went up to my bed-room, when. I was going to wind it up—I took no steps that night—I did not make it known only at home—I informed the police next day—I do not remember any woman coming up and speaking to me in the street; such things do happen sometimes—I had drunk a glass of gin and water after dinner—I dined at home, and then went to my friend's house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant,</hi> 16 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) On 17th November, about an hour after Mr. Pearse gave information of his loss, I took a description of the thieves from the book, and from Mr. Pearse, of the robbery. On 13th December I was on duty under the Park railing in the Edgeware-road, on the dark side; any person on that side can see perfectly well what is going on on the light side, but persons on the light side cannot see what is going on on the dark side—I was just beyond the Marble-arch—I watched the prisoners there together for about an hour, and then apprehended them—the woman spoke to me—she was standing at the corner of Hyde Park Street (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that evidence could not be given of what passed</hi>)—I took them to the station-house—I am sure they were all together—they stood talking together for about ten minutes—when I first saw them, they seemed to be perfectly acquainted—after White had been locked up some time we sent for Mr. Pearse, and other persons who had been robbed—Mr. Pearse identified them—after White was charged and was about leaving the dock, she turned round to the two men, and said, "I told you he would <hi rend="italic">tumble</hi> to us"—she said she had never seen the man before, and had not spoken to them that night.</p>

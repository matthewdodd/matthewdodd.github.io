                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in the Old Kent-road. The prisoner was my plasterers' foreman—he was employed at weekly wages—I have some houses building in the Commercial-road, Peckham—he was employed there as foreman—I provided materials for the plastering, and among other things a quantity of hair—on the 17th of May I bought</p>

               <p>2 cwt. of hair of Mr. Harmott—it was placed in Mr. Harmott's cart, and delivered at the buildings—I was present at the time—I paid 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the hair the same day—it was the prisoner's business to receive it—I have the bill of it, which bears the prisoner's handwriting on it, showing that he received it at the building—when payment was required he was to put his name on the bill, and send it as a voucher, and I paid the money—I re-quired the prisoner to take the hair with other materials, to his lodging that he had taken, near the work—I considered it safer there, as several things had been lost from the buildings—some time after that, I saw the hair going towards the prisoner's lodgings—he had my truck under his care, and a labourer with him—on Monday, the 7th of June, I received information from Mr. Forbes, a gentleman living near there, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of that I discovered that a portion of my hair had been taken away—I missed about three-quarters of a cwt., which the prisoner ought to have had in his possession—I went and looked at the hair at Mr. Forbes's, and the sack—I cannot say that they were mine, nor could I swear to the hair or sack that were stolen—I expect the hair that I bought was of that sort and description, but I did not notice it when I purchased it—I did not see the prisoner on the day I went to look for the hair at his house—I saw him on Tuesday morning—I told him I wanted to know what was the reason he had left my work, and I said in the same sentence, "I understand you hare been selling a quantity of hair to Mr. Forbes, and what has become of the hair you had of mine?"—he got up in a hurry, and said be would let me know all about that, and left my house—I did not see him till the officer took him—he said on going out of the door that I had no business to trespass on his place, and he would serve a writ on me for the trespass I had committed in taking things from his lodging—I had taken my own scaffolding and other things from there—I did not see him again for ten days or a fortnight, when the officer brought him—the hair I bought was 2 cwt., and the quantity I authorized him to use about the work was about a quarter of a cwt.—I consider he would have had no occasion to use more than that—there should have been 1 cwt. 3/4 qrs. left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bethnal-green-road. I was in High-street, in the Borough, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 8th of Dec., crossing over opposite St. George's church, towards London-bridge—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go home with her—I refused—she pressed me to go down each turning we came to, till we came to King-street—she there hustled me, got her arm round me, and squeezed me fight, and then was about to leave me—I felt three sovereigns and a half safe in my pocket while I was opposite St. George's church, and after she felt in<lb></lb>clined to leave me I missed my money—she had all the time while walking, a*kcd me to treat her or go home with her, which I refused; but when I missed my money I said, "Come and have something to drink here"—I took</p>

I received charge of the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, at the King's Arms, King-street, Borough—I made a search, and she was searched by the female searcher, but nothing was produced to me—there were several prostitutes and thieves io front of the bar in the public-house—I do not think it was difficult to get rid of anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Trinity-square, Southwark. I attended the Police-court for the prisoner—I cross-examined the prosecutor—I asked him whether he would swear he was absolutely sober, and in answer to that he said, "I will not swear I was absolutely sober," but he would not admit he was drunk—I asked the policeman one question and he gave me an answer, and then the Magistrate asked him the question again as to whether one policeman did not walk immediately behind the prisoner, and one have hold of her hand, so that she could not get rid of any<lb></lb>thing, and his answer was, "No"—to the best of my recollection, that was the only question put—I have mislaid the notes I took.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. John Henry Pelly, of Upton, who is a magistrate of Essex, as watchman on his premises. The house is not a mile from the last prosecutor's—on Saturday night, the 15th of June, I was going my rounds through the premises, about half-past two o'clock, and found the prisoner lying down—I laid hold of him, and asked him what brought him there—((he was between nine and ten yards from the drawing-room window)—he asked what o'clock it was—I told him it wanted a quarter or twenty minutes to three o'clock—he asked me the way to, Plaistow—I said I would direct him—I went about twenty yards with him, and then turned back, and on going by my master's window I observed it was up—I had not before ascertained that the house had been opened—I found a piece of a pane of glass either broken or cut out, and the lid of a Incifer-box lying on the ledge of the window, with one or two matches, and a piece of sand-paper—I took the lid—when the men-servants were called at five o'clock I told them what had happened, and I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in custody in the morning, and knew him to be the man I had seen near the drawing-room window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Pelly, the Magistrate. I was informed in the morning of the drawing-room window being open—I had secured it about a quarter-past ten o'clock overnight—I examined it in the morning, and found the middle pane of the upper sash partly taken out-that would enable a person outside to turn back the bolt of the win<lb></lb>dow and push up the sash—I applied the chisel, which was produced on the last trial, to the window—I believe that, or a similar one, had been used to it—I found the mark of such an instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol. I found this instrument on the pri<lb></lb>soner—I applied it to the drawing-room window of Mr. Pelly's prisoner and, in my judgment, it had been used to open it—there was such a mark as it would make—it exactly corresponded—I compared the top of the luci<lb></lb>fer-box with the bottom of the box found at Mr. Gooden's, and one appeared to form part of the other—Mr. Pelly's drawing-room window was secured by a shutter inside—I found impressions on the shutter, inside the glass—I compared the chisel with the impressions, and it is exactly the size—it matched the marks on the putty and on the inner shutter.</p>

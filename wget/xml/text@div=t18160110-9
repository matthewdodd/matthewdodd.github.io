            . On the 28th, between five and half past, I caught the prisoner at the bar, with two pieces of toilenet, my property, in his hands; he was just putting them into a sack, with another person. On the morning of the 26th, I missed some particular goods, and I suspected that they must have been taken out of the warehouse while they were shutting it up, for one part of our warehouse goes into the Blossom-innyard, and on this evening, I said, I would wait, and the prisoner came in at the street door, into the warehouse door, which was a little open, and there was another person holding a sack for him to put these pieces of toilenet into. I could not see him in the warehouse, because it was so dark; but I saw him in the passage leading to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUGHES. I am warehouse-man; I live next door to Mr. Hodgson. On the evening of the 28th, at about a quarter or half past five, I was sitting in my counting-house, when I heard an alarm of stop thief! I rushed out as quickley as I could; I found Mr. Hedgson with the prisoner at the bar by the collar, and he was coming out after some other man, then out of sight, and the two pieces of toilenet were laying on the threshold of the door, in the passage of Mr. Berkley, leading to Mr. Hodgson's warehouse.</p>

            . That is my toilenet, it is my property. There is but one common entrance into Mr. Buckley's house, and my warehouse. The lowest value is five pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I fell in with a shipmate that night; he was going into Cheapside, and he said, he had got to go into a gentleman's house, and he went up and brought these things out, and asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100009"></xptr>to put them into the bag for him, while he held it open, and then that gentleman seized me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor, I could not see him come out of the ware-house, because it was so dark, but I saw him in the passage with the goods, and I saw the other person who is not here, come from the other side of the way, and open the bag for him to put them in; and I took him in the altitude of putting them in.</p>

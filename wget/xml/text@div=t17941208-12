               <p>Q. Does any other person live in the house? - No, I have two little rooms and a yard to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. In November last did you lose any part of your property? - All, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a silver watch, a black silk petticoat, one other silk gown, and two cotton gowns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you express what was the value of these things altogether? What was the value of the watch? - Two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the silk gown? - Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the petticoat-Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the other silk gown? - Fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the two cotton gowns? - One pound two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you lose any money? - Two pounds two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What day in November was this? - The third of November, I do not know the time I lost the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, was she in your service? - She came to take a lodging of me for sixweeks, she said she was waiting for a gentleman's family coming to town.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080057"></xptr>Q. How long had she lodged with you? - Just the five weeks, and my being a widow with two children, I thought it would be helpful, as I had two beds.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave your lodging? - She left it on Monday, and Tuesday the six weeks was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive that any of the things were taken from you previous to the time she left your house? - I perceived the two guineas were gone when she had been there three weeks, I went and unlocked my great chest and found the money gone, she talked so fair I could not think it was her, and so I let it pass; three weeks afterwards she left my place, she said the family were come to town, as she told me, and she took me to the place with her in Finsbury square, No. 8. When I came home on the Monday on which she went, from my business, about one o'clock, she said she had got a note from the family in Finsbury square, and asked me to take a walk with her to the place; and when she came to the place she said, Mrs. C a e, you will excuse me asking you in, because I know nobody here but the cook, and she went down the airy, and shut the door after her, and I came home; and my little girl happened to go to my drawer for something and saw my watch was gone, then I went to my padlock chest, and unlocked that, it unlocked very easy, it used to go very hard. After I found my things were all gone, I went after her to Finsbury-square, and this housekeeper said, she came in there with an excuse, and they turned her out, they thought she was a thief. And then I went to Worship street, and there I spoke to one Mr. Blackiter, and he knew the woman very well, and said, she came to Newgate every day, to her sister, and she was taken there the Friday after; she stayed away from Monday till Friday before she went to her sister in Newgate-street; I did not know that she had a sister any where till Mr. Blackiter told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she stopped? - At Newgate, as she was going to Newgate to see her sister, her sister was tried last Sessions, and transported.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover where she had lived after she had quitted your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her searched? or have you found any property in her possession? - No, she pawned it all, she told me she would tell me where it was if I would not take her to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the Office she confessed to the taking of the things? - No, as she was going to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you previous to the time promise to shew her any favour? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten her at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she confess? - She confessed she pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that confession voluntary? - It was. She confessed them all, and what pawnbrokers they were at.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you discover where they were? - I found one gown at one of the pawnbrokers before I found her, in Newgate-street, at one Mr. Fleming's, he had one cotton gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing in regard to the two guineas? - No, in my flurry I did not say any thing to her of the two guineas, I hardly knew at first what I lost, and when I went to make my bed that she slept in, I found she had taken a good many of my feathers out of the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She shewed me every favour, and said, she would not put me in prison if I would but confess; there it one pound nine shillings taken away from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say you would not prosecute? or that you would not bring her to justice, if she would confess? - I did not, she used to pity me, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080058"></xptr>she would not let any body rob me, and yet was robbing me herself. She wondered how I went through my work to maintain my children, I lived so low.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 3d of November, and she wanted a guinea on them, I let her have fourteen shillings; she said how it would not be sufficient, she must go and get something else, accordingly in about ten minutes she brought me the silver watch, she said, she lived in Water-lane, Blackfriars, which is just by where I resided; I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>

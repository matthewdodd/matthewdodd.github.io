The prisoner came there on Friday, and asked for six quarts of ale to be put into a bottle, and said he had a number of persons at the docks to pay, and wanted some silver - he paid for the ale; he said he had a number of men working at the docks, and one of them should fetch the bottle after the ale was disposed of; he told me he had been recommeded to our house by an intimate friend of Mr. Eayres, as a customer - he paid for the ale, and asked me if I had a man to send to Islington, to fetch his horse - I told him there was a man who could go: he was then in the bar, and asked me for a piece of paper - I had some paper in the bar, locked up in a drawer, and there was money in a bag in the drawer, which was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; he asked for the paper to write a direction for the man to go for his horse - he was sitting down in a chair, close by me; he remained in the bar, and after giving the man the direction, he said, "I will send one of my men for the ale," and went away - he had been in the bar about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - the bag of money was locked up in the drawer, and I had the key in my pocket; after sending the man away from the house, he returned again in less than ten minutes, and said he wanted another piece of paper - I gave him some, and he wrote something; he then asked if I could let him have 20s. worth of change - I told him I could; I opened a drawer, and took out a bag, with a quantity of silver in it- he could see there was money in the bag; I counted him 20s., and he said "Let me have 2l. worth, as I have got my men to pay" - this was on Friday, the 15th of March; he took the silver off the table, and put it into his pocket - I said, "You have not given me the two sovereigns for the change;" he said, "Oh! I will give it you presently - I have been recommended by a friend of Mr. Eayres." - I said,"You may be known to Mr. Eayres, but not to me;" he said,"Have not I sent your man for a horse, detain the horse when it comes, if you are afraid;" and he went out without my consent - when I asked him for the sovereigns, he said,"Do not I tell you I am intimately acquainted with a friend of Mr. Eayres, detain the horse when it comes, if you are afraid, it is worth 30l." - when the man came back no horse was to be found; on the Sunday following he came again, and said, "I suppose you thought I was lost" - I said,"I did not know what had become of you, as you had forfeited your word;" he said, "Well, I am come to pay you" - I pressed him to give me the two sovereigns; he said, "I wish you to do something further for me, and will pay you altogether" - I told him about the man, and in the mean time I sent for an officer - he had a paper in his hand, and said he wanted to send to Islington for 7l. 19s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I should return in half an hour, and give you the two sovereigns? A. You said you should return in a short time - he did not appear at all drunk; there was a crown, three half crowns, and several shillings and sixpences among the money.</p>

            . I am beadle of Queenhithe. I apprehended the prisoner, by desire of Mrs. Hurst, for stealing 40s. in silver - he said he had come down on purpose to settle with her, but I found only 8s. 6d., and a written order for 9l. 10s. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It does not look suspicious to borrow 2l. on Friday and return on Sunday, when I need not have gone there - I wrote to my executor, and if he had remitted the money I should have paid it immediately if they had not been so hot tempered.</p>

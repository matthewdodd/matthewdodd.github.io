When the conversation was going on, the prisoner knew that accounts were going to those people, and he said he believed he had not received them and knew nothing about a deficiency, and he came and wanted to see the books—goods sometimes arrive before the invoice, we then deliver them without charge, and the charge follows—I cannot say whether this gravel arrived before the invoice, and I do not know whether in such a case an assumed charge is made without waiting for the invoice—I cannot tell what the goods clerk does—it was the prisoner's place to collect accounts as well as the goods clerk's, when the goods porter could not get them in—this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd occurs just about' the date of Mr. Gasson's account—the company have sent in their bill to the Guarantee Society.</p>

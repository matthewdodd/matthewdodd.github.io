I let the prisoner at the bar a ready furnished room on the 4th of January, she came to my house to take the lodgings, and we went for her character, she was to pay half a crown a week, she did not come into the lodgings till the Monday, that was the 6th, she continued there until Thursday, the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay for her lodgings before she went? - No, she went out about two o'clock, with the key on her finger, and went down the lane, I went up to look into the room, and when I came into the room the bed was cut open, and a quantity of feathers about the room, and the articles in the indictment were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these articles let to her with the lodgings? - Yes. About five o'clock that evening she came to a neighbour's house opposite; a woman sent over to my wife, that she was there, and my wife went over and asked the prisoner for a flat iron, and she said she would come and give it her, my wife had lent her a flat iron that very morning; I was not present, she was taken before the justice that afternoon, and the justice of Worship-street turned her over to the City constable. That same night, Thursday night, about nine or ten o'clock all the articles that I have got, where found at one pawnbroker's; some articles are not found yet.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I produce some of the things which I took in of the prisoner, two sheets, a blanket, and a bolster, a flat iron, a pair of bellows, and a frying pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person before? - No, I did not; but she brought these things several times; I have no doubt about her person, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend her money on them? - Yes. The sheets were brought the 6th of January, the blanket was brought the same day, the bolster was brought on the 8th, the bellows and iron the 9th, the frying pan on the 7th. I lent her money on them all.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You had let all these things with the room? - Yes, I am sure of that; they are my things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My name is Ann Parman, and not Ann Palmer, the wife of William Parman, of Old-street; my husband for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150215"></xptr>some time has lived in a criminal way with another woman, and turned me out of doors destitute, with the allowance of eighteen-pence a week; I took the ready furnished lodging with intent to get work, and while I brought in several things with intent to light a fire, I was gone out, and come back again, and to my great surprise I found my room door open, by means of my landlord having a second key to the room. I have children, and am now pregnant, and humbly beg the mercy of the court. This is my defence and it is truth.</p>

I am a carman, and reside at 139, Nelson-street, Vic<lb></lb>toria-docks—I keep a horse and cart—I recollect Mr. Cousin's applying to me for my horse and cart—I know the female prisoner; she is his wife—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said to me I took my horse and cart to his house, but he came about an hour and a half before I took it up, on the 16th, I think it was, the day I took away the tea—I saw the female after the first bed tick came out—they were represented to me as beds—I do not know the man's name who brought them out—the first bed that was put on to the cart the counterpane was outside of it, torn, and she sang out to her husband not to tear them, and the answer I made was, "What is rotten will rend"—I afterwards took these bed ticks away in the cart—Mrs. Cousins went with me—her husband was not there when I first started—he met me at the Bridge Tavern, after I got over the iron-bridge—I first saw Palfrey just as I came over the Barking-road station, before I met Cousins—I never heard him speak till after we got into the Bridge Tavern—Mrs. Cousins said to Palfrey, just before we got there, "I am going to London to-day," and she ordered me to pull up to the Bridge Tavern, and I did so—she and Palfrey then went inside, and had a pot of half-and-half to drink, and in came Mr. Cousins, and another man with him—we stopped at another beer-shop, in the East India-road—my orders were to go to the head of the Commercial-road—Mr. Cousins gave me the orders—I drove there, and round to the end of Colchester-street—when we got to the end of the Commercial-road I asked Mrs. Cousins whether she knew where we were to go to—she said, "Did not my husband tell you?"—I said, "He did not"—the husband was absent at that time—I drove to the end of Colchester-street, stopped there, left the horse and cart at the head of a public-house, and then came back to Back Church-lane to see if I could see Cousins—Mrs. Cousins was inside the public-house at that time—I did not see Palfrey till after I got to Back Church-lane—I there saw him at a public-house called the Blacksmith's Arms—he was standing on the pavement—I could not say whether it was him sang out, or the other parties—there was a party sang out for me to stop the horse—I was leading the horse along—I could not say who it was.</p>

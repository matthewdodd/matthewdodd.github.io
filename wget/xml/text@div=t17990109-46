               <p>Q. He had nothing to do with this butter, had he? - A. No; it was butter upon Mr. Bolt's wharf, under his charge, it weighs upwards of seventy pounds, and is worth thirty shillings; (produces the tub); here is No. 50 upon it, the mark put upon it at Waterford; it is Irish butter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great number of them, perhaps, from the same quarter? - A. Yes, a great number.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at work upon the wharf all the day, I was counting my money for my day's work, when this gentleman laid hold of me; I never touched the tub.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Turner. In July last I put up three dozen silver spoons, and two dozen forks - they were all the fiddle-pattern, and worth about 50l.; I gave them to William Simmons, to be taken to Mr. Buck's, No. 13, Cumberland-street, who has been a customer of my masters' many years; I was at Messrs. Turners' at the time the prisoner was an apprentice there, and I know his hand-writing; I believe this letter to be his writing, but it did not strike me then, as I had it not long in my hands before the order was executed; I think I destroyed the other part of it, and put this part on the file.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Why did you destroy the other part? A. It is customary in our business; the other part had contained the direction, "Messrs. T. and C. Turner, No. 58 and 59, New Bond-street, London; by favour of Capt. Montgomery;" it came by the two-penny post; this is the prisoner's hand-writing - I have no hesitation in swearing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure it came by the post, and had Capt. Montgomery's name on it too? A. Yes; it had his name on the fore-part, immediately over the direction, and yet came by the post. (read.)</p>

Montgomery will call there on his return to Hampton.</p>
               <p>Another letter came on the 8th of August, which, I believe, to be the prisoner's writing, but there was something in it which excited my attention, there is one word mis-spelt in it, the word has instead of as; I went to get directions in consequence of the suspicion I entertained, and I went to the office and to Mr. Buck's house; this is the letter(read)</p>
               <p>Mr. G. Buck's compliments to Messrs. Turner, and informs them, the plate gave every satisfaction - has Mr. B. wishes to make the set more complete, he will thank Messrs. Turner to let him have six more of each, (except the teaspoons) and a soup ladle.</p>

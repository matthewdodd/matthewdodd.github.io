                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Scaley, of No. 23, Col<lb></lb>chester-street, Savage-gardens, in the parish of St. Olave, Hart-street. On the 30th of January, between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner coming out of the back-attic of Mr. Scaley's house, with a blue bag in his hand—he went down stairs—I followed him—I did not observe him drop any thing—Mr. Kemapley, master's clerk, stopped him as he got out of the outer-door, to go out—my fellow-servant and I sleep in the back-attic—none of my property was taken—it is the custom to keep the outer-door of the house shut, but how it was that day I cannot say—the inner-door, leading to the dwelling-house, is usually kept shut—I had not noticed it that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Scaley. I stopped the prisoner about one o'clock, going out of the outer door—I came out of the counting-house, the door of which is on the outer side of the inner door, hearing an unusual noise, and stopped him—Fisher came down about three minutes after—the outer door was then shut, and the prisoner was trying to open it—the inner door was open, as he had come through it—I had seen both doors several times during the morning—they were both shut—a bag was brought down stairs, which is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who brought the bag down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of the ser<lb></lb>vants—I cannot say which—I have no doubt at all the doors were shut, but I do not know positively—I noticed they were shut in the usual way when I passed them—the inner door has a small catch, which opens out<lb></lb>side by a key—there is a catch inside—I had passed it several times in the course of the morning, and perhaps half an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for to Mr. Scaley's house, and found the prisoner in custody—I searched him, and found on him six skeleton keys, a screw-driver, a gold neck-chain, a watch, three brooches, two pairs of kid gloves, and a silk handkerchief—I produce the bag—it contains a green cloth cloak lined with silk, a brown silk gown,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040021"></xptr>
               <p>a black silk pelisse, a black silk shawl, and a small blue cloth cloak—I took the prisoner in charge—he said he was guilty—I said nothing to in<lb></lb>duce him to make that observation—I had examined the bag in his presence, before he said he was guilty, and found the things in it—it was lying down close by the door when I went in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you find that neck chain on his person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in his trowsers pocket, with the other articles—I told him I must take him to the station-house, with he said he was guilty—he said so while I was tying his hands in the room—there were two or three persons in the room—I believe Mr. Scaley and Miss Bulmer were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Scaley.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

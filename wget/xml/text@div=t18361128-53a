The prisoner was his servant of all work for about six months—she came in May—she is between nine<lb></lb>teen and twenty years of age—I have no reason to believe she is married—in consequence of the appearance she presented, I taxed her once or twice with being pregnant, and I had done so about a week or a month before the 19th of September—she denied it—she had received a month's notice to quite Mr. Jeffery's service, which expired on Saturday the 19th; she was to leave that evening—I saw her between seven and eight o'clock, I believe, that morning—she used to be up sometimes at six o'clock, and sometimes after—she was sitting in a chair in the parlour when I saw her, not able to do her work—I asked her what was the matter?—she said she had a pain in her back—she was so ill, she was obliged to go up to her own room—she went up by my advice about eight o'clock—in consequence of this, I men<lb></lb>tioned what had occurred to my mistress—I went up to the prisoner about nine o'clock to her bed-room—I am not certain about the time—I opened the door, and saw her standing in the room dressed, packing the things in her box—I asked her if she was getting ready to go—she said yes—nothing more passed, and I went down—I afterwards went up again, and found her still standing near the box, the door was not fastened—I saw stains of blood on the floor, just close by the door, about where I stood, and a very little way from where she was standing—close by the window—I ob<lb></lb>served nothing unusual about her—I asked her what was the meaning of the stains, and she said something had come from her—I went down stairs</p>

               <p>the middle of the room, with a box open under the window, and a broken pot on her left hand near the table—I said to her, "Jane, what are you doing?"—she said, "I am preparing to go away"—I said, "You do not seem fit to go away—you appear ill"—she said, "No, I am not ill—I am well now" (<hi rend="italic">Here the witness stated the particulars of his examination of the prisoner's person; after which, he charge her with having been deli<lb></lb>vered, which she denied two or three times.</hi>) I said, "I insist on knowing where the child is, what you have done with it, or where you have put it"—I believe her answer was, "I have not put it any where"—I told her I knew she must have put it some where—I said I insisted on knowing and would send for the police if she did not tell me—she hesitated some time, and said, "If I tell you, will you tell any one else?"—I made no answer to that—she waited two or three seconds, and then said, "It is under the bed"—I looked under the bedstead, but perceived nothing, and said, "You have deceived me, it is not under the bed"—she said, "No, you mistake me, it is under the bed, not under the bedstead; you will find it at the foot of the bed, under the bed"—I then went to the foot of the bed, turned up the quilt and the blanket, I believe, and saw a substance—a large package of something in a brown stuff wrapping, but completely under the bed, so as to be concealed but partially—the brown stuff was not entirely hid from view—no part of the child was to be seen—it was entirely covered—it was only partly under the bed; a very small portion of the bed was over it—I took off the woollen covering, and under that was a linen wrapper; I removed that also, and immediately discovered the head and face of a child—it had entirely covered the head and face—I saw nothing till I removed the second wrapping—the face was uppermost—I do not think the head was under the bed—I saw a gash in the neck of the child—I did not notice any thing else at that time—I asked her, I believe, how she could do such a shocking act—she made no reply—it almost made me shudder to look at it—I did not feel the child, to know whether it was warm—there was no appearance of blood from the wound in the throat—I only unwrapped it as low as the neck, and did not touch, the child at all—I have no doubt it was dead—a policeman was sent for, and came in a quarter of an hour—I remained in the room with the prisoner—I begged the policeman to fetch another, which he did—I then told them to take particular notice of the room, and to go to the bottom of the bed, and see what was there—they brought the child on the table, and uncovered it—I examined it—the limbs were quite flexible, and there was no unna<lb></lb>tural coldness about it—I could not judge how long it had been dead, not having seen a circumstance like it before; but from the time I was called in, and knowing the previous circumstances, I suppose it must have been dead half an hour at least, within or about that period—after the exami<lb></lb>nation, I said to the prisoner, "Now, Jane, you will save these men a great deal of trouble and inconvenience, if you can tell where to find the instrument with which you did it," she said, "It is there under some box or basket," I am not sure which"—I believe she pointed somewhere—they searched, and found a knife—I did not take it into my own hand, but I saw it in the policeman's hands, and said, from the appearance of it, "I think you have wiped the knife since it has been used"—she said, "No, I did not"—there were appearances of blood on it, but not so much as I should have expected—I then left the room—on the Saturday I examined the placenta, and found it healthy and full there was not the smallest portion of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord</hi> attached to it—that did not</p>

               <p>appear to be cut, but to be torn or rent—on the Monday following I examined the body—it appeared in every respect, a healthy, full-grown child—there were five spots on the face, one on the neck, and a bruise at the back of the head—the hands were clenched, and, the tongue visible between the lips—its weight was 2lbs. 7oz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the nature of the spots on the face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three on the left side, one on the right, and one on the lip, which was like a bruise—I apprehend they must have been made by pressure, and probably by the hands or fingers—I thought they might be caused by the grasping of the hand—there was a little spot on the back of the head—the incision about an inch long, like an indentation—I cannot account for that at all, and I do not think it of any consequence—the child falling on the ground would be very likely to account for the bruise at the back of the head—the incision on the throat was an inch and three quarters long—I proceeded to examine that when Mr. Robinson arrived—we made a very minute examination of it, and that could not have caused the death of the child—we could form no opinion whether the child was alive or dead when that wound was given—we minutely examined all the internal parts, and found them perfectly healthy—no disease in the chest, abdomen, or brain—we cut the lungs—they were remarkably small, and weighted an ounce and a quarter—their appearance was purplish—they were quite in the upper part of the chest, the chest in all the other parts being hollow—I perceived this before we proceeded to dis<lb></lb>sect—I then thought, from their appearances, that they had inhaled very little air—my impression was, that they had not inhaled any—we dissected the lungs—I did not perceive any air in the lungs—Mr. Robinson had them in his hand—he separated them from the heart—they were afterwards sub<lb></lb>mitted to the test in water, and floated—we afterwards cut them in several parts, and something like air seemed to escape from them—it was then my opinion that the child had breathed—that is merely from the fact stated by authors, that lungs which will float have inhaled air—I never dissected so young a child before—I merely give my opinion from reading—we dissected the lungs up to the wound in the throat, and were satisfied that that could not have caused death—it was merely a superficial wound—I have attended between 700 and 800 women in their confinement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known instances of children inhaling air, who have breathed and cried, and yet died before they came quite into the word? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly—I have never known a child cry—I have known a case where there was no doubt of its having breathed previous to exclusion—my opinion from the circumstances is, that this child had been perfectly separated from the mother alive—I should attribute its death to violent expulsion from the mother—the bruise on the head, and the probable rapidly wrapping it up in linen, would prevent life continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would die from suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly—I think the appearances of violence on the body, conjointly were not sufficient to account for death, except the bruise—I am not competent to speak of that—we examined the bruise—it was two inches in diameter—all the blood remained settled in the scalp—I cannot say whether the bruise might produce death without producing internal injury to the brain—there was no appearance of injury in the substance of the brain.</p>
               <p>(The witness was then examined at considerable length, and stated his opinion to be, that the prisoner had been delivered in a standing position,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280086"></xptr>
               <p>which had caused the rupture of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord,</hi> which would ac<lb></lb>count for the blow in the head. On his cross-examination, he stated that if the child had fully breathed, the cavity of the chest would have been filled, and instead of being purple, it would have been a bright red—the marks in the face were quite unimportant—a pressure on the nose would have impeded breathing in part—the prisoner might have unintentionally injured the child in attempting to relieve herself—he had heard that the test of the floating in water had been long since exploded—his own ex<lb></lb>perience did not enable him to say that they must sink if they had never breathed, and he considered the test fallacious—the cut in the neck was superficial, it was through the integuments, and about 1-8th of an inch deep—no vessel was injured—supposing the fingers of a hand to be placed on the spots on the face, the flat part of the hand would not cover the mouth—the size, weight, and situation of the lungs were similar to those which had never inhaled.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to assist Mr. Drayton in examining the body of the child—I have heard Mr. Drayton's evidence—mine would be only a repetition—I concur exactly with him regarding the appearances, both external and internal—every thing was apparently such as is always the case in a child born at the full time, both as to weight and length—when I first opened the chest, my impression was similar to Mr. Drayton's, that the lungs had not been fully inflated—I could not form any opinion when I first saw them, whe<lb></lb>ther they had been inflated to any extent—they were a purplish colour—when lungs have been fully inflated, they present a more florid appearance than these—on dissecting them, a few bubbles of air escaped—I afterwards submitted them to the test in water, any they floated—I should say there must have been some air admitted to cause them to float, because the spe<lb></lb>cific gravity of the lungs themselves, if they have never had air admitted, would cause them to sink—that is my judgement in all cases, except where putrefaction has taken place—in the absence of any thing of that sort, it is my opinion that lungs which have not been inflated would sink—the child had never taken a full inspiration.</p>

               <p>being able to account for it—in this case the child might be lost for want of assistance, and it is frequently the case that they are suffocated without any fault of the mothers—I think the bruise on the head quite sufficient to kill it—it must have stunned it, and from its low vitality would probably kill it—that blow might easily have been caused in the delivery—the mark on the neck might possible be caused by the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord</hi> hitching on the head, but I will not say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to Mr. Jeffery's house on Sunday morning, the 20th of November, at six o'clock, to take charge of the prisoner—I remained there till two o'clock, and was then received by another person—I was in the same room with the prisoner—Sarah Whitby was attending on her as nurse—she had been speaking to the prisoner on religious topics, and said she deserved punishment—she said, "I know I deserve punishment"—Mrs. Whitby said she must look up to the Almighty—this was about eleven o'clock—she then left the room for gruel, for five or ten minutes, and, directly she was gone, the prisoner said, "Oh dear, it is a bad job"—I said, "Yes, it is a bad job"—she said, "What was I to do? I concealed it from my mistress all along, I denied it; I went down to get breakfast, and I was taken so ill, I found I was obliged to go up again—I took a knife and went up, and when the child was born, I took it and cut its throat—when I got well enough to go away, I intended to take the child and make away with it, and myself too"—I then asked her what the father was, she told me an omnibus-driver—I asked her if she had got any friends in London—she told me she had got a sister only, but she had got a father and mother about a hundred miles in the country—the nurse then came in—I did not tell her what had passed—my inspector had told me not to put any questions to the prisoner—I thought her quite sensible at the time—she appeared quite aware of what she was doing in talking to me—I was in my police-dress—she knew me to be a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married; I was acting as nurse at Mr. Jeffery's. On Saturday, the 19th of November, I was attending the prisoner, and also on Sunday—I was there while the policeman was in the room with her—I had been prying by her, and told her she must look up to God Almighty—she did not say she deserved punishment—she could not have said so</p>

               <p>while I was in the room—I was not out of it more than two minutes—I consider her to have been in a lost state on Sunday—not sensible—she took no notice of any one, nor asked for any thing—I did not ask her any questions, no more than in prayer—I never named the death of the child to her—I do not remember naming any of the circumstances to her—I considered the child lying there sufficient—I only prayed to the Almighty, and prayed her to do the same—I did not hear her have any conversation with the policeman—I was not down stairs more than two minutes—I was not allowed to stop for what I went for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner appear to you on Saturday or Sunday in an insensible state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so—this cap and this night. gown was in a basket, with some of her clothing, underneath the bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were examined before the Coroner, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she did not say to me that she deserved to be punished—I said be<lb></lb>fore the Coroner that she said on Monday or Tuesday she deserved to be punished—I thought I heard her say so, but it was in prayer—she was en<lb></lb>gaged in prayer on Monday and Tuesday, but she never said it except in prayer—I prayed by her, and read the Bible to her on Sunday afternoon—I told her to repent, and pray for mercy—I told her so first on Saturday, and also repeatedly on Sunday—I do not remember asking her now she came to do it on Saturday—I do not remember saying before the Coroner that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Monday did she tell you that if she had known what she had done, she would not have done it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember it—I do not remember telling her that she had murdered her baby.</p>

               <p>(Mrs. Hammond, of Kentish Town, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There had been a good many dealings between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he never was in my office—he came occasionally on business—our dealings were very trifling, I believe four dozen of small bottles of cayenne, which he borrowed of me—that has been the only transaction in the way of business—there have been other transactions between us as long ago as 1818—it continued till 1838, and from that time I did not see him for more than eighteen months—he has owed me money for a considerable time, and has paid me in bills of exchange at different times—I have not got him to get bills of exchange ac<lb></lb>cepted for me—there have been several bills brought me by him, perhaps eight or ten—he has had goods from me at different times, and money lent, since 1837—when I said the cayenne pepper was the only transaction, I thought you meant a recent transaction—the bills were for a greater amount than he owed me—I do not know what an accommodation bill is—he owed me 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—very likely accepted bills passed between us to the amount of 524<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many bills, to your knowledge, that you promised to provide for, has he been sued on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he has been sued on a single bill that I promised to provide for—I have no recollection of having done so—I may have said, "If this bill becomes due, and you are not provided, I will take the bill up"—I do not know whether I did so—I know a person named Dunnat—he told me he was a hop merchant—I heard he was an certificated bankrupt after I took the first bill—I do not think I took ft second bill after that</p>

               <p>bills as the others—if a person owes me a bill, and brings me another bill, I may take it—I cannot admit that it is an accommodation bill so long as a person owes me money—I do not know what was the amount of the greatest bill the prisoner got accepted for me, nor whether it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was sued on one bill—I do not know that I had promised to provide for it, nor whether he has been sued on more than one—I have no recollection of it.</p>

Thomas Bowen thus deposed: About Ten o' Clock on Monday Night, I was got confounded drunk, and was riding along Drury-Lane, and at the Corner of Russel-street I met the Prisoner and another Woman. How do you do, my Dear? says she; Won't you give us a Pint? With all my Heart, says I; and so we went to the <placeName id="t17250513-54-crimeloc265">Half-Moon Tavern</placeName>

I hung my Horse at the Door, went up Stairs with them, and call'd for a Bottle of Wine We sat down together, the Prisoner on my Right Hand, and the other Woman on the Left. They began to talk about Country Affairs; I told them I came out of Essex, and they pretended to be well acquainted that way, and grew very familiar with me. The Prisoner thrust her Hand into my Breeches, and the other Woman unbutton'd my Cloaths; and then I began to think that I was got into ill Company, and so I got up and felt for my Money, but could not find it. I charged them with it; but they deny'd it. However, they gave me good Words; but I not being satisfy'd with that, they quickly came to bad ones. But at last, to make me easy, they said they'd help me to my Money again, if I'd pay the Reckoning, and give them the odd Guinea. I offer'd them a Crown, and they agreed to it, upon Condition that I would take my Money again without telling it over; and so I did, and then went away together to a Gin-Shop in Newtoner's-Lane; and when we came there, the Prisoner bade me look upon my Money, and see if it was right. So I took it out of my Pocket to tell it, and she dash'd it all out of my Hand, and then they pick'd it up betwixt 'em, and swore I should never have any of it again. I made a great Uproar, and sent for a Constables. The other Woman ran away, but I secured the Prisoner; and upon Search, we found six of the seven Guineas in a Pail in the Yard. The Prisoner thus made her Defence: I accidentally went to light a Candle at the Gin-Shop, and there the Prosecutor was quarrelling with a Woman. The Woman got away, and thereupon he charged me with being concerned with her. The Jury <rs id="t17250513-54-verdict266" type="verdictDescription">

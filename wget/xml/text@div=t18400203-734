                  </hi>. I live in Golden-grove, Old Brompton. I was at the George public-house, on the 2nd of February, with three or four others, and we were about making a bet of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I placed on the table one crown and two half-crowns—while I was making the bet the landlord came in, and said he would not allow the bet to be made—the prisoner took up the money and went out—I went as far as the Admiral Keppel public-house, and could not find her—I heard where she lived, and went to her house and waited till she came home, very tipsy, with another woman—the policeman who was with me found 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence in one hand, and a crown and half-crown and two more halfpence in the other.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 186.) I went to the prisoner's house at eleven o'clock that night, and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner—but while I was on duty in Cottage-street, I heard the prisoner say to the other woman, "You say I can't get enough to support myself; but I have got some now"—I then went round my beat, and came down opposite the cottages where the prisoner was living—the prosecutor was near the door—he said to her, "You are the person I want; you robbed me of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I shall give you into custody"—I found 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her right hand, and a five-shilling piece, a half-crown, and two halfpence in the other hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the public-house—I saw the money put down, the landlord came in, and said he would not allow a bet, it being Sunday evening—the prisoner came round, and took the money off the table and went out with it—she was not drinking with the prosecutor—we thought she only took it in a joke.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have known the prosecutor fourteen years—as he went in he said, "How do you do, <hi rend="italic">Poll?"</hi>—I said "<hi rend="italic">Tim</hi>, how are you?"—we sat there some time—three coalheavers came in—one of them said, "I will bet you three sovereigns that I have the sharpest dog;" and</p>

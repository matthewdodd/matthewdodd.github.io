On 23d Dec. the prisoner called at Mr. Balcock's beer shop window, and told me he had got 200lbs. of lead if I should like to have it; I said I should, and communicated directly with Benton—about 8 o'clock next morning the prisoner came alone, and said, "Will you lend me a bag?" I did so; and in about ten minutes he came with 46lbs. of lead, for which I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and he was to bring me the rest in the afternoon; but before that he was given into custody by his master, on suspicion of stealing a coat—the prisoner told me, on the Saturday after he was remanded, that the lead came from the oil mills, that he did not take it, but Ward got up and took it and he was below—he told me where the remainder was, and I accompanied the sergeant, but could not find it.</p>

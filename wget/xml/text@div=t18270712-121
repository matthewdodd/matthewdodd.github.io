               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor about half-past nine o'clock - she asked me to go and have something to drink. I took him to the Half-moon, public-house, and had three glasses of rum; he said, "Take my watch and wind it up." I said, I did not like; he then took it from his fob, and put it into my hand; he and this witness came out with me. I had my shawl taken off my shoulders and was knocked down - the prosecutor was tipsy.</p>

               <p>Court. This is no evidence at all, a copy of the register is the proper proof. It is common to get half a crown of people, and give them a certificate; what is that? It is no more than a ballad. People have lost their estates this way.</p>

             was my niece. I was present at her marriage to the prisoner at the bar, at Clerkenwell church, on the first of May last.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>M. Price. She is about twenty years of age.</p>

               <p>M. Price. To the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he call himself?</p>
               <p>M. Price. He said he was a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she any other relations?</p>
               <p>M. Price. Her father and mother are dead. She has some relations I think in Brecknockshire, but none of any signification.</p>

               <p>Parker. No. His health failed him very much. He complained the duty of a corporal was too hard for him, and desired to be a private man. He behaved very well. As to the fact he is charged with I know nothing of it.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since the second of February, 1749-50. I enter'd him on that day, and he continued in the company a year as a private man. He behaved so well, that it was thought proper to make him a corporal. I never knew him to commit any irregularity. His behaviour was with sobriety and decency. He is in another company now.</p>

On the 14th of November last I went on guard, and returned on the 15th; I left two shirts and a pair of stockings in my knapsack, on the 16th; in the morning I went to my knapsack, and one of my shirts was gone. I went down and told the landlord of it; the landlord told me the prisoner had absconded, and taken away a great deal of property belonging to the men he slept with.</p>

            . I live in Parsons-street, Ratcliffe Highway. The prisoner lodged at my house five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner speak English - A. Very little. I can speak Russia to him. The prisoner met me about the India House, he asked me if I knew any Russian officers; I said, no; he said he had lost his master. I shewed him where I lived on Monday; I told him to call on me, I might get him a situation. On Tuesday he brought the bundle to my house, and left it in the room, where three young men slept; I thought of getting him a ship; he was taken up, and taken to the Compter. I went to the Compter and asked him what he had done, he said he had bought a soldiers shirt, and gave three shillings for it. This is the shirt. I brought this bundle down when the officer came, and the soldier claimed the shirt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

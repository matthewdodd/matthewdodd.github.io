               <p>"You are afraid to strike me." Huke said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want to fight me in earnest? I know you, and you may be as good a man as your father for what I know." He put his hand against the prisoner's breast, gently, merely to push him off - the prisoner directly drew his right-hand from behind his coat, and struck him on his left side. As he drew his hand back I saw he had the blade of a knife. Before I could catch hold of him Huke cried out,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have rued me!" then ran at him, and both fell - as Huke fell, I saw blood come from his breast. The prisoner made three or four more stabs with the knife. I caught hold of Huke, and lifted him up - the prisoner got up, and asked me why I interfered? I said he must be a villian to use a weapon, and secured him with this knife in his hand - (looking at it) - he broke the point with the first blow. I could see the steel was fresh broken against something; I told him of it, and the prisoner said he knew the point broke at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARABIN. Q. Whether they quarrelled before or not you cannot tell - A. No.</p>

            . I am a headborough. The prisoner was given into my charge. I produce Huke's clothes - we cannot find him anywhere. - (The witness here produced Huke's shirt, which was exceeding bloody at the left breast.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Huke and me were always playmates and friends. We were going to bathe that afternoon; we fell out about a pot of beer - he came and struck me twice. I had the knife in my hand, eating bread and cheese. He rushed upon me; whether I cut him or not I do not know, but I said,</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid I have cut you" - he said</p>

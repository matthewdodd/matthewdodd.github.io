                  </hi>. I am principal ledger keeper to Peek Brothers, and am trustee of the defendants' estate—Arthur Charles Morris had been to Sir Henry Peek, and a deed of assignment had been made—a private meeting of creditors was called on 9th October, of which I was chairman—several other large creditors were there—both the defendants were present—I had been through the books and had discovered that there was a con<lb></lb>siderable deficiency, which they were asked to explain, and Charles referred</p>

               <p>to Henry, who was the book-keeper—Henry used to stay in London and Charles travelled—Henry said that he had been unfortunate, and had made losses and bad debts—he was then asked to leave the room, and Charles was asked to give an account—he said that his brother could explain it better than he could, but he knew they had been unfortunate and had made bad debts—he said nothing about speculations—I then said "Have you speculated on the Stock Exchange or the Turf?"—he said "Not on the Stock Exchange"—I said "Can you tell me what your loss has been, or do you keep a betting-book?"—he said "No"—I pressed him as to the amount he had lost, but he said he did not know—I suggested various things to him, and at last he said 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover his losses—he said, but I will not be certain whether it was at that meeting, that he had been betting for some time—on Henry afterwards coming in he was asked as to the de<lb></lb>ficiency—he handed these two sheets of paper to me, which is a balance-sheet of the state of their affairs from 1870 up to 1st January, 1879—this shows on 31st December, 1870, a loss to Charles Morris of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a similar loss to Henry—in 1871 there is a profit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—on 1st January, 1877, their balance was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the wrong side on each side; in consequence they paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they made a profit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but their drawings were 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Charles and 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Henry—in 1872 there is a loss of 523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; they then put in 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more capital, coming from relatives and sisters—in 1873 there is a loss of 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, or 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1874 a profit of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1875 a profit of 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1876 a profit of 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1877 a profit of 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in 1878 a profit of 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; and taking the balance on 1st January, 1879, Charles Morris owed the firm 3,368<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Henry 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—up to that meeting bankruptcy had not been contemplated, but it was decided upon when it came out about the betting—a petition was then presented and adjudicated, and I was appointed trustee—my attention has been called to the bad debts; in 1870 they amounted to 2,274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. net losses; in 1871, 491<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1872, 938<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1873,212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1874, 311<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1875, 543<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1876, 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1877, 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1878, 483<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1879, 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; total, 6,095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is taken out from their books—they owe Peek Brothers 5,938<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they purchased from us between 14th June and 14th October, 1879, goods amounting to 3,190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; between 14th June and 14th October they also purchased of Saunders and Worthing<lb></lb>ton goods amounting to 268. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and of Twinings, 333<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; of Steinberg, 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19. 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of Moffatt and Co., 913<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and of Edwards and Son, 387<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; none of those goods within those periods have been paid for—I have realised out of the estate about 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to this time, and am afraid there is very little more to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Their trading with Sir Henry Peek since they have been in business amounts to about 237,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amounts they purchased between June and September are about the same as in previous years—they paid us 5,003<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between June and October, 1879, but that includes a sum of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which ought not to be included, we having lent them 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th August, as they could not meet a bill of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the first time they had come to us for assistance as far as I remember—we sold them about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods after that—Henry Morris used to come to see the samples, Charles used to travel; he lived principally at Stockton-on-Tees—the average drawings of Henry from 1871 to the time of their stoppage was about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and Charles about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Worthing</p>

Morris is a relative, either a sister or an aunt—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was borrowed of her in May, 1867.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If they had not been regular in the payments which fell due they would not have received any goods—the payments were in respect of goods which had been purchased prior to 16th June, but which fell due during that period, and had they not been met the credit would have ceased—their drawings always exceeded their profits—the stock-in-trade in Great Tower Street was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the unencumbered warrants which they could deal with were, coffee 192<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and tea 291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were other warrants which were given to Brown, Janson, and Co., to cover discounts, but Brown, Janson, and Co. have nothing to return to the estate; they made a loss—if they had stopped at any year from 1870 to 1879, they would not have been solvent according to this paper, but at some periods their debts would have been much larger; fluctuations in the price of goods must be allowed for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and live at Woolwich—on the 4th of February I was on London Bridge in a recess—the Rifle corps was going along—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, and the chain was round my neck—when the Rifle corps came I am sure I had my watch in my pocket—while they were passing the prisoner came and stood close to my right side—I had my wife on my left side, and two friends were near me—the prisoner stood with his face towards my face, he was looking right in my face—I heard a click—I put my hand to my pocket and my watch was gone—I said to my wife, "My watch is gone"—as soon as I heard the click the prisoner ran across the bridge—when I spoke to my wife he was not a yard away from me—I said to my wife, "Mistress, that man has got my watch"—as soon as he darted off I followed him as far as I could—a captain or officer connected with the Rifle corps stopped me, and we had a little 1 bit of a scuffle—this happened on the 4th of February, and I was at the Mansion-house on the 13th and saw the prisoner—I am quite positive he is the man—my watch was worth six guineas.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are on your solemn oath, and there can be no mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am not mistaken—this is the first time I have been in such a situation as this—I know a good many people—It is possible I may have mistaken somebody for a person I knew, but I am not mistaken in the prisoner at the bar—we are all liable to make a mistake—it may have been the case that I have taken an entire stranger for a person I knew, but I am still positive the prisoner is the man whom I saw on the 4th—he was looking at me—I turned my head round and he was very busy at my watch—I never felt a pull at my guard—he was looking in my face the time I turned my head round; he had his side face towards the Rifles—I can't say that I saw him take the watch out of my pocket—when I turned my eye his hand was about my waistcoat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was on London bridge with my husband, arm in arm with him—I did not notice any one standing near my husband—I was linked arm and arm with my husband, and I saw there was a pressure of people coming; I said to my husband "Be careful, look to your watch"—I turned to speak to the witness and directly my husband said "O that thief has got my watch"—I then saw the prisoner—I am quite positive I saw him pass through the Rifle corps.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When your attention was first called to him was he not running away <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was standing still—of course I felt flurried and ran after the man—it was when my husband said" That thief has got my watch" that my attention was first called to the prisoner—when my husband said that the prisoner was not close to him—the prisoner was between me and the kerb of London-bridge—I dare say at one time he was within grasp of my husband—when my husband said "That thief has got my watch" the prisoner was nearer to my husband than he was to myself—he was about a yard-and-a-half from me—I was on the other side of my husband—he was on the right side of my husband and I was on his left—he was opposite to me and he was going off away from me—after he ran away his back was towards me, but not when first I saw him nor for a second or two—he did not make a direct run, he walked first—his side face was towards me—I observed his face—his scarf is exactly the same that he had on then but his coat was not buttoned over—I cannot swear whether it is the same coat, but it had a velvet collar—it is very possible it was the same coat—I would not swear whether it is or is not—he had a cap on his head—he had no whiskers—his hair was much the same as it is now—I never saw him before—I saw him nine days afterwards; I saw him first come out of the prison-van—I was just in time to get to the Mansion-house as he got out—I went there to identify him, but I had no thought of seeing him in the van—he was shewn to my husband at the cell—I followed my husband and went on to the cell with him—and I saw the prisoner come out—my husband was not with me when I saw the prisoner get out of the van—I think my husband was with one or two detectives—I did not call his attention to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cookson, and live in Ore at James-street, Lisson-grove. On Wednesday, the 16th of Nov., my little boy 'called me into the shop—I had teen these things safe not more than ten minutes before—I had pinned the waistcoat on a line—when I came into the shop I saw the prisoner—he asked me for a halfpenny worth of needles—I served him, and as soon as he was gone I found this jacket on the floor, I then missed the waistcoat and gloves—I am quite certain he is the person—this is my waistcoat.</p>

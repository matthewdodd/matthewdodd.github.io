            . I live in Crispin-street, Spital-fields. On the 6th of June, at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was coming down <placeName id="t18220703-19-crimeloc99">Artillery-lane</placeName>

I passed them a short distance; they came after me when I had got about two yards, and surrounded me. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"Don't touch him, he is a cooper." I did not know him. They pushed me about, and I received a blow from the fist of one of them, which knocked me down; my hat came off in the fall. I got up; four or five others came up and shoved me about, and struck me several times. The head-borough came up and took the prisoner. Four or five men came up; they said nothing; I do not know that any of them took the hat; my pockets were not touched; they said nothing about any money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The four or five men were boys - A. Some were rather bigger than the prisoner. I was rather in liquor; I did not run against the prisoner to my knowledge; I pulled my jacket off to fight them.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten minutes past ten o'clock I saw three desperate characters standing about; I saw this man come by; some few words ensued; I saw him pass through them; he turned back again, and the prisoner struck him behind the head; there was a scuffle.</p>

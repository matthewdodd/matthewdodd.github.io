                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Northolt. The prisoner was my horse keeper for six or eight months—I discharged him about 13th Sept. twelve months—on Saturday, 7th Nov., I had a hay stack, a bean stack, an oat stack, and a small stack of tares, within 100 yards of my house, and about a quarter, to 10 o'clock that night the prisoner gave an alarm—I rushed out, and found him in front of my house, in the garden; he said, "Mr. Gurney, Mr. Gurney, your ricks are all on fire!"—he was rather excited, and out of breath, as if he had been running—I went to my rick yard, and discovered a small fire at the corner of a hay rick—four or five of my neighbours, and some working men, were there—the prisoner went down the yard just before me—he lived with his father, within a slight distance of my house—it is a plain road from my rick yard to his father's cottage, which adjoins the same road—the fire was extinguished after a short time—next morning I saw some footmarks of the previous night, which I traced from the rick yard, through some hurdles, into a meadow, and over a stile, to within ten feet of Buckland's cottage, both there and back—no one had a right to go across the fields in that direction—I had a stack on fire once before.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policemen</hi>). I reside at Northolt, adjoining the pri<lb></lb>soner's house—I was at home, and heard the prisoner call out, "Moore, fire, fire!"—I came out, but could not discover any fire till I got to the rick yard—it was then just reaching the thatch—I helped to put it out—next morning, Sunday, about 11 o'clock, I traced footmarks from the rick yard, ten or twelve yards from the corner of the rick to three yards and a half from the prisoner's house; they were quite fresh and distinct—on Monday, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to my gate, and asked me if I wanted to see his shoes—I said, "Yes"—he showed them to me, and I told him that they corresponded with the track—I did not take them from him, but I saw that there was one large nail in the centre of the heel of the left shoe—he said that he had been into Mr. Gurney's rick yard, and returned the same way—it is about 130 yards from his house to the rick yard, the back way.</p>

I was in a gig with Mr. Gurney, and met the prisoner on the road—Mr. Gurney asked him how it was that he did not give an alarm to Rush at the cottage—he said that he did not; he went back, and the first person that he alarmed was Moore—Rush's cottage is at the end of the rick yard, forty-four yards from the rick—Rush is in Mr. Gurney's employ—it is 393 yards from the corner of the rick which was on fire to the prosecutor's gate, going round by the road, and eighty-three yards from the rick to the prosecutor's front garden gate, which is twenty-two yards from his front door—the prisoner said that he was standing by a boiler in the yard, at the back of his own cottage, at the time he saw the fire; that is 140 yards from the comer of the rick—I have placed myself in that situation, and I do not think it possible that he could see the fire from there, unless his attention was called to it; but if it was, he might.</p>

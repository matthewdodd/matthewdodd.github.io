               <p>Q. Did you see that shilling again before you saw the prisoner again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - When the constable brought them in, about a quarter of an hour after, and the constable asked me if there had been such a person in my shop, and I could not immediately recollect, till I saw the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when they were brought into the shop? - The constable asked me if they had been in the shop? I said, the tall one had, and they asked me if they had left any bad money? My master looked into the till, and picked out this shilling I had taken of them, and said it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to that shilling, as the one that was given to you by the prisoner? - Yes, I can.</p>

               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that that woman came into your shop and purchased some tea and sugar. What did she give you for it? - Three-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. She gave you a shilling, you gave her change, and that shilling you put in the till. How many more were in the till? - Ten or a dozen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine all these shillings? - No, my master took up a handful of shillings and took this one out.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know that was the shilling you had taken of this woman? - No, but I knew it by the cross on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine all the other shillings? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know but what some of the others might have the same mark? - Yes, they might, I did not examine them. I see no necessity for that as I could swear to her giving me that one.</p>
               <p>Q. It does not seem a mark sufficient to swear to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 18, Albion Street, Leeds—I was appointed receiver of Messrs. Glave's estate on 20th April, 1875—I sent my clerk, Senior, the list produced which I made out from the books of the firm—I asked the prisoner to account for the monies referred to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170196"></xptr>
               <p>in that list and in a letter from my clerk—he said "It is being paid away to private creditors"—I asked him to whom—he said "That I will account for presently," or words to that effect—this conversation occurred four or five days before the meeting of creditors—the first meeting was on 7th May 1875—the prisoner never gave me any particulars—at the meeting he was asked and in my hearing he explained to the effect that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid to his wife and some money to Mr. Morton and to Mr. Perry—my duties ceased on 7th May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not tell me he had paid small trades. men—the business was carried on at Leeds, and in London—the mill was at Leeds—I do not know anything about the mill not paying—the assets were valued by the servants of the firm at the market price of the day—I believe the assets were about 18,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the liabilities 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. leaving about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency—there was also a stock in London; I do not know what that re<lb></lb>alized—it was valued by the servants of the firm under cost price—the deficiency was about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I cannot say if there would be a profit by reasonable trading if it could have gone on.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a clerk to Mr. Burrow, afterwards was ap<lb></lb>pointed receiver—I saw the prisoner and took possession of the warehouse and the goods, and the books that were there—J received also a list of which this is a copy from Mr. Burrow; I shewed it to the prisoner and asked him to give an explanation, he took the list and said he would do so—the total of the sums received is 369<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; this interview would be about the 29th April—I asked him for an explanation twice—he. said he had written to Leeds about it; that was his only explanation—I left before the meeting of creditors, when he said he had written to Leeds, I understood him to mean to Mr. Burrows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant at Leeds—I was appointed trustee of the estate of Bennett and Glave under the liquidation, on the 7th of May—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the disposition of the cheques produced—I was at the meeting of creditors on the 7th of May, and heard the prisoner say he had paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his wife, and something to Mr. Perry, and Mr. Morton, per George Lee—a dividend of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been declared—the assets that came into my hands were nearly 17.,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the proofs of debts are over 32,000.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no interest in the prisoner except as trustee—this prosecution was sanctioned by the committee of inspection—some portion of the assets realised under the estate, went to pay off preferential creditors whose securities did not realise the amount—those assets were for the most part at Leeds.</p>

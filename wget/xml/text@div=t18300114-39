            , packed it up, and sent it away; no other person came to the house but the porter to fetch it - it was tied up; the prisoner never came to our house he never came near the place; I do not know what the parcels contained - I never looked into it; I did not see it open - I do not know that Wood was a friend of the prisoner's; I do not recollect seeing a person named Francis Hodgkins - there was a man came for the box; I do not know whether I have always given the same account of this - I was very much flurried when at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Have you always stated that you do not know who left it? A. I cannot tell what I said, I was taken in such a flurry; there was only one examination - I do not know the prisoner as a neighbour, but he has been at our place; I do not know what was in the parcel - it was tied up as a bed; I do not know what was in it- I never opened it; it was opened at Bow-street, and contained the gloves - Davies did not claim that parcel at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you able to come here last Session? A. No - I have since then had a child.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You made your mark to an examination? A. Yes; I cannot remember whether it was read over to me - I think it was; I have no doubt about it - (Deposition read.)</p>
               <p>I am the wife of George Kenny; a large parcel was left at our house, to be kept by a man I do not know - the prisoner Davies made the request for it to be left; the prisoner Davies opened the packet.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that true? A. I really do not know what I did say; I was not at home when it was left.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS MORRIS. I am an assistant Police-officer. In consequence of information I watched the residence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140035"></xptr>of the prisoner in Belton-street, Long-acre; I saw a packing-case brought to the door of a carpenter's shop by the prisoner - he put it on the porter's shoulder, who took it to the dwelling-house of this witness; the prisoner went by the shop, returned, and went into it - the same porter brought it out, and got a bricklayer's labourer to help him up with it; I followed the porter down to Glasgow-wharf, East Smithfield - he left it then, and came out with a paper in his hand; I went to Bow-street, and told Ruthven - we went together to the wharf, and I pointed out the box to Ruthven; this is it.</p>

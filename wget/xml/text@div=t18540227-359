                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Westenholz Brothers, merchants, of No. 26, Mark-lane. It is my business to open the bill box door every morning and afternoon; I generally open it about 10 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and again about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and take out any bills I find there, put them together straight, and either put them into the safe, or give them to one of the clerks—there is a door to the box on the inside, with a lock and key to it; and outside there is a brass plate with "Bills for acceptance" engraved on it—the key is kept on a hook in the office, and the box is always kept locked—on Monday, 6th Feb., I went to the box as usual, but I am not aware whether there was anything in it that morning—on the afternoon of that day two gentlemen came; I did not see them come, but I came into the office shortly after 1 o'clock, and they were there then; it might be 5 or 10 minutes past 1 o'clock—they were in the inner office, the partners' room when I went in, and there was a man, who I suppose was with them, sitting in the outer office—I did not take sufficient notice of him to be able to recognise him again—shortly after<lb></lb>wards one of the gentlemen told the man to go down stairs and pay for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which they had come in—he went out of the office, and I went out at the same time, and saw him speak to the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>—I did not see him go up again, as I went as far as Tower-hill—I came back again in five or six minutes, and the same man was standing on the landing outside the office door—I did not see him go into the office again—I do not remember how long the two gentlemen remained—I opened the bill box about half past 4 o'clock, and found a large quantity of bills, but this bill produced was not among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in Messrs. Westenholz's office. On Monday, 6th Feb., shortly after 1 o'clock, I went out of the office, and met two foreign gentlemen on the staircase, followed by the prisoner, who was with them—they asked me for Mr. Westenholz's, and I showed them into Mr. Westenholz's room, and asked the prisoner to go into the clerks' office and take a seat; he declined at first, but I told him it might be a long time before the gentlemen came out again, and opened the door, gave him a chair and made him sit down—I then went out, and returned in about half an hour afterwards, when the prisoner was standing outside on the landing, a little distance from the door—I said nothing to him—the next time I saw him was on the following Thursday, the 9th, outside the Mansion-house—I asked him if he knew me again; and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270014"></xptr>
               <p>after some hesitation he said, "No"—I then asked him if he did not accompany two foreign gentlemen to the City last Monday, but did not mention any house; he said, "Yes, to Mincing-lane;" I said, "No, to Mark-lane," and he said, "Yes, to Mark-lane"—I then asked him if he did not meet me on the stairs; he said, "Oh, yes, and you showed me into the room, and told me to take a seat"—it was Mr. Ogilvy's duty to open the bill-box twice a day; the slit on the outside measures about eight inches by an inch and a half—I have once or twice taken letters out through the slit; not by using any instrument, but the letters were very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a native of Germany, but a naturalized Englishman by Act of Parliament—I quite understand English—I am a commission agent, of 33, Seckeford-street, Clerkenwell—I was a publican in Clerkenwell for fifteen years in one house, and for six or seven years I have carried on a commission business—I have known the prisoner eighteen months or two years; when I first knew him he kept a chandler's shop, but latterly he was at the Royal Hotel, Blackfriars-bridge, as night porter; he was there within these two months to my recollection. On Wednesday, 8th Feb., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I believe, he came to my house, and said he wanted to speak to me—I asked him if it was anything particular; he said, "Yes"—I said, "I will fetch my hat, and we will go to a public house "—I went with him to the Anchor, in St. John-street—when we got there, he said his master had discharged him; I said, "Why?" he said he was accused of not doing any work that night; that must have been Tuesday night, the last night—he said, "I have spoken to the porters about it; my master is very hasty, but I dare say it will be all right again"—he then said that two Danish gentlemen who he had been cleaning clothes for, and who had come from Denmark on diplomatic service, and who had fourteen or fifteen pairs of boots, ten or twelve coats, and so on, asked him what he would charge if he went out with them, and cleaned the boots, and brushed the clothes; and that he said he would consider about it, and let them know; and that he was to go out with them as interpreter and show them the town—he then said, "I think I can buy a bill very cheap;" I said, "What bill?" he said, "I think it is a bill of the Bank of England"—I told him that there were a great many different bills of the Bank of England, and if I could see the bill I could tell him what it was—I asked him if he had got it; he said, "No, but he could buy it for a few shillings"—I said I wished I could see it; "Well,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270015"></xptr>
               <p>he said, "I tell you now, I have got it," and produced it to me; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it of a bricklayer—I asked him whether he knew the bricklayer; he said, "Yes"—I asked him where the bricklayer found it; he said, "At the Post-office"—I told him that it was a very strange place to find a bill like that—he asked me whether I thought I could negotiate the bill; I said, "I should advise you to take it to the Bank of England, you can take it yourself; or I will go with you if you wish me, and by so doing I have no doubt but that they will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and I said, "Honesty is the best policy," and told him that as his character was very black in London previously, it might be a great advantage to him in future if he took it to the Bank of England; that it would be a benefit to him—I spoke it in a friendly way, friendly advice—he said, "No, I will go down to White-chapel to the Minories, and see if I cannot negotiate it among the Jews"—I said nothing more; but in a minute or two I asked for the bill again, he gave it to me, and I noticed it particularly, so that I knew where to apply to; I then gave it back to him, and we made an appointment for the next day to meet me at my house, 33, Seckeford-street, to go to Mr. Saunders, a house agent in New Oxford-street; he then left, and I went to Smithfield, got a Directory, found out where Messrs. Westenholz lived, and went to 26, Mark-lane, where I saw one of the partners—on the following day I spoke to Spittle, the officer—next day, Thursday, the 9th, the prisoner came to my house, about 10 o'clock, I believe it was; I then went with him to Mr. Saunders; on the way there, I told him I thought I could get it discounted at Messrs. Reid's brewery, in Liquorpond street—he said, "Whatever you get, I will give you half"—I asked him for the bill; he said he had not got it with him, he had it at home and would fetch it; I said, "Very well, I will wait for you at Reid's tap, at the brewery;" there are two taps there, one for the draymen and the other for the clerks—he left me in Holborn, at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane—I met him at Reid's tap, three quarters of an hour afterwards—he said, "l am very hungry, I want some luncheon;" he had some bread and cheese and a glass of stout, and after that he gave me the bill; and said, "Now you can get it"—I said, "What name? you must endorse the bill when it is paid;" he said, "I will not put my own name"—he told me he gave the bricklayer 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I said it was very cheap—he said that anything I got for it he would give me half—he gave me the bill in the tap; I took it into the counting house, and gave it to Spittle, the officer, who was there by previous arrangement with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). In consequence of information I received, I communicated with Mr. Bewille—I received instructions from the autho<lb></lb>rities of the Bank of England the day previously, the 8th—I went by arrangement to Reid's brewery, in Liquorpond-street, on the 9th—Mr; Bewille brought the bill to me, and afterwards the prisoner—this is the bill—I showed it to the prisoner, and said, "Does this bill belong to you?"—he said, "Yes"—he did not then know that I was an officer—I said, "Did you send it to the brewery by this gentleman?" meaning Mr. Bewille, who was present—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what he wished to have done with it—he said he wished it to be discounted—I said, "It will be neces<lb></lb>sary to make some inquiries about it; where did you get it I"—he said, "I got it of a man named Goldsmid, a slipper manufacturer, of No. 10, Goulstone-street, Whitechapel"—I asked him when he got it—he said, "Last Tuesday "—I then said, "We will go to Goldsmid "—he said, "I have not time; I have an appointment at 1 o'clock; I will call at the brewery again"—the prisoner and I left the brewery, and went together to the City—on our way there I said to him, "What did you give for the bill?"—he said, "51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I am to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount"—before that I asked him, "What is your name?"—he said, "John Valentine Raemer"—I said, "Where do you live?—he said, "No. 36, Turnimill-street"—he did not say where Turnmill-street was—I afterwards took him to the Bank of England, and the authorities directed me to charge him with stealing the bill—I took him to the station and searched him, and found on him six sovereigns and sixpence-halfpenny, a gold chain, a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, and a memorandum book—I have made inquiries at No. 10, Goulstone-street; I did not find any person named Goldsmid there—I afterwards told the prisoner that no such person lived at either No. 10 (there are two Nos. 10), and he said, "I never went to Goldsmid's house, but he told me he lived there."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you first saw the prisoner, Bewille was there, was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was; he was present when the prisoner talked of the bill having been sold to him by Goldsmith—the Bank of England is about a mile and a quarter from Reid's brewery—there are two Nos. 10 in Goulstone-street; I inquired at both—there are witnesses here from each house—I took a note in writing of the place where he said he lived; I have it in my book—I am sure he said Turnmill-street; it was not any court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the society for the relief of small debtors—the Earl of Romney is one of the trustees—on 28th June the prisoner Sainsbury presented this petition to the society—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th June, and signed "B. S. Sainsbury" stating that he was an estate agent, at</hi> 186, <hi rend="italic">Walworth Road, was married, and had one child, under sixteen, that he was a prisoner in Whitecross Street, at the suit of Robert Woods, in formd pauperis, requesting a donation of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and giving references. The petition in bankruptcy was also put in, in which Sainsbury stated that he was imprisoned at the suit of Robert Wood, for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">money lent, judgment recovered in the Queen's Bench; and in the accounts appeared "Robert Woods, of Kent Street, Borough</hi>, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for money lent, has sued me in the Queen's Bench</hi>")—I gave Sainabury a copy of the rules for petitioning the society, perhaps a fortnight before his petition came in—he was then summoned to be examined before the governors, on 6th July—he attended—the Earl of Romney was in the chair, and other governors were present—I heard Sainsbury asked certain questions, and made these notes on the very day—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Have you been imprisoned for debt, and gone through the Court of Bankruptcy, <hi rend="italic">in formd pauperis?</hi> I have. What is the name of your detaining creditor? Robert Woods. What address? Kent Street, Borough. What was the debt for? Balance of money lent. What Court were the proceedings taken in?

Mr. Doyle, the society's solicitor, than said 'Now, mind how you answer; were you not really and truly arrested at the suit of Henry Banks, under process of the Lord Mayor's Court, imprisoned on the 8th, and dis<lb></lb>charged by Banks on 11th December last?" 'No' A governor then said 'Who prepared your petition to this society? 'I, myself.' 'And the copy of your petition?' 'Myself, too' Mr. Doyle, for the last time, cautioned</p>

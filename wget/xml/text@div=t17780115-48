               <p>On Sunday evening last, at about seven o'clock at night, as I was returning home from my brother-in-law's in <placeName id="t17780115-48-crimeloc262">Wheeler's-street, Spittlefields</placeName>

Smith crossed first; he came behind me and took hold of my cloak; I struggled with him; however<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150033"></xptr> he got it from me; his face was sooty, and I thought him a chimney-sweeper. That is the prisoner Smith; it was a very light night, and besides there were two lamps near the place where I was robbed; there had been a fall of snow, which lying upon the ground, made it very light; he ran from me as soon as he had got my cloak, and the others likewise ran away. I immediately cried out, stop thieves; upon which a number of people came up, and before my brother came, they had brought him back; the cloak was brought to me. The other two were close by me at the time Smith catched hold of my cloak; all of them came together to me, and all ran away together. When I was before the Justice I charged Smith;

               <p>I keep a chandler's shop in Wheeler-street. I am brother-in-law to the prosecutrix; my sister drank tea with me last Sunday; soon after she left my house, I heard her cry out stop thief; I went to the door; there were two people there; one ran one way, the other another; I took hold of Smith, upon which Godfrey came up and said, you have no business with him, you are not an officer, and he said, Smith was not the man. I replied, if you say he is not the man, you must know something about the robbery. I secured them both; my sister came up and charged them with this robbery; he was in a lock-up house, which either is part of Justice Wilmot's house, or else adjoins to it: my sister charged Smith before Mr. Wilmot. Godfrey said in Smith's presence, that he had been with Smith that night at the White Horse in Wheeler-street, and from thence to the White Hart in Webb's-square; and that Smith came back again into Wheeler's-street and crossed over, and robbed my sister.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to a chimney that was on fire. I could not get up it myself; I ran to fetch another person to it, and I was taken up.</p>
               <p>GODFREY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Godfrey called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

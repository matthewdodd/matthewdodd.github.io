On the 3rd of July I was at home, between eight and nine o'clock at night; my father put four sovereigns and 10s. into a cupboard - I took them out, and put 10s. into my right hand, and four sovereigns into my left; I wanted to look at the sovereigns as a piece of curiosity, it being dark - I took them to the back of the house to look at them; the prisoners were play-fellows of mine - they were near the door; my little brother seeing the sovereigns began to jump for joy, and said, "My brother has got a load of sovereigns;" Dixon then came, and looked over my right shoulder - I got into the passage, and left the street door open - fearing he might take the sovereigns out of a lark, I closed my hand, as he said they were Queen's metal - he then laid hold of my hand, forced two out, and tried to get away; my other brother collared him - Lilley (who was with me and saw him do it) tried to rescue him; I called for help, and Scott came- when Lilley found there were three of us he ran away, and we forced Dixon into the room; some more boys went and brought Lilley back - I sent for the Policeman; I have not found the sovereigns - Dixon swore he never had them, but when I first laid hold of him he said he had dropped them - while my brother and some boys were gone for the Policeman I heard the door locked, and looked about where the bustle was, but could not find them; the other boys came in when Lilley was brought, but they did not go so far as where he said he had dropped them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were not these boys altogether in the passage, scrambling? A. No, none of them were on the ground; nobody but Scott went near the ground during the whole time - Scott was the only one who came in; the others stopped at the door when they brought Lilley back - I never had a sovereign in my hand before; the cupboard was not locked - my father did not accuse me of taking them; there are cracks in the floor, but they are filled up with dust and not wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080087"></xptr>enough for a sovereign to go through - I have tried to put a farthing through; the boards have not been taken up.</p>

            . I was standing at Daley's street door, and saw Peter Daley go to the staircase window; his little brother danced about the passage, and said his brother had got some sovereigns; the prisoners were playing about the door, and heard it - Dixon went into the passage, and looked over Daley's shoulder; I did not see him take the sovereigns as I was at the door - there was a scuffle between them; Daley hallooed out, "I have lost two sovereigns;" Dixon said, "I have dropped them;" they both fell down - Lilley, who was standing at the door, then went in, and fell over them; he grasped up something - I could not see what; I said, "Have you got them?" he said, "Hold your tongue;" he shut up his hand, and ran away - I am quite sure he said,"Hold your tongue;" he ran away, and stopped at the corner of Payne's-buildings, Whitecross-street - he came into the court again when the boys fetched him, and sat down in the room with Dixon quietly; Dixon said to him, "Let us come out, don't let us stop here to be sloughed up all night and Sunday, till Monday morning;" Dixon said to the Policeman, "I own I had them, but I dropped them in the passage" - I was not in the passage after they were lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. May you not have made a mistake? A. Yes; I am certain Daley and Dixon fell down, but Daley was in such a perspiration and fright he could not exactly say whether he fell.</p>
               <p>DAVID SCOTT. I live in Forster's-buildings. I was in the next house - Thompson came for me, and said Daley had been robbed; I went to the door, and found him and Dixon scrambling - he called for help; I went in, and caught hold of Dixon, put him into the room, and he swore he would break every window in the place if we did not let him go - I went to the corner of the buildings, and told Lilley they had got Dixon; he said he did not care, for he knew nothing of the sovereigns - he went back with us; Dixon said, "Don't let us stop here to be sloughed till Monday."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Lilley till you fetched him? A. No; we found him at the corner of Payne's-buildings - the Magistrate liberated them from Monday to Wednesday, and they came to the office then.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had information from a private watchman, that the captain had been robbed - I went in search of Dodd and Marshall; I found them at No. 2, Twine-court, Shadwell; as the watchman and I came out of the house, Dodd came with us, and I saw her lay something in the kennel - I looked over my left shoulder, and saw it; I said, "What is that, Dodd?" Dodd said, "Oh, my God! it is a watch;" this was four or five hundred yards from Wright's.</p>

            . I was the watch-house-keeper. When Marshall was brought in I was giving her some water, and she said it was a pity the old woman (meaning Wright) was not locked up, for if it had not been for her they should not have robbed the man of his watch, for she told them to do it - I went and took Wright; she was drinking some coffee with a man, and told him it was the last she should drink with him, for she was sure to be transported.</p>

               <p>Dodd delivered in a written Defence, stating that she had met the prosecutor, who told her he had been robbed at the house, and would give her the watch to keep till morning, if allowed to accompany her home - that she was in search of him to return it when she was apprehended.</p>

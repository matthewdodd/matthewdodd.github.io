                  </hi>. The child, Charlotte Small, was by a former hus<lb></lb>band—the prisoner is landlord of my room. On Monday, the 2nd of March, I came home, and found the room-door locked—it was fastened outside, and something put into the key-hole—the prisoner was on the stairs—he said, "MRS. Curry, have you any money for me, if you have not, I am b—if you go into your room again—I have fastened the door up"—I went into the room through my mother's room, which is the next to mine, on the ground-floor, and there is a door from it into my room—the prisoner went out into the street, and got in through the window, attacked me, and pulled me down, and tried to get me out of the room, between the two doors—he wanted to push me through the middle door to get me out of the room—he jammed my arm between the door—my child came and pulled hold of my petticoats, and said, "You will kill my mother"—he took the child by the throat, and dashed her against the grate—her head fell against the fire-place, and her back over the fender—she was very much injured—she was quite well before this, but was very ill the same night, like a burning coal, and complained of pain in her stomach all the evening—so she continued till the following Monday—I got her some me<lb></lb>dicine in the course of the week, and on Monday she brought up blood—I took her to Mr. Buck the doctor—she vomited blood again on Wednes<lb></lb>day, and I took her again to Mr. Buck, and on the Thursday I took her to the Dispensary in Waterloo-road—she had advice there three days, and she died on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I examined the body of the child after death—I never saw it alive—the chest and abdomen were very healthy, except a small portion of the lungs adhering to the chest—that would not cause death at all—I found the blood vessels of the head very much coagulated, and a quantity of water in the cavities of the brain, which was the cause of death—many causes would produce that effect, such as a blow on the head, or a fall on the head, and dentition with young children might cause it, or when the stomach and bowels are not in good order—it had all the teeth a child of that age would have—they were all quite cut, and had been so, I dare say, for a year—dentition could not produce the effects I saw in that child—a blow on the head, or disease of the stomach, might produce it—there was no symptom of disease of the stomach at all—the child appeared to have enjoyed very excellent health—if it was thrown with violence by the throat, and the head went against the fender or stove, concussion of the brain would be the consequence, and that, jointly with the terror of the child, would be sufficient to produce death—if the child was quite well before, I should judge that that violence was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would excessive terror effect this alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it would—terror at seeing the mother ill used might cause unusual sensation in the brain which would bring on reaction, and the same ap<lb></lb>pearances would ensue—I should say that trembling violently was one of the sufficient causes to produce the effect—I must have observed the sto<lb></lb>mach to be out of order if that had been the case—I saw nothing in the state of the stomach which should cause the child to complain of pain in it—if the head is bad for two or three weeks, the stomach generally becomes weak, and sickness would ensue from compression of the brain—that would account for violent pain in the stomach—all the symptoms I per<lb></lb>ceived could be accounted for by terror and anxiety—I saw no external marks of violence, but it must have got well in three weeks;—the parents did not point out any place where I could discover a mark—they pointed out a scar on the left part of the throat, which had evidently not been long there—it might have been five weeks, I cannot say—I have no doubt the symptoms about the brain and head arose from a recent cause—it could not have arisen from a blow six months previous—no doubt a previous accident would produce a predisposition for such a cause, if the brain was then affected, but if the functions were all right it would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the child fell out of window, and was playing about next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that injury was of no consequence what-ever and would not produce predisposition—all the symptoms I perceived might be produced by fright, but it is most probable that the head fell against some solid substance, and caused concussion of the brain.</p>

               <p>Did you hear when Boyle was taken up? - I know none of them by their names.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner Boyle? - I cannot recollect him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any man coming to Mrs. Warrickshall's house, on the 21st at night in March? - Yes, on Monday night about half after nine, I let in two men, they knocked at the door as I was ironing, they said nothing to me, but went up to Mrs. Warrickshall.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a candle? - No, I do not recollect that I had; one of the men told her he had got some stuff, whether it was old or new, I cannot say, and she asked them whereabout it was, and he said hard by, and she bid him work away for she was not afraid, and then the man said some words, which I do not recollect, she said it is not time yet, sit down you can do nothing yet, I will tell you when to go; then they sat down; the man said, there was another, she said, where, he said at the door; she said, call him in, for our watermen are at work, nothing can be done just yet, a pot of beer was standing on the table, which we had for supper, she bid them drink; a chandler's shop being next door, I went out for some snuff, and when I returned I saw three men; she did not much like her neighbours hardly, and she was very angry with me, because I went without her leave, and when I came back, she bid me go to bed: I left the three men sitting there, and saw them no more that night; there was a young woman lodged in the house, I cannot tell her name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warrickshall. I deal in the shipping, this woman washed for me five years, she threw herself on our parish, and I took her in out of charity, I deal in the smuggling way; I did not care to trust her; the watermen go to work of a night on board of the ships; I had a property of India goods.</p>

               <p>Tell us what you and the prisoner have done? - The Monday night, I cannot tell the day of the month, but it was the night before we were taken up, we went there about eight o'clock, and going in we found a parcel of new yarn; there was Boyle and Sulivan, we cut about nine bundles, either eight or nine I cannot say rightly which, when we had made them up, we brought them about half way to her house, and left them in the marshes, all but one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300084"></xptr> parcel, and we took one of the parcels to bring to her house, to get two or three shillings, we was stopped by the way, there were two or three men, I forget their names, they were coming after either, Sulivan or Boyle dropt the bundle, and as the two men were coming after, one of them picked it up, I asked them why they dropped the bundle, they said, they were afraid, says I, you ought to have walked on with it, we came to Mrs. Warrickshall, and I went in, the other staid out, she asked me what it was as I had no parcel, then I told her, I had got some stuff, she asked me where it was, and I told her, it was hard by; and she told me then to work away, I told her that would not do, then I told her what it was, in telling her what it was, she said, it was rather to soon, and bid me set down, and she would tell me when it was time.</p>
               <p>Was any body with her then? - There was her son, and a niece, and her girl, and another young body, and a sailor in a blue jacket, a lodger, I believe I staid there till between eleven and twelve, she desired me to tell them to come in, but they came in without calling, when it was time she told us to go off, and if we did not go off at that time we might be hobbled, because the watermen were going to work at the shipping to smuggle some goods, then we went where the yarn was, and we brought a bundle a piece, and we threw it off our shoulders down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door? - I believe the door was upon the latch or half open, I was the first that went in of the three.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to the door? - I cannot tell, I went right in with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Was either of them stopped at the door? - Never a one.</p>
               <p>Did you bring any more bundles that night? - Yes, Sir, we brought two more, Boyle and I.</p>
               <p>When you brought these two bundles, was any body at the door then? - No one at all.</p>
               <p>Who went in first? - I went in first.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about Boyle? - The second time Boyle was stopped in the entry.</p>
               <p>Who stopped him? - As I could find out, he was stopped by one Smith.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these bundles? - Throw them down into Mrs. Warrickshall's cellar, as we went along Boyle says, here is a man following us, upon which I said, come on, and the man laid hold of Boyle at the door and turned him round; we staid there about an hour; we told Mrs. Warrickshall, and she bid us stop a bit, I told her Boyle had told me he was stopped; she asked me if I could shew her the house, and she said, she would go along with me, I shewed her, and she said, it was one Smith; there was no fear, but to go on; she and I came back to the house, and coming back I called Boyle out, and I asked him to come along, and as we passed Smith's, he laid hold of Boyle, and called out to another young fellow named Smith; this young fellow laid hold of Boyle, and the other laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>In the first place I ask the prosecutor Mr. Hankey, which I look at now, whether it was dark or light, it was half after eleven, I was sitting up for a lodger, every body was in bed in my house; I heard Mr. Hankey and one Mr. Govey, a ship-broker, in the street about half after eleven, and goes to the door hearing their tongues. Hearing Mr. Hankey making mention of an old rope that had been stolen, and that I had it, God bless me, Sir, says I, have you any suspicion Mr. Hankey, are you sure that I keeping an old rope shop, have got it, come in says I; and he turns to Govey, and he says something to Mr. Govey in a high stiled manner, which I cannot rightly tell you the words; but meaning if he came in I should hurt them; I never saw the property, or ever had it from the top of the house to the bottom, Mr. Hankey searched, I had not a bit of new stuff in my house; there is old stuff, about five or six hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Court to Hankey. Was it a dark or light night? - I think it was light enough.</p>
               <p>- HANKEY sworn.</p>
               <p>You was at the prisoner's house that night, was you Sir? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was it so dark that a person could not distinguish perfectly? - I think it was not dark, because I could very well distinguish her, when she stood at the door, she came to me, and asked me several times to come in, and said, I beg Mr. Hankey you will, for you will catch cold; I told her my business was in the street, and there I chose to stand.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time of night was that? - That was about one, I was not called till half after twelve.</p>

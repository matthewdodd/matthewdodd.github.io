            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's, Soho. On Friday morning, the 16th of November, after I had called half-past one o'clock, I was standing at the end of a court, and heard a rattle spring - I was not above twenty or thirty yards from High-street at the time - I saw the prisoner running; he turned the corner into Crown-street - I am sure it was the prisoner - I saw him stoop behind some bricks; he ran out from behind the bricks immediately, and I told him to stop; he stopped directly, and I laid hold of him; one or two St. Giles' watchmen came up - I asked what he had done; one of them said, he had robbed a gentleman of his watch - I said, "I partly guess where it is, behind the bricks, for I saw him run in behind the bricks and stoop" - I took him towards the bricks, and saw Murphy, the watchman, pick up the watch on the spot I saw him stoop; as I took him to the watch-house I said, "What did you rob the gentleman for?" he said,"It was not me who robbed him, but a woman put the watch into my pocket," and he named the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you took a woman into custody? A. Not me - I did not see a woman in custody - I never lost sight of the prisoner; he turned into the street I was in - I did not see him near the prosecutor - I am sure he is the man who stooped behind the bricks.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour, and came up on hearing Mason call Watch! - I had not seen him before he called out; when I got towards the place - I met a young woman named Margaret Harris, who is now in custody; she was not running - I saw a young man with her; he was not running; there was only one young man - I took Harris, and she pointed across the road to the prisoner; he was not the man who was standing with her - I cannot tell who he was - I let her go, and pursued the prisoner - I sprang my rattle, and saw the prisoner running away - Mason was then down on the pavement, and complained of being robbed of his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman run away? A. No - I do not know what became of her; the man who was with her had an umbrella or stick; I stopped him, and let him go again, as I had nobody to assist me; the prisoner was running on the other side of the street; Harris had pointed him out - I pursued him; he turned into Crown-street; I lost sight of him; and came up to him when O'Neil had him in custody; O'Neil directed me behind the bricks, and I found the watch there - I gave it to Mason, the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any body touch the prosecutor? A. No; Harris is in custody now, but I do not know where. I saw a man standing with her - he had a stick or umbrella - I did not take hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you let go of the man after having him? - A. I let go of the woman, as she pointed out the prisoner as having taken the watch; she pointed nobody out till she was taken. The prisoner said that woman put the watch into his pocket; I was within three or four yards of the prosecutor when I saw him on the ground; the man and the woman were at a distance from him; I do not know how many yards, it was across the street; the prisoner was further from him than them - they were only two or three yards from him; it was the prisoner who was across the street, rather to the left; we took the woman again at three o'clock in the morning, in consequence of the prisoner saying she put the watch into his pocket; the man and woman were coming on till I stopped them; they were within a yard of each other - I cannot say whether they were in company.</p>

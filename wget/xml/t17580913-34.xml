            . On the 17th of July I saw a silver pint mug hang with the handle of it out of the prisoner's pocket, at the Adam and Eve in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Thornton. I live at the bell in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Pates. I told a soldier that was there of it and we took hold of the prisoner; a brother that was along with him, snatched it out of his coat pocket and ran away with it. The soldier ran after him and caught him, we carried them both to justice Welch, he asked the prisoner how he came by the mug, he would give no account of it. It was advertised, then Mr. Thornton came and owned it.</p>
               <p>Thornton. The prisoner said he found it near the half-way house in digging in a clay-pit.</p>
               <p>Pates. That was all he would say.</p>
               <p>Thornton. The bottom of the mug is knock'd out, and cut into small square pieces, we have them here. ( The mug and pieces produced in court and deposed to.) Here is W. M. S. on the handle of it. I advertised it, describing it by these letters on the 19th of Ju ne.</p>

               <p>I found the mug where I was at work.</p>

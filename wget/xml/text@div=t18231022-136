            . I am a constable of Poplar. On the 9th of October, about four o'clock, I was going to Mrs. Baker's, <placeName id="t18231022-136-crimeloc734">Well-street, Poplar</placeName>

I went up to Mrs. Baker's. She said she missed a gown. I then went after the cart, and overtook it near Hollis, the pawnbroker's. The prisoners and the woman were in the cart. A boy came out of the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mother, they won't let me have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220054"></xptr>it, you must come yourself." I told them all to come out of the cart, I went into Hollis's, and found a gown corresponding with the pattern which the prosecutrix gave me. I then took them to the watch-house. The woman asked me what I wanted. The prisoners said nothing.</p>

             came to my house about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, with the prisoners and a boy; I knew her before, but not them; she asked me to take her into the yard, which I did. Owen was on the step of the street-door. Thomas, and the boy, were in the house. I came back into the house, and found them all there. The boy said he would go and buy some corn for the horse. The prisoners went with him. I went to my drawer, and missed a gown, which was safe when they came into the house, as I had had it in my hand. They came back in a quarter of an hour; I charged them with it. The prisoners said they were innocent. The boy said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a bother, mistress, if your gown is gone, you shall have it again." Owen said he would not have such a thing happen for 5 l. as to be in their company if any thing was stolen. The boy said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a bother, and I'll go and fetch it, but I have not got the money." The prisoners said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want of money." One gave him 1 s. and the other 6 d. They went out altogether to see where he went for it. The officer came, and I gave him the pattern of it.</p>

The prisoner was in my service, and was in the habit of receiving and paying money for me. On the 25th of May I gave him a 10l. note, fourteen sovereigns, a shilling, a sixpence, and 4d. to go to Smithfield to pay to Mr. Hill, for eighteen sheep and four lambs - he was to take them to Mr. George Warner, in Bermondsey-street, who is my employer; the prisoner was to have met me at Romford fair on the following Wednesday, but I did not see him again till the 1st of September, when he was in Mile-end-road; I ran after him, but he escaped - he was taken again on the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did you give him the money? A. At the corner of Dean-street. Tooley-street, but I opened it again at the corner of Thames-street, to see that it was all right - he was to pay it for two different salesmen - it is entered in a book, which is not here; I went immediately to Romford, and staid there till Wednesday - whether he went to my house or not I cannot tell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 145). I was on duty at half past 2 o'clock in the morning of 2nd Nov., near the Mason's Anns public house, at the corner of China-walk, facing the Lambeth-road—it is in the parish of St. Mary's, Lambeth—while I was passing the public house, I heard the door unlocked—I was about half a dozen yards from it—I saw the prisoner come out and leave the door open, and run away—I followed, and never lost sight of him—I came up to him, when he was about 200 yards from the public house—I did not call to him, I stopped him and said, "I want you to come back with me to the Mason's Arms; I saw you come out of there, and I know you don't live there"—he said, "I know that"—I took him back to the house, and alarmed the house—I took the prisoner to the station—I</p>

               <p>returned to the house and examined the outside, and also the inside—I saw a window which opens into China-walk; there is a urinal under that window—I examined that, and saw foot marks on it—I examined the sill of the window, and saw foot marks—I saw a billiard table inside, and foot marks on it—I am sure the prisoner is the man, that came out of that house—I saw no soul, but him—I saw him come out, and never lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Mason's Arms; it is kept by Mrs. Elizabeth Susan Calley. I fastened up the window of the club room about a quarter past 12 o'clock on the night of 2nd Nov.—it is fastened by a little bit of a latch which comes out of the bottom sash—the top sash has no fastening—you can pull the top sash down, and undo the latch, and lift up the bottom sash—the window had been shut down—about half past o'clock I was disturbed by the policeman—I went down stairs, and found the side door in China-walk open—it was unlocked—the key was in the inside of the door—there is no keyhole outside—the key had been left in the night before—I went into the club room, and found the bottom sash was up and the top one down—I saw footmarks on the place of convenience, on the window sill, and on the bagatelle board—there is a urinal under the window—by means of that, any one could get in the window—I searched the premises—I missed nothing—I found some pots in the club room which had been knocked off the table—I had left them on the second table from the window.</p>

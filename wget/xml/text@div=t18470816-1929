                  </hi> I am a porter, and live in Red Lion-street, White-chapel. On the 7th of Aug., about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was in Grace's-alley, Wellclose-square, and saw the prisoner there striking a young women—I said, "Why not leave the women alone?"—he then left her, and seized me by the neck-handkerchief, twisted it round, and nearly choked me—a constable came up, and sent him one way, and me another—when I had got about 150 yards from the spot, he came running back—he ran past me about a yard or two, then turned suddenly round, and aimed a blow at me, which I thought was with his fist—he then stepped little way back; and as he rose his hand a second time, I caught the reflection of the blade of a knife, or some sharp instrument—it was under a gas-lamp—I then hit him, and knocked him down—he aimed a second blow, which cut me slightly on the neck—I found my arm cut about an inch, or rather better—I was taken to the hospital, and am there still.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had no knife on me, nor was any found—there were sailors and others round—he had me on the ground, and two men were on me—they took my handkerchief and cap from me, and he collared me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman H</hi> 155.) A little before twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the seventh of Aug., I saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling together in Grace's-alley—they had hold of each other by the collar—the prisoner wanted me to take charge of the prosecutor for striking him—I separated them and sent one one way and one the other—I then went on my beat—I was fetched back by a female, and saw the prosecutor bleeding very much from the arm, stating that he was stabbed—a house was pointed out to me where the prisoner had gone—I gained admittance, got a candle, searched the house, and found him in a water-closet in the kitchen—the door was closed—I saw no knife—when I was called back I believe they were chiefly the prosecutor's friends about him—the prisoner was without his cap the first time.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I examined the prosecutor's arm, and found an incised wound about an inch in length, and little more than that in depth—it must have been inflicted with a very sharp instrument—there was also a superficial wound at the back of the neck, I should say inflicted by the same instrument—the wound on the arm was such a one as would be received in parrying a blow—it was followed by inflammation and erysipelas, and was likely to have been very serious—as the man was of a bad habit of body.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not carry a knife about me at all; I was coming along, and the prosecutor and a lot of sailors were standing there—he sent a girl after me, who asked if I had any money—I said no, and told her to go home—two men then came and knocked me down, and took away my cap and handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">Richard and Neville Parker</hi> brig, lying at the Yarmouth-chains, opposite the Custom-house. The prisoner was one of the crew—on Tuesday evening last he went ashore without leave—he came back about ten o'clock on Wednesday morning—he ap<lb></lb>peared to be very drunk, drunker than I think he really was—he came down into the hold, were I was working with another man—he took off his jacket, and said he would have murder—I never spoke at all—the captain came on board, and the prisoner went into the cabin and asked for his dis<lb></lb>charge—the captain said his voyage was not up, and he could not have it—another man went into the cabin, and the prisoner went to listen to what was said—I said he had no business to do so—he struck me, and ill-used me—we were parted—he came again, took the handspike and hit me a heavy blow across the thigh, and I think he has fractured the bone—he then attempted to strike me on the head—I rushed in and prevented him—I was obliged to get some assistance—I went ashore for the police to take him out of the ship, or we should get killed—I found Hyde, the po<lb></lb>liceman, standing just abreast of the Custom-house, I suppose about a quarter of a mile from where I was assaulted—I brought him on board—the prisoner was standing at the companion door, talking to the captain, who was in the cabin—I had told Hyde that I had been assaulted—he asked the prisoner what was the matter—he said it was no business to him, or something of that sort—Hyde said he must come with him—he</p>

               <p>said no, he would not—he said so several times—he took up a piece of rope—the policeman had him by the collar, and the prisoner hit him with the rope—he afterwards tried to gripe the policeman by the throat—he drew his staff to advise him to keep off, and hit him with it—they scuffled and fell—the prisoner took away the staff from the policeman, and hit him ever so many times over the head with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 516.) On Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing last I was fetched on board this ship by the mate and one of the sailors, in consequence of some assault on board—I went on board immediately, and the prisoner was pointed out to me astern—I went to him and said, "Halloo, what is the matter? what a foolish man you must be, going on like this, creating a disturbance here; here is the mate has charged you with an assault and striking him with a handspike"—he was standing quiet at that time—he had no weapon in his hand—I said, "Now let me persuade you to go quietly along with me to the station"—he said I had no business to interfere with him, he was going down below—I told him he was not going down there, he must go along with me to the station, as the mate had charged him—the station is about five minutes' walk from the waterside, opposite where the ship was lying—he sidled on one side, caught hold of a piece of rope, and said he would not go for me or anybody else—he appeared as if he had been drinking, but was perfectly cognisant of what he was doing—I saw the rope in his hand—he made towards me, and struck me over the shoulder with it—I had not hold of him at that time—I then drew my truncheon, and told him, if he did not be quiet, I should certainly strike him with it—with that he rushed towards me with the rope in his hand—he tried to get his hand inside my collar—I then struck him with my staff, at the same time telling him to keep off—he closed in upon me, and we both went down together—we got up again, and soon after that he was coming at me again in a fighting attitude—he then rushed in all at once, seized my staff, twisted it out of my hand, and struck me on the head six or seven times with it—he struck me one or two blows while he was down, which were not very hard ones—some of them were very hard; one cut my head open—I have been attended by a surgeon—he is not here—the flesh was divided, and the blood all ran down my face—with the assistance of one of the sailors we got him down on the deck, and got the truncheon out of his hand—he then got away again, went to the fore part of the vessel, got up the handspike and was in the act of striking me over the head with it—I and one of the sailors rushed in on him, and got it away from him—we got him down on the deck again, then tied his feet together, and afterwards secured his hands—shortly after that the Thames police came alongside, and they assisted me in getting him out of the ship and taking him to the station—this happened in the City.</p>

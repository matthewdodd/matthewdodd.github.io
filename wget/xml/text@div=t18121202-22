               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners. On the 21st of November did you see any of them in your shop - 
               <persName id="t18121202-22-person277">A. Ann Parker</persName>
             came to my shop, and asked for a thimble. I asked her what price she wished to go to. She said, about a shilling or eighteen-pence. I reached the tray of thimbles. It had a great number of them in. She tried most of them on, and then said there was none that fitted her. I was persuaded there was her size, because there was all sizes. She then asked for a clasp, and several other articles, and after looking at them she said there were none that suited her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any ear-rings in her sight - A. Not then; afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing - A. No. She said, there was none that suited, and went outside, and looked in the window, and about two minutes after she came into the shop again. The prisoners, Henry and Hughes followed her. They asked me to let them look at some ear-rings. I told them, if they would wait a few minutes I would wait upon them. I was attending upon Parker at the time. Parker went out. I reached the tray of ear-rings out. Parker came in again. They were looking at the ear-rings, and Henry, which is the least, said that her aunt had sent out there, or else she should not have known where to come. She said, that her aunt had bought a pair there a little while ago, and gave fifteen shillings for them. They then examined the ear-rings. Parker was bye during this time, and after looking at them some time, they said, there were none such as they wanted. They then asked me for clasps. Parker said, she would have a comb. She looked at what I had got, and said, there was none that she liked, and after looking at a variety of articles they said, there were none that suited, and Hughes said so too.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at this time were you behind the counter - A. Yes, they stood before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near the tray where these things were - A. Yes, quite near them. They pulled the things about a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there anybody else in your shop, but you - A. No. My wife was in the parlour; she is not here. Hughes and Henry said, that their aunt had sent them to buy a pair of ear-rings. Henry said, she did not think it would matter if she had any thing else. Hughes said, no, your aunt will not like you to have anything else. I then said, if you do not want anything but ear-rings, I have none that will suit you, so do not give me any further trouble. Hughes then asked me, if I thought I should have any such ear-rings as they represented, on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Saturday. I said, very possible I might. They then said, they would come on of those days. They came on the following Tuesday. They all went away then together. They all three came again on the Tuesday, the same way as they did on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean - A. On the Saturday, Parker came first; Hughes and Henry came in first on the Tuesday. Parker came in about two minutes after, but before they left the shop, while Parker went out, I told Hughes and Henry, that after they went away, on the Saturday, I missed things, about half an hour after they were gone, two pair of ear-rings and a cornelian drop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020014"></xptr>Q. Did you miss them from any of the trays that you had shewn the prisoners - A. Yes, from the very tray that I had shewn them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shewn the tray to anybody else to the hour that you found out your loss - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before they came in had you seen these things safe in the tray, before they came - A. I had seen them the same morning. They were in the tray at the time I was shewing it them. I had but six pair of ear-rings. I am quite sure that when I shewed them the tray, they were in the tray.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed these things did you make any enquiries after these girls - A. No, I did not. They were strangers to me. They said they would come on the following week. They did. I then accused them. They strongly denied it, until I threatened to send for a constable, and then they acknowledged it. Hughes said, if I would let her go home she would go and fetch them; which I did. She was gone about an hour, and the other two remained with me. I asked Parker and Henry where they lived. They directed me to No. 4, Drury-lane. I went there and there were no such persons lived there. I kept them at my own house. They sent me there as to their mothers, and as I was coming out of the shop where they had directed me, I saw Hughes coming along on the opposite side of the way, in Drury-lane. I then went over, and tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her if she had got the ear-rings. She said, that she had been, but her mother was not at home. I then said, go with me, and tell me where your mother lives. She said, she lived at No. 2, Coal-yard. Drury-lane. I had a friend with me. I sent him over to the place where she directed; there he found the mother of Henry. He brought Henry's mother and father to me in the street. I said to the mother, you must go with me; your daughter has robbed me. Hughes was present. Henry's mother and father came with me to my house, and Hughes also. I immediately sent for a constable, and in the mean time that I sent for a constable, Hughes's sister came in, and brought a duplicate of the ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know the sister before, did you - A. No. She brought the duplicate. I gave it to the officer. His name is Langley I went with him to the pawnbroker's. The pawnbroker produced two pair of ear-rings. He asked me if that was my property. I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a drop - 
               <persName id="t18121202-22-person278">A. </persName>
            No. That was sent to me the next day, by the mother. The mother works with a gentleman. She sent him with it for fear I should stop her. The pawnbroker has the ear-rings in his possession. The drop I have in my possession. I produce it. The top of it I lost. There is the drop which matches with the one they left behind. I have no doubt it is mine. That is all I know it by.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I live in Compton-street, Soho. I produce two pair of ear rings. They were pawned at my house on Saturday the 21st of November, by the prisoner, Hughes. I have seen once; before that day. I lent her seven shillings upon them. She came in, and said, she would pledge two pair of ear-rings; that her aunt had given her them to buy a pair of ear-rings. She shewed me a top and drop.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The ear-rings are my property. They are the very identical patterns that were taken from me. I had no others of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find in your tray any vacant place for them - A. No. They had been tumbled together, so that I could not see. I can say they were in the tray before they looked at the tray, and I missed them about an hour after they were gone. I described them to the constable, before I went to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these ear-rings - A. About seventeen shillings the ear-rings, the top and the drop altogether.</p>

I went with Mr. Thomas to the pawnbroker, and the moment he saw the ear-rings, he said, they were his.</p>

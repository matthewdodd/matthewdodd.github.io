                  </hi>. On the 26th of Jan. the prisoner came and pro<lb></lb>duced this paper—I questioned him upon it, and he said Mr. Chapman was still very unwell, and it was written by Mrs. Chapman, and given to him—I asked him where Mr. Chapman's men were at work—he said at the In<lb></lb>fant-school in some street in Gray's Inn-lane, I think Baldwin's-gardens—(<hi rend="italic">paper read</hi>)—"Please to let the bearer have four bars of solder and two brushes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman, Lamb's Conduit-street, 26th Jan."—he said Mr. Chapman was so unwell that he could not write himself—he did not say it was written by Mrs. Chapman for Mr. Chapman—he said it was written by Mrs. Chap<lb></lb>man, and given to him—I cannot say whether Mrs. Chapman conducted her husband's business during his illness—I questioned the prisoner as I did be<lb></lb>fore, about his having the order from Mrs. Chapman, and received similar answers—I let him have the solder—I considered that he applied by Mr. Chapman's authority—I knew that he worked there some time back, perhaps twelve months; I cannot say exactly, and I supposed him to be still in the service—I considered this as a request from Mr. Chapman, that upon his credit I should furnish the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Chapman. I did not write this paper, nor authorise or know of its being written—it is not my husband's writing—he was ill at the time, and is so now—the prisoner was not in our employ at this time—he had not worked with us for about twelve months—if he represented that the goods were ordered by my writing, and that he saw me write it, it is quite untrue—I never remember sending any one to Mr. Mitchell's—I did not manage my husband's business during his illness—my husband has sent to Mr. Mitchell's for articles—he used to send the plumber who might me be at work for him at the time—if the prisoner had been at work with the plumber he might probably have been sent for things that were wanted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are not in the habit of writing orders for your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not think I ever did to Mr. Mitchell—my husband sometimes has many workmen, but only one plumber generally—that man has not authority to send orders—he never sends without Mr. Chapman gives him an order to go—Mr. Chapman always puts his own name to it—the plumber never sends notes for himself—this is the form in which my husband sends his orders—his name is always in the paper—he puts "J. Chap<lb></lb>man"—he never puts Mr.—he generally puts J. Chapman at the bottom—the purport of the paper is generally "Mr. Mitchell (or whoever it may be) please to deliver to the bearer," (whatever he may request.) J.

About a quarter past four o'clock, on the 26th of January, I saw the prisoner in company with another, with five bars of solder—I followed them to the corner of Church-street, St. Giles—I stopped the prisoner and asked where he was going to take it to—he said to Mr. Chapman's in Lamb's Conduit-street—I said it was a round-about way to Mr. Chapman's—he gave me a bill which he had had from Mr. Mitchell, and said, "If you think there is anything wrong about it, you had better go there and see"—I went back to Mr. Mitchell's and asked if he knew the prisoner, and if it was right—he said he knew him as coming from Mr. Chap<lb></lb>man but it was not Mr. Chapman's handwriting—the prisoner said that Mrs. Chapman wrote it and gave it to him—I went to Mr. and Mrs. Chap<lb></lb>man's, and they knew nothing about it—the prisoner then said, a man named Wallis, living in Bell-court, Gray's Inn-road, gave him the order.</p>

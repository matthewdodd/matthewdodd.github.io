               <p>Q. How much had you drank before? - Three pots between three of us, at the corner of Field-lane; then I bid them good night, after I had paid for the gin and made the best of my way home; and she followed me again, and she says, young man, as you are late, you had better go home along with me; I said, as I am late, I don't care if I do, if I could get a bed. So she pretended she could get me a bed, and she went to a house in Chick-lane, and asked for a bed, and the person he looked out of the window, and said, no, I will not have any such person as you; then she said, follow me, and I can get a bed for you; and I followed her to Black Boy-alley, and I took and set myself against the wall, and we talked together, and I felt my money while she was talking to me, and she went away from me; and I felt and found my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you feel you had your money? - In Black Boy-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman with her then? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you treated her with the gin that you missed your money? - I suppose about an hour and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. And you are very sure you felt it afterwards in Black Boy alley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her do any thing about your pocket? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she with you after you felt your money? - Not above ten minutes after I felt my money; I stood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160117"></xptr>by the side of the wall, and she stood by the side of me.</p>

P. and a brass shilling. There was one marked I. P. among the twelve; this is it. I then took her into custody to the watch-house, and from thence to the justice the next day.</p>

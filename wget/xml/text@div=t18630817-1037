                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing optician, at 111, Minories—I have known the prisoner nearly twenty years—he was in my father's em<lb></lb>ployment—he left about seven years since, and he has been employed by me this last time about two years—I employ between thirty and forty men—the prisoner was general foreman—about twelve men worked in the same room with him making telescopes, quadrants, sextants, and spectroscopes at times, and compasses—I am not a microscope maker—I have never given the prisoner directions to make microscopes of any kind—he would receive orders from me or Mr. Blakley, and he would have no authority to do other work, except what we ordered—from information I received, on Tuesday evening, 4th August, I examined his drawers—he had a nest of drawers, all of which opened with one key, and one drawer without a key, and two or three other drawers to which he had access, and which he used I believe—I first opened the drawer of which he had the key, by forcing the bolts down, and found this body of a microscope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is an eye<lb></lb>piece in it which belongs to me, and which belonged to a telescope, and has been adapted to the microscope—I searched the bench adjoining the prisoner's and found a number of castings for two <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi>; I might say, the complete castings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the jiggers are used principally for making small glasses—I have never seen them used, and they have never been used in my business, to my knowledge—I have never given the prisoner orders to prepare jiggers for me—I never ordered these castings of any one—I also found this drawing under the bench adjoining the prisoner's, which is the bench of a workman named Owen—this shows how the jigger is used; it is a small lathe, not a jigger, correctly speaking—I also found, close by, these two drawings for microscopes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and in a drawer which was un<lb></lb>locked I found these rough castings for microscopes—they were then not turned—a man named Bindley, I believe, turned them, the following morning—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186308170062"></xptr>
               <p>I replaced everything, and on the next morning gave information to the police—I went up with the officer Gaylor, and brought all these things out and placed them before the prisoner and the whole of the workmen—I said to the detective, "This is Christopher Homan, whom I charge with stealing this property"—he made no answer directly; but shortly afterwards he got up and said, "It is all right; this is your property; I made it for you. How have I stolen it?"—I then said to Owen, "Who told you to make these things up?" referring to the jiggers and portions of the castings—he said, "Mr. Homan, of course"—Homan then said, "I had them made to make small glasses for you; I thought you might make up some microscopes, and then they might be useful"—I said, "If that is the case, how came there to be two jiggers made? it would not require two"—he then came forward and said to Owen, "Now be frank, Owen; did not you say to me that one would be very useful to you for your work?" and Owen, in a very hesitating manner, said after a short time, "Well, yes, I did say it would be handy"—I said, "Even if you had made these jiggers for your work and Owen's, how do you explain making up microscopes?" and he again repeated something to the effect that he thought I might make up some object powers, and then the body of the microscope might be handy to try them in—he was then taken to the station by Gaylor—I saw him searched there, and these four small lenses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found on him wrapped up separately in paper and then inclosed in one parcel—they are mine—they are eye-pieces of an astronomical telescope—he said they were my property—I did not hear him say how they came in his pocket—I went with the officer to the address the prisoner gave, and found a spectroscope, telescope, a pocket compass-box, and a set of ground frames for a quadrant, with coloured glass—I can swear to this telescope as my property, and I am sure the other things are mine—he had no authority to take them away from my place—I never gave him per<lb></lb>mission to remove them—some of the workmen were paid by the day, and some by piece-work—this work would all be called piece-work—there is an account of the work which each man does; the prisoner gave that account to Mr. Blakley, who paid the wages.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186308170063"></xptr>
               <p>microscopes—two arms could not be used in one microscope—I never saw it—I don't see any other duplicate except that—we found the things at the prisoner's house in a set of drawers, not all together in one drawer—I did not observe any children's books or slates in the same drawer—these glasses are all different colours—that is not a magnifying glass on that compass, it is plain glass to protect the card—there were no flies in it when we found it; there were eight or ten half-crowns in it, I should think—I never saw one of these used by children to put flies in; it would be rather an expensive style of fly-box—the prisoner's wife, was there—she said the things belonged to the little boy, but not until after some considerable time.</p>

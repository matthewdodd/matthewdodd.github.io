                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live in Fair-street, Stepney. On the evening of the 16th of Jan., I was in Philpott-street, Commercial-road, looking at a man selling hardware—I felt some one behind at my pocket—I turned short round, and saw the prisoner—I missed four handkerchiefs out of my pocket behind, wrapped in part of the "Edin<lb></lb>burgh Journal"—I saw the prisoner behind me—he moved away directly—I followed him, and said, "You have got my handkerchiefs"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have"—he had his two hands in his pocket in front—he shuffled about, and dropped the handkerchiefs at his feet—I saw him do it, and I picked them up—these are them—when I was giving the prisoner into custody, he said he would enter an action against me for giving him into custody—I am quite sure I saw him drop them.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock on the 16th of Jan., the prisoner and the prosecutor came up together—the prosecutor had got hold of the prisoner's arm, and gave him into my custody, for stealing four handkerchiefs out of his pocket—the prisoner said directly that he had not stolen them, but they were picked up at his feet—I then took him to the station—the prosecutor gave me these four handkerchiefs—they were wrapped up in a piece of paper, and the paper was muddy.</p>

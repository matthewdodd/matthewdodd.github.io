                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my mother, in Parker-street, Drury-lane. The prisoner lived in the next room to my mother—on Saturday, the 23rd of April, about three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, the prisoner told me to get her a pint of beer, and half-a-pint of gin—I went, and she gave me some gin—I afterwards went into my mother's room—the prisoner went down stairs, then came up, and called me—I went into her room again, and she locked the door, told me to sit down, and said, "Pour the gin out, and drink"—I said, "No, you drink first"—she drank, and then I drank—she said, "Pull off your handkerchief, for fear it should choke you"—she was drunk—I took my handkerchief off, and drank the gin—she then gave me a halfpenny to go and get some Pease pudding, which I got, and came back—she told me to sit down again—I said, "Will you have a bit?"—she said, "No, eat it yourself," which I did—she said, "Get the bread and butter out of the cupboard, I will cut you some," which I did—she told me to cut it for myself—I cut it, and just after I swallowed the last bit, she said, "I want to speak to you"—I went to her—she laid hold of me by the shoulder, and cut ray cheek—she got up—I pushed her back by the fire-place, ran to the door, and then she cut my throat with a razor—she was very drunk at the time—I had given her no offence—she only said, "I want to speak to you"—she had a pipe in her mouth all the time—I was carried to King's College hospital—here is the mark on my cheek, and on my throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's mother—I remember seeing the prisoner the afternoon this happened—she was very drunk—when I went home, about half-past three, my boy was sitting blowing the fire—I saw</p>

               <p>he had been having something to drink, and scolded him for it—the pri<lb></lb>soner came and said, "Don't scold him, he is a good little boy, and don't deserve scolding"—I said, "I am very angry with him, and not best pleased with you, Ellen"—presently she came and asked if I would allow him to fetch her a pint of beer—I said, "Yes"—he went out—I afterwards heard a terrible scream from my boy, I ran to the door, and found it fast—I shook the door, and said "Open the door"—the child opened it at last—I saw the razor at the child's throat, and her arm round his waist—she had the razor—she was at the child's throat, as if in the act of cutting it then, and he was bleeding tremendously—I screamed and put the razor back with my hand—I flung her away, pulled the child to me, took my handkerchief, end bound it round the wound—I called out, and people came to my assistance—the wound was sewn up at home, and he was carried to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six or seven months—I always found her a very good neighbour, and very kind to my children—I think she has had trouble on her mind for three weeks which induced her to drink more than usual—when I screamed and took the child from her she looked at me but made me no answer—when sober she was remarkably kind and quiet—I never knew her do any act of violence before—for three weeks before this, in consequence of some trouble, she was continually intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with Mrs. Wilks—when the child screamed out, I went with her to the door, when it was opened I saw the prisoner with a razor in her hand—she had been cutting his throat—his neck and chest were covered with blood.</p>

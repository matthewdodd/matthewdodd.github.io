                  </hi>. I live at 42, Henry-street, Kent-street, and am the wife of John Stanley—on the evening of 26th October I took home a female who was drunk, to the prisoner's house—I saw the prisoner there—she lives up-stairs in the same house—the other woman lives in a different room—I saw her safe up-stairs into her own room—the prisoner, who was in the passage, asked me for some lucifers—I gave her some, and she went up-stairs and upset something, and then came down and said I had been in her room and broken her lamp—I said it was false, I had not been in her room—she said she should get murdered for it—I had a child in my arms—Mr. Hunter, the man that she lives with, came home—she said she wished I had not got the child in my arms—she kept on repeating in his presence about the breaking of the lamp—a little girl named Martha Crane took the child out of my arms—she is no relation to me or the prisoner—I did not give her the child; she took it from me—the prisoner said, "If you had not got the child in your arms, I would give you something for yourself;" and then the girl took the child from me—the prisoner then struck me across the top of the head, and I fell—I did not see the instrument; I cannot say what it was—after I was down I was bleediug very much, and she hit me again, but I do not know whether it was with the same instrument—the second blow was at the back of my head—I bled very much—I was under the surgeon's care for a fortnight—two men picked me up in the passage and stood me against the door, and I was led to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Henry-street, Kent-street, South wark—on 26th October, in the evening, I heard a noise at Mr. Hunter's house—I saw the prisoner there—I heard a bit of a bother and went down—I saw Mrs. Stanley there—Mrs. Hunter was inside the passage and Mrs. Stanley outside the door—Mr. Hunter had his arm across the door, smoking a pipe—Mrs. Hunter said, "What would I give you if you had not that child in your arms," and then the little girl took the child from Mrs. Stanley's arms, and no sooner was the child out of her arms than the prisoner struck her on the head—I saw this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her band—Mrs. Stanley fell into the passage—I did not see another blow struck—the blood gushed into Mrs. Hunter's face—I went up the street for the two policemen, and when I came back Mrs. Stanley was outside the door bleeding very much—I am sure this is the weapon that the prisoner had in her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 135, Dover-road, Walworth—on 26th October, about 12 o'clock at night, the prosecutrix was brought to my shop bleeding from two wounds on the head, but not much; the bleeding had nearly ceased then—I dressed the wounds—one was half an inch in extent, and the other an inch—they were both lacerated wounds—this in<lb></lb>strument is very likely to have caused them—they must have been done with an amount of violence—it went to the bone, but it had not injured the bone—the prosecutrix was under my charge a fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they dangerous wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in themselves—they might have produced erysipelas or exfoliation—the prosecutrix was not drunk—it was what we call a penetrating lacerated wound, as if done with the point of a weapon.</p>

On the 12th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was at Worship-street office, and four pieces of pork were produced, which I had cut and put on my own counter the night before; there were two loaves likewise produced, which were similar to two I had lost, but I could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is become of the pork? A. It was fresh pork, and I told the officer if he liked to make use of it, he might; I had no brandmark upon it, but I knew it; they were cut out of the prime part of a spare-rib; I can swear they were my own cutting; I took particular notice of it; I saw them again soon after, and knew them to be the same; I cut different to ninteen butchers out of twenty; there is not one butcher in fifty, that knows how to cut a joint of meat - from the sight of any piece of meat, I could tell whether it was my own cutting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand that you cut this as you usually do, and yet in some particular manner? A. Yes; I cut six pieces particularly straight and fair, to see if I missed any of them.</p>

            . I live in Shoreditch. On Tuesday evening, the 10th of October, I received information from the prosecutor, and on the following Thursday morning, I went to his back-door, soon after six o'clock - I saw the prisoner about a yard from the door - his back was towards me, and he was talking to his wife - I had seen him before, and am positive of his person - he was in the act of delivering something from his apron to her - he then shook his apron, and went in doors - I followed her to Worship-street: an officer came and stopped her - her lap was opened, and I saw the pork.</p>

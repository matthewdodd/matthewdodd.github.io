                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in King-street, Lambeth-walk. On the 1st of Sept. I had to do some work to a van for the prisoner Boorn—I told him I wanted some nails—he said he would send Cotterill for a penny-worth—I said that was no use, I should want half a thousand—he said he would not trust him with any more money—he afterwards sent Cotterill with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get two quarters of a thousand—he brought two packets, and one was not right—I sent it back—Cotterill returned, with two par<lb></lb>cels, one of which had a brass knob outside—Boorn asked Cotterill what he wanted for it, and he said, "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Ben"—Boorn gave it him, and he jumped down out of the van—Boorn said to him, "Don't go there any more, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, or you will be <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> "—on the Thursday following I met Boorn—he said I had been to the station-house—I said I had not—he said, "You b—, if I thought you had, I would jump your b—guts out"—he said, "Never mind; if you had, I could have brought a person to prove that you bought the things"—I said, "Very well," and the next, morning I went to a Mr. Redford, an ironmonger, and then to Mr. Boden's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was apprentice to a piano<lb></lb>forte maker, not a regular apprentice—I was put under Mr. Daley to learn the business—I was with him five years and a half—he was an irritable sort of man—I was always running away through his bad temper—I left him of my own accord—I was not discharged for stealing tools nor spoons—he raised a report that I stole a silver spoon, and took me to the station, but I was acquitted—I was not in custody above two hours—I have been in trouble since then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were asked before the Magistrate if you had been charged with felony, did you not deny it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did at first—I did not know I was on my oath—when the policeman stated it I recollected that I had been charged with felony—I think that was for keeping bad company—I was locked up in the station for one night—I never was put into prison for any time—I was not on friendly terms with Boorn—I had no quarrel with him—the reason I went to Mr. Bedford's was that his was the nearest shop—I have stated that Mr. Boden came down the yard the day that this occurred, but I did not then know that it was him—I did not make this known before, be<lb></lb>cause Boorn owed me some money, and I wanted to get it—six days elapsed before I made the disclosure—I have not been paid my money—I do not know how much Boorn intended to give me—I did not tell him when I met him that I would go to Mr. Boden—I did not know Mr. Boden's name—that must have been a mistake when I was telling the man to write down the de<lb></lb>position.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father Solomon Harris, at No. 22, Well-street, as tailors and outfitters—the prisoner was our fore<lb></lb>man for about fifteen months, he lodged in the house—it was his duty to cut out clothes and to receive them when they were made—he had no authority from us to take clothes and pledge them—about five months ago we began to miss clothes—on 12th May, I think it was Thursday, I went into the prisoner's bed room, about 3 o'clock, and found him on the bed—I asked him what business he had on the bed at that time, he said that he had the head<lb></lb>ache—I told him it was not the place of a foreman to lie down at that time of day, and keep the front door of the shop shut, and he ran down into the shop—I looked under his bed, and found a pocket book with a letter in it, in which I found some duplicates—I went to the pawnbrokers to identify the clothes, and immediately after that, went up stain, and gave the pocket book to Williams, the servant, with instructions—I was in the shop when she came down and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Byrn, is this your pocket book?"—he said, "Yes"—I immediately called a policeman in, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines, at Woolwich, On Wednesday evening, the 4th of May, about five o'clock, I came from Hedge-row with a bundle of clothes—I went into the Three Dews—the prisoner was there—I then went to the Marquis of Granby, and had my bundle there—soon after I missed it—it contained two pairs of trowsers—these now produced are them.</p>

               <p>She deposed, That she went out of her Masters house to fetch home a Child from School, and by a hole broken in the Window laid the key there, after she had locked the door; and she supposeth the door was opened by some that took the key out of the window, for she found it open when she returned, and that it was about four or five in the evening: and her Mistris told her, the little Dog barking very much, made some that were above-stairs come down, who found the door open, but no body there; and about half an hour after they missed the things in the Indictment. That the reason of their accusing these Women was, because one of the Shirts was offered to be pawn'd by Jane Baley at Cow-cross; and she being examined, said, she bought it of Mary Hipkins; whom also they took upon suspicion, but she would confess nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Jane Baley the Prisoner said, That the other Prisoner Hipkins sold it her at house called the Two Brewer's for 4 s. and being afterwards in want of money, would have pawn'd it. She could not produce any person that see her buy it, but she brought one

And upon other discourse, Hipkins also was heard by her to say, That had it not been for a whiffling little Cur, she would have done her work better than she did.</p>

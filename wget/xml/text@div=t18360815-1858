                  </hi>. I keep the Six Bells public-house. On the 11th of August, the prisoner came in, about seven o'clock in the evening—a per<lb></lb>son named Andrews was there, rather intoxicated—he had been in and out all day—the prisoner sat down by the side of him—after some conver<lb></lb>sation they called for a pot of beer—I brought it, and Andrews gave me a shilling—I looked at it, and saw it was a new one—I put it into my pocket, with other silver—just afterwards I pulled the money out to give change—I took this new shilling in my hand—I bit it, and it proved to be bad—it resembled that I had received from Andrews—I had no other bright shilling in my pocket—soon after that, my son Charles made a communication to me, after he had served them with the next pot of beer—I saw the policeman—he was waiting at the door till Brown went out—I wrapped up the shilling which I took—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Piper. Andrews was at the house—he is a man known in the neighbourhood—he was tipsy—I do not remember the prisoner coming in, but he was sitting with Andrews, and drinking with him—my father had made a communication to me about a shilling—after that Andrews called for another pot, and gave me a bad shilling—they drank the second pot—I told him it was bad, and Andrews said a woman who had been there gave it him—I gave it to him back—he gave it to the woman, and gave a good one for it—I afterwards got that shilling from the woman,—I had bit it before I returned it—the officers were not told to come in, they were to remain at the door—An<lb></lb>drews left the house in company with his mother, and then the prisoner was about to leave, and Spiers, the officer, stopped him at the door—(the woman was Mrs. Baker, whom Andrews had been employed by)—the policeman searched the prisoner, and I saw three bad shillings taken from his pocket—he said nothing—he seemed very much frightened.</p>

I was directed to wait at the door, when I saw the prisoner leaving the house, Mr. Piper said he had suspicion of his having bad money—he immediately put both his hands to his pockets—I seized on his left hand, and said, "Let your pockets alone; keep your hands out"—I took his hand, and found in it three bad shillings—we took him to the station-house, and found three more in the same pocket.</p>

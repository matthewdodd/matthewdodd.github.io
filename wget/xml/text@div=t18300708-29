These brushes were in his shop, about nine o'clock in the evening- I saw the prisoner and a companion of his for five minutes- they both advanced on the step of the door, and one or the other took the brushes off, but I saw both their hands were on the brushes; I hurried round the counter, and walked very sharp after them - I turned a street, and saw them; the prisoner was rather ahead, but they were in company - the one behind looked round and saw me coming after them; I was not running, for I was not sure which had the brushes; but I saw the prisoner's shoulders rather bent, and suspected him - he ran off, and I ran after him; he threw these brushes behind him - he went up to a stationer's and I caught him.</p>

            ; the property is my brother's - I am his servant; I cannot tell the date of this transaction - this was between the two lights, but I could distinguish their countenances; the shop is within two doors of Blackmoor-street - it is not a great thoroughfare; I did not say it was another man that took them - I will swear the prisoner touched them; his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080027"></xptr>was up - I was about three yards from the door; I could see very plainly to the door - we have a glass which comes to the side of the desk; there might be some persons near him, but I saw him fling something down - I was about half a dozen yards from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the corner of Blackmoor-street; I saw a man run from Stanhope-street, and turn into that street; a gentleman came out, and cried Stop thief! I followed, with twenty or thirty other persons - it was then dark; it was impossible for him to swear to any one; I was close to the man who dropped the brushes - they fell on my feet.</p>

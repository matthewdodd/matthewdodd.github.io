                  </hi>. I was acting as fourth officer of the ship <hi rend="italic">Tantallon Castle</hi>—the prisoner was a seaman on board, during the voyage from Cal<lb></lb>cutta England—I missed several articles from my chest—a gold ring, some handkerchiefs, a shirt, some socks, and some cosmetique, and when I arrived in the docks I missed a sovereign from my purse—on arriving here, I called a policeman to search the prisoner's chest, and saw these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found in it—they are mine—at the beginning of the voyage the prisoner washed for me for a short period, but he never washed white shirts or handkerchiefs—in consequence of the prisoner's bunk in the forecastle being injured in the rough weather, he slept amidships where I was—and he might have had access to my chest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there any marks on the shirts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but they are made of a particular pattern of which I have the Counterpart; and the cloth is peculiar; and they are made either for studs or buttons—the handkerchiefs are not marked, but I produce counterparts of them—theprisoner stated, in my presence, that he had bought the handkerchiefs in Calcutta, and that a man named Bryno was present when he bought them—Bryno was called forward, and he said he saw the prisoner go into a shop in Calcutta, and bring out a parcel tied up, and the prisoner said they were handkerchiefs, but he did not see them—I have the cosmetique here—it is a thing a seaman would not be likely to have—there were twenty-six men on hoard—two men and two boys slept amidships—the prisoner said that the shirt was given to him by a man who died in the passage out.</p>

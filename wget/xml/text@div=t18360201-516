I live at No. 2, Wellington-Camberwell, On the 6th of May last, I was at home at my mother's, with my brother, (the prisoner at the bar,)and some friends—I met the prisoner about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock that morning, at Whitechapel church—we then went home to Camberwell, and I continued in his company till seven</p>

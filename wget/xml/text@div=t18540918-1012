                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 121). About 4 o'clock in the morning, on 4th Aug., I was on duty near Brown's—buildings, Stanhope—street, Clare-market—I was called by somebody to go to Brown's—buildings—I was told that the parties were in the centre house, on the left side, at the top of the court—I was in uniform—I was not told what I was wanted for—I went, knocked at the door, and asked if the police were wanted—they said there had been a vagabond trying to break in the door—that was the prisoner's wife, who was in the house—the prisoner then put his head out of the window of a house opposite, and said, "I can't be everywhere at once"—the wife and daughter came to the door of the house, where I went to, and identified Merritt, a man who was standing there, as being the party who had been at the door—that was the man who had fetched me there—I said if the girl brought home men with her there, they must settle their quarrel in another manner—I did not see any marks on the door, and I could not take him into custody—the wife and daughter came out, and began to abuse the man, and afterwards they began at me, and made a very great noise—I desired them to go in doors, and not to awake the inhabitants at that early hour in the morning—the wife then called to the prisoner to come down, and go to the station, and report me for not taking Merritt into cus<lb></lb>tody—the noise was so great that I went to put them in doors—I took hold of the wife, and put her in doors, for the purpose of fastening the door, to get the place quiet—as I was going to fasten the door the daughter threw something out of the door—she was standing on the step, and she threw something, which struck me on the breast—I caught hold of her, to take her into custody, and at the same time the mother caught her, to pull her in doors, and by so doing it pulled me on to the step of the door, and inside the passage—after a short struggle the daughter said, "If you will let me put more clothes on, I will go with you"—I was in the act of letting her go, when the prisoner rushed in past me, to come inside the passage, and I found him strike me on the side of the neck, but I do not know what with—I took no notice of that—he then said, "You d—d vagabond, what are you doing here?"—he then struck me a second time in the mouth—I believe it was with a knife; I found a bleeding at the time—I was not certain at the time, but I believe it to be the knife—finding myself bleeding</p>

               <p>I grasped at him, and found myself get another blow on the breast—I could not say what that was with—it did not penetrate the skin, but I found a cut on my coat, where that blow was given—he then struck me again which knocked me off the step of the door, and left the knife sticking in my breast—I then pulled out my staff, seeing him attempting to shut the door, and put the staff between the door and the post, to prevent his shutting the door—I pulled the knife out with my right hand, and put it in my pocket—I rushed into the passage then, and took him out, and called for assistance—Merritt caught him round the body and arms, and we brought him down to Stanhope—street, and the turncock caught hold of him—I told him I was stabbed, and the sergeant took the prisoner to the station, and an officer took me to the hospital—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat I had on—here are three cuts on it—here is one on the collar, which corresponds with the first blow I felt—it cut the coat and stock, but did not cut my neck—I after<lb></lb>wards found a cut on my lip corresponding with the blow that I had received there.</p>

On the 27th of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to see some wedding rings. I handed her three cards containing six gold rings each. On turning to shut the sash, I observed she had taken the six rings off one card, sat down, and shot all six into her lap - she had taken her gloves off. I observed a gilt ring, and a paste half-hoop on her hand, both on the same finger - she took them off, and fitted one of my gold rings on - one of them fitted her. She asked the price of putting a posey to it, and said she would write it. I gave her some paper, and she wrote</p>
               <p>"Love till death." She put six rings on the card, laying them loosely altogether. She then took up a second card of broader rings, and said that she should like a broader one - it was not for herself, but a young friend. On her taking up that card I begged of her to allow me to detach them, as I had observed her detach the others in an unpleasant way. I had observed that she had mixed her gilt ring with my gold ones. She paid no attention to me, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180031"></xptr>stripped them off into her lap, and kept fitting them on her finger one after another, and at the same time asked me what I would take to mount the paste ring in fine gold, and if I would shew her some patterns; which I declined doing at that moment. I withdrew the third card, and laid it on the back counter - they had not been touched. She gathered the rings upon her lap, and put them on the second card as before, saying that none of them fitted her, and observing I had withdrew the third card, she wished to see it. I then told her there was one exchanged on the first card, and that one was missing from the second. I had only put the rings on the cards on the Friday preceding, and I am certain there was no gilt ring upon it when I handed it to her - it could not miss my eye for a moment if it had been so - it would be as conspicious to the eye of a jeweller, as black from white. I am also certain, no gilt ring was on the second. Miss Ballard was in the shop purchasing a ring, before she came in, and remained there - she did not touch either of the cards. The prisoner, as though not regarding what I had said about the ring being missed, put her hand into her basket, and took out of her handkerchief a 1 l. note making no reply to what I had said. At this moment another Lady came in, and wished to see some pearl and amethyst rings. I shewed her three, neither of them were the size - I begged her to call again on her requesting to see the tray, as I was particularly engaged at that time, and the prisoner said she could not wait. I have not seen that lady since. On her withdrawing she took the prisoner's basket; she had got to the door when the prisoner turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"Ma'am you have taken my basket!" - she returned the basket. The prisoner then went to the counter, and said if I would take ten shillings worth of halfpence, she would call again in a few moments - that was for the ring which fitted her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason why you was to take halfpence - A. Not the slightest. I told her I must consider that a mere pretence for leaving the shop, for there was a ringmissing, and I thought as she had a 1 l. note, the best way would be for her to pay for it, and leave the shop. She said she did not know any thing about a ring being missing, and she certainly did not take it. I said if she wished me to consider her a customer, she should pay for the ring - as she had a note, and I had plenty of change. She said, she did not wish me to think she came to steal a ring - she would pay for the ring. I gave her 10 s. out of a 1 l. note. I then endeavoured to convince her there was a ring missing, by delivering her that which fitted her, and shewing her there were but four in the card. She said she had not taken it - I said I had no proof of that, and was alone in the house, and could get no proof of it; otherwise I did not doubt, but I should find it on her. I requested her to leave the shop - she said she had no objection to be searched, if I thought she had got it. I said I had no one to search her, and desired her to leave - she said I had grossly insulted her, and her husband should come and see her righted. I understood her husband's name was Collinson - I saw him at the Mansion-house, and found it was Borrenstein.</p>

               <p>Q. She said her husband should see her righted - A. Yes, I begged her not to interrupt me in my business and leave - I would put up with the loss. She then began to be violent, saying it was a shame I should charge her with taking a ring. I begged Miss Ballard to call in Mr. Nicholson, a neighbour - he came immediately, and said I had better let her go about her business. I said she insisted on being searched - she then said to him, that she wished to be searched - I believe she had loosened part of her dress; she came forward, and said Mr. Mott accuses me of taking a ring, and putting her hand upon the counter placed a gilt ring there, and said</p>
               <p>"Here is the ring." I am confident that before that there was no ring upon the counter - I then found it was a gilt one, and said</p>
               <p>"Ma'am this is not the ring, this is a gilt one" - that was a second gilt ring. I had no gilt rings near that spot. I have only a few in the shop, and they are very old, and are kept upon a wire in a drawer. I am certain that ring was not upon either of the cards in her possession - I had shewn her none. Mr. Nicholson then said I had been robbed and swindled too, and advised me to charge an officer with her, which I did. The officer proposed that Miss Ballard should search her; she went backward with her for that purpose - they returned, and Miss. Ballard said she believed she had nothing about her - the officer took her away. I think she first said she lived at Hackney, or that her friends lived there. She afterwards mentioned Blackfriars-road, and at the Compter she said John-street Blackfriars-road - I found she lodged there, and that her husband was a journeyman printer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How many persons serve in your shop - A. One lad besides myself - I have had no servant this two or three months. Before this I had not shown those rings after they were carded.</p>
               <p>Q. She came as any other lady would - A. Yes, it was unusual for a lady to take them off the card, four of them might have been tried without detaching them. When she laid the rings upon the first card, there were still six, but one was a gilt one - she had put the one which fitted her upon the card with the others, and I put it aside. I wanted her to leave, but she continued to express her indignation at the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. She insisted on being attended to before the lady who came - A. I requested her to wait and she consented, but in a minute or two said she would not wait.</p>
               <p>Q. She might have kept a ring by mistake - A. That could not be, because a second was missing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPLUS. Q. The first card had six rings, all gold - A. Yes; and she returned me but five gold and a metal one; and on the second card only five were returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she wish to be searched until the lady had left the shop - A. No, that lady had stood close to her side, their clothes might touch; the counter is about eighteen feet long. A metal ring was produced at the office as one found on her. This made a third metal ring.</p>

            . I live in Baker's-buildings, Old Bedlam; I was in Mr. Mott's shop when the prisoner came in, I did not particularly direct my attention to her, but to the best of my recollection, she sat herself down in a chair by the counter, and asked for a wedding-ring for a friend of hers, who was going to be married. Mr. Mott<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180032"></xptr>took three cards from the window and handed her two, she took the rings off the card into her lap, I think she slipped both cards and put them in her lap together, but my attention was not particularly fixed on her. When Mr. Mott said he missed a ring, she said she did not take it, and the ring she fixed on she would pay for; she took a 1 l. note out of a handkerchief, and said she would go and fetch 10 s. worth of half-pence; that she was going to get it a little way from his shop, and would be back soon. Mr. Mott said he had plenty of silver, and would accommodate her with change. A lady came in and asked to see a ring which was in the window, it did not fit her. Mr. Mott said he should have a variety to-morrow, and as she was going out she took up the prisoner's basket, when she got to the door, the prisoner observed it - she had not been in the shop above ten minutes, and stood next to the prisoner - the prisoner got her basket again. Mr. Mott immediately said he missed two gold rings, and two base ones were substituted for them; she said she did not take them, and it was unknown to her, and requested to be searched. Mr. Mott said he had no female in the house. I afterwards assisted in searching her. I found nothing on her, and she was afterwards given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She denied it, and behaved as an innocent woman would - A. Certainly. She took her gown and stays off, and shook them; I did not touch her clothes, nor did the maid who was with me.</p>

            . I am a constable; I took the prisoner to the Compter in a coach with Mr. Mott; I found a metal ring in the palm of her hand, in her glove, besides a gold and paste one, which she had on her finger. She was endeavouring to shuffle it down.</p>
               <p>MR. MOTT. I missed the gold ring, and found a metal one substituted for it before the other woman came into the shop; I missed one from the second card; I could not mistake them for gold rings for a moment, one is rather broader, which matches the second card, but it could not impose on a tradesman for a moment. The other woman did not touch the cards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will take my much injured case into your consideration. I went with intent to purchase a wedding ring, having unfortunately lost my own. I met my father in Old-street-road, on the Saturday before, and told him of the accident, he expressed his sorrow, and it being too late, and not being provided with sufficient money, he said I had better leave it till next week, and I bought a gilt ring as a substitute. On the following week, as I was going to my father's at Hackney, I called at the shop of Mr. Mott, when this unfortunate circumstance took place. I hope you will be satisfied I am not a person of that description.</p>

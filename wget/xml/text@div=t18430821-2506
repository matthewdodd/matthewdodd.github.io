                  </hi>. I live in Old North-street, Red Lion-square. About one in the morning of the 25th of August I was in Falcon-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner caught hold of me by the coat and wished me to give her something—I desired her to go away, and went into the road to avoid her—I left her, and as I passed round into Aldersgate-street I put my hand on my breast and my pin was gone—it was there a quarter of an hour before—I had stopped with no one else—as I turned I saw a policeman—he went and took her—this is my pin.</p>

About one o'clock on this morning I was passing Falcon-street—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor—the prosecutor was putting out his hand, telling her to keep away from him—he crossed the street, and crossed again, telling her to keep off-—she went towards Goswell-street, and the prosecutor towards the Post-office—I told her if I saw her do that again I would take her up—the prosecutor then spoke to me—I went and spoke to the prisoner about the pin—she was in the act of taking it from her shawl—as soon as she found I felt it, she said, "Here it is"—gbe begged and prayed he would not prosecute her.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Woodhouse, of No. 56, Torrington-square. On the 19th of February, I was going through <placeName id="t18290219-120-crimeloc685">Little Russell-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You said before the Magistrate that you met the prisoner and another man? A. Yes - there were three, but I do not think the third was one of the party; only two laid hold of me: I cannot tell what became of the third -I endeavoured to call Watch! and got my face scratched; they put a hand on my mouth: they took my watch-chain and seals, by force - the watch remained, as the rivet in the ring broke, or they would have had the watch, but the guard prevented it; I did not feel my property taken: I did not feel the chain break - I missed it directly: the watchman came up, and took the prisoner off me - I was on my face and hands, and the two men were on the top of me; he took them off, but was obliged to let one go.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow did they knock you down with? A. One of them gave me a blow on the forehead, which made it bleed; it did not prevent my knowing what was going on - I have not found my property at all: I am certain my chain and seals were safe when they laid hold of me - I had buttoned my coat round at the top a few minutes before, and saw my seals; they were petit-ore: the watchman took the prisoner to the watch-house - the other made his escape; I had not power to help the watchman - they had escaped before I was up: I am positive the prisoner is one of the men who dragged me up the court - he was in my sight till I was knocked down, and when the watchman came up he was on the top of me, which was not quite five minutes; I had spent the evening at the corner of Little Wild-street, not at a public-house; I had drank a little: there was only I and two young men - I parted with them about half-past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been doing for the half hour? A. I do not know that it was half an hour; I parted with them in Wild-street - I left them in the house: I went straight to Russell-street, but I met a young man whom I knew, and I just stopped to speak to him; I cannot positively say how much I drank - I was in a sufficient state to identify the prisoner as one of them; I suppose I was the worse for liquor, but quite sufficiently collected to identify him.</p>

            . I live in St. Giles', and am a watchman. On Saturday morning, at half-past one o'clock, I was crying the hour, and as I came along I heard a screaming, and ran into this passage; the prisoner and two more were on the top of the prosecutor, who was on his face and hands - his face was downwards: I collared the prisoner and another, and fearing they would serve me out. I was obliged to let one go, to spring my rattle, and kept the prisoner; I took him to the watch-house- his hat and the prosecutor's were in the court; I sent another watchman for them: the prosecutor came out of the court when I brought the prisoner out - he made the charge against him, of robbing him of his seals and chain, in his presence; the prisoner said some of them dragged the prosecutor in, and he went into the court to see - but he was the man who was on the top of the prosecutor when I went in, and I detained him; the prosecutor appeared against him next morning: I looked about when I got on my beat, in about ten minutes, but found none of the property; the prisoner had no hat on - he claimed one of those found in the court; the other two had their hats on - I did not see the hats found in the court myself: the prosecutor was very sober - there was no sign of liquor; I do not know the prisoner - he was sober also.</p>

            . Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is one of the persons who met you in the street? A. I am certain he is one of those who laid hold of me before I went into the court; he assisted in dragging me into the court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the time in question I was on the other side of Russell-street, and heard the prosecutor cry Murder! and Watch! I ran over to see what was the matter, and stumbled over him; two men ran away - the watchman came up directly, took me, and said I was one of them; I said "If so I should have run away:" the prosecutor did not charge me with robbing him at the watch-house, but with an assault - he was very tipsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Mary's, Islington. I am a clerk—it is my own dwelling house—at 11 o'clock on the night of 11th March I and my family went to bed—my mother was the last person up—she is not here—when I went to bed, the house was safe and secure—I looked over it—at 7 o'clock next morning I found the house had been broken open—the back door and the staircase window were open—the sash had been <hi rend="italic">slid</hi> up—there are no shutters—I cannot say for certain how the sash was the night before—the window was shut down close—the back kitchen door had had the bar taken down, and was wide open—it was barred up the night before, at 11 o'clock—my brother went down stairs first—I missed my over coat and my hat, and that was all I missed at the time, out of the hall—I have seen the coat since—I know this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—the other is my father's—the night before one was in the hall, and the other in the front kitchen—at 7 o'clock they were gone—I missed seven spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs—two or three of the spoons were good ones, and the rest were common, <hi rend="italic">albata</hi> or something of that sort—in the front garden we found a treacle plaster made to fit over a pane of glass—they did not get in at that window—they put a plaster on to break the window, so as to carry the piece away without making a noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the two prisoners—I know Taylor very well—I lived with him—I lived with Barrett for a little while, in the same house—I recollect the male prisoner, more than a month ago, going out, I should think, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—he took with him a treacle plaster in brown paper—about 7 o'clock the same morning he came back with two coats on his back—I should know the coats again—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—he also brought some sugar-tongs, a hat, and some gloves—he asked the other prisoner (Barrett) to go with the coats, to pawn them—that was in the morning—I did not hear him say anything at the time besides telling her to pawn them—I went with her to pawn them—she pawned them at Barr's, the top of Osborn-street—he wore the other coat for about a week, and sent it to the other pawnbroker's—he sent that by the prisoner—I did not hear what he said to her when he gave it to her to pawn—I never saw any more of the spoons</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a pawnbroker, in Osborn-street, Whitechapel. I produce a coat, pawned by the female prisoner, on 12th March—I do not recollect whether anybody was with her—I cannot tell what time of the day it was—we can always tell who pledges the articles—sometimes we have 400 people in our shop in the day—this case was brought to my notice a fortnight after—we take no memorandum of the person, merely of the thing, and get rid of it as quick as we can if other people are waiting.</p>

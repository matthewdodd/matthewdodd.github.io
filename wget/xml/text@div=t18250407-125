            . I am a watchman. I heard an alarm not far from my box, which is at the end of Tottenham-court-road - I went out and heard this man call for the watch; he had hold of the woman, and said she had taken the coat, but she denied it; he said, she had had half-a-crown; she denied that, but said, the next day, at Marlborough-street, that she had the half-crown, but not the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down and saw him at the door of the next house; when he came up to my room, we had some altercation about the half-crown, and he struck me several times, and I could do no other but defend myself. As to the coat I know no more of it than a stranger.</p>

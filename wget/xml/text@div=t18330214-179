            . I live in Massetts-place, Bloomsbury. I went to the George and Crown public-house on the 10th of February, to have a glass of spirits and water; the landlord reached it over to me, as I could not get near the bar; I drank it and handed the glass back, and while I was reaching I felt something at my fob - I looked down and saw the prisoner's hand let go of my watch-ribbon; he had drawn it up from the bottom of my fob quite up to the top; every part of the watch, the seal, and the key, had been altered in its position - I put my hand down, and my thumb caught against the ring of the watch, which joins to the watch; the watch was just out - when he found he was detected he commmenced fighting; I warded off his blows, got to the door, and called the officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I called for half a pint of rum, and as I was taking it a fellow shoved it down; this gentleman then accused me of taking his watch - I told him to go for the Policeman - I waited till he came back with one; there were four or five persons between him and me. Witness. I am quite sure he is the person who had hold of my ribbon - he stood next to me when I felt it. I saw his hand let go of the seal and ribbon; I cannot say which hand it was - when I got to the door; I held the door, and called the Policeman, who came and took him.</p>

I put my hand forward, and pushed him away-there were three of them behind me. I put my hand to my fob, and missed my watch-it did not last a moment - I saw the prisoner at my shoulder; I did not observe him at first-there was nobody near me but the three behind and the one before; they all appeared to be engaged together. I seized the prisoner, and never let him go. I never got my watch. I lost my watch, chain, seals, and key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could not swear to me - A. I did not. When I took hold of him, I asked him where my watch was, and he replied, that he knew nothing about it; I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I was passing along the corner of Samuel-street, and observed four men; they appeared to be connected together and talking. I was gone about ten minutes. When I returned, I heard a man had been robbed. The prisoner was in custody; I knew him again. I am quite sure he was one of the four men that I saw standing at the corner; he had a blue coat and white apron on.</p>

I told my father so as soon as I got home. - Armstrong found me out, and took me to the office. Nobody gave me any instructions to swear to him, either by his dress or any thing else.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DOBSON. I am headborough of the parish. I took the prisoner into custody. I did not hear Higley say he could not swear to the man. I never gave the boy(Franks), any directions to swear to the prisoner. I asked him if he was sure the prisoner was the man. I never said I would say, that the prosecutor said he could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Dobson said the man said he could not swear to me. When I was examined, the prosecutor said, if his watch was made good to him, he would not prosecute me. My brother gave him a watch, and he promised me not to appear against me; the watch was deposited in Bradstone's hands.</p>
               <p>HIGLEY re-examined. I said if he was innocent, I should not wish to hurt him, before he was taken. I said if he would produce my watch, I would not go against him. I never received a watch not to prosecute him; the prisoner offered to give me one or make any recompence I thought proper. I refused it-no watch was given to me. I heard nothing of it.</p>
               <p>DOBSON re-examined. When he was going to the watchhouse, he said he would give the prosecutor a watch, or make him any amends for the watch. I know nothing of a watch being deposited.</p>

               <p>Were you in such a situation that you could observe the person of each? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you only conclude that you know Pearman by observing a person rather taller? - His cutting me three times in one place, it went to my very soul, I caught at the hanger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have told us, it was the tallest man that struck you with the hanger? - Yes, but the other laid upon me.</p>
               <p>You staid late at the alehouse? - Yes, this business detained me at the alehouse, I only drank one pint of potter and one glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Sober.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a darkish night, but the light came on, it was morning.</p>
               <p>There was no moon? - No.</p>
               <p>You were not near any lamps I believe? - No.</p>

               <p>How long might this business be transacting? - That is impossible for me to give an account of, it might be five or ten minutes.</p>

               <p>How soon afterwards was it that you saw either of these two men? - I believe it was the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Was not it Thursday? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You recollect, that before you did see them you had application from their friends to know if you could identify them? - Not to me, I was kept in a dark room because the surgeon said, that I was in such a state that I must be kept close.</p>
               <p>When did you first see them afterwards? - At my house.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know they came with their friends? - No, not one.</p>

               <p>Were they running? - No, walking a pretty goodish pace, they came up to me pretty near Mare-street gate, it was the side of the road, I asked them where they came from, and if they did not hear of a murder, they said no, I said, I am sure there is a robbery committed, the young fellows said no.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners? - I have seen Pearman before, but I did not know Nash, and then Thomas Defee came up, and said halloo, he said, he knew them, and he lived but three doors off, and I let them go, I heard of this the next morning, and I mentioned this circumstance, and one Mr. Yardley went and fetched one Mr. May to me, and on the Sunday evening these young fellows heating there was a scandal upon them about the neighbourhood came to resign themselves; they went to the Bladebone, but what passed I do not know, I met them both coming back not in custody, and on the Monday young Pearman drank two pints of beer with me at May's house, I know them to be born in the street, and to be hard-working industrious people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And they were not taken again till the Thursday? - They had their second hearing on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Durant. Yes, your honour, I was in liquor, I did not know the prisoners when I stopped them, I was so drunk; there was a hat produced as one of the prisoners, but I never saw them in such a hat, and they both had hats on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have fifty people to the character of these men, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150148"></xptr> Mr. Knowles thinks it is too much to press it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I wore a round hat my round hat was taken from me, and this was a round hat which they took.</p>
               <p>Defee. When Mr. May came to me, he said, one had a round hat, the other a cocked hat on; one in a blue jacket, the other in long clothes, he said one of them must certainly have a bruise at the side of his head, and they were stripped, and I never saw any bruises about them, they was stripped to be searched.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ormsby-street, Kingsland-road, and am employed in a gas factory at Haggerstone. In July, 1853, I became acquainted with the prisoner, who represented himself as nephew of a great Mr. Mead, in the East Indies—he afterwards showed me some letters; I do not know what has become of them—the first way he introduced him<lb></lb>self to me was, he said he had large property left him by an uncle in the East Indies; that he had seen it in the paper, and he was to apply to a soli<lb></lb>citor in Covent-garden; that he had ascertained that he had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the East India Company's hands, which he had become entitled to from the death of his uncle, who was an indigo grower or planter in the East Indies, and that he expected the money every day—he said he had had his pedigree made out and sent out by the East India Company—he wanted a little money, and he applied to me for assistance—I told him I could not assist him—he said if I could afford him a little assistance he would repay me—I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—he had several sums—he called on me on 3rd Sept., and produced this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "East India House, Leadenhall-street, London, 25th August, 1853. Sir,—I am directed by the Honourable Board of Directors to write to inform you that there is a war<lb></lb>rant signed for you to call for the amount of 23,810<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am, Sir, your most obedient, James Wassall, Secretary. To William Mead, Esq., 55, Margaret-street, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road")—I said I did not think Wassall was the secretary's name, as I had seen the secretary's name the night before, Melville—he said there were several secretaries, a secretary to each department—I believed that, and gave him some temporary relief—I think the whole that I let him have amounted to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd shil<lb></lb>lings; and in addition to that, I boarded and lodged him and his wife—I do not know what that cost—he was with me from 1st Dec. until 6th June—I boarded and lodged them, and found him in pocket money as far as I could afford—I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Half-past 2 o'clock, Oct. 4, 1853.

I am now in full possession of which in a few days will come into the public newspapers, and in nine days from to-morrow I must enter my name in the Herald Office, and choose my herald out which I will take; so that is how I stand, to my pleasure and comfort.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner put in the following written Defence:</hi> "In Oct., 1843, an adver<lb></lb>tisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, respecting the next of kin to Samuel Mead, of Bengal, and formerly of Stanstead, Suffolk; to this advertisement the de<lb></lb>fendant was induced to reply, being nephew to the said Samuel Mead; Joseph Fellows, of No. 13, Piccadilly, advised and assisted the defendant in tracing out the necessary pedigree, which was in due time sent out to Bengal, attested, and with the respective seals of the Hon. East India Company, City of Lon<lb></lb>don, and the Public Notary in Leicester-square, in May, 1844; the defendant's claim was admitted in 1845, by letters from India to the defendant, from Josiah Moul; the matter then lay dormant; in 1850 letters directed to the defendant from the Oriental Bank in Bengal were mislaid at the Post-office, in consequence of the defendant's change of domicile from Camberwell to Hackney; these letters were returned back to India from the Post-office in 1851; this fact the defendant ascertained from one Charles Pearce, a cousin of the defendant, who saw the name accidentally in the City, at the Post-office; the defendant had several interviews on this point with the secretary of the Post-office, Colonel Maberly, who informed the defendant that three days previous these said letters had been returned back to India; this was on or about the month of April; the defendant believes that the result of these letters being returned to India was, that the entire property was thrown into the Courts of Bengal by a process similar to the Court of Chancery in this country; since then the defendant has not heard anything further relative to his claim; the property in India was sold for 230,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there is now six years interest due, and Mr. H. Brown holds a letter from Bengal to that effect; Samuel Mead was the paternal uncle to the defendant; he left one son, named David, who died without a will in 1843; Benjamin Albeonella, of Bengal, came over to this country on or about the month of May, 1844, to identify the defendant, which he did, and specified all the documents, &amp;c., as correct, &amp;c.; unfortunately for the defendant all the papers, vouchers, letters, &amp;c., in this matter were placed in the safe keeping of one H. Brown, solicitor, No. 13, Union-court, Old Broad-street, who has absconded, and the defendant cannot by any means discover or learn the address of the said Brown; Sarah Ann Albeonella, cousin to the defendant's wife (born Harriet Pearce), willed the defendant's wife the sum of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year, in the French funds, by a will executed in Paris in the year 1844, and proved in March, 1845; this will the defendant expects daily from Paris, in order to produce; (the defendant can explain why this property has not been realized; there is now a sum of about 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due in Dec. next); in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180009"></xptr>
               <p>the month of May, 1844, an advertisement was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> by that Joseph Fellows, above named, on behalf of the defendant, to obtain for him a loan of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; several money lenders replied to the advertisement, but no conclusion was come to with any; the said Joseph Fellows obtained from one Thomas Wilkinson (since a bankrupt), on or about June, 1844, the loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which the defendant was induced by the said Joseph Fellows to give a bond on the India property for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the defendant only received from the said Fellows the small sum of 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of which sum he deducted the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, reducing this small amount to 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the charge against the defendant is, that he cannot produce the documents relating to this matter, which he cannot do for the reason before stated; the prosecutor, Benjamin Goodwin, claims from the defendant 242<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which sum the defendant received but 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this prosecutor holds a bill for 999<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by the defendant, accepted by Arthur Death, a baker, and indorsed by me to John Plum, a dairyman and cowkeeper, and several deeds and documents relating to houses and landed property, belonging to the defendant, and situated in Ipswich, and elsewhere, in the county of Suffolk; the prosecutor, William Matthews, claims from the defendant the sum of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for rent and cash due; this was incurred by the defendant, on the promise that this debt was to be repaid whenever the defendant obtained his rights; the defendant promised him a situation, and the houses for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he, the prosecutor, held a bill or promissory note; William Smith, the prosecutor, swears falsely as to the amount due by the defendant; he claims about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when in reality there is due 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., partly for groceries, and partly for cash; but the defendant had paid several amounts to this prosecutor previously; the defendant obtained altogether, as loans and credit for goods on his India expectations, something under the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not, as falsely stated by the pro<lb></lb>secutor, 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Benjamin Sharp, as butchers, in New-street, Dorset-square—Goodiff was in our service seven or eight weeks—I know Prime by sight by coining to the shop—on the 16th of March, I was returning home about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and passing my shop, I saw Goodiff with his back towards me, and Prime holding a cloth by three corners—I saw Goodiff take some meat and give it to Prime—it was put into the cloth—I did not go into the shop at the moment—as soon as Prime saw me, he said to Goodiff, "Hush," and threw the cloth and meat behind some carcases of mutton—he then took up a piece of neck of mutton, and said, "Weigh this for me, I am unwell"—I walked into the shop—Goodiff asked me how ranch it was,—it weighed 2 3/4 lbs. —I said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I then took the doth and meat from behind the sheep, and said, "What a shame it is to rob me in this way, not retail, but wholesale"—the cloth contained a fore-loin of pork, and the chump end of a loin of mutton—the prisoners both said they knew nothing about it—I then asked Prime if the cloth belonged to him—he pretended to look at it, and said it did not—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the mutton, and walked out of the shop—I observed the initials "H. P." on the cloth—I did not at that time know Prime's name—I then called to Groves, our clerk, to pay Goodiff his wages, which he did—I accused him of the theft, which he denied—he went away—I afterwards went with the police to Prime's house—he opened the door, and I gave him in charge—we searched the house, and found some cloths with initials correspond<lb></lb>ing to the one in my shop, and almost all his things were marked "H. P."—in consequence of information I afterwards examined my premises, and found marks of pieces of fat on the cover of the water-closet, which is in the passage leading to the slaughter-house—I also found a hole in the ceil<lb></lb>ing of the stable, but could not see any marks there.</p>

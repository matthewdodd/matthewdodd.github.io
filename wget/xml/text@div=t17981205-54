               <p>Q. Have you seen it since? - A. Yes, at the Police-office, Worship-street; that, I think, was on the 27th, it was on a Tuesday; I believe it to be mine, but I cannot swear to it; I have a servant here who has had the care of it, and I believe, can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen it? - A. I had missed it about two days; I had the looking over the saddles and bridles.</p>
               <p>Q. And have not other persons been employed by Mr. White to look after them? - A. Yes, when I was absent.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street, (produces a saddle and bridle): On Friday, the 3d of November, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner knocking at the door of a sadler's, in Worship-street; there was nobody answered from the house; I asked the prisoner who he wanted; he said, Mr. Watson; I told him I would shew him Mr. Watson if he would go with me to a public-house; he said, no; then says I, I will see what you have in your bag; he said, it was a saddle he wanted to get stuffed; I took it to the office, and found it was a saddle and bridle; I asked him where he lived, and he told me; I went, and found it was true.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050058"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was a place, natural enough, to take a saddle to that wanted mending? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no scruple of telling you where he lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Butler. This is the saddle that I missed, I know it by frequently riding upon it, five or six times a day; I have had it under my care a long time, it is very rough; and the bridle has got a cut about the middle of the rein, which one of my fellow-servants did, in whetting his razor when it was new.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you never see another bridle with a cut in it in your life? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The saddle you say is rough, was that roughness from wear? - A. No; that would make it smoother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see so rough a one before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing wonderful in that? -

            No.</p>
               <p>White. I believe it is my saddle, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does that saddle want repairing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Be so good as look at the stuffing; does not it want stuffing? - A. No, it does not; and I had given him no orders to get it stuffed.</p>
               <p>Q. It has happened, perhaps, where a man has a friend, a sadler, that he can get it done a little cheaper, it is a common thing for them to take it to their own friend? - A. I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Butler.) Q. Had you given him any orders to get this done? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I intended to repair the saddle myself, for fear of anger from my master, and pay for it myself out of my own pocket.</p>

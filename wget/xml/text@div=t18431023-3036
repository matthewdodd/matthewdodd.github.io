                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker, and live in Harrow-street. I was employed at some premises in Park-street, Camden-town—the prisoner was on the premises when I went there—I took off three pieces of lead—one piece I threw down into the yard, the other two laid on the party wall—that was about eleven or twelve o'clock, on the 3rd of Oct.—about five I received a communication from the policeman—I then missed the lead.</p>

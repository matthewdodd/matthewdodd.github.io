               <p>Are you certain he is the person? - Yes, I knew him again as soon as I saw him; it was about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; it was light, and I could well discern his face. I never saw him to my knowledge before; nor did I see him then, till he had hold of my collar, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Was any person near at the time? - Three gentlemen were coming from Kentish-Town, who were within a minute's walk of me; I did not see them till after he had robbed me.</p>
               <p>How long was the transaction about? - I suppose not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>During that two minutes, you must be in some agitation of spirits? - I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Could you take such accurate observations of the person of the man, as to swear positively that the prisoner is the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any person with him? - He was alone; he had a great stick in his hand; he took me by the collar, and in a little time he said, Your money! I said, I have but a few shillings about me; I hope you will not take it from me. He said, Little or much, do not hesitate, or I will have your life.</p>
               <p>Did he, when he made use of this expression, stammer as he does now? - I did not hear any such thing. I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out an handful of silver: I had about 40 s. in my pocket; I left only an half-crown and a shilling in my pocket. He said, Here is not all; turn your pocket. I put my hand into my pocket again, and took out the half-crown and shilling. I said here is all; you may have my pocket turned, if you will; but I hope you will not take it at all. He gave me the half-crown again, and took the shilling. When he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300017"></xptr> shilling, he pointed to my watch, and said, What is that watch? I said, I hope you will not take my watch. He immediately laid hold of the chain, and drew it out: he turned about. I said, Pray don't take my watch; it will grieve me to lose it, more than my money. He said, He had taken it. He turned, and went away. There is a gap at the corner of the field; I saw a man there. I said to him, Are you an honest man? He seemed staggered. I said, If you are an honest man, help me to take that man, pointing to the prisoner; he has robbed me of my watch and money. He said, Are you in earnest? I said, yes. He said, I saw you talking together, but did not know he was robbing you. While I was speaking to that man, two gentlemen came up: I told them the same. The man disappeared: we thought he had got into a ditch; we all went back, but did not find him. I gave information of the robbery at the office in Bow-street: I was afterwards sent for to Bow-street; I was shewn a man, and asked if I knew him; I said I did not. I was then taken into another room, where there was the prisoner and another man; I knew the prisoner immediately; I had a hint not to say any thing to him, if I knew him. I was taken before the justice a little after, and saw him there, and knew him directly.</p>

               <p>In what manner did he give his answers? Did he speak stuttering and stammering? - Sometimes he stammered, sometimes he did not; he swore very plain.</p>
               <p>Have you had conversation with him? - No farther than taking him that morning. He never stammered a bit then; but he stammered twice at the bar. When he speaks softly, he does not stammer at all.</p>
               <p>If he was to stop a man upon the highway, do you think he would stammer then? - I cannot say: he never stammers when he speaks slow; he speaks plain then; but if he speaks quick, he stammers.</p>

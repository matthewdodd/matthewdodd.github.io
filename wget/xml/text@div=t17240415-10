But some Persons present desir'd the Court to inquire whether he had not been out of his Service during his Apprenticeship, and at Sea for 18 Months, or more? To which he reply'd, he had, but he receiv'd his Wages, and so accounted him to have serv'd his Time to him Faithfully. He was also interrogated, whether he had not so behav'd himself in his Service, that he procur'd him to be committed to Bridewell? He acknowledged he had so done, but would insinuate, it was only for being drunk or so. The Court perceiving him to prevaricate in favour of the Prisoner, order'd him to be taken into Custody, and bound by Recognizance with two Securities to appear at the Court the next Sessions, to answer to such Matters as should be alledg'd against him. Two or Three other Persons appear'd to his Reputation, who depos'd, That they knew no ill of him.</p>

But being interrogated, whether the Prisoner was never from him, nor at London in all that Time? He did own that he had sometimes come to London about his Business, but came Home to him again orderly; nor could he take upon him on Oath to say the Prisoner was actually at Tottenham with him, when, according to the Evidence, this Fact was committed. The Prisoner's Sister spoke also much to the same Purpose.

            . I am a watchman; when I went my rounds about ten that night, I tried the pin of the window, as is my constant method, I found it fast; I tried it again also at eleven, and found it the same; when I came by again about twelve, I found the window-shutter was drawn three parts open, as far as it could hang without falling down; I looked in, and saw the prisoner standing upright in the shop; I asked him what business he had there; he said, d - n you, what is that to you; I said, you have no business there; he said, I am waiting for my master, he is at the masquerade, and will be here in a minute or two; I said, the masquerade is not kept here; I alarmed the people, he rolled himself down on the board, and lay as if he was asleep; the prosecutor's servant came down, and gave me charge of him.</p>

               <p>Pratt. The pin of the window is a square pin, it could not be turned round; there are a couple of iron bars above to let in air; we found by my master's trying a man might put in his hand there, and reach down and unkey the bar of the window; we did not think it could have been done till my master tried.</p>

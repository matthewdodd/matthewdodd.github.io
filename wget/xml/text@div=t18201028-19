On the 16th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was coming from town alone, and when I got within four miles of home, just on this side of the stone bridge on the Harrow-road, near the Coach and Horses, public-house, I heard the sound of some people in the road, in a kind of a trot run - it appeared the sound of more than one person. I stopped a moment, and three of them passed me in the road. I said</p>
               <p>"I wish you good night, gentlemen, you seem in a hurry" - they made no answer, but went on twelve or fourteen yards, and jumped up on the footpath. When I came up to them one or two others came behind me, and patted me on the shoulder; one of those before me said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, have you got any money?" I said</p>
               <p>"No, I am only a hard-working man, have nothing to depend on but the sweat of my brow, and have been out of a situation since February - you cannot expect I have much about me." I had scarcely spoken these words before those in front turned my waistcoat pocket inside out, took my tobacco-box and penknife, took my watch from my fob, which cost me seven guineas and a half, and about 9 s. in silver from my pocket - they also took some halfpence and three balls of worsted from my coat pocket - they returned the worsted. When they were going to rob me, I told them I hoped they did not intend to ill-use me; one of them said No, if I did not resist.</p>
               <p>Q. You know none of them - A. No, it was very dark. I said I thought none of them were much taller than myself, but I could not exactly tell; they might have stooped. On the 9th of October I saw a white-handled penknife in the hands of Lack, which was that I lost; I have found nothing else.</p>

            . I was in company with my brother officers on the Harrow-road for near a week, and on Saturday night, the 30th of September, about eight o'clock; the prisoners, Hughes and Smith, passed as; Hunt and Eaton came on, and bid us good night - they were about one hundred yards behind the others. Limbrick, Chapman, and Woodbury were with me. We jumped up and pursued them all; they were walking on. Hunt and Eaton were then before Smith and Hughes. I went up to Smith, and said,</p>
               <p>"What are you doing here? I am an officer." He directly pulled out this pistol - (producing it.) I seized it by the barrel, and wrenched it from him, it was loaded with powder and shot. I handcuffed him, turned my head round, and Eaton was by his side; I collared him, and Woodbury came to my assistance. I searched Smith, and found on him a half-crown, a shilling, a six pence, and a pocket-piece; and on Eaton I found five half-crowns, two shillings, two-pence, and a knife. Limbrick took Hughes, and Chapman took Hunt. Perkins claimed the knife. A pistol was found on Hunt in my presence.</p>

I have had it about six weeks. I bought it when I was making hat-boxes in the Summer, and bought a pair of scissars at the same time.</p>

In the Evening I shut the Sash-door next the Street, but did not bolt it, and went backward to light Candles. In about 5 Minutes I return'd with the Candles, and found the Door open.

            , and I went all together. And as we were passing by the backside of the first House, from Tower-hill, going into Rag-fair, we look'd in at a Window, where there was a Candle, and saw Whitesides trying on a pair of the Gloves; upon which we went to the Fore-door, and found Marshall shutting up the Stall (it was an Apple-stall;) we search'd him, and took one pair of Gloves out of his Pocket, and then we went in; but having made some Disturbance in seizing Marshall, I suppose Whitesides took the Alarm and hid the Gloves; for at our first going into the Back-room we could find nothing but the Paper they had been wrapp'd in, and one pair lying loose on the Dresser: However, upon farther search we found the rest under a Cherry-Sieve. Whitesides ran up Stairs, and Marshall got into the Cellar; but we got a Constable and secur'd them both.</p>

As I stood at my Door, a Girl was singing Ballads, and Whitesides came and saunter'd about her for some time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270003"></xptr> and all on a sudden he was gone. I was hardly three Minutes after, when Robert Alcock came out, and said, he had lost a Parcel of Gloves. I told him what a loose Chap I had seen, and that if we went immediately to Rag-fair, it was a Chance if we did not find him a selling the Gloves in some of the Gin-ships. So we and 2 more went, and at a Back-window, I saw Whitesides standing by a Candle, and trying a Pair on. We took Marshall at the Door, and found a pair of Gloves in his Pocket, and going backwards, Whitesides ran up, and Marshall down Stairs. One pair of Gloves lay on the Dresser, and the rest we found under a Cherry-sieve, which a Girl was sitting on. Marshall bid Whitesides go and fetch the Man they bought the Gloves of, and Whitesides would fain have gone, but we would not trust him.</p>
               <p>Whitesides. I was try'd here last Sessions, and resolving to get clear of ill Company I enter'd my self on board a Ship; but going to take Leave of my Brother, I met Marshall, who ask'd me to buy a pair of Gloves, and so I stepp'd into the House to try them on.</p>
               <p>Marshall. That's very true, for Whitesides is an innocent Man. I found the Gloves in a Dust-hole by the Postern on Tower-hill, and meeting one Mrs Pattison, she desir'd me to call at the Corner-house going to Rag-fair, and help the Girl (

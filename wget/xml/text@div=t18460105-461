                  </hi>. I live at Brixton. The prisoners were in my service—Nye had been my cook about three months, and Wilson was my parlour<lb></lb>maid—having missed some wine and other things, I concealed myself in a small room on the landing, in my house, on Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., instead of going to church, as I generally did—my wife went to church, and soon after she left the house, I heard the prisoners get the key of the china-closet, which was kept immediately at the bottom of the stairs—the servants were not allowed to get the key of the china-closet, but they disco<lb></lb>vered where we kept it, and they went and got it—I heard them at the china<lb></lb>closet—in closet—in that closet we kept the keys of all the cupboards, and the wine<lb></lb>cellar—I then distinctly heard the prisoners go to the wine-cellar, which is on the basement, and after being there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I heard them lock the cellar-door, go up stairs, replace the key of the wine<lb></lb>cellar in the china-closet, and the key of the china-closet where it had been before—on the evening of that day Nye was going out, and immediately she got out, I met her, and said I wanted to speak to her—I led her back into the dining-room, and told her I had too much reason to believe she had been robbing me, I was in fact certain of it—she denied it for a very long time, till I told her I and my son had been secreted that morning, and on the Sunday morning previous—she then said, "Have mercy on me, I did take wine, t did take some tea, I did take the shirt"—she begged and implored me to be merciful in consideration of a child which she said she had, and I did not give her in charge then—I went down stairs and told Wilson I was satisfied she had been robbing me—she denied it for a long time, till she discovered that the cook had criminated her—she then said, "I did take tea, I did take wine and ale"—I then asked Nye about the wine—she said it was sour wine they had taken that day—I said, "Where is it?"—she said, "Mary," meaning Wilson "can tell you; it is down stairs"—I took Wilson down, and said, "I insist on your finding this wine"—after a great deal of hesitation, she put her hand up the kitchen chimney, and took down three quarters or half a bottle of claret—there were several empty bottles about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wheeler, of Enfield. On Sunday, 9th March, I went up-stairs, and opened a box—I missed a dress, and my husband's trowsers and breeches—these are them; I had seen them safe about a fortnight before—on 6th March I had bees at work at Mr. Humble's—I left my house after dinner, a little before one o'clock—the window was shut, and not broken—on my return at night, I found it Woken—a person could then put in their hand and undo a button, which would enable them to open the window, which was large enough to admit a person.</p>

On the Thursday before I was before the Magistrate, I saw my mother with a pair of trowsers, a black dress, and a Pair of breeches, between two and three o'clock in the day—these are them—I am sure she had not been out of the house before that time—she had been out at the back-door—Mrs. Wheeler's place is fenced off by a hedge from the yard my mother went to—after my mother had tied up the</p>

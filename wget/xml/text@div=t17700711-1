The prisoner came to my house, and wanted to go to the necessary, which is in the cellar; as I suspected him, when he came up, I went down into the cellar, and I found two casks turned upside down, and the cocks taken out of them. I called to my maid to bring him back; he was gone but two or three doors. I sent for a constable, who took them out of his pocket in my presence. The boy lighted him down to the cellar, and the cocks were in the barrels then.</p>

               <p>I had been as far as Whitechapel. I happened to go into this house, I believe, I am not positive,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110003"></xptr> for I was in liquor; as to the cocks, I know nothing of them. I always bore a good character. I lived in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, fourteen years. I could bring many people to my character, if I had time. I have had thirteen children. I am a broker, and live in Liquorpond-street.</p>

               <p>Court. That is not a very reputable neighbourhood, is it? - No Sir, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court. What had you to do there? - I goes out with tatoes round there, they asked me for something to drink, I said I did not care if I did, they said I had better not go to a public house for fear I should lose my money, I went to their room.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - It was a remarkable wet day, I had drank a little drop.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray what do you call a little drop? - I had drank some gin with these women but I was sensible; when I got in I took and pulled my pouch out.</p>

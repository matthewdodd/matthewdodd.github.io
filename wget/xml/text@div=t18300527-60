            . The prisoner was in my service, and left me - I then missed some articles; one handkerchief was pawned at a house in Holborn.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not search her boxes? A. Yes, but she turned the things over so fast, that I did not see any thing of mine, but they were found in her box afterwards; I have no reason to suspect that my husband was too intimate with her - he loathed the sight of her; I am surprised she should dare to say so - the Police-man took her, and brought her box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TILLING. I received information from the prosecutrix that she suspected the prisoner; I took her to the house, and searched her - I found some duplicates on her; one of them for this handkerchief, and this other handkerchief and apron were in her box.</p>

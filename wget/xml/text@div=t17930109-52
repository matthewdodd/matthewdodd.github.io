            , and he brought me a warrant down; I went to the King's head in Wood-street, there I found the defendant Crosfield in custody with the bail and Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson wished me to execute the writ; but I objected to do it, because he was in custody of his bail. In some other transactions we went to Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Wilson expressly wished me to execute that warrant; I objected to executing the writ because Mr. Clowes, the plaintiff in the writ, was one of the bail in the former transaction, and it was by his consent that I should not execute that writ; that he said in the hearing of the prisoner Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Wilson say? - He did not say any thing than that he desired me to execute it; I did not execute it, I took it away with me and left the defendant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090081"></xptr>in custody of his bail; there was much conversation about it, but I thought it not proper to execute it; I recommended the bail to take the defendant Crosfield into Middlesex. In about half an hour after the bail brought the defendant Crosfield to my house, and Mr. Wilson was with them; the bail stayed with me till about eleven, and they left the defendant; I conceived it to be on this writ, Mr. Wilson went away in the coach with them, Mr. Wilson did not stop at all; I detained him on this transaction.</p>

            . The two Women took away my Wallet, and carry'd it up Stairs. P follow'd, and there I found the Prisoner, and Richardson and Matthews. The Prisoner, and Richardson escaped out at Window, and I could never find who the Prisoner was till last Sessions; we took up Matthews, and he told us where to find him. The Prisoner confess'd that he had sold 2 pair of Stockings, and an odd one, as he was going to Deptford. I ask'd him how he came by them? He said, when he got out of Window, he jump'd upon them, and some others, which he took up and carry'd off; but he dropt some of them in the Road.</p>

            , Beadle. When the Prisoner was in St. Giles's Round House, he confess'd that he was concern'd in taking the Stockings, and that he drop'd some of them in the Road.</p>
               <p>Foxly, Watchman. As the Prisoner was going to the Round House, he confess'd to me, that Betty-Yates turn'd him out of the Window, and shew'd him the way over the Wall, where she had thrown the Stockings ; and told him, if he did not go that way, the Constable and Watch would meet him; that he got over the Wall, and stept on several pair of Stockings, which he took up, but drop'd some of them in going along, and the Remainder which was 2 pair and an odd one he sold to a Woman at Deptford. I shew'd him these other 2 pair of Stockings and an odd one, which I found in Islington Road, and he said, that he believ'd these were the same that he drop'd. This odd one that I found, and this odd one which he sold at Deptford are Fellows.</p>

He got up soon after, and came to me, and swore he had been robb'd, and would secure us all, and so he went down Stairs.

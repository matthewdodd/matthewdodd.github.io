               <p>Q. Was your shop open at that time - A. The shutters were down, but the door was shut. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070031"></xptr>door was upon the latch. There was no one in the shop at that time but me. The dwelling-house is over the shop, and there is a communication from the shop to the dwelling-house. It is all under one roof. I was standing in the middle of the shop; I heard a person in the shop, but not until he was going out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the noise of somebody going out, did you look to see - A. Yes, I did, directly. I saw the prisoner going out with two pieces of linen. I have here one under each arm. I directly pursued him, and did not lose sight of him until he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from the shop was he taken - A. He was taken from fifty to an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two bundles that he had in the mean time - A. He dropped both the bundles on the pavement, within a few yards from where he was apprehended. One of the witnesses held him while I took the linen in my possession. I have had the linen in my possession ever since. I have kept them in the room that I sleep in. This is the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm when you went out after him - A. Yes, I did. I called out, stop thief. This is one piece of linen, and this is the other. I knew them by my own mark, which I put on them when I took them in my possession. They are worth nine pounds, the two pieces together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of, stop thief, on this morning that we have been speaking of - A. Yes. I heard at the same time something drop by our shop door. I went to the door and saw these two pieces of linen laying by our door, and I saw the prisoner running a cross the street. I ran after him, and caught him at the corner of the street. I took him from there to Bow-street. There was no sitting magistrate there. I took him from thence to Covent Garden watchhouse. I knew

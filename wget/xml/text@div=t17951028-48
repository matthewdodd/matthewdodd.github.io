I see the prisoner in a watchman's coat, he had no lanthorn, he had a large stick. I asked him where the gunsmith's shop was, he made me no answer, but took me by the collar, held up his stick, and said, where is your money? where I say a word, and I will knock you down. I had the advantage of taking the stick in both my hands, which I did, and pushed him against the wall, being in so public a street, I thought I should get assistance, which I did, several people came, and took, him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober at the time? - Not knowing the man, I cannot say; he made use of a very queer expression afterwards, he said, insult me? would you insult the Prince of Wales? That was some considerable time after he was taken. At the time he first attacked me, there was not a single soul in the street, he had his watchman's great coat on, and some people said, let us examine, and see if he was a watchman or no; on examining further, we found that he was a watchman, but it was not his hour of being out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you not inclined to think that he was intoxicated with liquor from his whole conduct? - I am sorry to say, I have reasons not to think so.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to his character, and proved, that when he drank too much, he was like a madman.</p>

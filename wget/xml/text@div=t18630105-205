I am a machinist, at 1, Rolls-court, Fore-street—about ten weeks ago I saw the prisoner at a public-house—a man named Welsh was there—this worsted jacket was lying on the table—the prisoner picked it up, took it to Welsh, and showed it to him, and said, "That is the jacket you want"—he tried it on, and said, "How much?"—the prisoner said, "Half a crown;" and Welsh paid it to him.</p>

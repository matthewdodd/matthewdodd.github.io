Savage spoke to me, and pointed out the prisoners—I told Johnson I should take him into custody for attempting to pass a bad half-crown at a chemist's shop—he said, "I suppose you want me for the half-crown"—I then took hold of Toll, who was near—they denied knowledge of each other—I searched them then and there—on Johnson I found this half-crown which has been produced, a purse, and a duplicate with the name of Toll upon it—I searched Johnson again at the station, and found 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. good money on him—on Toll I found four half-crowns wrapped up separately in a paper—Johnson said he lived at Bays<lb></lb>water, but refused to say what place—I found out that Toll was in charge of a house at Balham-hill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson's Defence.</hi> I had been lodging with this man for three weeks. I changed a sovereign that morning, and I think I must have taken the half-crown then. I was with Toll at his house till 4 o'clock that afternoon, and then came across Clapham Common with him. I had a headache, and went into the chemist's shop and was told the half-crown was bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Toll's Defence.</hi> The half-crowns I had in my possession I found in the area of the house I was keeping—I had them in my possession from the time of Epsom Races. I had forgotten they were there, and had changed my trousers that day. It is not likely I should try to pass money so near my home. I am perfectly innocent of this.</p>

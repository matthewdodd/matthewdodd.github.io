I reside at 35, Robinson's Road, Hackney Road, and am a widow—on the afternoon of 10th August, between five and six o'clock, I was walking with a friend in the Hackney Road—when we got near the corner of Crabtree Row a man came up and seized me by the brooch and chain, which was round my neck—he pulled me on to the pavement, and pulled me on my face and hands, and cut my face and my fingers—the chain was broken, and he took the best portion of it away—the rest of it was scattered about the street—I became insensible—the man ran away—I could not swear to him myself.</p>

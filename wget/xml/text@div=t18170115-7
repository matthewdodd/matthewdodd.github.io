            . I went with the last witness to take the prisoner into custody, we took him to the watchhouse; Mrs. West was there, she said, he was the man who struck and robbed her. He said, he was not the man who took it, but he knew where it was; he then said, it was at No. 4, Duck-yard, Duck-lane. Two boys, named Anderson and Baker, had been taken up before for the robbery. Anderson was brought out to him, and said, the prisoner was the man who had struck Mrs. West. He denied it. Barker was then brought out, he also said, that the prisoner was the man who had struck Mrs. West; and that they had agreed to meet at Tothill-street to divide the money. The prisoner denied it.</p>

I saw him snatch the bundle, and run into the Park, and I went home through the Park.</p>

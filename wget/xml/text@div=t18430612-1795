                  </hi>. I live in Camomile-street. On the 2nd of June I got rather intoxicated—I left the West-end about nine o'clock to come home-I saw the prisoner in a public-house at Seven Dials—I had two silk pocket handkerchiefs in my coat pocket—I did not lose them—I was too much in toxicated to give the particulars.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 125.) On the 2nd of June, about half I past twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Seven Dials, and saw the pri-soner bringing the prosecutor, who was quite drunk, arm-in-arm up Queen-street—when they got to the public-house the prosecutor stopped—I went to the prisoner, and asked him what he was <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> with the gentleman—he said he knew him, and was going to take him home—he pulled him into the public-house—I went round to another door, and pushed it aside so that I could see them distinctly—I saw them stand a moment or so, and then saw the prisoner put his band on the gentleman's shoulder, push him along the side of the bar towards the door, and then put his right hand into the gentle-man's coat pocket, right up to the sleeve of bis coat—the gentleman turned sharp round, which caused the prisoner to take his hand out again—he then went to the bar, and asked the gentleman what he would stand to drink—they had half a pint of gin, which the prisoner gave to two companions that he knew there—after it was gone the prisoner placed his hands on the gentleman again, pushed him along the bar, and put the same hand into the same pocket again—the gentleman turned again, and the prisoner snatched out his hand again—a man who is very well known to us, came to the door to light his pipe, and saw me—he went and whispered to the prisoner, who then took the gentleman by the arm, and took him out of the house—I took him by the collar, told him what I charged him with, and said he must go to the stanofl—he said he would not, he would see me d----d first—I said if he did not I must use violence, and he then went quietly.</p>

I said to Mr. Fielding, that man has picked my pocket of my handkerchief; then said he, I have got him fast, and laid hold of him. The prisoner turned, and said, Sir, have I picked your pocket? Yes, said I, you have: then I saw the handkerchief fall from the inside of his jacket on his shoe. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. Asterley. After he got his handkerchief again, I gave the prisoner a kick, and said, go about your business: then the prisoner said he would have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280007"></xptr> satisfaction for that kick; then we determined to take him before a magistrate.

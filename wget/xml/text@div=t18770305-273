                  </hi>. I live at 9, Trinity Street, Clerkenwell—about midnight on Saturday, 24th February, I was going home—six or seven men sur<lb></lb>rounded me—the prisoner was one—one of them put his arm and held me back, saying "There's no watch," and the prisoner tore out and rifled my pockets—my hat and handkerchief were gone—I also lost two half-crowns, a shilling, and fourpence—I could not come to my senses for a second—my money fell on the ground—I was thrown on the ground—I afterwards met two constables and said "I have been robbed"—they rushed after the men and caught the prisoner—the handkerchief fell from his hand—I took it up and gave it to the constable.</p>

I live at Hoxton—on 24th February I saw Smith near the Fenton Arms, the prisoner and three or four men they threw him over on his back on the pavement—I was then only a little way off—he called "Stop them"—I saw the prisoner tear Smith's pockets out and the money fall on the pavement—I picked up a concertina which dropped from Smith, and fol<lb></lb>lowed the prisoner.</p>

On the night of 24th February I was in Pentonville Road—Smith came to me in a very excited state and said that he had been robbed, and pointed to the prisoner and other men and I gave chase—the prisoner dropped this handkerchief—when he saw I was gaining upon him he stopped running and walked near some shutters slowly, trying to throw me off.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I had been hard at work a washing, and was just got to bed, and in a sound sleep, when I was call'd up. I found the door and window open, (it was a sash window) and my line striped of things in the kitchen: I mist a tea-kettle, a box-iron, two shirts, two shifts, three aprons, a damask table cloth, and other things, as they are laid in the indictment; and other things which are not found. We have rooms on the ground floor, we lie in one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How were your door and window fastened?</p>
               <p>I. Pemberton. We had lost the key to the window, so it was fastened with a fork on the inside; I had fastened the window and door about nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am a wire-drawer by trade , I lodge at Mr. Pemberton's. As I was going home about a quarter past ten at night, I saw two boys at the top of the court; Wilkes, I know, was one of them; I knew him before. They stood one on one side, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Mr. Pemberton's house?</p>
               <p>Adams. It is about 20 yards distance; I went down the yard, and as I was going in at the door, I met a lad with a bundle coming out. I went in, there was nobody in the house; I called out two or three times; then I perceived the boys, and one of them I believe slipt down an alley in White-cross-street. I laid hold of the two prisoners in White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the three boys all together?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes, he with the bundle join'd the other two; Wilkes had this green apron on; (produced in court) I saw he had linen in it. When I had hold of the two prisoners, they dragged me about the street, and up into a place called White's Yard; I called watch; the boys tried to kick me up; Cooper got from me; I called stop thief; the watchman came at that instant, and laid hold of him; I still kept hold of Wilkes, as he let the things he had fall on the ground; which were the linen, shirts, shifts, aprons, and other things.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was crying the hour 10 o'clock. This man called watch! stop thief! I turned back, and saw Cooper making off, in White's Yard; I laid hold of him; the linen was lying in the yard; I took it up, and carried it with Cooper to the watch-house. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120013"></xptr> tea-kettle and box-iron, was taken up in White's-Yard, and brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoners say for themselves?</p>
               <p>Lefeavor. Wilkes said he picked the things up as he was going along.</p>
               <p>Adams. The watchman that took up the tea-kettle and box-iron is not here. (The things found produced and deposed to by Mrs. Pemberton.)</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was along with one Ben, that sells trotters and neats-feet, in Rosemary-Lane, and met Wilkes; we were coming together. Wilkes went down the alley to case himself. We saw a man run out of the alley, and drop these things, and Wilkes and I picked them up.</p>
               <p>Wilkes's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went down the alley to ease myself, and we saw the man jump out, and drop these things, and we picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Adams. How long was you after the boy run out of the house, before you followed him?</p>
               <p>Adams. It was about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Wilkes at the upper end of the court, had he any thing in his apron then?</p>
               <p>Adams. No, he had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the two prisoners when you came back to the upper end of the court?</p>
               <p>Adams. They were then running down Whitecross-Street. They ran down very near three hundred yards before I laid hold of them. I saw the other boy slip down an alley, just before I laid hold of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cooper one of them you saw first? Or was it him that came out of the house?</p>
               <p>Adams. That I cannot tell. Cooper, and the other, whoever he was, were looking one one way, and the other the other.</p>

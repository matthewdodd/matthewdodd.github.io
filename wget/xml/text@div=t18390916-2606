                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in High-street, Shadwell. On Monday, the 9th of September, about three o'clock, I was reading, in my room behind the shop—my watch and guard were upon the table—I fell asleep for about five minutes, when I was awoke by a slight noise in the room, and saw a boy almost close to me, going out of the room—I jumped up, and said, "What do you do here?"—he said he wanted a pennyworth of tobacco—I said, "You have no business here for tobacco"—I turned round to see if I could miss any thing, and in an instant he was out of my sight—I missed my watch—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live opposite Mrs. Sweeting. On Monday after<lb></lb>noon I saw a boy come out of her shop, and join the prisoner and another, almost opposite my window—they went away together—the prosecutrix came across, and said she had lost a watch—they appeared acquainted—I went after the boys, and saw them going down the stairs to take water—I overtook the prisoner—the waterman said, "He has got a watch in his hand"—I said, "You are the boy I want"—I collared him, but found no watch.</p>

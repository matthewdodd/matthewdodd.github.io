               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had he been in Mrs. Holmes' employ? A.About five years; I have been there twelve years - his coat hung by the side of mine in the workshop; five or six men besides boys work there, but only one other coat hung there - I merely felt the skirt of his coat; a man named Williams and two boys were there - I told Mrs. Holmes in about an hour; she was engaged till then - the coat had not been moved after I found the parcel; Hawkins asked how the parcel came into his pocket - he said he put it in himself, and hoped Mrs. Holmes would excuse him; nothing was said to induce him to confess.</p>

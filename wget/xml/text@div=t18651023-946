                  </hi>. I live at Ebury-street, Pimlico, and am the uncle of the little child, John Riley, who way born on 20th September, 1860—the mother died in November, 1862, and the father in January, 1863—there were four other elder children—I placed this child in the workhouse of St. George, Hanover-square, in February, 1863, and it remained there till August, when I gave him to the Rev. Charles Batt to take charge of, and gave Mr. Batt 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for its maintenance—my brother had bequeathed that sum to me by will for the maintenance of his children—the child's parents were Roman Catholics—I saw the child twice after it had been sent to the prisoners in Lower George-street, Chelsea—it was then just the same as when I fetched it from the workhouse—I saw it once in Hanover-street, it was then in just the same condition—I remember the prisoners removing into Sutherland-street—I saw the child twice there, the last time was nearly two months ago—I did not notice anything extraordinary about it then; nothing to complain of—it was never subject to fits to my knowledge—it was not an idiot, it had the usual intelligence, I should think, for a child of its age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the mother die of consumption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the child was sickly in August, 1863, when I fetched it from the workhouse; it had some sores on it—when I saw it in George-street, Chelsea, the de<lb></lb>fendants children were there; this child was with them on both occasions—the defendants did not know of the hour I was going to visit them—when I saw the child in Hanover-street it was in the kitchen, having its tea with the defendants' children—the defendants did not know that I was coming—the child did not improve in health at Hanover-street, that I could see—I went twice to Sutherland-street—the last time was about a month before this prosecution, about August, this year—the child was in the front kitchen, it was in the evening—there was no meal going on—it could speak—the de<lb></lb>fendant's children were there—my brother's eldest daughter is married and lives at Brixton—there is another girl in the Brompton Oratory, and the two other children were sent down to Hastings; I saw them once, and they were doing very well—I have known the male defendant since I was a child—he has earned his living at a wheelwright's in Pimlico, thirteen or fourteen years; the same employment as myself—I do not know his wages because he worked at piece-work—he used to leave home at six in the morning and knock off work at six in the evening, or later if occasion required—Mrs. Roach was ill about August, I cannot say the exact date—I did not find her in ill-health the last time I went, but she has erysipelas—she kept no nurse or servant—they occupied the front kitchen in Sutherland-street as far as I could see—I only went into the back kitchen once, I passed through it to go to the washhouse—I think there is a door from it into the yard—I do not know of the drainage being complained of—the prisoners have three children, the youngest is about two years old—I have seen John Riley to<lb></lb>day, he looks worse than he did at the Police-court, and as bad but not worse than when I saw him at Sutherland-street, but considerably worse than when I fetched him from the workhouse, in 1863.</p>

               <p>account strictly—the earliest recollection I have is November, 1863—I knew the prisoners at that time, living in Lower George-street, Chelsea, and in the beginning of November I spoke to Mrs. Roach with regard to taking care of this child, and arranged to pay her 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month for doing so—my first payment to her was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 3d November, 1863, and I have paid her 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the beginning of every mouth up to the time she was taken in cus<lb></lb>tody—I once or twice paid her two months at a time in advance, as she gave me some reason which I now forget—I saw the child at George-street from time to time—it seemed to be properly treated as far as I could judge—I do not remember their removing to Hanover-street—I understood from her that she removed from George-street, to Battersea—my visits then ceased, as it was very inconvenient, and I felt confident she would take care of the child—I did not see it in Sutherland-street, but from time to time it was brought to see me—it was brought to me in the spring of this year—I never saw Mr. Roach about the matter, but I met him once or twice at the house in Lower George-street; he has been in the room when I have con<lb></lb>versed with his wife about the child, and may have heard the conversation—I believe the prisoners to be man and wife—in December, 1863, I gave Mrs. Roach 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra for flannel for the child—I suppose she represented it to be in delicate health—on 28th September, after it was taken to the work-house, I saw her and told her I was grieved to hear that the child had been neglected—she denied it, and showed me some ointment which she said she used for its sores—it was very delicate when it was placed with her; it seemed to be quite an ungrown child when it came out of the workhouse, and there were sores on its head—it appeared to get better under her care at first.</p>

               <p>her arms opened the door to me—we went downstairs to the back kitchen, the door of which was closed, but not locked; one of the female lodgers opened it, and I went into the room, which was so dark that at first I could not see anything—when my eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, I saw a little child sitting—I brought it out and then looked round the room—there was an old French bedstead, without the battens to it, on the floor, and the two halves of a straw palliasse, almost black with dirt—the remains of an old flock bed were also on the floor—it was a wooden floor—I looked at the bed and found it was saturated with urine, which I could tell by the smell under it—the floor was also saturated with wet—there was no outward door to the room, but a good sized window looking into the yard—the win<lb></lb>dow was very dirty, I should say it had not been cleaned for twelve months at least, and across the lower sash was hung something which I took to be a petticoat or the skirt of a gown, it was that which made the room so dark—there was not a single article of bed clothing in the room—I took the child into the front kitchen—it was dressed in this frock and this pinafore only, those were its only articles of clothing, and it had no shoes or stockings—I put it down on the floor of the front kitchen; it immediately ran to the table, scraped some bread crumbs up, and ate them with great avidity—a woman, one of the lodgers, gave it a piece of bread which it ate very greedily—I found that it had what is commonly called scald head—there were lice in the gathers of its frock, and its loins were very much bitten by lice—I took it to Rochester-row Police-court, and applied for a summons against John Roach—I then took it to the workhouse, where a doctor saw it—on the 29th, before I went to the Police-court for the summons, I caused the child before I left the workhouse to be put in the scales in which we weigh provisions, it weighed 24lbs.—I weighed it again on 3d October, and it weighed 251bs. and on 10th October it weighed 26 1/2 Lbs—I weighed it this morning but it had not gained since 10th October—there was the same amount of clothing on it every time—its head is now quite well—I saw three of the prisoners' children at Sutherland-street; they are well-grown and fat.</p>

On 27th September I went with Mr. Baddely to 15, Sutherland-street, and found the back kitchen where the child was, in a most filthy state—there was urine on the mattrass, which had gone right through it, and I saw human excrement under the mattrass—the window was darkened by a large fur cloak hung before it—all the food that I could see in the room was a little mouldy pie on a plate turned bottom upwards—the stink was so great that we had to retreat as we opened the door to go in—I took the child into the front kitchen, it had lice on it—Mr. Baddely took it with me to the Police-court, and I applied for a summons—I took the male prisoner on a warrant on the following</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230030"></xptr>
               <p>Monday night, and told him I apprehended him for cruelty to a child—on the way to the station he said, "It is very lucky you apprehended me now, as it was my intention to go to America; but being the head of the family I suppose I must suffer. I had rather suffer than my wife should, but it is my wife's fault; I know nothing about it. I am very sorry it ever came to what it is."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and my father is surgeon to the parish of St. George, Hanover-square; he is seriously ill, and I am doing his work for him—on 27th September I saw this child at the workhouse—its head was lousy, and covered with sores, and its body marked by the bites of lice—there were no external marks of violence, but it was very much emaciated—I have attended it up to this time—I have not pre<lb></lb>scribed medicine, but it has had proper food, and has been put in a properly lighted and ventilated place—I think it was emaciated because it was not supplied with sufficient and proper food—when I saw it it was in bed in a night-gown—its health was injured for the time being—the sores on its head resulted from it being allowed to get into a lousy state—they are healed now—if the neglect had been continued it would unquestionably have died—it was running about the yard playing yesterday, and has been gradually improving, but it is not very well today—besides want of food, want of light and air and exercise tends to emaciate—at five years old it might have been twice the weight, and not have been a very large child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the weight depend very much on the confor<lb></lb>mation of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I made no examination of its chest, as I only heard before the Magistrate of its parents dying of consumption—the sores on its head were recent—there were no marks of old sores—it is not permanently injured in health, but I would not say it is not seriously injured—it is considerably enfeebled by all the neglect it has undergone—it gradually mended, but it is not perfectly well—I saw it every day, and it has improved up to the present time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. submitted that there was no evidence of imprisonment, as the child was able to open the door; that Mary Roach being a married woman, contract with her was not binding; and that there was no proof that her husband knew of the contract; and also that it was necessary to prove that the child was actually injured. (See Cox's Criminal Cases, p. 140.) <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. con<lb></lb>tended that as the child could not get beyond the yard, the prison was only made larger; and that as long as there was enough to make the offence a common law misdemeanour that was sufficient.<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. considered that as the male prisoner took his meals with his children, this child being absent, the question for the Jury would be whether he was not cognisant of his wife's acts, and so tacitly ratified the contract which she had made.</p>

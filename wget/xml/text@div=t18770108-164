                  </hi>. I live at 8, Three Foxes' Court, Ratcliffe, and am a shipwright—on the afternoon of the 18th December, I had just come to my own premises with a board on ray shoulder when I saw the prisoner standing; at a public-house door—he came up and struck me with his fist on my face, then he took a stevedore hook from his pocket and struck me across the face with it—my face bled very much—this scar is from the wound; my wife and child were present—the prisoner then went to his own house—I did not strike him—I never challenged him to fight or quarrelled with him—I know him well by sight—the police doctor sewed up the wound.</p>

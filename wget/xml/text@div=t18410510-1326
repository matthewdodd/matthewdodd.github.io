                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and live in Upper North-place, Gray's Inn-road. At twenty minutes past nine o'clock on the 12th of April, I received information from my daughter—I ran out, overtook the prisoner, and found on him this brush, which is my workmanship—I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>he bad been committed for stealing two books—we attended, and he was found "Not Guilty," on account of insanity—he was then committed to Hanwell, where he has been more than twelve months—he ran away, and one of the officers came and took him back—one Sunday morning, about a month ago, he came to us before we were up, and said be bad been dis<lb></lb>charged on the Friday—he exhibited during that day such violence, as induced me to go to Hanwell to see if he was discharged—the doctor said he was afraid it was a hopeless case, but if there was a chance for him it was by letting him mix again in the world—I came back from Hanwell, and found he was in possession of my sister's apartment—he had frightened her out of the room with a poker, and got possession of the whole place—I am sure he has not a sense of right or wrong, or gratitude of any kind—every little benefit we have done him has been scoffed at— I am convinced, not only his family, but the public, are in danger from him—he has not only been convicted of stealing the brush and two books, but be has confessed to us his trickery and thieving that he has committed—the first thing was one Sunday morning, how he avoided the officer finding two tickets of a telescope and a draft-board on him—he must have lived entirely on thieving for three months—Dr. Connolly told me that they have a fund, from which they give when they consider them cured, from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he was so doubtful in this case that be merely gave him a sove<lb></lb>reign—that was gone in a day or two, and I gave him a trifle myself—the next day I wrote to Dr. Connolly, and he wrote me this answer—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "<hi rend="italic">Hanwell, March</hi> 8, 1841.—SIR,—I am much inclined to think that the prospect of being sent to prison would be a more effectual check on your unfortunate brother, than the fear of being sent to an asylum. If you get a proper medical certificate of his insanity, the overseers of the parish to which he belongs will cause him to be sent here; he can only be received in this way, or by a Magistrate's order. The police will surely relieve you from more immediate danger. I am afraid he merely gives way to bad and violent propensities, well knowing at the same time right from wrong.

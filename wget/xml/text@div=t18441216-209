I refused, knowing him so well—he did not say that his brother was at home at the time I said I saw him, nor did I reply that I had sworn it was him once, and I would stick to it, or continue to do so—I said nothing of the kind—I said I knew what party I had got, for I had seen them together before, and I knew him well—I told him I had got the right party in custody, I knew him so well—he said I had not—Millerman was the policeman to whom I gave the information about the boys—I di­ rected him to find them—he had told me before that they were out toge­ ther—as soon as I had gone to the station, and put the bedstead there,</p>

I was on duty on the 29th of Nov., and patroling the division, about six or seven o'clock I saw the prisoners both together in Rochester-row, which is not ten minutes walk from this passage, in Horseferry-road—I afterwards received some information from Butler, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoners—I found Brown at home at his own house about half-past nine—I told him I wanted him for a bedstead that was stolen from Hawkins—he denied knowing anything about it—I took him to the station, where he was identified by Butler—I afterwards went in search of Smith every­ where, but did not find him till the 10th, when I happened to run against him accidentally, in the Broadway, Westminster—I told him I wanted him for the bedstead—he denied knowing anything about it, and I took him to the station, where he was identified by Butler.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Orchard-place. I sometimes run on errands for Daniel Lucas. On 11th Feb. he sent me out with sixpence, one penny, and two halfpence—I saw the prisoners—Flanagan lives at 16, Orchard-place; Burke at 2, River-place, next door to Mr. Lucas; and Breen at 1, Gray's-buildings</p>

               <p>—I was going down Orchard-place to the mews—Burke said to Flanagan, "Search Riley, to see if he has got any cigars"—they got me down Edward's-mews—Flanagan ran, and hallooed out that he had got me—Burke and Breen took hold of my hands, and Flanagan took the money out of my pocket—he put the sixpence in his mouth, saying, "There is but 2<hi rend="italic">d.,"</hi> and ran down the mews—I hallooed out—Flanagan ran away—Burke and Breen walked down the mews—I began to cry, and the policeman came.</p>

Riley complained to me, and I took Flanagan and Burke, and told Breen to follow—I have known them from their infancy—I told Flanagan what I wanted him for—he said, "We did not rob him, the money was knocked out of his hand, and I picked it up"—at the station he said he gave it to a boy to take to Riley's mother—Catherine Lawler gave me this money at the station—she lives with Riley's grandmother.</p>

The prisoner Breen says, "I say the same as Burke."</p>

                  </hi>. I an the wife of Henry James Whiteman, and live in Arlington-street. About four months since, the prisoner, Francis, hired a furnished apartment at our house, and she and Chilcott came to live there—we gave them warning three weeks previous to the 18th of November—they should have quitted on the 18th—Francis said they could not go then—on the 19th, I said we must have the room by that evening, as it was very particular—she said she did not know whether she could let us have it, and in the evening, she said they could not go—we then asked if the property was safe, and said we thought it must be pledged—she denied it—I asked to see the property—she said she would not satisfy my idle curiosity—we then insisted on searching, had the policeman, and missed a pair of linen sheets—I gave her into custody—Chilcott was not there then—he was taken on the 22nd—there was some rent owing, which we were willing to forgive them, if they would give us the duplicates and possession of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Laughton, who lived at 7, Brewer's-yard, when I left home—I have for some time past been a prisoner in the House of Correction, at Westminster—I was convicted at the Middle<lb></lb>sex Sessions in January, and was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, with hard labour—on 16th January last year, I was at work at the Seamen's Orphan Asylum, in the Bow-road, as a charwoman and assistant laundress—I had been there as assistant for, I should think, about the last seven months—the defendant, Mrs. Coucher, was the matron of that Institution—on the evening of 16th January, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was leaving the Asylum, having finished my day's work at a few minutes after 8 o'clock—I was carry<lb></lb>ing a small newspaper parcel, and a basin of dripping—I had the newspaper parcel in my left hand, in this manner, and the basin of dripping in my right hand—I cannot say what the newspaper parcel contained; it was so short a time that I had not looked into it—Susannah Harvey, the cook, had given it me for my supper—I was in the habit of having my supper given me to take home, and I supposed this to be my supper—the parcel was not very large; not large enough to contain three half-quartern loaves, two pounds of uncooked meat, and two pounds of cooked meat—the cook had also given me the basin of dripping—there was no other wrapper of any kind attached to the parcel, out the newspaper—I was wearing this apron—there was nothing but the newspaper round the parcel; no wrapper—that parcel was the only one that I carried out—I came out of the kitchen into the yard, through the scullery door, straight to the gate—Mary Ann Keast, the laundry-maid, stood at the</p>

               <p>laundry-door—the laundry and scullery are two different places; the laundry is just opposite as you come through the door—you go from the kitchen, through the scullery, and into the yard at once; it is only about half a dozen steps from the kitchen to the yard—I went through the Kitchen, and through the scullery door, and then into the yard—as I passed the laundry door, Mary Ann Keast stood there—she said, "Are you going?"—I said, "Yes; I am"—I asked her whether she was coming to the gate—she walked to the gate with me—we were talking together—on my way to the gate I saw Mrs. Coucher as soon as I came out of the kitchen into the yard—I did not know then that it was she, but I know now—the laundry door is outside the scullery door, but it is on the other side of the yard—I must pass the laundry door to go to the gate into the Bow-road—I went up to the gate with Mary Ann Keast, and when I got to the gate Mrs. Coucher came up—I said, "Good night"—I believe Mrs. Coucher said, "Good night," and put her hand on the newspaper parcel that I carried in my left hand, and said, "What have you got here?"—Mary Ann Keadt was by at the time—I said, "My supper"—Mrs. Coucher said, "Give it to me"—she appeared very ravenous for it—I said, "Yes; allow me to hand it to you"—as I handed it to her, she said, "That is all I wanted"—I handed her both the dripping and the parcel of supper that I had received from the cook—I had not lost sight of them at all from the time of the cook giving them to me—I had not altered them in any way by adding to or taking anything from them—when Mrs. Coucher said, "That is what I wanted," she went the same way as she had come, towards her own room, with the parcels—I went straight back into the kitchen, and found the cook there still—I remained there from three quarters of an hour to an hour, as near as I can tell—I told the cook why I remained in the kitchen—I was waiting to know why Mrs. Coucher took my supper—Mrs. Coucher did not come to me in the kitchen—after waiting a long time the cook spoke to me, and I went home—after I had got home a policeman came to me, and I was taken to the station, and from the station back to the Asylum—that was the same evening—when I was taken to the station, I saw a bundle there, in which were three half-quatern loaves, and the basin of dripping which Mrs. Coucher took from me, and the newspaper parcel, also some cooked and uncooked meat, the paper was broken—the paper parcel, the basin of dripping, and the other things, were all inside a coarse apron—I returned with the police, and the apronful of things, to the Asylum; to the schoolmaster's room—Mrs. Coucher came, some<lb></lb>time after I went in, and the things were put on the table before her—I said to her, "Are you going to say that you took that bundle from me at the gate?"—(I had been told by the inspector that I was charged with stealing those things)—she said, "Yes"—I was then taken back by the policeman—I do not remember whether I said anything else to her—Mrs. Coucher has seen me before leaving the Asylum at night with my supper, and she has given me a beef-steak pudding uncut, for my supper, to take away, from her own room, and told me not to tell any of the servants that she had given it to me—she has known that I was in the habit of taking my supper away—Mrs. Coucher came to the police-station with me, and Inspector Kerresey was there—I do not remember whether it was before Kerresey that I asked Mrs. Coucher whether she charged me with stealing those things—I was a good deal confused at the charge—I do not remember what I said to Kerresey.</p>

I believe went into the kitchen—I cannot say how long I stayed in the laundry; five or ten minutes—it was quite impossible for Laugh<lb></lb>ton to have had three half-quartern loaves in the parcel without my seeing it—some time previously Mrs. Coucher made a charge in respect of me and Mary Laughton about some calico; and in a few days Mrs. Coucher came to me and said, "Ann, I have found my mistake as regards that calico; and I have just merely come into the laundry thinking I should meet you and Mrs. Laughton; but I have inquired about it, and you tell Mrs. Laughton that it is quite correct about the calico; and it is on my side that the mistake is"—I had been before the Ladies' Committee—Mrs. Coucher was not present then; but she came in afterwards I believe—it is a rule that we shall not be all present at the same time—I heard Mrs. Coucher say that Mrs. Laughton had a husband to do for her, and she thought there was a widow more in need of the work than she was—that was about a week or a fortnight before the charge about the calico.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you tell me it was five or six weeks before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did not go into the bread-room, I was at the bread room door—I was not in the bread-room on Friday week, but I was on the Friday week before this—I was at the door but no further—the soap and soda was left on the ledge—there is a slide which comes down; you have the advantage, you have been in the Asylum, and know all about it—I did not see you there, but I heard so—the cook told me the other week that you were there—she said that a gentleman, the lawyer that was plaintiff for Mrs. Coucher was there—I have said what I have got to say and you will get nothing more from me—Mrs. Harvey told me that the counsel for Mrs. Coucher was in the asylum taking all the intelligence he could get—I forget whether she mentioned your name, and I forget when she told me—I have got a bad memory—it was when I came from the Old Bailey the last time she told me that the counsellor who had pleaded for the woman, had been in the Asylum getting all the in<lb></lb>telligence he could: had you not Eliza, the housemaid, in private to talk to you?—I do not know whether Eliza was alone—the cook told me that you were in the Asylum talking to Eliza, and so you <hi rend="italic">was</hi> she also told me that you were talking to the boys—I suppose the cook had a pretty good guess what you were there for; she said that you were there to learn the particu-lars</p>

               <p>—that was before the last sessions, but you can have it the other way—I heard Mrs. Coucher give her evidence before the Magistrate—I did not hear it at Clerkenwell, I was out of Court—at the time Mrs. Coucher asked Laughton what she had got there, and she said that it was her supper, I did not hear Mrs. Coucher say, "It is a very large supper," and she could not have said it without my hearing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook at the Seaman's Orphan Asylum—on the morning of 16th January, I gave Mary Laughton her supper to take home with her, which I was in the habit of doing to the knowledge of Mrs. Coucher—it was wrapped in a pieoe of newspaper, and consisted of a piece of cooked beef, 1lb. I should think, and a small crust of bread only, as I had no more bread down—I had given her a basin of dripping in the afternoon—I gave her no uncooked meat—when she took it she left the kitchen through the acullery which leads to the laundry, she returned in ten minutes, or not so long, without her parcel, and remained in the kitchen with me three quarters of an hour, or an hour—I next saw her when she was brought back by the policeman, I had not in that interval seen Mrs. Coucher—I first saw the parcel of bread and meat in the apron in the schoolmaster's room, there was a piece of cooked meat and a piece of raw meat—I had not seen the un<lb></lb>cooked meat and the loaves of bread before—I had not given them to her—she could not have had that parocel when she left the kitchen without my seeing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Tollit, No, 95, Strand. On the morning of the 17th of March I was serving in the shop—the prisoners came in, and asked me to show them some rings—I reached them out a tray, and noticed a large cameo ring among them—they did not look at that, but at another ring—Jones took the ring first, and then handed it to Baron—Jones drew the tray near to him, and I then saw him take a cameo ring off with his left hand, and conceal it in his right hand—I then went to the door, held it, and called William Cooper to assist me—while I was holding the door Jones tried to push me away to get out—I afterwards saw the ring on the counter—it is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—it was about the same part of the counter as I had seen him endeavour to con<lb></lb>ceal it, not a yard from it—he had transferred it from the left hand to the right, and closed his right hand with it—Baron endeavoured to attract my notice the while by examining the other rings—Jones asked him if he liked a ring—he said he did not exactly like it, and drew my attention towards him while Jones took the cameo.</p>

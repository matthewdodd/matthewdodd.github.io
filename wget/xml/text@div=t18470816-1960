On the 31st of July, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I was going my rounds, I saw a crate standing under a shed, and the prisoner near it—he had no business there—when I approached he left the crate hastily, and came towards me—I asked what he had been doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let us come back and see"—we went, and I found a hole in the crate, the straw pulled on one side and disturbed, and down where he had stood were these two butter-pots—I accused him of stealing some—he said he was not stealing, but merely looking to see what the crate contained—I told him it was not on his beat, and if it were he had nothing to do with the</p>

                  </hi> I am in the service of the Dock Company. I had seen the crate of crockery safe on Saturday afternoon the 31st of July, from two to four o'clock—I cannot say whether there was any hole in it—I did not examine it—I assisted in placing the crate under the shed—I did not notice any hole in it, or any straw protruding from it.</p>

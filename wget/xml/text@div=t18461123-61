                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at No. 24, Houghton-street, New<lb></lb>castle-street, Strand. On Monday, the 16th of Nov., about one o'clock in the morning, I was passing up Holborn-hill on the north side—I was return<lb></lb>ing from a friend's house in Crispin-street, which I had left about half-past twelve o'clock—I crossed New Farringdon-street, and observed two females, as I thought, before me—I passed them, and one of them said, "My dear, where are you going to?"—they were the two prisoners—I turned round instantly, and said "Going home"—they then left one another and one came on the other side of me, and one remained on the side he was—they begged me to go somewhere to give them something to drink—I cannot recollect the words they used—I did not stop—I said I would not as I was going home—I proceeded onwards—when we got to the corner of Field-lane one of them, (I do not know which,) said, "We both reside here; will you go to our own home, and give us something to drink there"—I said no, I was going home, I would have nothing to do with them, still walking up Holborn-hill—when about half way up Holborn-hill, opposite Shoe-lane, the tallest prisoner, An<lb></lb>derson, put his hand on my coat collar, and begged if I would not go any<lb></lb>where to treat them, that I would give them something to treat themselves—I declined to do so—I had a great coat and a shawl on my neck, and a pin in it, which I saw as I passed the lamp—I was buttoned up tight, and it was pro<lb></lb>jecting forward—I have no doubt this is the pin (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that was in my shawl—I could not positively swear to it as I have got no private mark on it—when I said I would have nothing to do with them, and I would give them nothing, both the prisoners left me—they crossed the road to go down Shoe-lane—I looked down and missed my pin instantly—there was a police<lb></lb>man within two or three yards—I have heard his name is Whitmarsh—I said to him, "Did you observe those two women talking to me"—he said, "I did"—I said, "They have stolen the pin out of my breast"—he did not follow the prisoners—he called to two policeman on the opposite side and said, "This gentleman has been robbed of his pin"—the prisoners were followed—I crossed and went up Shoe-lane, but no further than the end of the church wall—I met the two policemen returning back with the prisoners, and they</p>

I was one of the City police, but I have since left the force—I was on duty on Holborn-hill on Monday morning, the 16th of Nov.—I there saw Mr. Parry and the two prisoners in conversation underneath the lamp-post—they were at the time standing still—the prison<lb></lb>ers were dressed as females—Anderson was next to the prosecutor, and Sulli<lb></lb>van was about two feet behind, near the corner of Union-court, facing St. Andrew's church—I saw Anderson's hand on the collar of the prosecutor's coat, in the act, as I thought, of whispering to him at the time—I ordered them to move on—I then had occasion to go up a court to see that all was right—when I returned I saw the prosecutor—he said, "Did you see those women? "I said I did—he said, "They have robbed me of my pin"—I gave information to Templeman—he and another policeman pursued them up Shoe-lane—I proceeded a short distance up Shoe-lane with the prosecutor, and met the prisoners in custody being brought back—they were the persons I had seen with the prosecutor on Holborn-hill—the prosecutor was perfectly sober—I believe I have seen Anderson before in female attire, but I could not swear it.</p>

I was on duty on Monday morning, the 16th of Nov., in Field-lane, Holborn—Bullen, another constable, was with me—it was about one o'clock or a little after—I saw the prosecutor, and the two prisoners, who were dressed in female attire—we watched them for a time—they made a stop at the corner of Plough-court—the moment we came out of Field-lane they moved further up the hill, in com<lb></lb>pany with Mr. Parry—when they got a few yards up, Sullivan made a stop with his back to the shutters—Anderson and the prosecutor proceeded on a few doors higher up the hill, about twelve or fourteen yards—Sullivan then moved on and joined them—they were in company then for about a minute—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners suddenly leave Mr. Parry, cross the road, and go up Shoe-lane—Whit-marsh said something to me, and I went up Shoe-lane and pursued the prisoners—Bullen was with me—we overtook the prisoners just before we got to Stonecutter-street, which is about 200 yards up Shoe-lane—they were making a stop against the dead wall of the market—we took them to the station—Anderson gave the name of Emma Anderson, and Sullivan the name of Jane Wilson—they were there discovered not to be women—they were searched by the female searcher—here are the clothes in which Sullivan was dressed—here is a pair of stays, a piece of black velvet which he wore round his neck, and some wadding which formed the breasts—this is a white veil, and this is the remains of a bonnet—he destroyed it after he was locked up—it was found partly in the water-closet—here is some false hair—this is all we could possibly bring of that, as it was in such a mess—here is the body of the gown that Sullivan had on—I have one silk stocking—another stocking was discovered, but it was in such a mess it could not be brought—here is a small comb which attached the false hair on—this other bonnet was on Anderson—this is a cloak which Anderson wore—here is a fur boa which was taken from Sullivan—these things of Sullivan's appeared clean when we took them—they are now in a totally different state—these clothes, worn by Anderson, are in the same state that they were—they were not thrown down the water-closet—this</p>

               <p>was then brought in, and he had not been in long before the female-searcher called out, "Templeman, come in"—I went in—he had everything on as a woman—the female-searcher told me in his presence that he was a man—he turned round and said, "I am as good a man as you are"—they were taken back to the bar—I searched them, and found they were men—they each wore a napkin so placed as to conceal their sex, and by that means the female-searcher passed one of them—I found every article of female apparel on them, except a man's shirt on one of them—the other I believe had a chemise.</p>

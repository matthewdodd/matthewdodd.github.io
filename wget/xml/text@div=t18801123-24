I am an Inspector of Her Majesty's Customs, and live at 26, College Avenue, Lower Clapton—on Saturday evening, 16th October, I went to a urinal on Tower Hill—I had a silver watch and a gold chain—as I was adjusting my dress, holding my umbrella in my left hand, I felt a tug at my watch, and in less than a moment it was gone—I exclaimed "You wretch"—I saw Casey and Garrett in the urinal, but I do not identify Flewitt—Garrett was taller and lighter than</p>

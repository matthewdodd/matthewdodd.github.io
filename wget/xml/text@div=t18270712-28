On the 6th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was engaged in the counting-house, and heard a noise in the warehouse, the door was half open - I went in, and missed two pieces of stuff from the counter, which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before. I went into the street, and in a court adjoining I observed a boy with two pieces - I will not swear that it was the prisoner. I returned to fasten my warehouse, and then went in pursuit, but without effect. I returned to my street door, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner (who appeared to me to be the same boy) coming to the door, with a piece of stuff under his arm - I laid hold of him and took it from him. I gave him in charge; it is one of the pieces which had been taken from my warehouse - there are twenty-eight yards of it; it is worth 21s. He said he had picked up it - this was within a quarter of an hour of its being stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The boy took two parcels? A. Yes; I found the prisoner close to my door, with only one.</p>

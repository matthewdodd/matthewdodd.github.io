On Monday, the 27th of September, his house was robbed, and on that day I saw a person come into the entrance of the door, before the robbery. I communicated this to the police officers; and Hanley directed me to go after the man, wherever I should see him. I accompanied Hanley and Attfield two days after the robbery, (on the 29th of October,) to a ground where there were a great many men, tossing half-pence. I saw one of the officers there put his hand on the shoulders of the prisoner at the bar, and say something to him, which I did not hear; my attention was directed to the prisoner. In consequence of that, I looked at him, and observed him particularly, and afterwards had some conversation with the officers about him. I did not know him before. I told the officers that he was not the person I had seen in my master's house; I saw him again half an hour afterwards in the same ground; the officer had taken me somewhere else in the interval; we returned again and saw the same man there; I observed him again as the other officer was talking to him then; and I think he said</p>
               <p>"Kiddy, how came you here?" I was still of the same opinion that he was not the person I had seen at my master's house. On the Sunday afternoon following (the 3d of October) I went to Shoreditch-church to hear a charity sermon. I had a five shilling piece, two half crowns, eight shillings and a sixpence in my purse. I left the church soon after five o'clock, and gave one shilling to the charity, leaving seventeen shillings and sixpence in my purse. I had my umbrella and a shawl when; I came out of the Church, I saw the man whom I had seen in the entry of my master's house on the day it was robbed; he was outside the church-rails, holding the rails with both hands; the officer had desired me to follow him if I should see him; (he had not said so on the ground.) I followed the man a little way down Hackney-road, and then up a turning over into a field, over the canal, and then down a turning, and over the canal again, and up a turning which took me into the * <placeName id="t18241028-58-crimeloc317">London fields</placeName>

               <p>"I do not know you Sir." I did know him very well, but said so from fear; I knew him from seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280022"></xptr>in the ground; he then beckoned to another man who instantly came up to me, and instantly took hold of my other arm. I still saw the man going down the path of the field - the prisoner told the other man to put his hand over my mouth, that I should not halloo; he put it over my mouth, and held it tight - he had nothing in his hand, but when we got a yard or two further, the prisoner crammed some bay into my mouth, and said to the other man,</p>
               <p>"Now hold your hand over this;" he did so, and the man whom I had been following, when he saw the other two holding me, crossed over and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, d - n her, make her take off her pattens, that she may go on faster." I put them off with my feet, each man holding me by the arm, and left them there - they walked me along as fast as they could to the end of the field, still holding me all the time, and when we came to the end of the field, they took me down a lane, with a hedge on each side; it leads down to a pond: as we went along the lane, the man who I had been following said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! d - n her drag her down faster" - and when I came to the pond the prisoner at the bar took the umbrella out of my hand and my shawl off; he pulled out a rope about a yard and a half long from his pocket, and said</p>
               <p>"I will hang her and she cannot swear against us then" - (the prisoner said so,) the man who held my other arm, told the prisoner to search me, to see what I had - he said</p>
               <p>"Search her and see what she has" - the prisoner searched my pockets and took out my purse, which had the money I have mentioned in it, and I saw him put it into his left hand waistcoat pocket - and said</p>
               <p>"D - n the b - g - rs they cannot swear to money" - then he (the prisoner) took hold of my shoulders, and the other man who held my arm, held my feet and they threw me over a rail; I rolled down into the pond; there was a great deal of water in the pond; every part of me except my head was in the pond; the man who I had been following, then said</p>

               <p>"D - n her, poke her down under the water" - the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Oh! she won't rise any more."</p>
               <p>* The witness often mentioned Hackney-fields, it is London-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were thrown into the pond, did the man you had followed say anything - A. He came up to me and gave me a blow in the breast, and I fell back against the rail of the pond - I was thrown over the rails with force: when I was in the water, I heard one of them ask if my shawl was all silk; another said it was all silk; it was made with hard silk; another said</p>
               <p>"We won't have anything that belongs to her, because there may be a mark on it, which the b - g - s can swear to" - the prisoner came to the edge of the rails and said</p>
               <p>"Here goes," and threw the umbrella and shawl into the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the hay - A. I pulled it out of my mouth in the pond. I heard one ask the other how much he had; another said 17 s. 6 d., and they said</p>

               <p>"Now she is gone, we will go to the White Horse at Hackney and regale ourselves</p>
               <p>"they went away. I remained in this situation for a minute or two after I heard their voices, fearing that if I came out too soon they would poke me into the water again, and then I crept out of the pond and sat by the edge of it. I heard two men talking, I peeped up to see who they were, and asked them to help me; they helped me over the rails - I was all wet up to my neck, and muddy. I asked them to take me home to my father - they said I had better go to an alehouse at the end of the field. I walked behind them to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented your hallooing as you went along the field - A. The man held my mouth all the way with the hay in it. The landlord got me a coach, and I went to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner attentively, and state whether you only believe, or whether you have any doubt of his person - A. No; I am positively sure of him - I described him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity as you went along the field of seeing his features - A. I had. I saw him all the way along for twenty minutes I dare say. I was face to face to him when he 
               <persName id="t18241028-58-person576">drew</persName>
             the rope from his pocket. I have not the slightest doubt of his being the person. I afterwards saw the officers who had accompanied me to the ground, and communicated it to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What time of day was it when you saw the man at your master's house - A. About eleven o'clock in the day - it was not the prisoner. I was not alarmed then; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when the officers took me to the skettle ground; there were a good many men there. I always go to Shoreditch church. I did not see the prisoner when I came out of church - my way home was towards Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the person, did it not occur to you that it would be wise to take somebody with you - A. No, there was nobody there who knew the man but me. I knew none of the people about and said nothing to them; people were passing in the road - I did not ask for assistance there - the man walked as any one else would. I noticed his dress. I do not know the name of the lane which he turned down - it is a public lane and persons were passing. I was never there before - there was not a soul passing in the field at the time the two men had hold of my arm. I did not see any one pass me in the field where they took hold of me. I was in the pathway of the field when they took hold of me, but nobody was passing. I could not call out because I was alarmed, and the prisoner beckoned to the other, who instantly came up. I had not time to cry out. I had not presence of mind to call out, I was so alarmed. I pulled my arms to get from them, but they held me so fast I could not, and as soon as the other man came up, he put his hand over my mouth, and the hay was put in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now mind what I ask you, did you not in your way to the pond pass several persons - A. No, I did not, not one. I have never said that I did pass persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at another place, when giving this account that if you had seen persons you would not have mentioned it, for they might have noticed you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that if persons had passed they might have supposed you were walking arm-in-arm with the men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that persons did pass you after the three men were in your view - A. No. I passed some houses - I could not call for help; the man's hand was over my mouth, and the hay in it. I must have seen persons if they had passed. I was alarmed when they caught me by the arm, but I should have seen if any person passed in the pathway; nobody did. My alarm continued<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280023"></xptr>till I got to the pond. One side of the pond is open to a field - one side has a fence, and the other a hedge. I was thrown over the rails; it has rails along; I could have got under them. When the man said he would hang me I thought I should have died.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the alarm increased I suppose - A. Yes. I did not lose my senses at all. I laid in the pond, and heard their conversation. I was holding by a piece of wood in the pond, to keep my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a part of the pond where they might have put you in without throwing you over the rails - A. No; the part that was open is in a field, not where we were; they could not put me in where we were without throwing me over. I have been to the pond since. I heard and remembered all they said. I have told this story at the office, and at Hick's-hall. I have not talked to my friends about it, for every time I think of it, it hurts my mind. I have not described the pond as 680 yards from the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have an impediment in your speech - A. I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been asked why you did not communicate to people that you were going after the man; you was told if you saw him to watch where he went to - A. Yes; not to have him taken, I was to watch where he went, and the officer would make enquiry. The man saw me when I saw him in my master's entry.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you state where you last saw anybody walking too and fro - A. By the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton; that is a great way from the pond.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. On Sunday afternoon, the 3d of October, about ten or twenty minutes after six o'clock, I was crossing the London-field, with Field; it was just getting dusk, and after we got across the field, and were right opposite the pond, I heard the call of a female in distress; she said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake gentlemen give me assistance, for I have been robbed by two men, and thrown into this pond;" Field jumped over the rails, assisted her up, and I helped her over into the pathway; it was the prosecutrix - she was in a dreadful state; the lower part of her was all covered with mud, and she was wet up to the breast; she was close to the edge of the pond, not in it. We took her to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, which I should think is nearly half a mile from the pond.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose she was agitated and alarmed - A. Yes. The fields are much frequented on a Sunday, but we had particularly remarked as we came along that we did not meet a single person, except two men, whom we met coming in a direction from the pond, towards the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any observation of these two men - A. Not at all; they were about a hundred yards from the pond. I should not know them again.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 29th of September I accompanied the prosecutrix with Hanley, to a ground behind the Princess of Wales, public-house, in Wentworth-street, to see if she could identify any person who she had seen about her master's premises on the day they were robbed; there were thirty or forty persons there; she looked about, and I saw a person there whom I knew very well; and while she was looking I went up to the prisoner, whom I knew - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ah! Kiddy, what brings you here?" the prosecutrix could hear that. I told him I understood he was in constant employ now; he turned on his heels, and made some observation, which I did not hear. The prosecutrix recognized nobody there. We came out of the ground, and went to the City of Norwich, public-house, Wentworth-street, for the same purpose, and in consequence of somebody I saw there we returned with the prosecutrix to this ground again - we had been absent three or four minutes. I did not myself observe the prisoner there when we returned: we remained there two or three minutes; this was on Wednesday. I saw her again on Sunday night, the 3d of October, at Garton's house, about half-past seven o'clock - she complained of being robbed by three persons, and gave me information, which led us to apprehend the prisoner - Hanley took him at the Princess of Wales, (behind which is the ground we took the prosecutrix to) on Monday, the 4th of October. On Tuesday I went with

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with Attfield and the prosecutrix to the ground behind the Princess of Wales, public-house, on the 29th of September - I saw the prisoner there and spoke to him, and called the prosecutrix's attention to his person; were-turned to the ground in a quarter of an hour, and I again called her attention to him. I was in conversation with him, and am certain that she saw him - she did not know him. We were in search of a person suspected of robbing her master. We directed her in case she saw the man suspected to watch his motions to see where he went to, and to come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280024"></xptr>to the office and give information. On Monday morning, the 4th of October, about eleven o'clock, four officers besides myself went to this gambling ground. I saw a woman run out of a house in a direction towards the Princess of Wales - I ran after her; she ran in at the corner door of the public-house; I went in at another door in Wentworth-street; one man ran out past me, and the prisoner followed him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop Harris, I want to speak to you;" I laid hold him, and sat him down on a bench, and in two or three minutes Gleed and Attfield, the other officers came to my assistance. I told the prisoner I apprehended him on suspicion of robbing and ill-treating a woman in London fields, the evening before; he said,</p>
               <p>"It is very hard, let what will be done amiss, I am sure to be charged with it;" I took him away; he went very quietly. On Saturday, the 9th of October, I accompanied the prosecutrix to the London-fields; I measured the distance of the pond from the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton - it is three furlongs and six yards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you took him and he complained to you, did he not add</p>
               <p>"I was at home all yesterday afternoon" - A. He did say so in the course of the day, but not at that time; he mentioned it at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not mention it as he went along - A. We had another prisoner to take, and he said nothing to me going along. Vann and Armstrong had him; to the best of my recollection the first time I heard him say he was at home was at the office, in the course of the same day. I searched his house next day; he lived in Carter's-rents I think - George-street is just by the Princess of Wales; his house is a quarter of a mile or more from there; I know of no other George-street. I cannot exactly recollect the name of the place he lives in - I should think it is half a mile from Shoreditch church, &amp; from there to the pond is one mile, four furlongs, and two hundred and nine yards. I think it is above two miles from where he lives to the pond. The prosecutrix gave me the shawl and the umbrella.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter; he lived in George-street, by Hanbury's brewhouse. I have a mother, a brother, and a sister - my sister does not live at home. I live with Mrs. Walker, in Carter's-rents. I heard of my father being taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on the Sunday before that did you go to buy any apples - A. Yes; it was within five minutes of six o'clock - I had been taking a walk, and went to Mr. Marshall's in George-street to buy the apples; he lives three or four doors from my father, on the other side of the way, nearly opposite. I saw my father as I passed his (my father's) window; I saw him at the window in his shirt sleeves, with his hands leaning on something, taking something out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taking something out of the window - A. Yes; his hand was on the rail; the window was open. I came Brick-lane way, and looked at Hanbury's clock, and it wanted five minutes to six.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long had you been out walking - A. Ever since half-past two o'clock; I was alone all the time; I started from Mrs. Walker's, and went to Spitalfields Church, and stopped there about an hour and half, and walked round Shoreditch, up Bethnal-green road and down Whitechapel, and did not go home, but went by my father's window to buy the apples; my father's is about three doors from Marshall's, on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not passed any other apple shop in your walk - A. I do not know, I generally buy my apples there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280025"></xptr>I only bought one penny worth, Mr. Marshall served me. Mrs. Walker was at home; she lives not many minutes walk from my father's.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came from Spitalfields Church and along Whitechapel, would it be the nearest way home to go by your father's - A. No, it was out of my way; I went for the apples; I did not call at my father's; I had seen none of my father's family that day; I saw them two or three days before; I did not call to know how they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your brother - A. I did not see any of them; my sister lived with me at Mrs. Walker's, but she had dined at my father's that day; they dine about one o'clock; I did not call for her; I do not know at what time she came home; Walker is a weaveress; I work and lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you took your walk, did you see your sister - A. She came up at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I met her in Brick-lane by accident; I was then going to Spitalfields Church.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the service was over when you got there - A. I cannot tell; I did not take notice whether the sermon had began or not - when I met my sister I said I was going there - she did not say where she was going: I did not see her after that, till she came to bed at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home to Walker's - A. I was up there two or three times after I bought the apples: I went and sat on the steps of Walker's door till near nine o'clock - I got there just after six - I went straight back from Marshall's, and sat on the steps for three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your sister come in during that time - A. No; my brother lives at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you went up to Walker's two or three times; and now you say you sat on the steps three hours - A. I got up, but was not off the steps two minutes; I only went up stairs - I continued on the steps from six o'clock till I went to bed. Spitalfields Church is not far from Walker's; Brick-lane is just at the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing from two o'clock till half-past three - A. Walking up and down Brick-lane. I think church was over about half-past four; there was a sermon I am sure.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did Mrs. Walker go with you - A. No, she was at home all the evening, up stairs from six o'clock to nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the steps when your sister came home - A. I was up stairs then, and in my own room I believe; she slept in the same bed as me. I went up for good to bed, at ten o'clock; I do not know at what time she came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to church at prayer time, or sermon time - A. They were not at prayers, they were preaching all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What garment did the clergyman wear, black or white - A. White; I do not know whether he changed it while I was there, for I sat behind in the gallery, and could scarcely see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You can read I suppose - A. No. I can tell the time, it is now not quite twenty minutes to four. I cannot tell what the clergyman talked about, I cannot tell what he said at all; they sang once, as we came away, after sermon. My father generally goes to bed on Sunday afternoons - he was up at five minutes to six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his waistcoat on - A. I could see nothing but his shirt; he was not very well. I do not know what had been the matter with him; he is a last and patten maker.</p>

            . I live a few doors down the street, nearly opposite to Harris - his daughter Eliza often comes to my shop - I saw her on the Sunday before the prisoner was taken up: it was as near as I can say about five minutes before six o'clock, she bought one pennyworth of apples - I had not seen Harris that afternoon.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How did you know the time - A. I heard the clock strike a few minutes after; I was asking what o'clock it was, and soon after heard it strike; I asked because I wanted to know the time - I asked some people who were passing just before she came; nobody was at home with me.</p>

            , JUN. I am turned eleven years old, and work at winding silk. I cannot read or write. I go to Spitalfields church, and I can say my prayers - persons who speak false go to the wicked man - (sworn.) I remember my father being taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he on the Sunday afternoon - A. Why, my father was taken very bad, and obliged to lay down, and my mother told me to go to chapel after dinner; we dined a little after one o'clock; my father was taken bad about two. I went to chapel alone - it is at the corner of Wood-street; the service had began when I got there - the minister had a black gown on. I came out of chapel between five and six o'clock, and went straight home; my father was then at tea with my mother - nobody else was there; my father sat by the fire after tea till 8 o'clock and then told me to go to bed; we have got no clock, we go by Mr. Hanbury's clock - I heard it strike eight when I went to bed - my father was then in the room, and had been so from tea time. I suppose it was half-past five when we had tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that from the time you had tea till you went to bed your father was never out of the room - A. Yes. He had only his breeches, shirt, and waistcoat on at tea time.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. He had got a violent cold - A. Yes; he sat in his shirt till I went to bed, without coat or waistcoat. It was Spitalfields church that I went to that afternoon. I did not see either of my sisters there. My sister Ann dined at my father's that day; I do not know what became of her - I went to church alone at two o'clock, and got there about ten minutes after two. The gentleman was in a black gown; church lasted till a little after five.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the chapel in Wood-street what you call Spitalfields church - A. Yes; it is a chapel at the corner of Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no prayers there as there are at Spitalfields church - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Spitalfields church also - A. No; it is at the corner of Wood-street.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. The chapel at the corner of Wood-street is shut up, and I believe is used with Hanbury's brew-house.</p>

            What is the chapel called - A. It is called Spitalfields<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280026"></xptr>church; the place I went to is not where there is a steeple and bells; they would not let me in there. I went to the chapel at the corner of Wood-street; it is near Hanbury's brewhouse; I do not know the name of the other street at which it is at the corner of. There is a chapel near there which has been shut up, but this is another.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to more than one church or chapel that afternoon - A. No; they call it Spitalfields church - it is not very large; I staid till service was over, and then went home.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you from the chapel see a very large building - A. Yes, some large houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your father was taken ill unexpectedly; it is not usual for him to be ill of a Sunday - A. No. He does not go to church or chapel; he breakfasts in bed, and gets up about ten o'clock on Sundays, and dines with us.</p>

               <p>Q. Then takes a walk and come homes to tea does he - A. Yes. I never knew him go to bed before on a Sunday afternoon. The bed is in the same room as we sit in. I saw my sister Ann after dinner, about eight o'clock, when I was going to bed, but not before.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. On the Sunday before he was taken up, I dined with him about one o'clock - my mother and brother dined with us; I staid there till three o'clock, and then went home to clean myself at Walker's, and then returned to my father's - my brother was told to go to chapel - I believe it was to Spitalfields chapel; when I returned from Walker's about half-past four o'clock, my father was asleep in bed, in the sitting room; he had his breeches on, but his coat and waistcoat were off - I then went to take a walk; I did not meet any of the family in my walk; I walked round Bethnal-green-road, and then back to Mrs. Walker's - I got there between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk from the time you left your father's till between nine and ten o'clock - A. Yes; I was out three or four hours; and when I got back to Walker's, my sister was sitting on the step of the door - I went to bed about half-past ten. Spitalfields chapel is at the corner of Wood-street; I was never there - there is a chapel by the brew-house, which is shut up; it is in St. John-street - there is a chapel besides that, which is called Spitalfields chapel, you can see the church from it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had your father a violent cold that day - A. I think he had; he was very ill I know - I left his house about half-past four o'clock, and walked till half-past nine o'clock - I went up Bethnal-green-road, round Hackney; by the Jews chapel in Hackney-fields; down Hackney-road, and Shoreditch, towards home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you always spend your Sundays with your father - A. Not always - he often laid down after dinner - my brother lived at home, and was there more than me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You left your father's at half-past three o'clock, and returned at half-past four - now recollect well: during that time did you meet your sister - A. No; not till night, when I went home; I did not see her after leaving home before dinner till night - I think she was gone out when I went to clean myself.</p>

            . I know the prisoner by sight - but am not intimate with him. I live at No. 1, George-street, and he lives right opposite - I can see his house from mine - I heard of his being taken up on the Friday; on the Sunday before that Friday I was at home all the afternoon, and went to my window about five o'clock or a quarter past, and saw Harris - I suppose it was him, but do not swear it; I saw a man who appeared as if he had just come off the bed, as his waistcoat and coat were off; he was in Harris's room; I believe him to be the man - I called my wife, and Norwood, my apprentice to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you call them to the window - A He being a notorious character, a fighting man. I called my wife and apprentice to the window, for the express purpose of seeing him - there had been something between him and my brother; I knew his person. I afterwards went to Newgate of my own accord, to see if I could identify him as the man I had seen at the window.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. As you were not acquainted, what induced you to go to Newgate to look after the man - A. I mentioned it at the public-house; and hearing the case was a bad one, I thought I had better go. My house is about three quarters of a mile from Shoreditch church; I went to live there on the Sunday before. I had seen him before, but never in that house till the Sunday. I have heard people in the parish say that he was a noted boxer - I should not have known him if I had met him in the street; I will not swear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you believe him to be the man you saw at the window - A. Yes; I heard he was charged with committing a robbery about six o'clock, and believing I had seen him at that time, I went to Newgate to ascertain whether he was the man or not.</p>

               <p>- YARDLEY. I am the wife of the last witness. I heard of Harris being taken up on the Monday - I had seen him on the Sunday about half-past five o'clock or twenty minutes to six. I was at our window, and he was at his window, in his shirt sleeves; he is the man - Norwood was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you known him long - A. I never knew him before - my husband pointed him out to me; he said that was Kiddy Harris, the man who his brother was going to fight some time ago; his window was open; it is on the first floor - not even with the street. Our window was also open - it is a narrow street; three carts could not pass in it - nobody was at the window with him; I had seen him before, but never knew him by name.</p>

No; the horse and harness were; I was at the Feathers at half-past five o'clock - another hay-cart had unloaded at the same place, and we went to have a pot of beer together; before I went into the house I said I must keep a look out, for if a gig, which was before my horse, went on, mine would follow it; when I came out the first time the gig was gone, but my horse stood there quiet; the wasy for the horse to go home would be up Grosvenor-place and Park-lane - he knew the way home if nobody had interrupted him.</p>

            , Rickmansworth, was on it - I left it there, keeping myself on the alert, and about half-past ten o'clock I was in Belgrave-square, and heard a cart going in the direction of Halton-street; the prisoner was in the cart, alone, driving it - I stopped the horse, and asked if it was his property; he said it was -I asked him the name on the cart; he said if I wished to know I might look - I said that would not satisfy me; he said I should have no further satisfaction - I said he must go to the station with me; he immediately jumped out of the cart, and said he did not know the name; that he had been drinking with the driver of it at the Feathers, in Grosvenor-place, and he wished him to drive it to Pembroke-mews, and to wait at the Sun public-house, Chapel-street, a few minutes, when he (the driver) would come to him, but he had not seen him since that time, which was seven o'clock; I asked where he was going to take the cart - he said to a livery-stable; I asked where - he said to no one in particular; I said then he was my prisoner - he immediately turned round, and ran off as fast as he could; I followed, springing my rattle, and he was stopped by another constable - I asked his name; he said if I would allow him three minutes to go to the Sun, he could give every satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the Sun at the corner of Chapel-street and Belgrave-mews? A. Yes; the door is in Chapel-street - Grosvenor-place is a more public road than Pembroke-mews, which runs out of Chapel-street, and I consider there is more light in Grosvenor-place; there is a lamp nearly opposite the Sun - I first saw the horse and cart in the mews, just behind the Sun, as it were; I had not gone by there before that night - one or two persons said they did not know who it belonged to; I went on duty at nine o'clock - the prisoner was quite sober; he said he had been drinking at the Feathers, not at the Talbot, in Chester-street; he might say that at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was that all he said? A. Yes; he was out of breath with running, but did not appear intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Talbot, in Chester-street, and called for a pint of ale - the tap-room and parlour were quite full; I could not get a seat, and as I stood at the bar a man got into conversation with me - it was raining very hard, and he asked which way I was going- I said towards Regent's-park; he said he would give me a lift, if I would wait - he told me to get into the cart, which I did; he said he would not ride, as he was going to leave a note in Chapel-street; he turned the horses head close against the Sun, told me to go in there, call for a pint of beer, and he would be in directly - I waited some time; he never returned - I was taken ill there, and went out at the back of the house twice; I did not know what to do with the horse and cart - I got into it, intending to drive it to a livery-stable, or to the station, for advice how to act; the Policeman called after me, and told me to stop, which I did, and got out of the cart before he put a question to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Pelatt, Manchester warehousemen, Bread-street, Cheapside—the prisoner was in our service. On the 28th of Oct. I caused him to be taken into custody, and asked him if he had any property of ours—he said he had taken nothing beyond the first indict<lb></lb>ment, to which he has pleaded guilty—I had him searched and this letter was found on him—(<hi rend="italic">this was a letter signed H. Spurting, requesting the prisoner to forward him 2 1/2 yards of black broad cloth</hi>)—I asked the prisoner if he had sup-plied the broad cloth mentioned in the letter—he said he had—I asked if he had entered it to himself, or whether it was paid for at the time—he replied that it was entered to himself—I have examined the books, there is no such entry—I never gave him authority to sell the cloth—it was not greatly out of his province, but it was out of his department—the cloth was under the care of another person.</p>

I am assistant to a linen-draper in the Old Kent-road—I have known the prisoner a long time—I sent him an order for some black cloth—this letter is my writing—he sent me the cloth in Aug.—I considered I was dealing with the firm—I paid him for the cloth about three weeks after delivery, one day when I was walking with him in the street—I thought I was getting it at the wholesale price.</p>

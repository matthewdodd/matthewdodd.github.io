At a quarter to seven o'clock on the night of the 16th of Feb., I was in Fitzroy-place with M'Millan—I saw the prisoner running down Henry-street with something under his arm, and looking behind him, as though he suspected some one was after him—I followed him into Grafton-mews—I got down into the Mews, and saw him strike M'Millan—he ran away, and I after him, down several streets—I lost him—he dropped what he had under his arm in the Mews, and when I got to the station I found M'Millan with the copper—I took the copper the next morning to No. 6, Brook-street, and fitted it to the brick-work where a copper had been set—it fitted exactly—I first saw the prisoner about-fifty yards from that house—I saw him in the station-house on the 24th of Feb., and swear he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grainer and writer. On the 16th of Feb. I was with Manser, about a quarter to seven o'clock I was standing in Fitz<lb></lb>roy-place, and saw the prisoner coming down Henry-street with a bag—he commenced running, and crossed into Grafton-mews—I saw him throw this bag under a truck—I told him I wanted him—he shuffled about, and struck me on the cheek—just as Manser was going to take him be ran off—I took the bag and the copper to Albany-street station—on the 24th I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner again in Tottenham-court-road, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock—he passed me—I turned and followed him to No. 10, Eaton-street—he went in there—I told sergeant Taylor of it—he told me to stop till he came out—he came out about half-past twelve, and I told a policeman, who took him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

On Friday evening, the 16th of Feb., I was in the wash-house at half-past six o'clock—the copper was then fixed—I went again at half-past seven, and it was gone—I believe this is it—here is a white mark at the bottom, where it was burnt, and I have tried to clean it off.</p>

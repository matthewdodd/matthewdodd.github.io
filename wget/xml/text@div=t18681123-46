On the morning of the 29th October I was on duty in the Whitechapel Road with Constables Chapman and Lillestone—I saw three men there together—the prisoner was one of them—we watched them, and saw them go into a public-house—they were there about ten minutes—they came out, and we followed them down the Mile End Road to the Bancroft Road—they went about two hundred yards up that road to a place where the houses stand back, and there we lost sight of them—there was no other turning out of the road except about one hundred yards further up—we waited down an area for nearly an hour, and then I heard a dog bark—Chapman and myself got over the gate into the back yard—Lillestone went into the Mile End Road—he had been there an hour previous—several other constables had been placed in different places—I got into the second garden, and saw two men going over the walls the other way—we chased them all over the walls—they got over the wall at the end of the gardens, which is about twelve feet high, and I saw them cross the field—we followed a little way, and then I heard Lillestone call out, "I have got one"—we lost sight of the other two, and went back, but could not see anything of them—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—this property was found in the garden of No. 13.</p>

I was with Harvey in the Whitechapel Road, and saw three men, of whom the prisoner was one—we followed them to Bancroft Road—I went with Harvey into the back yards—I was with him, and followed the two men over the walls—I found this centre-bit, chisel, and knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the back<lb></lb>yard of No. 13—that is next door to Mr. Muller's house—the whole of this property was found in the back<lb></lb>yard of No. 13, close down by the wall—I went to Mr. Muller's house, and examined the window of the kitchen—the catch had been shifted back by a knife—the shutters were forced open and the window was up—the window of No. 11 had been shifted as well.</p>

I was with Chapman and Harvey on the night in question—I was standing in the Mile End Road to watch, near the lodge of one of the gates—I was there about two hours, and then I looked over a wall at the back of the lodge, and I saw the prisoner getting over the wall which parts the garden from the meadow—I said, "Halloa, you are there, are you?"—I jumped over the wall into the garden—I could not see him at first—I looked down, and saw him crouching under the wall—I caught him and called out, "I have got one"—a con<lb></lb>stable came to my assistance, and we took him to the station—the prisoner said he got over there to ease himself.</p>

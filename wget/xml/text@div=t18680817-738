                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a lodging house at 81, Bloomsbury Street—on Saturday night, 11th July, about 9.30, I was sitting in the front kitchen, down stairs—I heard some footsteps, and went on to the ground floor—I saw the parlour door open—I had closed it a few minutes before—a young lad came right against me from the parlour—I caught him by the shoulder, and called out "Thief!"—he pulled me to the street door, and opened it—another lad then came out from the same par<lb></lb>lour—he passed me and went into the street, and ran to the right—the other one got away from me, and I lost sight of him—I did not leave the house—I next saw him on Monday, at Bow Street—I cannot say that it was the same lad—there was some linen on the parlour table—I had taken it in a few minutes before—it was rolled up in the table-cloth when I saw it again—there was a light in the passage, but I was too excited to notice the boy at all—the street door was fastened by a latch—I had fastened it a few minutes before.</p>

I am the wife of Peter Turkeney, and live at 45, Charles Street, Fitxroy Square—on Saturday night, 11th July, my husband and I were passing the proseoutrix' house, 31, Bloomsbury Street—I saw the prisoner scuffling in the lady's hands, in the hall—he got away, and went to the right—my husband and I went after him, and kept him in sight till two gentlemen stopped him in Oxford Street—I saw a constable come up and take him from the two gentlemen—he was running when he was stopped.</p>

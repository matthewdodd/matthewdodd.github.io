            , I am a pawnbroker. In December last the Prisoner had been at my shop several times, and my servant told me he did not like him, and believed he was not honest: he brought first one pair of leather breeches, one pair of plush breeches , and a short cloak; about a fortnight afterwards he came to my shop with another pair of leather breeches.</p>

               <p>Jacobs. My man did, and after the Prisoner was gone he suspected him, and did not like him; the next time

My Lord, a few words will do it; I did ask my acquaintance to tell Mr. Rymer I had a few words to speak to him, and I discovered to Mr. Rymer the transactions Mr. Moss had with us, and went to Mr. Rymer's house to apprehend the Prisoner, which we did; and after the Prisoner was convinced we had opened the affair to Mr. Rymer, he fell down on his knees, and with tears in his eyes said he had wronged the best of masters.</p>

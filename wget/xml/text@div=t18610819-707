                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker and mender, and live in Mill-lane, Deptford—on Thursday, 30th May, about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming home from Lewisham where I had been doing some work, and as I was near the Ravensbourne river, going along a footpath leading to Deptford, I met the prisoner—the first words he accosted me with were, "You are the very fellow I want to see; you are a pretty fellow to go to a lady's house and do the work that I ought to do and have the money for it"—I asked him what house it was where the lady lived—he said "You d—d old b—you know well where she lives"—I said nothing to that—he then said that he would stab my—eyes out, and then I commenced to go on home, and he commenced stabbing me at the back of the head—I received the first stab there and the next at the side of the head—I held my hand up to defend myself—I turned to see what he had to stab me with, and it was the iron tube of an umbrella handle; and in turning my head he stabbed me right in the left eye with it—he then commenced stabbing me with it under the right eye and then under the ear, three or four times—I tried to extricate myself from him, I do not know how, and before I had gone many steps I fell to the ground senseless, and do not remember anything more until I found myself in the hospital some weeks afterwards—I was nearly ten weeks in the hospital—I have totally lost the sight of one eye and the other is very much damaged—unless I recover my</p>

               <p>sight I am a ruined man, for I cannot follow my employment—I have known the prisoner by sight for many years in passing by, but never had any conversation with him, and was never in his company—he is an umbrella maker and mender—there had been nothing the matter with my eyes previous to this occurrence—I did not use any violence to the prisoner before he struck me, only in my own defence in pushing my hand out to defend myself; if I did touch him it was not intentionally.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th May, I saw the prosecutor lying on the footpath leading from Lewisham to Deptford, near the Ravensbourne river—the witness Price and another man were with him, bathing his eyes with water from the river—his left eye was very much swollen, and he was bleeding from a stab in the right cheek—I got assistance and took him to the station, and then to Guy's Hospital—he was not able to speak—in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house at 9 o'clock next morning and saw him—he said, "I suppose you are come about that affair up by the water works yesterday?"—I said, "Yes, I am"—he said, "Well, I done it in self defence" and he delivered this stick up to me and said that was the stick he did it with.</p>

I am a seafaring man and live at Deptford—on the evening of 30th May, I was near the Ravensbourne river—I heard some persons talking rather angrily, and then saw the prisoner and prosecutor; I was thirty or forty yards from them looking at some men at work—I turued round and saw Morgan make a blow at the prisoner, whether it" was in self defence or not I cannot say, it partly knocked his hat off—the prisoner took</p>

               <p>a stick from underneath his arm and made a blow at the prosecutor's face, and repeated it directly—it was a thrust—I made up to them directly, and Morgan was then lying on the ground bleeding from the—cheek and eye, and the prisoner was standing close to him—I took off his handkerchief and apron and bathed his eye, and remained with him till the policeman arrived—he was insensible when I went up to him—he vomited a great deal, and what he brought up smelt very strongly indeed of rum.</p>

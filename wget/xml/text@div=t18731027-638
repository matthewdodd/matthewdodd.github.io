I live at St. Mary's Square, Paddington Green—on 10th August last I went through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner at All Saints, Battle Bridge—he told me he was a widower—we went to live at 25, Caledonian Road, and about five weeks afterwards we removed to 16, St. Mary's Square—I first heard that he had been married before on the morning he was taken—I saw the wife—the prisoner was present—she said he was her husband—he said he did not recognise her—at the police-station he said he had been very much tormented by her for the last thirteen years, and had maintained her up to the last few months, and that he would sooner be hung for her than support her, she had worried him out of the last dozen situations—the wife said he had behaved very badly to her, and it was about ten years since he had left her, he lived with a person, but she was not his wife, they were not married—I can't say whether he contradicted her or not.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on the morning of 11th October—he was fetched out of a shop in the Edgware Road—I told him I was a police officer, and was going to take him into custody for marrying Miss Woodcock, his wife, Mrs. Pike, being now alive—he said "I have not lived with her for thirteen years, and I hope I shall never see her again"—I took him to the station and fetched Mrs. Pike—she said "That is my husband, and he left me about nine years ago, and he behaved very bad to me"—the prisoner made no answer to that—Miss Woodcock was present.</p>

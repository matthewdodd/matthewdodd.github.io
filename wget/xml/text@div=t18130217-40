               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch in February - A. I did, from off the nail in the parlour, where it hung up, just inside of the door that parted the shop from the back room. The house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it before it was lost - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner; do you know him - A. I never saw him before that night. I think it wanted about a quarter to seven at night when he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it away - A. I heard him draw it off the nail. I was drawing some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room - A. No, I was in my chandler's shop, drawing some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take it off, did you - A. No. I was stooping at the barrel; I heard the chain rattle and he run out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who run out - A. The prisoner. He came into the shop for some beer. I looked and saw the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anybody else there that saw it besides you and him - A. A little girl that is here saw it. I called, stop thief, and my neighbours followed him and stopped him. The constable has got the watch.</p>

            . I stopped the prisoner about one hundred yards from Mrs. Broadhurst's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running - A. No. He had his hat in his hand. It appeared to me that he had dropped his hat, or that he had tripped. I heard the cry of, stop thief. I laid hold of him and stopped him. I told him I would take him back and have him searched. I heard something drop from him. I called to a young man that came out of the house with me, to look and see what was dropped. I am certain it was the watch. The young man picked up the watch.</p>

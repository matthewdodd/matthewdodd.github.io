I am a pawnbroker's assistant, and live at 13, Francis Street, Deptford—between 3 and 4 in the afternoon of 17th August I was on London Bridge, looking at a boiler that was on a van—I noticed the prisoner close to me: I had my watch taken out of my pocket, and on looking down I found my chain hanging down, it was broken—I saw the prisoner walking off towards Tooley Street—I got a policeman and gave him in charge—I asked him for my watch and he said that he had not got it—I have not seen it since—it was a silver watch and worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was standing on my left side when the watch was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser—on Monday afternoon, 17th August, I was standing on London Bridge about 2.30—I saw the prisoner snatch the watch from Mr. Brown—he passed it to some one else—he stood still for about half a minute and then walked about six or seven yards away—the prosecutor felt down and said "I have lost my watch"—I said. "Yes, that is the person who has snatched the watch from you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were about fifty or sixty persons there—I was about half-a-yard from Mr. Brown—the prisoner was between us; Brown was on his right side, and I was on his left—I did not see anyone in front of me—there might have been someone on the other side of me, but I can't tell you whether there was or not—I should think it was two or three, minutes before the prisoner was given into custody—I kept my eye on him while Brown went for a policeman—I pointed the prisoner out to the policeman—the prosecutor was present—I said "That is the man who took the watch."</p>

On Monday afternoon, 17th August, Brown came up to me on London Bridge and I took the prisoner, in consequence of what he said, on the charge of stealing his watch—the prisoner said that he did not take the watch, and the other witness came up and said that he saw him take it.</p>

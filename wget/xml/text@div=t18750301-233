                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Palliser &amp; Co., army and navy contractors, 154, Minories—in July last I was introduced by Mr. Coathupe to the defendant, and he introduced to my notice a patent of his own for improving trowsers—I examined it with some care, and found it to be a clever invention—he told me that he was unable to bring it out himself for want of means—he did not tell me that he had been at Messrs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010043"></xptr>
               <p>Turner's at Bristol, and that they had used the invention—he asked me to find the means for taking out this patent and working it—I put myself in communication with a patent agent, and provisional protection was ulti<lb></lb>mately registered for the patent in his name—a letter was written on the 9th July by the defendant to me, which embodied the terms of the arrange<lb></lb>ment under which I was to take out the patent and work it—at that time the defendant was residing at No. 29, Nelson Square, Blackfriars—it was arranged that I should take certain rooms at his house for the purpose of working the patent; the rooms were taken, and I paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for them—the defendant was much in want of money at that time, and I found him some for the purposes of his immediate requirements—he was placed in charge of the manufacturing department in Nelson Square, and Mr. Coat<lb></lb>hupe was the clerk—it was his business to look after the books; they were a day-book, a pay-book, and an outward and general invoice-book—this was a temporary arrangement for the purpose of testing this patent—the defen<lb></lb>dant was to be paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as subsistence money on account of royalty, Mr. Coathupe 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and the employe's were to be paid by the week—when the amount earned was ascertained, we were first of all to deduct 6 per cent, for working expenses; after that Captain Coathupe was to have 10 per cent., and the defendant was to divide the remainder with us—in September certain information was given me in reference to the buying of cloth—I saw the prisoner in reference to that information—I found that he had purchased quantities of cloth much in excess of what he ought to have purchased; he had only authority to buy a small quantity for a test—I told him that he was not to buy any more cloth, and I sent a circular to all the manufacturers of cloth and advertised in the newspapers, warning them not to supply it—after the cloth had been manufactured into trowsers, the prisoner had no authority to dispose of them direct from Nelson Square—this is a notice that I gave to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">stating that the amount of cloth ordered by the defendant was</hi> 1.279<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d. and directing him not to order a yard more, as they should not pay for it</hi>). The course of business was for the orders to be received at the Minories, transmitted to Nelson Square, and the goods sent through the Minories to the customer, who would be debited in our books there—the Nelson Square premises were simply our manufactory—on Thursday 3rd December 1 had some conversation with the defendant in reference to the transfer of this pa<lb></lb>tent to some one else—he said he had a friend, a rich manufacturer of Leeds, who had gone to Bristol, who was prepared to buy all the cloth and trowsers—he would not give me the name, he said he was to be back the next day—he did not make any communication to me at that time about his having been sending goods on direct from Nelson Square to any persons; I was quite unaware of it—these two* documents marked C and D were drawn up on that occasion—prior to 3rd December I had received D in a letter from the defendant, and that document D with the letter was considered at the interview of 3rd December—C is a copy of it made by myself with one exception—the defendant took that away with him. (<hi rend="italic">The defendants letter enclosing paper D proposed to take the entire stock, paying</hi> 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cash for it, together with the book debts</hi>, 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) The document D contains the terms upon which he said his rich friend was going to take over the whole thing—the addition to C is the date, December 8, 1874—that is in the defendant's handwriting—I gave him till the following Monday to com<lb></lb>plete the arrangement—the document says "open till Monday"—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010044"></xptr>
               <p>was no stamp on it at the time it was taken away—the rich friend was to have come back on the Friday, then he asked till Saturday, and then I advanced it to Monday—he did not come on any of those days and the proposal was at an end on the Monday—there had been some talk prior to this interview about forming a company for the purpose of working this patent—I had prospectuses printed at the defendant's request and had them issued to him; it was proposed that this patent should be worked in that way—in document C I find "Cash by book debts 434<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—in D it is 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there is no mention in either of a sale to Walton—on 10th December I received some information from a man in our employ named Game, and I went with Mr. Coathupe to Nelson Square—I had previously written to the defendant this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th December, hoping the defendant would make it convenient to see him</hi>) I wrote that because I had been unable to find or to see him—in cones<lb></lb>quence of what Game told me I went with Mr. Coathupe to the premises of Messrs. Pewtress, the packers, but I did not go in—the following days I went upon receiving a memorandum from Messrs. Pewtress, and I there saw 30 dozen pairs of trowsers belonging to us—I was also shown this invoice in the defendant's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi>10<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1874. <hi rend="italic">Messrs. Pewtress &amp; Co.—Please to receive from E. Symes to pack on account of Thomas J. Walton</hi> 30 <hi rend="italic">dozen trowsers in bundles.</hi>" I saw the defendant's wife at Nelson Square on the 10th December, and in her presence I made certain enquiries of the persons employed there—on the morning of 11th December I received this letter at my private address. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated December</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th. From the defendant to the witness stating that he should be out by</hi> 9.30 <hi rend="italic">in the morning, having to attend Court, co., and suggesting that Coathupe should have notice, as after the present week there would be nothing for him to do.</hi>) If Coathupe had been taken away from the premises there would have been on one there to supervise or overlook the prisoner—after inquiring I found that twenty-one and a half dozen pairs of trousers had also gone to Mr. Walton—until the defendant was taken into custody I knew nothing of any bill of exchange drawn by Symes and accepted by Walton in respect of goods supplied direct from Nelson Square—until December 10 I knew nothing of Mr. Walton—the reason of the selling through the Minories was that we might make enquiry into the solvency of persons to whom goods were to be supplied—from what I have since heard of Mr. Walton I should not have supplied goods to him. (<hi rend="italic">A letter marked YY dated 11th December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">from Palliser Co. to the prisoner was rend stating that they had decided upon removing the goods from Nelson Square to the Minories at once, and requesting him to hand them all over to the bearer</hi>) We removed the goods after this discovery—we did not get the books; the first time they were produced was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You engaged the rooms in Nelson Square and we paid the rent—we commenced to pay the rent at the end of July—I did not engage you as a servant; you had been occupied in the develop<lb></lb>ment of this patent, as a test—you were engaged with me in developing this patent, not as a servant, as the manager of the works—you were neither a servant or a partner—well, you were as a partner, if you wish, in the patent—I paid you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on account of royalty: that was a verbal ar<lb></lb>rangement—the arrangement was that we should divide the profits equally between us, whatever was over after paying the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week royalty, 6 per. cent on the gross sales, and 10 per cent. to Mr. Coathupe, we should divide</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010045"></xptr>
               <p>whatever was the result of this little test—that arrangement was made about the end of July, about the time the patent was taken out—it was not in writing, it was a verbal arrangement; it was made in the presence of my brother and Mr. Coathupe—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week was paid to you regularly every week, that was on account of the royalty as far as I recollect, or on account of the half share of the profits, it does not signify which, it is quite im<lb></lb>material—I purchased 6 yards of cloth for you to make a test with—you purchased all the cloth except that, up to the time we advertised and stopped it on 3rd December—all the cloth was sent to the Minories to be properly examined, entered in the books, and forwarded to Nelson Square—all the invoices came to us—this produced is an invoice for some of the cloths ordered by you, it is dated September 1st and is made out to you—you had authority to order small quintiles—when I called at Nelson Square, on 10th December, I saw Mrs. Symes—she said you were gone to the City of London Court to answer a summons from one of the workmen—I don't recollect her saying the same on another day; she may have done so—I re<lb></lb>marked that there seemed a diminution of stock—she said some goods had gone out—I ascertained upstairs that they had gone to Walton, and I said I hoped he was a sound good customer—previous to 3rd December I had conversation with you relative to taking over the whole stock; you said a friend, who is now in Court, Mr. Faulkner, had offered you 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was going to pay you—there was no agreement beyond my saying that I should be very happy to see the gentleman and arrange terms—I called on you on Saturday night, 28th November, and at your request brought a statement of the stock and the money that had been paid—you said you would make out the statement and send it to me by post—I assented to that—I received it on the Monday, the 30th—I called on you three times on the Monday—I said I would consult my brother on the subject—the ar<lb></lb>rangement was made that if you paid me 1, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would take over the book debts and that 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to you as half profits was to remain against any debts, or anything; that was the time Mr. Faulkner was going to purchase it for 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what I agreed to was reduced into writing, all the rest was mere conversation; nothing was drawn up until 3rd December—I would have accepted the money—when you travelled you had authority to take orders but not to part with the good—all the goods were sent from Nelson Square to be examined—the goods were packed in Nelson Square—they were put into boxes and forwarded by our packers—there was a ticket printed at first by mistake, "Palliser's patent," that was never used; it should have been "Symes' patent"—I was aware that you were getting up a company, I had nothing to say against that; I printed the prospectus for you and gave you every possible encouragement—I did not arrange the prospectus—you wanted me to become a director, I distinctly declined to have anything to say to it; one ground was the absurd amount of the capital, half a million—I think you wished to be managing director—I pro<lb></lb>posed myself to get up a company, when you had failed, among my own friends—you sent a letter to the War Office in your own name, I think Mr. Coathupe drew it up, I did not—I refused to have anything to do with the prospectus. (<hi rend="italic">Letters dated 9th, 16th, 19th, 25th, and 30th September, 7th November, and llth December, were read.</hi>) I knew of those letters afterwards.</p>
               <p>Henry Coathope. I live at Stamford, Road, Fulham—in July last year I introduced the prisoner to Mr. Palliser, and the prisoner and myself com<lb></lb>menced to conduct the business in Nelson Square, as Mr. Palliser has stated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010046"></xptr>
               <p>—I kept the books and the prisoner attended to the manufacturing—Mr. Palliser rightly told you that the orders would go through the Minories, so that the credit might be tested, and so on, and the goods were sent to the Minories for delivery, and the money for the goods was paid at the Mino<lb></lb>ries always—I do not know of any goods being sent on the 2nd December to Mr. Walton, nor on the 10th December—I did not know of any bill being received from Mr. Walton for 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until it was found out—I never saw any entry in the books of those transactions—I last saw the day-book on the 29th or 30th November—I don't know what became of it—I could not find it between the 30th November and the 11th December; it was missing—I inquired about it—I asked the prisoner, and he said "It will turn up," and I thought it would—there was nothing to put down, so it was not very important; that was the book in which the transaction should have been entered to Walton—we had not a bill-book there—all financial transact<lb></lb>tions were done at the Minories—I had nothing to do with them—I saw no entry in the day-book until the matter was investigated at the Police Court—I was present on the 3rd December when a conversation took place about a negotiation for the sale of the business—I saw those two documents which have been put in as to the 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. plus 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think for the bills to remain over till the following morning—I did not give the prisoner any authority to sell goods in his own Dame and send them off to Walton, and I had no suspicion of it—I never got to the place of business earlier then 10.30, generally about 11 o'clock—it depended on the trains—if goods went out before that I should not see them.</p>

Palliser, or rather say since last July—I had known them before that; I was at Staff College with Captain Palliser and his brother—I wrote a letter to you on the 13th of December for an explanation—I wrote that of my own authority—I said I hoped that for your own credit you would be able to explain this transaction—I called there, but I could not find you—I was not at Nelson Square on Monday the 30th November, I am quite certain of that; nor on Tuesday the 1st December—I was ill on those days—I was there all subsequent days up to the 10th December—I was there on the 2nd, and saw Captain Palliser—I did not see him in the evening: it was on the evening of the 3rd I saw him, when the stamped agreement was made out—I was most likely there on the 28th and 29th, I could not say positively—I remember the fact of two gentle<lb></lb>men being downstairs when Captain Palliser called; I could not say the date—the arrangement on the 3rd between you and Captain Palliser was that you should pay them 1, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they taking up the book debts, you taking up the bills owing and taking over the business—that arrangement was cer<lb></lb>tamly not made before the 3rd, because the arrangement with Mr. Palliser did not expire till the 2nd December—I know of a company being formed, I drew up the prospectus—the Pallisers had a proof of it; they did not ap-prove of it, they declined to be responsible for a single statement in it—you told us you had arranged with Mr. Faulkner that he was to buy the business for 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but it was all moonshine—I did not know you were negotiating a sale until the 3rd December, as far as regards that particular arrangement—I wrote this post-card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to you, it is dated the 10th November:" All right, if your solicitor acts for them, no need of leaving here—they</p>

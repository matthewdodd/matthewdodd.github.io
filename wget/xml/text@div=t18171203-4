On the 31st of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my bar, the candles had been lit sometime-three men came into the tap-room and called for three quarterns of gin, the prisoner Harding was one of them - I served them; they afterwards called for a glass of gin and water, and while it was making Harding was walking to and fro in the passage by the bar door, the stairs came into the passage, he could see every thing. I went up stairs and tried my own room door, and am positive that I found it locked; I went into another room that was not locked, but could see no person there - I did not fasten that door. I then heard a whistle, and some person called "Rover," and said,"D-n the dog." I came down for a candle, waited in the passage to watch, and saw the prisoner, Hooker, come down stairs; I met him in the passage, and asked him if he had been up, he said he had, as he had made a mistake, and thought it was the Horse and Dolphin; I told him he should not have gone up; three more men then rushed out of the tap-room and knocked me down, they gave me a violent blow on my head-the prisoner, Harding, was one of them; Hooker joined them and I pulled him over me, and tore a piece of his coat off - He got away - I followed him into Great Suffolk-street, where he was stopped. I never lost sight of him. I returned, went up stairs, and found the back room door broken open, which I had locked myself an hour before-it was not the room that I went to before; I had the key in my pocket at the time; there were marks of a chisel on the side of the door-the stairs that I saw Hooper come down leads to that room-it was the nearest to the stairs, there is no other key to the door-it was forced open. I missed nothing. As I returned from the office, about two hours afterwards, I picked up some skeleton keys, with a wrench and a picklock, in a bag; it was in the direction that he had run, and in the very place where he turned round in Great Suffolk-street, which is not a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. It was about a quarter before seven o'clock when they came in, I looked at the clock. I suspected them from seeing them watching about. I did not try the door the first time that I went up, I came down on hearing them call "Rover;" I waited in the passage, and saw Hooker come down stairs; he said he supposed he had made a mistake, for he had come to meet a friend at the Horse and Dolphin. At the Office he said he came to see a friend who lodged there. I laid hold of him, but they rushed out and rescued him; I then followed him into the street, and asked him to come back, he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was you gone to Bow-street - A. About an hour and a half. I followed Hooker very close.</p>
               <p>Q. If he dropped the bag you must have seen him - A. No; when he got to Suffolk-street I did not pursue him so close, as I knew he could not escape. I am positive the room was locked an hour before; I had the key then.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. I was in the tap-room and saw the men come in-my brother left me in the tap-room when he went out; the three men went out, the prisoner, Harding, was one of them. Hooker came down stairs, and my brother called out immediately. I followed close into Great Suffolk-street, and stopped the prisoner, Hooker, at the corner of Little Suffolk-street; he said he would knock any person down that came near him-he struck me twice - I gave him up to the constable. After taking him into the tap-room, while I was holding him, Harding was brought in. He is the same man that was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a servant out of place. I never saw the prisoners before; they came into the tap-room between six and seven o'clock. Harding was with the other two - He did not sit down, but kept walking about the passage, and looking up stairs.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CLAYTON. I am a boot-closer. On the 31st of October I was coming up Whitcomb-street, and heard the cry of stop thief! Harding was before the mob - I stopped him - He was running in a direction from Jackson's house; I brought him back, with the constable's assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He made no resistance. He asked what was the matter, I told him I did not know. The constable came up and took him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM POWEL. I was in the tap-room, on the 31st of October, when the search was made, a dark-lanthorn was found under a seat with a piece of wax candle in it; I had seen the prisoners sitting in that settle when they were handcuffed - I was not in the house before.</p>

             re-examined. It is the same seat where the prisoners were sitting, only at the other end.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was found an hour and a half afterwards; it was under the very place where they sat when they were brought back.</p>
               <p>HOOKER'S Defence. An acquaintance of mine, of the name of Williams, lodged in Whitechapel, but had removed; they directed me to the Horse and Dolphin, the first public-house in Whitcomb-street; I went up and knocked at the first-floor door, but nobody answered-as I came down I met Jackson, he asked me to come back, which I did, and he collared me.</p>
               <p>HARDING'S Defence. Jackson has spoken falsely to say I knocked him down; I was knocked down myself, and ran after the men, when I was taken. I was calling for my dog which I had lost.</p>

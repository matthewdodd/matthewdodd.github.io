                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Collingwood-street, Beth<lb></lb>nal-green. I was present at Shoreditch-church, in November, 1832, when the prisoner was married to Ann Weltered—I had known the prisoner about twelve months—his wife is still alive—I saw her a few minutes ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Parish-clerk of St. Mary, Islington. I pro<lb></lb>duce the register of marriages at that church—on the 5th of December, 1838, there was a marriage between two persons named Norris and Loft—Ihave some recollection of having seen the prisoner at that church, but I cannot testify that it was on a marriage occasion, and I have some idea of his wearing his hat about the church, and he seemed to have a careless way about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you have seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a clear recollec<lb></lb>tion that I had—I think it was on a marriage occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I was nineteen years old last November—I live in Wade's-place, Poplar—I have been acquainted with the prisoner better than twelve months—he was an acquaintance of my brother's, where I then lived, and it was there I first saw the prisoner—I went to live in his house last July—I saw a woman there, and she repeatedly told me, in the prisoner's presence, that she was his wife—I went there because my sister and I could not agree—I was placed under the prisoner's protection—I have seen him write repeatedly, and I have received letters from him—I have not the least doubt that the signature to the marriage in this register is his writing.</p>

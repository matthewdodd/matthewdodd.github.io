               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNBAR. Q. Where had you been? A. I was coming from my duty in the Strand, where I am in the employ of the Post-office; I had been into that shop to look at my watch, and then put it into my fob; I was crossing towards Day and Martin's at the time - there were persons coming along; I felt it taken quite suddenly - I could not exactly tell from where the snatch came; I did not see the person or the hand - I did not turn to look in the direction it went; I had dined at home, at Battle-bridge, I think about three o'clock, and this was a quarter-past eight - I was on duty at five o'clock, and gave it up at six; I had called at a friend's house in Lincoln's Inn-fields, and there I had part of three pots of ale among four of us - I had left there about a quarter of an hour when I lost my watch; I saw the man when he ran away - I cannot swear to the prisoner; the shop I went into was a pawnbroker's, to ask what they would lend me on it - I am sure I did not slip it down by the side of my fob; I had a thick great coat on - it was not buttoned; I saw a man taken to the watch-house, but cannot say he was the man I saw run.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I am a serjeant of the Police. I was in Holborn, and saw the witness - he cried Stop thief! I saw a man running - he ran round a cab, and dropped down before me; I took him - it was the prisoner; the watch was given to Tisdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this? A. A short distance from Little Turnstile - he was running from Day and Martin's; I was not aware of any fight - I saw a number of persons run when stop thief! was called; the cab was standing as if waiting for some person who had called at some house - I think the street was slippery; I thought the prisoner was struck at seeing me, but I do not know whether he fell by accident or design - I found these seals and chain in his hand; they do not belong to the prosecutor, and have not been claimed - at the watch-house I found six duplicates on the prisoner - two of them are for watches.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TISDALE. I was on duty about eight o'clock- I saw the prosecutor, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I pursued a man I saw running - he slipped under a horse's head, and fell: the prosecutor was calling out,"Where is my child?" or, "Where is my boy?" and a hand was reached over with dark clothes - whether it was a pelisse or a coat I do not know, and some one said,"D-n your child, here is the watch;" I received the watch within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the cab had been going on he must have been run over? A. Yes; I went up to the prosecutor when the prisoner was secured, and the watch was handed to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was running home from working with my cousin, who is a farrier, and I slipped down at the side of the curb - they said I had robbed the man.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Enfield, I am servant with Mr. Fipps ; I was coming to London, with a drove of sheep, last Saturday was a fortnight, about twelve at night ; the prisoner at the bar, came up to me, and laid hold on my horse's head, and asked me for my money; I think he had a sort of a hanger in his hand: it was some sharp thing; the moon shone very bright, so that I am sure it was the prisoner; he had a little cropt hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Field. I had at Edmonton, I think some time last summer; I gave him my money, which was 3 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike at you?</p>
               <p>Field. No, he did not, I was much afrighted ; about ten minutes after I was robbed; I met Joseph<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020035"></xptr> King with a cart, I told him I had been robbed, and if he had any money about him, to secure it ; he told me afterwards, he was robbed by such a man; I took the prisoner up on the Thursday following, going into Burry street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you then?</p>
               <p>Field. Yes, my lord,

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Manor Road—Mrs. Dewsbury is my wife's sister—I am an accountant, and have money of Mrs. Dewsbury, for the purpose of lending it out, which is the reason that there is a bank<lb></lb>ing account in the name of Follit and Dewsbury, and the security is in the names of Follit and Dewsbury—on 20th November the defendant came to me; I had never seen him before—he gave his name Alfred Whitehead, and wanted a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett would suffice—he offered, as security, a bill of sale on his furniture at Stock well—I asked him if he had a pianoforte—he said "Yes, I have got one at the Pantechnicon, but I have had an advance upon it, and that is partly the reason I want this money, to redeem it"—I asked him if there was any rent due; he said "No, it is paid up to Michaelmas." On the 23rd I went to his house 4, Norman Terrace—there was no pianoforte there then—he produced the inventory and said that he did not wish the bill of sale registered till the last day, at all events, because he was about obtaining an appointment to an estate in liquidation at Hammersmith, which would bring him into funds, and if the bill was registered it might injure him in getting that appointment—he said that he had received some income from his wife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260079"></xptr>
               <p>which might assist him, and he might get rid of the bill of sale—I next saw him on the 24th, I think, and the money was paid on the 25th, when I saw him at my house—I met him that day according to appointment at 6, Longford Terrace, Mr. Harris's house—the bill of sale had then been pre<lb></lb>pared; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it had been agreed that the bill was to be for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to cover interest and expenses for 12 months—he executed this bill of sale, and this inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is copied from the one he supplied me with—he signed and made this declaration at the same time, and before he executed the bill of sale. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the pianoforte, chimney-glass, and hearth-rug were his own property, and that he had not charged his goods with any sum of money, except the goods at the Bedford Pantechnicon</hi>) he also signed a pro<lb></lb>missory note, and I paid 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the full amount of the bill of sale—the amount the defendant got was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be deducted by agreement until he produced the pianoforte—I went to his house on the 29th; he opened the door to me—I said "Have you got the pianoforte?"—he said "Yes, all right"—I went into the parlour; there was a pianoforte there, made by Tolkein, and I paid the prisoner the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 14th I wrote to the prisoner, as the time for registration expired on the 17th, and said that unless it was paid on the following day it must be registered—when the deed was executed I said "Well, I expect the receipt for the rent," and he handed me this piece of paper to show that the rent was paid—I received this letter in reply to one of mine about registering the bill of sale: "December 7th. Dear sir, I think I shall be able to pay you back the bill of sale by Thursday next; so you will not require to register it before next Thursday, and I will call on you then. Yours respectfully, A. N. White<lb></lb>head. To W. Follit, Esq."—he called on the 15th and said that he should not be able to pay it off—I said "I think I can manage it; a friend of mine will lend you the money"—he said that he should be very glad—before that he said "Cannot the bill of sale be renewed?"—I said "No, it must be a fresh one altogether"—I applied to Mr. Lee and got his cheque—on 16th December I prepared another bill of sale for Mr. Lee, which he executed, it is a copy of my bill of sale—my first bill had to be got rid of to prevent it being registered; it was paid off—I did not tear off the name, as it is now, till two or three days afterwards—the promissory note was returned to him, and he gave me this one in lieu of it—this is his signature—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque I gave him, and he put his name on the back of it—out of this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. my bill of sale was paid off and cancelled, and then Mr. Lee stood as the person—there was no intercourse between him and Mr. Lee; they were strangers—I parted with my 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 19th November, on the bill of sale, and on the representation that he had a pianoforte, and that the rent was paid—I searched the list to see whether there was any Alfred White<lb></lb>head there, and there was not; but I have found it since—Walter being the Christian name, it escaped my attention—I believed the pianoforte I saw was the one from the Bedford Pantechnicon, and I parted with my 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. think-in he had redeemed it—I parted with Mr. Lee's cheque, believing the same representations—the glass lustres, chimney-glasses, and hearth-rug were at his house at that time—on December 23rd I saw a report in the newspapers, and on the 27th I seized the goods on behalf of Mr. Lee, and removed them—the prisoner called one evening at my house, and I told him the report I had seen in the newspaper that he had been on his trial for fraud respecting this very pianoforte—I was summoned to the Police Court—Mr. Ellison inquired into it, dismissed me, and sent the prisoner for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Baughan, of Southampton Buildings—about January 11th I went to Whitford Street, New Road, Hammersmith, and took an inventory of the whole of the furniture—I have since seen the furniture in the auctioneer's hands—McMillan was still there in January, 1871—some time after December 27th I went to Such &amp; Marshall's Rooms, and saw some furniture there—it was previous to the last Session of this Court—I found there a portion of the furniture which I had put in the inventory—these are the defendant's signatures—he signs Walter Alfred Whitehead—my bill of sale was registered in that name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What goods did you see at Mr. Such's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A mahogany chest of drawers, and washhand-stand and towel-horse, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—to the best of my belief they were the same—there is a balance still owing for the debt and costs—the goods were sold some two or three months back with your written permission, and realised 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

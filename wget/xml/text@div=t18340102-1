               <p>JOHN FOOTMAN re-examined.

               <p>John Pearce's Defence. Scott and Farrell brought the prosecutor in to have some gin - he met us, and asked if we would go and take part of it - we drank it - we had some ale afterwards; and the man put down 1s. to pay for the gin - the landlord took the whole of it out of the man's shilling; and about an hour after drinking, the man was intoxicated; and Scott and Farrell took hold of his arms, and led him outside, and said, "Come along, old fellow;" and as soon as they got out, I heard the man say, "Take your hand out of my pocket" - when I got to the door I saw Scott holding his arms, and Farrell's hands were in his pocket - Scott ran away - I was frightened, and I ran away and passed the policeman.</p>

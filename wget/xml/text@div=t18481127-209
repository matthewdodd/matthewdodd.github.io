On 9th Sept., before I went into their service, I was standing outside the gateway I saw Abell come out of the brewery with a loaded dray—he asked me to go and drink with him, which I did—he then asked me to walk with him, and we went to the Three Cranes-wharf, Upper Thames-street—, there was then on the dray five full barrels, two full kilderkins, and one empty one—we left at the wharf five full barrels, and the empty kilderkin—we then went to Mr. Todd's house, just off the wharf, and left one full kilderkin there—we had then one full kilderkin on the dray—we then went to Toolev-street, and then Abell said he hardlv knew where it was to go—he said Charles Fair told him it was just underneath the railway—we succeeded in finding Digges's house—Digges was standing in front of the door, looking into the street—Abell said, "I have brought you a kilderkin of stout"—Digges said, "That is right, my boys, bring it in"—he went into the house, and I lent Abell a hand to get it off the dray—he rolled it in—I opened the door—Digges at first said he would have the empty casks moved out of the corner—he then said, "Never mind, it won't be in the way, pitch it up there"—Abell pitched it up on its head in the corner, about two or three steps from the bar—Digges said, "What will you have to drink, my boys, ale, pale ale, or stout?"—Abell said he would have stout; and Digges drew a pint of stout, and gave us two glasses to drink out of—while Abell and I were drinking the stout, Mr. Berridge and the policeman came in—Mr. Berridge asked Abell what business he had there—he said he had brought some beer there—he asked him where the delivery-notes were—Abell produced some papers—Mr. Berridge looked at them, and said they were not sufficient notes—Abell then said he had forgotten them—Mr. Berridge told the policeman to take us two into custody, and he said he should give Mr. Digges into custody for receiving it—Digges said he would follow down to the station—the officer took Abell and me there—Digges did not coinc—I did not notice an) body at Digges's bar but Abell</p>

I missed two cages on the 2nd of June, and a pigeon-feeder on the 3rd, from an empty unfinished house; I had seen the prisoner lurking about that place on the night of the 1st of June, and on the night of the 3rd I went to the same place, and saw him and another running away - I took the prisoner, and this feeder dropped from him; a boy said he knew the prisoner, and stated where he lived - we went there, and found his father and mother lived there; I found these two cages, which I know are mine, and this feeder likewise.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRICE. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not deny taking the cages; I had a nest of birds, and being in want of cages for them I remembered seeing two exposed as if abandoned, on a heap of mould in the new building, and thinking they would answer my purpose, I, in the thoughtlessness of a desire to provide for my birds, took and cleaned and repaired them; they were quite exposed, and I had no felonious intention.</p>

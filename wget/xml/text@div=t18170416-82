            . I am a carpenter. On the 14th of March, I was at work for the prisoner, Bulgin, who lives at Tottenham. about eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in his back-room with him, and heard a sound of boards. Bulgin said, "there is the man with the boards," - He went out, and took them into the next house. Bulgin then brought the prisoner, Hards, into the room, and he stopped there about a minute, and went away. Bulgin told me that Hards worked at Bruet's Castle. I am sure that Hards is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of March, I went to Mr. Ede's house, which was building just by Bruet's Castle, and took Hards. When we got to the office, he told me he took the boards from his master's, and sold them to Bulgin for 1s. per board - He said he had taken twenty in all. I then went to Bulgin's house, with a search-warrant. Bulgin picked out some boards, and said he bought them of Hards. Bulgin's is full a mile from Bruet's Castle.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any shawls from your shop? - Yes, five.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - Twelve shillings. The 17th of February, the prisoner at the bar along with another woman, came into my shop and wanted to look at some cloth; I shewed two or three pieces, and sold them five yards and a half; after that they wanted to look at some shawls; I shewed them a great many different patterns, I had no pattern that would please them, I missed one pattern of shawls, and by the behaviour of the prisoner at the bar I supposed that she had them; I then called my young man out of the back shop, and sent him for a constable; the constable came, and I gave him the charge of this woman, the prisoner at the bar, and told him that I had a suspicion that she had some of my property, and the constable searched her and found the shawls on her; the constable has got them, his name is Moring.</p>
               <p>- MORING sworn.</p>
               <p>I took these three shawls out of the prisoner's pocket, in Mr. Mather's shop, and my brother officer has got two that he found himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know them to be mine by the shop mark.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property, they have the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends were with the prosecutor yesterday, and he promised faithfully he would not appear against me; therefore I have none of my friends ready. It is but five weeks since I buried my husband, and he has left me with two children. A young woman was out of place, and asked me to go with her to buy a shawl, and we drank a little two much, and when I drink a little spirits I have a very bad head, and how those shawls came into my pocket I really don't know.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 43). On the 13th Nov. I wag called by Burgess to assist in taking charge of a horse and cart at the King's Arms public-house, Whitechapel-road—I saw Burgess go into the house—he was in about a minute or a minute and a half—I was in charge of the horse and cart at the time, and from fifteen to twenty persons came out of the public-house—the prisoner is one of the persons that was there—I did not see him come out of the house—I was in uniform, but Burgess was not—I first saw the prisoner at the time they were rescuing the horse and cart—a man named Carney had a knife—he was on the near side of the horse—I was holding the reins on the off side—two of the persons attempted to get into the cart, and did get in, and tried to urge the horse on—one of them had a whip—Burgess had hold of the horse's head, and so had I—we succeeded in turning the horse round—Burgess was on the near side, the same side as Carney—we turned the horse's head round to take it to the station—I saw Lewis, who was tried last sessions, and Carney, strike Burgess two or three times, and myself also with their fists—the prisoner at the time was on the off side, between the horse's head and shoulders, and he took hold of the horse's reins—I heard him say, "Don't let the b----s take it; cut the b----b----'s hands off"—I do not know who he said it to—he said it out loud—I did not see any wound in<lb></lb>flicted on Burgess—nobody's hands were cut with the knife—the man in the cart was whipping the horse, and the people round trying to get the hone from us—I am not aware that anybody was struck with the whip—Burgess had his nose wounded by Carney—I was knocked down by a blow from one Barnett by a life-preserver, and the cart was rescued from us.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 198). I was on duty in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of Whitechapel on the night this occurred—I saw a horse and cart drive up—after I was in the public-house and had come out I endeavoured to take the horse and cart to the station, with Bray's assistance—several people came out and surrounded it—Carney inflicted a wound across my nose with a pen-knife, which he took out of his pocket; he also cut me in the left temple, and in the hand—I did not observe the prisoner there during the riot, but he was one of the persons who drove up in the cart.</p>

I took the prisoner in charge—I told him I took him on suspicion of being concerned with others in assaulting Burgess and Bray—he said he knew nothing about it—as we went to the station he said, so help his God he would not be sent away; he would tell the Magistrate the whole of it what he knew, and that the worst parties had got away—Carney had been convicted at that time.</p>

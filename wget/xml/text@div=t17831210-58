               <p>Last Sunday three weeks as I was coming down Islington, about 11 or 12 o'clock at night, by the Bank-side, I met with one of these prisoners, Carter, the corner of a street, I asked her if there was any house open, as I could not get a lodging, she persuaded me to go with her, I cannot say where she took me to, but I have been since informed it was <placeName id="t17831210-58-crimeloc323">Three Kings Court</placeName>

               <p>Where was the prisoner Harrison when you fell asleep? - To the best of my remembrance she lay down by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober? - I was not sober, but I was not any ways in liquor.</p>

               <p>Was there a light in the room when you went to sleep? - Yes, and when I awaked: I awoke about one or two, and my things were all gone. I am sure these things were all in my pocket when I went to bed; I immediately went to the watchman and the officer of the night, but every thing was gone.</p>

               <p>About 11 o'clock I went to the Fleet-Market to an acquaintance, to have some supper; coming home about half after, I met the prosecutor, he asked me the way to Dock-head, I told him it was a great way from thence; it was in Cheapside I met him, I told him he might go home with me if he chose it, he came home with me, and he sent for some bread and cheese and a pot of beer; he was very much in liquor, at last he went to bed, and he gave me some things to take care of till he awaked, and he said if I took care of them till the morning he would make me a handsome present.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go away with them then? - I only went into the same street to a public house to get a drop of purl to warm me; before I came back that gentleman waked, and was out in the street, I have not a friend in London.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HARRISON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was not in the house when the man came in, I called for some cloth I had left in her room, I fetched two pots of beer and went home, I could not get in; coming back again, I did not like to come to her house, and went into this public house where she was drinking; I had a pint of purl by myself, she was much in liquor, she said, I wish you would go home with me, and take care of these things, for if the man should wake, he will think I am gone off with them; she gave me these things for fear she should lose them. Carter was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you give this woman the things to take care of? - No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court to Hawes. Where were these women when you first found them? - At the sign of the Ship, in White-cross-street, about three or four hundred yards from where they live.</p>
               <p>What were they doing when you first saw them? - They were drinking.</p>
               <p>Not coming away that you saw? - No, I asked the prisoner where the man's property was when I laid hold of her; she said, she had no property but what was her own.</p>

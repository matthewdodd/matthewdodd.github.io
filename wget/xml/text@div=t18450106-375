                  </hi>. I am assistant to Elizabeth Frost, who keeps the Fountain in Great Shire-lane. On the 23rd of Dec. a person came in, who I have no doubt was the prisoner, between two and three o'clock in the morning—he asked for half a quartern of shrub and some warm water—he put down a half-crown—I took it up, and it was bad—I said, "Are you aware this is a bad half-crown?"—he said, "No, I am not"—I took a</p>

On the 23rd of Dec, at near three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came, with a female in his company—he asked where I could get some gin, and whether he could have a bed for the night—I said I did not know whether the night-house was open, but I would take his order—he said he would have a quartern of gin—I said he had better have sixpenny worth, as there were two of them—he said no, he would have a quartern—he dropped a half-crown on the floor by his foot—I took the decanter in my hand and the half-crown, and went to the Fountain—the half-crown was refused, and I took it back—I am certain it was the one I took from the prisoner—I had no other money—somebody went back with me from the Fountain, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I bit the half-crown, and gave it to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Irons, who keeps the Star and Garter public-house, at Colnbrook, in the parish of Stanwell. On the 5th of April, the two prisoners came to the house, and asked for some gin, which I served them with—Parr gave me a bad half-crown in payment—they asked me if there was a dancing-room, and if I would let them go up—I gave them leave—they did not go up, but went out into the street—this was the time of Colnbrook fair—in about an hour they came in again, and had another quartern of gin—Part gave me another half-crown—the first half-crown I had marked, and put it into my pocket—it was of</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint. The two half-crowns produced by Cook are both counterfeit, and both from one mould—this good half-crown also produced by Cook I believe to be the half-crown that made the mould in which the two counterfeit ones were cast—here is an accidental mark on the Queen's forehead, and that mark has been conveyed to both the counterfeit coins.</p>

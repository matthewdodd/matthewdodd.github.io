               <p>On the 6th of March, between ten and eleven at night, I was at supper in a cellar in <placeName id="t17810530-22-crimeloc89">Bridges-street, near Drury-lane</placeName>

They abused me, and called me a German dog, and began to push one another upon me, and hustle me about. The prisoner was the first man who began this: they struck me, and knocked me about, and continued to beat me in this manner for half an hour; and during that time, I lost my watch, for I am certain I had it in the cellar; and Davis and the other persons, who had behaved in that manner, were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300018"></xptr> there when I looked at it: whether he saw me look at it, I cannot say; I missed it within ten minutes after they let me alone. I said I had lost my watch: upon saying so, all, or the greatest part, of the persons in the cellar went away; there were ten or eleven people there.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes: I went in with a friend of mine (a Mr. Taylor) he was there all the time; he is not here: the reason why my friend did not interpose to have them taken into custody was, he was so much beat that he was ill for fourteen days after. On the 5th of May, I met the prisoner alone in Prince's street, and saw the chain and key of my watch; there are two seals upon it, which are not mine: I immediately stopped him, and told him he had my watch, and he must go along with me; he neither denied nor admitted that it was my watch, but said, if it was mine, he would give it me directly. I took him to the house where the constable was, and then he took out the watch, and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I sold this watch to the prosecutor. I made it on purpose for him. The prisoner said to me, that if it was the prosecutor's watch, he might have it; he said he had bought the watch; he did not say of whom: he was impertinent to the justice, and that made the justice more severe, and insist upon Mr. Elson prosecuting him.</p>

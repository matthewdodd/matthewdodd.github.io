               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was accusing an innocent person, and the prisoner was by about four or five in that afternoon, and I observed the prisoner's countenance to change, so I suspected him; and on the 26th of December, I saw an advertisement in the paper, of a lid of a silver tankard offered to be sold at Mr. Stevens's, a goldsmith, at the  without Bishopsgate. I went there with the body of the tankard, and saw the lid was the same that was taken off. I desired him to describe the man who brought it; he described the prisoner both in person and cloaths. I went and found him at the Golden-key alehouse in Cock-lane, Spitalfields, the same night; the next morning I took him before my Lord-Mayor, with the lid of the tankard, and the four yards of linen cloth, he having before that told me where he had sold that. There I accused him of the robbery; he acknowledged every thing, and said he had nobody with him in the doing it. He said he broke the door with a ripping chissel, and that he tried at the other door, but could not get it open, where we found the wood broke by wrenching it. He also said he was in the house with a lighted candle an hour and half; that he broke open the drawers where the goods were, and that he had disposed of the large silver spoon at Mr. Lloyd's, a little on the other side Mr. Stevens's in Bishopsgate-street; and the four yards of cloth to Mrs. Goldfinch, near the Cock, where I took him; the handkerchiefs I did not search after.</p>

I was going home one night, about the 28th of May; I live in Wych-street; I was going from the Trumpet, Sheer-lane, betwixt the hours of eleven and twelve; I met the prisoner and another woman in St. Clement's ch urch-yard; I went with them into her house, and sat in a great chair; the other young woman asked me if I would have something to drink; I said, no: she called for a negus, and Mrs. Crane brought it in; the prisoner said, if I would not pay for it, she would take my life. She took out a fire shovel, and cut me down the nose: she said, if I would not deliver the money, she would knock my brains out. If I had not paid for it, she would have murdered me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's servant. On the 1st of September I went out and left the door ajar, and the gate of the front garden open; I went to the next house but one, and returned in about three minutes; I met the prisoner in the passage coming from the parlour - I asked him what he wanted - he asked me the way to Somers' Town; I asked if he went in to ask his way to Somers' Town - he gave me no answer, but ran away directly - I gave an alarm and so did my mistress. I saw him taken up the street, and am sure he is the who person I had seen in the passage.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live in the Hampstead-road. I was in Arlington-street, and saw the prisoner running towards me - he then turned off, and ran towards the brick-fields. I pursued, and said to the brickmaker's who had caught hold of him - "Don't hurt him; let us go before a Justice;" the prisoner said, he had thrown down the time-piece; a boy picked it up, and gave it to me. I then asked him where the watch was - he said, he had thrown that away. I said, "I will not take your word;" I put my hand into his pocket, and found it there - the officer afterwards took it out.</p>

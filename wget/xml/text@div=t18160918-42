About twelve o'clock on the night of Saturday, the 20th of July, the prisoner was very much intoxicated, and we put her to bed. She had lived with me since April. In the morning I got up about eight o'clock, with intent to send her away, and when I came down, she was in liquor again. I suspected all was not right, and I set my daughter to watch her, and she called me down, and I sent for a constable, and we found a key on her which opened the wine-cellar door. In her pocket we found several duplicates, one leading to a shift of my wife's, and between the bed and the mattrass I found the other things named in the indictment.</p>
               <p>ROSA LYON. On the 21st of July, I watched the prisoner into the privy, and I saw her take a bottle of wine out of her pocket, and drink out of it; then she went to the coal-place, and I called my father.</p>

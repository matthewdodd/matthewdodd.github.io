                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Princes-street, Leicester-square. The prisoner was my errand boy—I sent him on the 23rd of October, with some barley sugar and other things, to two or three different places—the policeman brought the prisoner to my house, and produced a spoon which was mine—I had not allowed him to take it out—it had been in general use that day—he left me about six o'clock in the evening to go on his errand—he worked in the kitchen where it was—he said he took the spoon when he went out in the evening—he had only been a week with me.</p>

On the evening of the 23rd of October, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a table-spoon—I asked him how he came by it—he said he brought it from his mother, whose name was West—I asked him what mark was on it—he said, "W"—I gave him into custody of Osborne with the spoon.</p>

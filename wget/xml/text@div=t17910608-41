               <p>How many might there be at this time? - I suppose there might be about an hundred.</p>
               <p>How long was you in this situation? - Above an hour; they drove me, I suppose, one hundred and fifty yards from Prouse's house.</p>
               <p>During this time of being pelted by the mob, did you see either of the prisoners in that mob? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How did you escape from this mob? - I stood with the pistol in my hand, and one of the cutter's people,

            , with his pistol, threatning them, and the mate came up to our assistance, and we got to Jones's, and they throwed stones and glass bottles at us all the way, and the gentleman Edwards came up with a cutlass, now, damn your eyes, says he, now will you shoot me? I said yes, unless he would keep off; he said, I will cut you down like a bullock, you b - g - r; he held up his cutlass towards me, and then he went down lower out of my sight; the mob was all surrounding the house, heaving the stones through the window, and broke all the glass windows outside, and through the casement of glass belonging to the parlour where I was; they kept heaving stones continually till night.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this? - I believe it was about from two or three o'clock till the candles were lighted.</p>
               <p>What happened to you personally at this time? - My arm was quite black, and they cut my leg with a stone, that I could not walk to the cutter, but was obliged to be carried.</p>
               <p>What else did you see Edwards do? - I saw him do no more; soon after I got into Jones's parlour, I saw the prisoner Balless come to the window and say, you may as well give yourself up, for you shall never go home alive; he had got a large stone in his right hand, but I did not see him heave it, but he had got it in his hand, and there might be above two hundred people near him at the time: I did not see him do any more.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquor that had been carried out of Jones's house? - They did not take any out of Jones's house, it was so secured.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it before this was well over? - I cannot tell what it was o'clock, it was just dark, and the candles were alight, I had directions to three other houses, but neglected to search.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Prisoner's Counsel. The mob first collected about at Prouse's house, and from thence you was driven about one hundred and fifty yards; how long do you think the mob was surrounding you before you got to Jones's house? - It might have been an hour.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink at Jones's house? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was three years ago? - Yes, better than three years ago; I knew the house where Balless lodged, he lived on the Causeway.</p>
               <p>Did any of your officers stay behind? - Yes, I was taken to the cutter, being disabled.</p>
               <p>I believe Balless and you had had some quarrel since this matter happened? - No, no quarrell.</p>
               <p>Was not you drunk once, and threatened him with your cutlass? - I attempted to duck him once; I suppose you would wish to know the truth, I attempted to duck him in Cawsand, and I caught him by the collar, he tried to heave me down, and he snatched the cutlass, and ran away with it; that cutlass was returned to me by the surveyor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080063"></xptr>coming over to demand it; it was returned by the woman he lived with: I say I was not drunk at that time, I am sure I was not.</p>
               <p>Had you never said to the defendant Balless, that you knew no harm of him, and could swear nothing against him? - I said he never did me any harm, for a good reason, because he could not; he strove all he could do do it.</p>
               <p>Now could not he have thrown that stone at you at the time? - Yes, but he could not have hit me, for I had nothing to do but defend myself; I think if he could have hit me with it, it would have been very agreeable to himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is a desperate undertaking to attempt to take one of these men in Cawsand? - Yes, without it is in day-light, and you know them.</p>

               <p>You went to make this seizure? - I was at Prouse's house, we went into his house, down stairs in the cellar, and we proceeded to make a seizure, I believe I took the first keg out, and Mr. Bradley desired me to go up to Jones's, they were all got up, four or five, and I heard a cry that the men had got Felton upon the green; then I took my pistols and went into the middle of the men; there were one hundred and fifty or two hundred smugglers assembled about Felton, the place was full, and May had hold of Felton by the collar; then I gave him a stripe with my stick, immediately the stones began to fly like shot, as thick as hail, at Felton, and the rest of the officers; when he got round the corner, I had four or five stones on my back, I did not see either of the prisoners at that time; I saw both the prisoners at one time, one of them had a stone in his hand, that was the prisoner Balless, he was doing nothing with it; I asked him what he was going to do with it, and if he did not put it down I would fire at him; then he dropped it; I did not know him before: I called him Brisk, a man said, mind what names you are speaking; then I thought it was not the same man; I saw him two or three minutes afterwards, I am sure he is the man; I saw the other prisoner looking into the window with a cutlass in his hand, holding it up, and he said he would be damned but he would have me out, and cut me down; we were prevented from effecting our purpose; we had three houses more to search. I tasted the liquor at Prouse's, it was brandy and gin; the windows were all broke in, with the discharge of the stones from the smugglers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. You stated that there were a great number of persons present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The only person that had a stone in his hand was Balless? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The moment you desired him to put it down, he did put it down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not Balless, at the time you challenged him with the stone, say, he was going to do nothing with it, and drop it down directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said you did not know Balless before? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you known him since? - I have seen him since, many times since.</p>
               <p>This happened in 1788? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not drank with him in a friendly manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink with him that very afternoon after this took place? - I was in the Black Bull when he came, I had a pint of porter before me, he partook of the porter with me.</p>
               <p>Did not Edwards speak out so loud, that every body might have heard him? - Yes.</p>

On the night of the 30th of January, 1788, a large smuggling cutter, by the name of the Revenge, was stranded on Kingston-beach; early the next morning I was informed of it, and went to secure the property: in the afternoon of the day about two, I received a message from Mr. Bradley, mate of the excise cutter, saying that he had made a seizure of a quantity of spirits, and was presently opposed by a large mob, and begged for God's sake, I would go to his assistance: I went; when I came up in the square, before the house of Jones the victualler, I saw a mob of people, to the amount of two hundred: the windows were broke presently, I saw Bradley, I made the best of my way to him through the mob with my men: the mob appeared to be very outrageous, and Mr. Bradley appeared to be very much agitated: I went with Mr. Bradley into the house, there I saw Felton, with (I think) a brace of pistols presented towards the door, he was very much agitated; the mob was still riotous, I saw the prisoner

            , with a cutlass in his hand, flourishing and making up towards the house; as soon as I saw him in that situation I made towards him, to secure him, conceiving him to be the ringleader; he made a blow at me with his cutlass, I suppose I was in Jones's house about an hour; a scuffle ensued, and the prisoner attempted to make his escape, he was pursued; several of the smugglers followed him, and blows passed, during which he made his escape.</p>

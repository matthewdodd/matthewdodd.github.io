                  </hi>. I keep a butcher's shop in Red Lion-street. On the 29th of October I sent the prisoner, who was my errand boy, to Mr. Kelly's, in Bedford-row, with a haunch of Welsh mutton—he was not ordered to bring any thing back—I wrote on a ticket, "Mutton, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," which if he received it was his duty to bring back—he has not paid it to me—I asked him if it was paid—he said no, the lady was coming out, and would call and pay it—I afterwards made inquiries, and found it was paid when he came the next morning, I took him to the house—he said the lady had paid him, and he bad given it to me—I am sure he did not pay me.</p>

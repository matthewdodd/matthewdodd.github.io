                  </hi>. I live at 13, Carlton-hill, St. John's-wood—I have known the prisoner some few months—I have been in the habit of lending him some small sums of money, in order to bring out a publication which he said he was going to publish—he came to me in October last, and presented this letter—I rather think he sent it in to me—I don't recollect whether this bill was enclosed in it, or whether he put it into my hands when I saw him—my servant brought the letters in to me—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and gave him the money—I don't recollect in particular what he said—he asked me to discount the bill for him; he had asked that in the letter—I know his handwriting—that letter</p>

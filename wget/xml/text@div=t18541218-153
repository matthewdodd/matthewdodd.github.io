                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Spotted Dog, in the Strand On Tuesday, 5th Dec, I was serving there—about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Perrin and Bryan came in—Perrin asked for half a quartern of gin, and Bryan paid for it with a shilling—I put it into the till—there was no other shilling there—they then both left together—in scarcely a minute Regan came in—I served her with half a quartern of gin—she paid me a shilling—I saw it was bad, and broke it in two—I said to her, "You have given me a bad shilling, and you know it"—she said, "No, I did not"—I looked in the till for the other shilling, examined it, and found that was bad also—I made a communication to Mr. Wilson, and he went to the door, and found Perrin and Bryan waiting outside—he pushed them in, and closed the door on them all three—when Perrin was inside, he said, "Here is a good shilling for you; that is all you want"—we sent for an officer, and gave the three prisoners into custody—Mr. Wilson gave the shillings to the constable.</p>

I was in front of the bar when Regan came in—I saw her tender a shilling to the last witness—I was inside the bar when that shilling was broken—I took a pair of pliers and cut it in two—the last witness took a shilling out of the till—that was bad—that was the shilling she had first taken—I broke that and cut it—I took possession of those bad pieces, and gave them to the constable at the station house the same evening—after finding the second shilling was bad, I went to the door, and found Perrin and Bryan standing by the lamp post, laughing—they were about ten yards from my door—I took Perrin by the collar, and brought him and Bryan back into my house—Regan ran away, but I ran and brought her back—I kept them all till the officer came, and gave them into custody.</p>

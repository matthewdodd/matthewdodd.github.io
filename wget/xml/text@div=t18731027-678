I lived with the prisoner five years as his wife; we lived at 34, Bedford Square, Stepney—on 4th October I was washing two glass cloths, and the prisoner was in the kitchen, sitting by the fire—there were no words, but I felt a tingling sensation in front of my eyes—I fell, and when I came to myself I was on the floor, bleeding terribly; a chopper was lying by me, which he used to chop wood with; he brought it down in the morning and said "Don't say that I am going to hit you with this"—I said "No, I am not so wicked"—we had had a dispute on the Friday before, and he threatened to kill me if I called "Police."</p>

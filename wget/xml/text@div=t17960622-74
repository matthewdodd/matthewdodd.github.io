               <p>Q. Is the shop part of the house? - A. The shop, and house, and warehouses, are all under the same roof, with communications from one to the other: on Friday the 17th of June, our warehouse was broke open, and entered at the two pair of stairs back window, that abuts to a timber-yard; I had not observed that window the evening before, it is a window that has never been opened since the warehouse was built; in the morning, between seven and eight, I observed it was forced in; we lost a great quantity of tea, from seventy, to about eighty or ninety pounds weight.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 18th of June, at six o'clock, the first thing that took my attention was the lids off the cannisters, the cannisters out of their places, and every thing in confusion; some of the small cannisters were entirely emptied; on further examination, we found that the warehouse had been broke open by the forcing in a sash-window, which was nailed up; and in order to ascertain our loss, we weighed our stock of tea, when there appeared to be a decrease of eighty pounds, more or less of that tea, and three of these bags here are marked by me; tea is an article no man can swear to.</p>

               <p>Q. And particular by this window? - A. Yes; because that window fronts the stairs as you return down stairs; the next morning, about half past six, or not quite so much, I saw it was broke in; the window is two story high from the ground, he could not get in without a ladder, or being upon the premises.</p>

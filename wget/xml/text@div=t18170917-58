On 18th of July, about eleven o'clock, I received information, ran out of the shop, and saw two men walking very fast-one of them had something wrapped up in a great coat; I followed them, they turned down Wimpole-street, when they got to the middle of the street, one of them turned round and saw me following them, they immediately ran off to the corner of Henrietta-street. I saw the prisoner drop the two pieces of cotton - I was within ten yards of him; I am certain he is the man. I told Cockrain to pick them up, and I pursued. He ran through Cavendish-square into Oxford-street, down Shepherd-street, into a public-house there; I went in and found him hid behind the bar - I secured him; I never lost sight of him. He was about twenty yards off when I first saw him. Cockrain produced the cotton, which I knew to be Mr. Wilson's property-it is worth 5l.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hepworth who is a stationer in Poland-street. On the 18th of July, I was passing Mr. Wilson's, and saw two men go into the shop, and take out the pieces of cotton; there was no person in the shop at the time - I do not know the men. I told Norton, and he pursued after them.</p>
               <p>JOHN COCKRAIN. I am servant to Mr. Parwicke, in Welbeck-street. I heard Goddard give information as I stood by the shop - I saw no person come from the shop. I first caught sight of the two men at the corner of Wimpole-street - they had something wrapped in a great coat. I followed them, they turned round and saw us, and ran. I saw one of them drop a piece of cotton, I picked it up - I believe it was the prisoner; I saw his features. Norton followed him; the prisoner stopped in a very few minutes. I am certain the prisoner who was stopped is the man. I saw him run away - He was never out of my sight above five minutes. When he was stopped, he said it was not him. I asked him why he ran away if he did not commit the theft? I am certain he is the man.</p>

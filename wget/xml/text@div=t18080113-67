               <p>Q. When did you lose these things. - A. I missed my watch on the 29th of December last. When I went to bed at night I put it under my pillow; the prisoner lodged in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed. - A. At twelve o'clock. The next morning when I awoke I put my hand under my head, the watch was gone; I got up and took all the clothes off the bed, and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the same bed with you. - A. No. I looked about the room; I could not find it; I went to work. When I came home at night I told the people of the house what had happened, there was another man that slept along with him; I accused him of it, he said he did not know any thing about it; I did not say any more about it. On the Saturday I came home wet, I went up stairs to put my things on, I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. This was about half past ten at night. I lost a great coat, an under coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, a neck handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and a tobacco stopper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were all these things. - A. In the room where I sleep. The prisoner left his lodgings on Thursday the 31st.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your things between the Tuesday and the Thursday. - A. Yes, I think they were taken on the Thursday; I had suspicion of the prisoner by his not coming home to his lodging; I told my father of it, he got an officer to search him, and about him they found the tobacco stopper and gloves; the tobacco stopper I left in my waistcoat pocket, and the gloves in my great coat pocket. I have never found my watch nor my clothes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - I am assistant teacher for the asylum of deaf and dumb; the prisoner was one of my pupils under my instruction. I can make him understand.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is he. - A. He was put apprentice to a shoemaker; [the witness by motions and by writing related the evidence.] - Witness. He says the gloves and the tobacco stopper he found in his bed room.</p>
               <p>JOHN GEARY. I am an officer. On Monday the 4th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130058"></xptr>of January I searched the prisoner, I found a pair of gloves and a tobacco stopper, and about nine and sixpence in money; when I got him to the office in Worship-street, I wrote to him with chalk, and he wrote to me; I asked him what he had done with the clothes, he informed me that he had changed them for a dark brown coat that he had on, and fifteen shillings besides. After he was examined I took him into the public house, I asked him where; he said Wapping, but where he would not tell. The watch, he said he knew nothing about that. I have never been able to trace the watch nor the clothes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner wrote for his defence - I did not steal watch - I did not steal clothes.</p>
               <p>The gloves produced and identified.</p>

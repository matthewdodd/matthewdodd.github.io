I am one of the clerks in the Discount-office in the Bank; the prisoner at the bar had a discount account at the Bank: On the 27th of January last, there were bills sent in to the Bank to discount, to the amount of 1242l. 12s. 11d. on the account of Joseph Adamson.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill drawn upon Bowles and Beachcroft, is that one of them? - A. This is one of them; he had discount allowed to the amount of 855l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out the warrants upon which the bills were discounted? - A. I did not, but the clerk is here that did make it out; it is signed by himself, which gave him credit to draw to that amount.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand-writing is that account of the bills which he sent for discount to the Bank? - A. Joseph Adamson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that accompany the bills when they are sent in to be discounted? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest, is there an account of this bill upon Bowles, Beachcroft, and Company? - A. There is; "Paid, London, Jan. 27, 1798.

               <p>Q. How do you know that these bills were left at the Bank? - A. I am certain that they were left, because they correspond with the list.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Mr. Adamson write? - A. I cannot take upon me to say that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever transacted business with him? - A. I have discounted bills for him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only from having seen other papers, which you conceive to be his hand-writing, that you suppose this to be his writing? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he ever acknowledge any of those papers that you supposed to be his writing? - A. we have very little conversation with the discounter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever understand, from him, that any of these papers were his hand-writing? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You saw the seal put to this release? - A. Yes. (A release from the Bank to Bowles and Company produced).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. You cannot say that you have ever seen Mr. Adamson write? - A. I may have seen him write upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say you have ever observed his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180058"></xptr>hand while he was writing? - A. I never took particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q.From the comparison of his hand-writing with the drafts that you have paid, you suppose this draft to be his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear from him any acknowledgment that these former drafts of his, were his hand-writing? - A. He would certainly have mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is this, you say you believe this to be his hand-writing, because, upon comparison of his name written to other drafts, it resembles it? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, with respect to these other drafts, have you ever settled any account with him personally, by the settlement of which, he had admitted that these other drafts were his? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. It is the course of your banking-house, (it is not the course of every house), from time to time, to return the drafts which a customer has drawn, with their book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you done so with Mr. Adamson? - A.Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that you have returned similar signatures to that which is now put into your hand? - A. Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever complain that there were any drafts inserted which he knew nothing of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Q. Do you recollect any instance, after the delivery of this book, that he re-delivered the book to you, admitting those drafts as good? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. How many times in a week has this book been carried backwards and forwards like a shuttlecock? - A. I cannot say how many times.</p>

               <p>Q. And without making any objections to the drafts being cancelled? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did the book last? - A.A. twelve month.</p>
               <p>- BEACHCROFT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. The prisoner kept cash at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the manner of the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes; I have seen him write.</p>

               <p>Q. And made payments in consequence of his supposed signature? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A.(Reads a draft upon the Bank of England, dated the 27th of January, 1798, for £845.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that signature the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A. I believe it is; I should have paid a draft with that signature, if it had come to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a person corresponding with your house of the name of Stevens, of Manchester? - A. We have.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the book, and tell me if the endorsement, which purports to be the endorsement of Mr. Adamson, is his hand-writing? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Adamson's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that acceptance? - A. The letters are R.D.B.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the course of your house, for each partner, when he accepts, to use his own initials? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It went backwards and forwards, as other men's banking-books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that accepted by you? - A. It is not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not the course, as in some houses for each partner to use the initials of the whole firm? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that list, whose hand-writing is that? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Adamson's writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you yourself, or any person, said any thing to induced him, or threaten him to give any information that he might? - A. No. I told him that whatever he communicated must be voluntary, and if he chose to give me any, I would receive it; but he must not hope for any thing in consequence of it. I had all the bills, and I shewed him this amongst the rest, and he pointed out this to me as a forgery; I asked him as to the endorser who Mr. Holt was, and he said a correspondent of his at Manchester; I asked him if he knew whose hand-writing it was, he said it was not Mr, Holt's, but he did not know whose it was; he said that was not the hand-writing of Mr. Morrey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. He gave you all the information he could, and, I believe, has materially assisted you, has he not? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to have troubled the Court with a single word upon the case, but have relied wholly upon that administration of justice which is peculiar to the jurisprudence of this country; but finding, to my utter surprize, that Mr. Wilkinson has thrown the whole of the blame upon me, I think it a duty I owe to God, to my country, and my friends, to declare, that I do not know any thing about his business; and I declare solemnly, as I hope for salvation, that I had nothing to do with his transactions. Every assertion that he has made upon that subject is not true; if I have erred, I have erred through ignorance and misrepresentation. I forbear saying more, not meaning to implicate any body. I leave the rest to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Kaye.) I believe you had reason to think that all the information he gave you was true? - A.Perfectly.</p>

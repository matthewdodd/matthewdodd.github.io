                  </hi>.—On the Friday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw Coe and Jones at the Pelican stairs—I found the ware-house open, and foot-marks—I found, beside the red wheat in the warehouse, three sacks containing white wheat; one was marked "Husband," one "Langdale," and the other, "Palmer"—I have here a sample taken from each sack; they were all one quality—I took Coe and Jones in my boat to Hayes-road—I said to Coe, "There is a barge there;" lie said, "That is not ours, that is Brown and Young's barge"—I said, "Well, I will have a look at her"—I <hi rend="italic">went</hi>, and saw a quantity of wheat scattered abaft the hatch<lb></lb>way—I removed the after hatch first, and there was a great hollow, I should say from two to three sacks Had been taken out—I removed the fore hatch,</p>

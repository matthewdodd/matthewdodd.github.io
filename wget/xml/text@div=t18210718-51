He did not appear to be firing at any thing; he appeared firing across the field which has footpaths across it - he took from his pocket (apparently) a cartridge, and discharged the piece again; he appeared to put paper in; he attempted to discharge it, not in the same direction as before, but towards some palings about seventy yards from where he stood - the palings were different heights, none of them were higher than seven feet; I stood very near him; he said nothing; he had some children which he brought out from the place. The paling encloses Mr. Cubitt's premises - he is a builder. In a minute, or a minute and a half, there was a hue and cry, that a man had been shot on the other side of the paling. I went to the spot. In about half an hour I saw a man taken on a shutter. I went into the livery-stables, and saw them bringing a man by on a shutter, in a direction from Cubitt's yard. I stopped at the stables. The prisoner was about four yards from me in the field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner <rs id="t18210718-51-deflabel298" type="occupation">belonged to the light horse livery-stables</rs>

Yes; he came out merely in play and fired across the field, and afterwards fired towards the paling. I think he could not see whether any one was behind them - he was about 120 yards from where the man fell.</p>

            . I am a student of medicine. I was in the hollow of the field, between the gate of the stables and Bagnigge Wells, about 50 yards from the person who fired - I do not know who it was. When I got in a direct line between him and Bagnigge Wells, he fired, I turned round, and saw him fire the second time, as if he was firing at the paling - two or three people came running to me in about a moment, and asked who had fired the gun - I pointed in the direction he went - he had walked away into the stable-yard - they said a man had been shot; I went towards the place, but the wounded man was taken away. I observed the paling two or three days after, and noticed the marks of a ball having penetrated it, four or five feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who shot went quietly into the stable, not running away - A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cubitt, a builder. Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in the yard at this time, close to the man who fell. I should think there were twenty people there. I and the deceased were getting up bricks - the man fell down by my side, and knocked me down almost. I heard the report of a gun. He laid down on the ground; he was wounded in the hip-bone; he was in good health before; some blood came from him; I got assistance, and caught him in my arms; he bled very much. They took him on a shutter to the hospital. I did not see him after.</p>

I measured the ground from where the man fell - it was about 70 yards from the paling, and above 60 from there to the stable. We have generally from 25 to 30 men in the yard.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was working at the light horse livery-stables. I saw the prisoner there about six o'clock, with a carbine, and some children with him, playing; he fired the carbine once in my sight, outside the stables, between them and Bagnigge Wells; he then stood in a direction towards Bagnigge Wells, not towards Cubit's yard, but in a direction from the place. I went inside the gate, and heard the report of the piece again. The prisoner came into the gate, and appeared very unconcerned. Nobody then knew of any mischief being done. He had the carbine in his hand. In four or five minutes the people came running, and said a man was shot - the prisoner was not in my sight then. I am sure he is the boy who fired first. His father is head hostler to the stables - he assists his father, and bears a good character.</p>

He had a deep wound from a bullet, such as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180025"></xptr>would come from a carbine, in his hip; I could trace it eight inches into the abdomen.

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden office. On the 29th of June, about half-past six o'clock, I took the prisoner, and charged him with shooting the carbine off, and killing a man with it. He said he was extremely sorry for it, but that he did not see any body when he fired. I think he could not see over the paling, He said he shot down the field first, with nothing in the carbine; but the second time put in a ball cartridge, but did not ram it down, and shot it at the paling, to see if he could hit them, but could see nobody behind them. He seemed very sorry, and gave me the carbine.</p>

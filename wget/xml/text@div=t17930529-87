I said no, he said it was the sweat of his pocket; I got a person who was a stander by, to be so kind as to look at it, and they said they thought they were bad, and would not have me take them, then I gave them to Mullein again, and he laid down four more, the same person that had looked at the others looked at these, and he said to Mullein these will not do, they are all of the same stamp, and I refused them, then Mullein had them all again, he had these eight again; he put down four more and the same person said, they will not do, all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290161"></xptr>these twelve are alike.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings did he produce in all do you think? - I cannot justly say, he had all of them again, he had a hand full of silver.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Lett give him any provocation except saying they were bad? - No other. When Mr. Newman came, Mr. Newman insisted upon searching Mulleins before he went out of the house, he did search him, I saw him take the money from Mulleins, I don't know how much exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ten shillings which you had in your hand? - I gave them to Mr. Newman when he came in, and he said they were bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the ten shillings immediately to Newman? - I gave them to Mr. Lett and he gave them to Newman.</p>

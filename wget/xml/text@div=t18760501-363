I live at 128, St. Paul's Road, Canon<lb></lb>bury—I saw the advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph" a fortnight before Christmas, 1875—I wrote a letter and received a reply—I went to 1, Cecil Street, where I saw Reed alone—he showed me an agreement first—I read it, and objected to take shares, so he cancelled it—he told me there were 14,000 members, and that a dividend of 7 1/2 per cent had been paid over the amount the company's shares realised upon the capital of the company—I was to be collector, and that was what the deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—I paid my deposit to Reed a work afterwards—there was nobody else there—I entered into my employment—I first saw the defendant in the City Reed took me to him—they were to leave the premises in Cecil Street, and wanted other premises, and asked me to advance 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order that they could buy the lease of the presimses; that is what Reed took me to D'Aeth for—I bought the lease, but I did not advance it to Reed—I lent the money to somebody else, not connected with the company at all, so that I knew how matters stood—while I was at the office I merely acted as clerk I never collected—they were to reconstruct the company, and writing out the new rules for agents were my duties—I saw the defendant at 301, Strand; he was acting as manager—sometimes he gave me some work to do and at other times Reed did—I was to receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary, but never did receive it—I applied to both for it, and all they said was, I should have it by-and-bye.</p>

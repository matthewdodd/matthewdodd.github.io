                  </hi> I was formerly in the C division of police, and have been engaged in reference to the tailors' strike almost ever since it occurred—on 22nd April I was present at a public meeting of the operative</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190056"></xptr>
               <p>tailors, held at the Alhambra Palace, and saw Partridge, Bailey, and New<lb></lb>bury there taking part in the proceedings—resolutions were proposed, seconded, and carried in reference to the tailors' strike—a resolution made by Mr. Lawrence had reference to the strike, and Mr. Druit in a speech he was delivering said that committees would be formed, and pickets would be put on the shops of the masters—I observed two days after the meeting that the shops were picketed—the master tailors' establishments are in Conduit Street, Maddox Street, Saville Row, and that immediate neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, and this picketing was at the establishments in those various streets—some shops had two men on in the fore part of the day, and in the middle five or six, and at some establishments I have seen twenty towards evening, and if any one came out one or two of the men outside followed them to see where they went and to find out their names and addresses, and I have seen them annoy persons by calling them <hi rend="italic">dungs</hi> and cowards, and hissing them, saying, "There they are; there they go" and so on—I have counted thirty-five persons at one time outside Mr. Poole's establish<lb></lb>ment—they were journeyman tailors; a great many of them I knew to be tailors—the persons who went out of the tailoring establishments were journeyman tailors, and out-door workers who came to fetch work to take home—I have seen all the prisoners performing that duty, except Part<lb></lb>ridge, Bailey, Shorrocks, Newbury, Stokes, and Ormerod—I recognise all the others as having seen them at various times and places doing picket duty, which commenced somewhere about seven in the morning and terminated about nine, but it depended on the time the shops closed, some close earlier than others—the persons performing picket duty resorted to the Blenheim Arms, Blenheim Street, Marlborough Street: and the Grapes, and Ship, in Carnaby Street; the Nag's Head, in Marshall Street; the Burlington Arms, Old Burlington Street; the Coach and Horses, in Conduit Street; the Lion and French Horn, Poland Street; the Nag's Head, Stafford Street; the Catherine Wheel, Little St. James's' Street; the Red Lion, York Street, Jermyn Street; the Grapes, Union Street, Bond Street; and some others—they resorted to those houses when they were leaving picket duty—they generally begun to collect there about ten in the morning—I saw more at that time than any other—they kept there off and on all day—the pickets would sometimes be relieved for a couple of hours—there were also com<lb></lb>mittee-rooms; the head meeting-house was the Green Dragon, King Street, the room there was called the Head Centre—I also attended another meet<lb></lb>ing at the Alhambra, on 29th of May, of the union men, the operative tailors—there were, as near as I can guess, about 3000 present—Partridge was there and Shorrocks, they both spoke—resolutions were proposed and se<lb></lb>conded, and speeches made in reference to the strike and the picketing system—one of the resolutions proposed was supported by Shorrocks—I also attended a meeting of the operatives at the Temperance Hall, Hanover Street, on 24th May; about 250 people were present—Newbury, Stokes, and Ormerod were there, and speeches were made and resolutions passed with reference to the strike and the picketing system—Newbury spoke and gave assent to the propositions—I attended another meeting of the same class of persons at the Sir Robert Peel, James Street, Oxford Street, on, I think, 14th June—Stokes was present—there were not 100 persons there, perhaps about eighty—there were resolutions and speeches in reference to the strike, and Stokes spoke about the tyranny of the masters in sending some of the men to prison, and said if the grievance between the masters and men had merely been the <hi rend="italic">time log</hi> it would not have happened, and called upon all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190057"></xptr>
               <p>those present who were not unionists to join the union, and to look out for any shops on strike and let the committee know—he spoke for some time longer, but I do not recollect it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pensioned police sergeant, and have been in the police nineteen years—I was employed by Messrs. Vallance and Vallance to accompany Mitchell, and watch what was going on at the tailors' shops—I learnt what tailors' shops were struck against, and visited most of them during the day—I have seen pickets at Messrs. Poole's, in Saville Row, as early as five o'clock in the morning, two, three, or four pickets, and they increased in number as the day advanced to eight or ten; in the middle of the day and towards evening I have seen as many as forty—they were always pointed out to me as tailors—I have seen them at other establishments engaged in the same way—they would stand in the morning two or three against the door, sometimes I have seen them sitting on the steps; if they saw a policeman coming they would move up and down; after he was gone they would take up their position again—I have heard them call the workmen leaving Poole's in the evening curs, cowards, and dungs; that has occurred repeatedly—there were also pickets at Messrs. Stohwasser's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190058"></xptr>
               <p>in Conduit Street, who conducted themselves very offensively indeed; when there was no one to drive them away they would surround the door steps, sitting on the door steps and leaning against the area railings; and when a policeman in uniform came by they would get up and walk up and down, and when he was gone they would go back, and when workmen came out they called them cowards, curs, and dungs, and pointed and said, "There they go! "—that has been the course when the workmen were leaving in the evening—that was the course of proceeding from the com<lb></lb>mencement—that was continued nightly at the first part of the strike, but it has not been so bad lately—I watched other tailors' shops, Mr. Small<lb></lb>page's in Maddox Street, and Mr. Bowater's in Hanover Street—the same course has been adopted there continually; there is Mr. Carter's in Hanover Square, and Mr. Bennett's and Mr. Meyer's—I have seen the persons go to the public-houses named—each person was kept on duty two hours at a time; I have seen them in the middle of the day as long as four hours, it appeared to be a sort of double relief which came on—they would come from the public-house or assembly rooms, go to their pickets, speak to the others on picket, who would go to the public-house, and report themselves much the same as they relieve guard with soldiers, only they did not march—I have seen people carrying away work, followed by pickets, and have followed to see what took place—I have seen them follow until the parties knew they were followed, and they have gone through public-houses with two entrances to get away; that has occurred frequently—I have also seen them followed till they came to another batch of pickets, and then they handed them over to the other batch—that appeared to cause annoyance to the work people; if it was a female she seemed very much frightened, I saw one woman run into Marlborough Street Police-court and two pickets after her—it was chiefly women who came to fetch work—I recognise all the defendants as pickets except Partridge, Bailey, Shorrocks, Stokes, and Newbury, and I have seen them all speaking to the pickets excepting Stokes and Shorrocks; they went up to the pickets in the streets and spoke to them, and I have seen the pickets pull out a book and show it to those who came up, and then put it into their pockets—I have seen the defendants at the Green Dragon thirty or forty times during the strike, Shurmer, Tampling, and Druller were three of the pickets, I recognise them as being before Stohwasser's at the latter end of May and June, and on many other occasions continually—on one occasion, May 3rd, I saw them in front of Stohwasser's, there was what they call a general <hi rend="italic">row; </hi>. saw a great crowd, and when Mr. Stohwasser's men came out a man, named Simpson I think, and his son were stopped and attacked by the pickets, and spit upon, and called dungs and curs—the three I have men<lb></lb>tioned were present and taking part in it, pushing among the crowd, and calling out the words I have mentioned—the police interfered.</p>

                  </hi> I am a journeyman tailor, working for some time for Mr. Bowater—after 2nd April the establishment was picketed, sometimes by three or four, sometimes more—some of the men annoyed me very much, but Ormerod is the only one I recognise—they were watching the people that went to the different shops, and on people coming out they watched where they went to—Ormerod followed me from Piccadilly to my house—we went in a public-house, drinking; he followed me and another one in, and offered to bet us six to one that we did not work on the Monday—they did not use offensive language, or call me any names.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman and salesman to Mr. Poole, of Saville Row, who had close upon 500 men at work when the strike took place—they all left but two, after which people picketed themselves out<lb></lb>side the premises—I recognise Maurice in particular, and another one—Maurice has walked up and down Saville Row with others, whom I knew to be tailors; I have been obliged to follow workpeople home through their behaviour—they interfered with them and asked them question what work they had been fetching away, and I have been pointed out—</p>

               <p>they have hooted at me, and called me a sanguinary foreigner in two syl<lb></lb>lables—I will give you the pronunciation if you wish; a b----foreigner—they pronounced that word when I was passing; it might not be in<lb></lb>tended for me, but when I was passing I always heard it, and as I am a foreigner I must take it for me—this has lasted from April till now; there were six pickets there when I left—when I was present they did not interfere with the workmen—one Sunday morning I was talking to a man who had left our employment, and Maurice came and placed himself be<lb></lb>tween us and entered into conversation—he has threatened me—I have seen him among the pickets on three or four occasions, and he has hooted me on leaving business—it had nothing to do with picketing, but he threatened me personally—I was insulted through trying to get workmen in Paris, but the threat had not reference to that.</p>

                  </hi> I am a master tailor, of St. James's Street—I attend to parts of the business, but to other parts I do not—since the strike I have taken an active part, and have been president of the Masters' Asso<lb></lb>ciation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the president of the asso<lb></lb>ciation which is prosecuting in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is composed of more than 200 master tailors—the metropolitan members are 170 or some<lb></lb>thing like that; but that is within the secretary's province—there are also several members at the East End—I have had no great experience of locks-out—I have heard more about the principles and practice of it in other trades than our own.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

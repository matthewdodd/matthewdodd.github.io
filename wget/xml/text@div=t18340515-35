             (police constable N 154.) On the 11th of April, I went to a cottage in plain clothes to watch Mr. Wilks' house, and about eight o'clock in the evening I saw Hutchins and two others - two of them crossed over into the field, but Sawyer remained by the pales - I then removed to another place - Sawyer then whistled three times - I then saw the other two persons who had been with Sawyer come by, but I could not see whether they had any thing - I went into the field, and saw nine sashes on the grass, which had not been there at seven o'clock - I was returning, and met the two prisoners and another person going past - I believe they did not see me - I remained at the corner, and in about ten minutes one person came into the field, and took some of the sashes on his back - I went to meet him, but he turned to a shed in the field - I then saw Hutchins coming from the shed - I went to him, and said he was the man I wanted - he said, "Very well, I am willing to go" - when we got over the gate he said, he supposed I took him for trespassing on the field - I said, "No, you know very well what it is for" - he then refused to go any further - I told him it was for stealing those sashes in the field - I went to the shed and found eleven sashes, which have been fitted to the openings in Mr. Wilks' house, and they correspond exactly - I apprehended Sawyer at his lodgings, in a court in Hoxton, the next morning, at half-past six o'clock - he was in bed, and covered himself with the clothes that I should not see him, but I saw his jacket which he has worn for eleven months - I told him I wanted him; and he said it would be a good thing for him if he was to be transported.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. You saw Hutchins coming away from the shed, but you had not seen him go there? A. I saw one man go there, but cannot say who it was - he said he had been to his mother at Ball's-pond.</p>

Upon which I open'd the Money Drawer in the Shop, and taking out a Bag in which was two Bank Notes for 50 l. and above 10 l. in Money. I paid him and put the Bag up again. The Prisoner who was a Ticket Porter, and plying thereabouts, was then standing at the Window, and saw the Mony. I went out, and at my Return, asked if any Body had been there, and they told me no. I open'd the Drawer, and mist the Money, and as for the two Notes they were put into another Till, and Mademan and the Prisoner went away.</p>

             thus depos'd. When my Husband was gone, the Prisoner began to make his Flourishes, and play his Tricks in the Shop, and he pull'd out the Money Drawer, but I did not see him take any Thing away. Why ar'n't you an Impudent Boldface now, says I, pray what Business have you to meddle with the Drawer, Why ye old Bitch, says he, what's that to you, I'll meddle with what I please, and then he began to pull and haul, and touzle me about at such a Rate, that you'd 'a blest your self, and he would fain 'a' had me 'a' gone into the Cellar to lye with me; and in short he grew so rude and obstropolus, that I was forc'd to run out of the Shop, or else I had certainly been ravisht, and that would have been a sad thing in my old Age, for alackaday I have liv'd these Threescore and Fourteen Years in the World, and was never ravish'd in my Life, so that what became of the Money when I was gone, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I know nothing of the Money, but as for the old Beggar Woman, I was minded to have a little Fun with her, because I have heard say, That if you take an old Woman and bite her by the Ear, she'll serve as well as a young Girl.</p>

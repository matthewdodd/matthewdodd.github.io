The prisoner was in my service for just upon two years—on Monday evening 20th Oct., between 6 and 7 o'clock, he was in my house at tea in the kitchen with the other servant—my house is about a mile from Mr. Holding's—the prisoner has always borne a most excellent character; I had a fifteen months' character with him—I have trusted him with large sums of money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body in the bed-room besides the prisoner and you? - A. Nobody; I had given her two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were drunk? - A. I was forward in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to be able to swear that you heard your watch tick? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- HOLT sworn. - I received the watch from the prisoner in Angel-court, in the Strand, and delivered it to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Hewitt. This is my watch; I know it by the maker's name, and the number; here is the chain that was upon it when I lost it, it has a string to it now; the chain was brought to me with the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I first met this man he was in company with another woman, and he went home with us both, he was very much intoxicated; he gave me two shillings, but that was not enough to satisfy me; I left him with the other woman in the room, and did not see him any more that night till about two o'clock, I met him on the stairs, and I went out to sleep at a friend's house; I knew the woman that he was with; and when they took me, the constable of the night said I should have my freedom if I would tell where the property was; and I went with them to the house.</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I am certain this is the woman that went to bed with me.</p>

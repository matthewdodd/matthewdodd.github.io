On the 16th of June, in the evening, I observed him with his body half in and half out of the counting-house-window, which is six feet from the ground, it pushes up; the counting-house is about five feet from the dwelling-house; there is an outward wall which surrounds both, I told the groom and he came back to look, we then saw him getting down the wall and pulling the window after him. I asked him what business he had to get up to the counting-house that way, he said he had been for the keys to lock the coal-warehouse. I told him he could not have been for that, for he had them out in the morning. He said if he had acted wrong he would take them back; I did not see them in his hand, I told him to do so. He went away, and came back in about six minutes, and told me he knew he had acted wrong, but he had not taken anything. I told him I did not say he had; he said I might search him if I chose. I told him I should not, for I had no business to search him, he then said, you will not say any thing to my master, will you? I told him if I did not the rest of the men would, for they all knew it - He then left me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he first left you did he go out of your sight - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the constable of Brentford. On the 16th of June, Mr. Thomas Rowe applied to me, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I went with him to look for the prisoner. I found him at the Magpie, about a quarter of a mile off; it was about twenty minutes before nine. I secured him and found a 1l. bank note, No. 53,061, and 24s. in silver on him, there was no dollar among the silver. I then went to Franklin's and got a 1l. note from him, No. 54,614, I showed them to Mr. Rowe. As I was taking him along he said he had not taken it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRANKLIN. I keep the Magpie, at Brentford. On the night of the 16th of June, the prisoner came to my house and had three pots of porter, he staid there about an hour; he was not sober when he came in; he paid me a 1l. note and I gave him the change, and I put it into my pocket with others; the officer picked a note out, I cannot say that it was the one I received from the prisoner, I had ten or eleven altogether. I took two or three 1l. notes the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Sanderson, who keeps the Exmouth Arms, Stepney—last Sunday night I went to bed at 11. 15, after fastening all the doors and windows—the bar was cleared, there was no one there—about 12.30 I heard, a noise in the yard—I afterwards heard the window, and a great noise below—I called "Police! "and awoke my husband—I went down and found the parlour window had been opened—the prisoner was found lying down at the back of the bar—I do not think he was in liquor, but he seemed to put it on—I think I had served him about 10 o'clock, but I have no recollection of his being in the bar for several hours.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 555). I heard the cry of "Police! "and went to the Exmouth Arms—I searched the place and the cellar, and in the bar, which was locked, I turned my light on and fouud the prisoner lying in a little space 4ft. or 5ft. square—he said "Give me a half-pint of beer," but he was no more drunk than you are—he said that he was a lighterman—I found the water-spout on the house broken, the window fastening prized down, and he had got over a little partition—I found a cap which no one owns, the prisoner had a hat on—there were two wooden partitions which he must have got over, and there were marks on one of them—no one could close the door without seeing him, as the place was only 4ft. square—the partition in the bar was 6ft. or 7ft. high, anyone could get over by getting on a chair, and there was a chair there.</p>

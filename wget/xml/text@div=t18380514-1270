                  </hi>. I am a window glass-cutter. In consequence of information, on the 14th of April, I examined and missed from my cutting board sixty-two squares of glass—they had been prepared for a particular customer, and cut to a particular size—the glass that is now produced Is mine, and that which was so cut.</p>

On the morning of the 23rd of April I went to the prisoner's house in Flower-and-Dean-street—I asked him if he had any objection to have his place searched—he said, "Not the least, look where you like"—I went up stairs to the first floor—I said be had better come up, and see what I did—I went to a box near the fire place, and while I was looking down I heard a noise in the second floor—I looked round, and the prisoner was gone—I ran up stairs, and found him trampling on glass—I asked him what made him break it—he said it was his own, he might do as he pleased.</p>

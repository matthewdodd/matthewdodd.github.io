               <p>Rebecca Harvison thus deposed: I and this Child of mine being at a Neighbour's House, in Church-Lane, near S. Giles's Church, where the Prisoner lodges, he came in about Seven at Night, took the Child in his Arms, and fell a kissing her. The Child, you may see, is a Dwarf, and an Idiot; and what makes the Misfortune the greater, she wants the Use of her Limbs so much, that she is forced to be carried like an Infant. We afterwards went to an Alehouse, where we left the Prisoner and the Child, and went a little farther: And when we came back, we heard that the Prisoner had taken the Child out with him; but he soon brought her home again, and went away. Then I undress'd her to put her to Bed, and found she was ruin'd, bloody, in a frightful Condition, and, by all Circumstances, had been ravish'd. The next day, the Prisoner confess'd to me, that it was he that did it, but said he was sorry for it, and would make it up; and beg'd me not to send him to Newgate, for that would ruin him. In two or three Weeks after, we found that the Child had the Foul Disease.</p>

             thus deposed: Mrs. Harvison and her Child Betty being at Supper at my House, the Prisoner (who is my Lodger) came in at the same time; and from thence we all went to an Alehouse in Dudley's Court, and my Husband carried the Child. We staid there a little while, and then my Husband and I and Mrs. Harvison went out together, and left the Prisoner and Betty. We return'd in about half an Hour, and were told that he had taken the Child away with him. I went to look for them, and found them by the Wall of <placeName id="t17250827-14-crimeloc56">S.

               <p>A Midwife deposed, that upon Searching the Child, she found that a Man had entred her Body about three Inches, &amp;c.</p>

             thus deposed: The Night as the Child was brought to our House, in Dudley Court, I was called in to see her, she being indeed a sort of a strange Sight. They told me, I need not be afraid to look upon her, for her Limbs were as straight as mine; and with that, one of 'em took up her Coats to let me see. I saw nothing that ail'd her at that time, which was about half an Hour before the Prisoner carried her out; but being called to look at her in a little while after he had brought her home, I found a great Alteration: Some Man had certainly abused her.</p>
               <p>The Watchman thus deposed: I went in the Morning to apprehend the Prisoner: He was then in Bed. He is a <rs id="t17250827-14-deflabel57" type="occupation">Plaisterer</rs>

Sam. (says I) you must get up and go along with me. He got out of Bed, and I perceived his Shirt was bloody too. When I brought him to Mrs. Harvison, he laid his Hand upon her Shoulder, and said, I have ruined your Child, but I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>- Brignal thus deposed: I was in Company with the Prisoner soon after the Child was injured. His Apron and Shirt was bloody. He confest that he did the Fact, and beg'd me to go and make it up. What a Stomach you must have, says I, to meddle with that Idiot? Why, I would have kiss'd twenty Women, and twenty times twenty, before I would have had any thing to do with such a Creature. Says he, The Devil bewitcht me.</p>

            , another Midwife, thus deposed: I examined the Child in two Weeks and two Days after the Hurt was received, and I believe there had been an Attempt, but no Penetration; nor was there then any Symptom of a Foul Distemper. I made use of one Finger, and did not perceive that the Parts were much extended. Two Days after I came again, and then the Passage appeared to be made much wider; and I found a Running upon her.</p>
               <p>- Cox, a Surgeon, in behalf of the Prisoner, thus deposed: Being inform'd that the Child had received the Foul Disease, I search'd the Prisoner very strictly in Newgate, on the 17th Day after the Fact was committed, and I found not the least Sign of his having had such a Distemper upon him. Now, I think, a Man could hardly be so perfectly cured in so short a time. I own there may be a Possibility of it, in a very slight Infection; or if the Patient had been under Cure before, and was almost well, at the time that the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, the Jury <rs id="t17250827-14-verdict58" type="verdictDescription">

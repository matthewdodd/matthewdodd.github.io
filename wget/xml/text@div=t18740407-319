My husband keeps a tobacconist's shop in Vauxhall—on 16th March the prisoner came for half an ounce of the best shag, and gave me a bad half-crown—I told him it was bad—he said it was not, and I was a d----liar—I said "You have been here twice before, and I have given you both the coins back, but I shall not give you this one back"—he said he would have it—I sent for a constable and gave it to him, but did not give the prisoner into custody—I had seen him the previous evening, and he gave me a bad sixpence, and three or four weeks before that he gave me a bad florin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and reside at Hackney—On Wednesday afternoon, 1st February, I was in Kingsland-road, going towards Kingsland-gate—I saw a horse and cart come out of a street into Kingsland-road—it was going very fast—as fast as the horse could go—the prisoner and another boy were in the cart—the prisoner held the reins, and he had the handle of a whip in his hand, with which he struck the horse two or three times, and after he had struck the horse it went quicker than before—I saw an omnibus standing in the Kingsland-road, in a direction towards Kingsland-gate—it was near to the left hand side of the road—I saw a man standing in the road, near to the omnibus—he was looking at the omnibus—and he was between the kerb and the omnibus on the left side—the cart came on the left hand side of the omnibus—there was nothing between the omnibus and the opposite side of the road—I heard the prisoner in the cart call "Hoy, hoy," two or three times—he was at that time six or seven yards from the man—the cart was at that time being rapidly driven—I did not see whether anything was being done with the reins—the deceased was knocked down, and after he had been knocked down the cart drove on—when it was done the prisoner held up a little and then went on again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Kingsland-road in the afternoon of 1st February—I saw an omnibus and the deceased was close to it—I saw a cart driven by the prisoner, and when he came opposite to me he commenced flogging the horse with the handle of a whip or stick, and the horse started off at a furious rate—it went on about 40 yards, and the wheel caught the deceased and threw him down—his leg went under the wheel and his head fell on the kerb—the prisoner drove on between the omnibus and the kerb and knocked the truck over—I ran and picked the deceased up—I called a cab and took him to the hospital—he was insensible and I thought he was dead—when I got to the hospital I saw the constable with the prisoner—the omnibus was on the near side of the road—there was nothing between the omnibus and the other side of the road—there was enough room on the off side for the cart to pass—the prisoner did not pull up, he went on at the same rate—after he had knocked the truck over he got about 40 yards be<lb></lb>yond the truck, and I saw the reins down by the horse's legs—the deceased had been standing alongside of the kerb.</p>

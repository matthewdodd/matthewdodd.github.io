             sworn. - A young man, apparently about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, told me that a man had ran away with an umbrella from Mr. Jacobs's; I went immediately and told my neighbour, Goodwin run after him, and brought him back and the umbrella both; the young man did not stop, but he saw him take it away, and to the best of my knowledge he took it off the wires.</p>
               <p>Goodwin. I produce the umbrella, it was hung upon a hook, it is not very easy for persons that are not acquainted with the hooks to take it off.</p>

I was coming through that court, it is a thoroughfare to Conduit-street, for any body to come through; I picked up this umbrella, and as I was walking towards Conduit-street this man ran after me, and said, that is my umbrella; I said, it is not mine, I have just picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Goodwin.) You had not dropped an umbrella? - A. No; I picked it up.</p>

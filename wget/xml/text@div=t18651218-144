I am barman at the Hen and Chickens, Suffolk-street—on Tuesday, 14th November, about 11.30, the prisoner came in for a glass of sixpenny ale—he put down a florin—I put it to my teeth, and found it was bad—he said, "Give it to me"—I said, "Take it where you got it from"—he said that he had no other money, and left—he took it to a paper-shop, but they could not give him change—he then went on a little further, came out, and offered me three halfpence—I would not have it, but gave him in custody, with the florin.</p>

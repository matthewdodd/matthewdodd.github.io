I was at the prosecutrix's house on the Sunday morning; the prisoner was charged with having taken the things mentioned;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190020"></xptr> we went up into a room, she wanted to speak with me by myself; she took off her garter from her right knee, and in it was sewed this gold chain; as she was pulling off the other stocking, she endeavoured to conceal something in her left hand; when she saw we observed her, she delivered them, which were these, two stock buckles set with stones, and a silver shoe buckle; after which I saw her stays taken off, and saw the medal fall upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington. Last Sunday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sent for to Mrs. Sedgwick's house, she said her buroe was broke open, and desired I'd go up stairs to the maid; the maid did not care I should see her searched, so I went into another room, and when I came back again Mrs. Sedgwick had got those things in her hand, saying, she has robbed me of them; I shewed them to the prisoner, and asked her if she had took them out of the buroe? she answered, she did, and also cut the hole in the drawer with a penknife; then I sent for the Headborough, she was carried before the Justice, and said the same there.</p>

               <p>Mistress ordered me to clean the house, and go away: I was cleaning about, and found these things in a drawer: I carried them into the next room, and put them into another drawer: they lay there from the Thursday till Sunday morning: I design'd to put them into the place again: I happened to drop the silver bodkin on the stairs, and it was found; then they asked me for the things, and I delivered them.</p>

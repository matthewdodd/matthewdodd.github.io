               <p>Q. How do you know it was his house? - A. Only from information; he kept a little huckster's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in the house? - A. No, only the wife and family; I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found the time-piece; the prisoner desired me to go to a friend of his, to look to the children, and to take the property that was in the house. (The time-piece was acposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at work on the 17th of April at the prosecutor's: I left off work at six o'clock, I sat down and had a pint of porter, I drank as many as five pints, besides a pipe of tobacco; I went to Mrs. Harding at the bar, and told her I had not money enough to pay her, I would pay her on Saturday night; I went out of doors through the passage into the street, and from there I went to another house, where I knew I could have a pint of beer without money; I had another pint there, and then went home to bed; my little boy was coming from the Sunday-school, the Sunday following, and picked up a bit of paper, and gave it to my wife, and she put it in the glass; it is not in my name, nor my wife's; my wife has been kept in prisoner ever since; I have been obliged to send my children to the work-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

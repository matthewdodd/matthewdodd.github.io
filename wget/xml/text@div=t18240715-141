On the 3d of May the prisoner came to our shop, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and wished to be shown some razors; I showed him several - he did not appear perfectly satisfied with them, and asked to see some others - I fetched a tray out of the window, and placed it before him on the counter; he selected a pair with ivory handles, inlaid with silver, and asked the price of them; I told him 18 s.: he appeared perfectly satisfied with them, and immediately went out of the shop with them - not offering to pay for them at all; I felt myself confused for a moment: I ran round the counter, and called Stop thief! but he was gone - I could not pursue him, being alone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you showed him the two razors where did you put them - A. I placed them before him on the counter - he took them up himself, and staid a short time, but did not offer to pay for them; I never saw him before: he was about ten minutes in the shop - he was dressed in a black coat, a pink striped fashionable waistcoat, and light coloured trowsers, I think, but will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of looking at him to say whether he was the man - A. I looked at him particularly, thinking he had very much the appearance of a gentleman - I cannot be mistaken: I am certain he is the man who entered my shop - we have three candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day of the week was it - A. Monday; it was as near half-past eight o'clock as I can tell: we have a branch with two candles in the window, and one on each side of the counter; he wore a black hat.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 3d of May till six weeks after, when he was in custody, you never saw him - A. I never did. The constable came to me the morning after he was taken, and asked what kind of a young man it was who came to my shop: I described him, and he then said there was a person in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mistake a person in your life - A. I do not know that I have. I feel myself perfectly satisfied that he is the man. I may perhaps have mistaken a person in the course of my life. I went to Marlborough-street at the second or third day after he was taken - I saw him pass through the passage to go to the office: I afterwards saw him in the office, in an elevated place, distinguished from other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that he was the man of whom the officer had been speaking - A. I knew he was the man who took my razors, that is all I have got to say; the officer said he was the man who had been taken on suspicion of other cases - Biles produced my razors.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw him at the office, did he answer the description you had given - A. Exactly so my Lord; he was dressed nearly the same as at my shop, except his trowsers, which were white, and at my shop he had light cloth ones.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Chaffers and Mills, pawnbrokers, Greek-street, Soho - I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Marlborough-street; I have some razors here which I produced there; I stopped them from a young man who presented himself to pawn them in the early part of June; I think it was the first week in June; the young man very much resembles the prisoner; I knew him from having seen him twice before, and should know him again if I was to see him - I intended to stop him as he had brought an album the week before which had been stolen: I put a few questions to him to keep him in parley, but on putting my hand to the counter flap, he ran out directly: he had brought something about a fortnight before, but what it was I cannot say: he was remarkably fashionably dressed: when he brought the album I thought I should not take it in, in consequence of his having asked a high price for something before: when he brought the album he had a blue coat on, but when he brought the razors he had a dark coloured coat, with covered buttons, and I think a light coloured striped waistcoat, and dark mixed trowsers, and a red silk watch guard over his waistcoat (I think) it was visible: I said the razors were very good ones; what did they cost; he said 24 s. - I asked where he bought them - he said in Great Russell-street - I am perfectly convinced that it was not the prisoner - I agreed to lend him 3 s. on the razors: he gave his address in Great Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did any person come to your shop soon after he brought the album - A. Cook, the officer, came in shortly after, and left a paper, stating that two albums had been stolen the day before; this directed my attention particularly to him - I am quite sure that the same man brought the razors.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there such a resemblance between him and the prisoner that a casual observer might mistake one for the other - A. Certainly they might - I have seen two or three persons very much like him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Seeing the man bring the razors whom you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150057"></xptr>suspected before, how came you not to detain him - A. On putting my hand to the counter he made off, and there was no one in the shop but me - I think it was on Thursday or Friday in the first week in June; I put the money on the counter, but did not intend to lend it; he left razors and money behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - the whole case rests on a mere question of identity; I solemnly declare my entire innocence, which I shall be able to demonstrate, by proving a clear alibi, and leave my case with confidence in your hands.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's aunt, and live at Acton Green, which is about five miles from London. In May last, Miss Coates was staying with me; the prisoner came to see me two or three times a week, at Acton Green - he was in our company, at Acton Green, on Monday the 3d of May; he usually came on a Monday, and I know that on that day I went to Mr. Hoole's, on Turnham Green, after dinner, respecting some business of the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you first see the prisoner - A. A little after six o'clock; he staid with me till twenty minutes past eight - I went with him, as I generally do, to see him to the stage, which passes the top of the terrace, and we were too late for the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that circumstance bring to your recollection that it was Monday - It does; he walked, and I took leave of him at half-past eight o'clock - he was then five miles from Hyde Park corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have been taking pains to consider about this incident, to be quite sure of the day - A. I have, and have not the slightest doubt of it. I am certain no person deserves a better character than he does.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You usually see him into the coach - A. Always; I never omitted it, as I am very much attached to him, and wish to remain with him as long as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your attention first called to the 3d of May - A. I keep a journal, and it appears by that that he was there on the 3d of May; and he wrote to me at Manchester, requesting me to look at it - I left it at Manchester with my papers. I set off for Manchester a month ago last Friday; and returned yesterday week. The journal contains an account of every time he came. I reside at Mr. Byng's, at Acton Green; Miss Coates also resides there.</p>

            . I reside at Mr. Byng's; Mrs. Turner also lives there. I saw the prisoner on Monday the 3d of May, a little after six o'clock, at our house, in the parlour; he was there for half an hour, while I was there; I lost sight of him finally at half-past eight; he was going to ride home, but missed the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What induced you to say it was the 3d of May - A. I had occasion to write a note to a friend, while he was in the house, and I dated it the 3d of May. I have since seen that note - he was there two or three times a week - when he did not come on Sunday, he came on Monday; and I particularly remember that she was not there on Sunday. He went away with his aunt about half-past eight o'clock; she walked to Hammersmith with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAMS deposed as in the former case, page 427; and MR. FRAZIER a clerk Mr. Abraham's office, deposed that he never saw the prisoner with a scarlet and gold watch-guard.</p>

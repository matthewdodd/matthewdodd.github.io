I am a builder, at Barking—on 11th February, about in the evening, I left my barge Milly in the creek, leaving about 150 bricks on the deck and 3,000 in the hold—I went back next morning—I saw Aley on a cart coming along—I did not see any bricks in the cart, but after I got down to the barge I made inquiry of the captain of the barge, and missed the bricks which I had left on the deck the previous evening—I traced them up the town, and found where they had been sold—I did not see where the horse and cart came from, but I went to the yard where it came from, because Aley used to be carman for me last year, and I found my bricks in the adjoining yard—I gave information to the police, and the prisoners were apprehended next day—I saw Summers in the town the same day, and said "You have been stealing my bricks"—he said "No, I only picked them up off the shore"—I saw Aley in custody at the station, and charged him—he made no reply—the bricks were shown to me afterwards, and I identified them as my bricks—they were worth is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no other barge in the creek but mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by my father, a coal merchant, at Barking—on Thursday morning, 12th February, about 6.40, Summers came and asked me if I would buy a few bricks that he had picked up off shore—I said "No, I do not want them"—about a quarter of an hour afterwards he came again, and said "We have the bricks outside in a cart, will you look at them?"—I went outside and looked at them—there were 90 bricks there in the cart, with the broken ones—Aley was there with the cart; not in it, but at the back of it—I asked what he wanted for them—Aley answered "Two shillings"—I bought them, and paid Aley for them—they were afterwards shown to Mr. Argent, and he identified them.</p>

I am mate of the barge Milly—on Thursday, 12ft February, early in the morning, I was asleep in the barge at Barking Town Quay—I heard a noise that woke me up about 6.15—I turned out, and saw Summers on the deck taking the bricks off the deck and putting them on to the quay—I did not see Aley—there was a horse and cart there, and the bricks were thrown against the cart-wheel—I was under the impression that they had come to finish the unloading, and did not interfere with them—I did not see the bricks put into the cart—after I went into the cabin all the bricks had been taken from the deck—I heard them being put into the cart, and the cart drove away—when I went down the night before there were about half a dozen bricks overboard at the most; there were about 150 on the deck, and they were Mr. Argent's bricks—when I came up again they were all gone from the deck and from the shore, and the cart gone also.</p>

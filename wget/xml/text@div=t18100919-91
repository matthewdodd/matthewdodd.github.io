About four months ago I was going along Guildford-street, by the Foundling, the prisoner asked me if I had a coat that would suit him, I had four coats across my arm, I told him I believed I had, I delivered a coat to him, he asked me the price, I told him eighteen shillings, he tried it on, said it fitted him he would give me sixteen shillings, I told him he should have it, he then said, come along with me, I live down <placeName id="t18100919-91-crimeloc512">Doughty-mews</placeName>

On the 20th of August I was coming along Oxford-road, I saw the prisoner in the rank with a Hackney-coach, I said, you served me a pretty trick, he drove out of the rank and went out of sight, I saw the number of the coach, I had him apprehended, I am sure he is the man. This is the coat, I found it on his back, it is my coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the coat of him, I was to pay him when I saw him again, I had never seen him from that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 5th of June last, I was at the watch-house taking some charges up, and seeing a piece of work I went up, and Mr. Rees gave charge of him; this waistcoat I took off his back,</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my waistcoat, I have the fellow to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He said he would give you half-a-guinea; perhaps he said this: sooner than I will be brought before a Magistrate I would give half-a-guinea for it? - A. I cannot take upon me to say the exact words.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. The prisoner said he had bought the waistcoat of a young man, and rather than go before the Justice about it he would give him half-a-guinea for the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him upwards of two years, and gave him a good character.</p>

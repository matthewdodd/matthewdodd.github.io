               <p>Q. Was he at work there on the 29th of September? - A. Yes, from ten till two; I was overpersuaded by that soldier to take the trufs off the wharf; he said, I think that trufs will just suit us, and will fetch us the value of five or six shillings a piece.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a trufs was it? - A. In wrap-pering.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you read? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you cannot swear how it was directed? - A. No; he told me I must put it into the wheel-barrow, and wheel it to the corner of Mrs. Froome's, near Dowgate-dock; I wheeled the barrow with the trufs in it, and then the soldier took it away, and I saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the soldier after that? - A. Not till he was in the Poultry Compter.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of the day was it taken away? - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not three other soldiers in the public-house besides me? - A. No, there were not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the public-house at all? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was that before you wheeled the trufs away, or after? - A. Before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taken to work upon Mr. Young's wharf, precisely at ten o'clock, on the 29th of September; I worked upon the wharf till two o'clock, when I requested to be paid off, on account of some business I had to do for the regiment; he paid me off, and another soldier at the same time; upon being paid off, I went to the public-house, with that identical soldier, and had some porter; I waited for my serjeant a considerable time, when a man employed me to carry a basket for him to the Saracen's-head, Snow-hill, and he himself carried a box; he gave me sixpence, and a pint of porter, it was then five o'clock; I then went from there to No. 71, Great Peter's-street, where I live, and went to bed, when I was awaked between ten and eleven o'clock, with a thundering noise at the door, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him upwards of seven years, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have been eighteen years in the regiment.</p>

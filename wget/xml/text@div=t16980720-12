            </rs>. It appeared, the Prosecutor's Sister bringing the Goods to her in a Box, wanted to case her head by resting the Box on a Shop-window; which the Prisoner perceiving, offered his assistance to take them off her head, which she accepted: And as she was looking for the cloth on which the box rested, the box was carried away. It also appear'd, that the Prisoner was in a gang with 5 or 6 others, who quarrelled about the mony which one of them had sunk, and deprived the rest of their shares. The Clothes were left at an Ale-house, and one of the Evidence deposed, that she had orders from the Prisoner and some of the gang, to carry them thence, which she did, and left them at two other places, where they were discovered. The Evidence being very plain, the Jury brought him in <rs id="t16980720-12-verdict54" type="verdictDescription">

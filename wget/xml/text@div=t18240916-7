            . I am shopman to Mr. Rushford, pawnbroker, Brewer-street, Golden-square. On the 5th of July I took two table forks in pawn from a woman, for 45 s.; on the 16th of July I received two more table forks, and two sauce ladles, for 35 s. - the first duplicate was brought, and they were put into one pledge, for 4 l. together. I have no recollection of the woman - whether the prisoner came on either occasion I do not know.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September I was fetched to Mr. Willis's; the prisoner was out - when she came house I took her in charge, and told her I was in possession of facts respecting the plate which was lost; she asked her master to make her a promise - I said none must be made in my presence; she then fainted. She called me aside after some hesitation, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have not made away with the duplicates;" I said,</p>

               <p>"Then where are they?" she took me to a room behind her bedroom, and under the floor in a hole she took up a wrapper with this duplicate and two others, and gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The duplicates are not in her name - A. Yes, and Mrs. Willis's name is on the duplicate also.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOSTER. This is the second duplicate which I gave the woman. The four dessert spoons and two forks are nearly of the same value.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIS. The spoons and forks are mine. I have heard that she has been led away by a young man, and has supplied him with money.</p>

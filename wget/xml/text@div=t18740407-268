I have been in the habit of working for Mr. Coate, brush manufacturer of Lisle Street, Leicester Square, my work was fancy boring—I have worked for Mr. Coate off and on for twenty years—I kept a book in which I entered the work at the time it was finished—I have that book here.</p>

Young and Marshall, and I kept an account of the work I did for them in a separate book—I have no recollection of their work apart from the book—I kept an account from time to time on a piece of paper of my charges against the prisoner, and sometimes I sent them and sometimes I took them myself to him and received money upon them—when I have handed those papers to the prisoner myself he has put them on a little file and written "paid" upon them, and I saw no more of them—I have not re<lb></lb>ceived any money except when a paper has been delivered—I can't tell from memory whether in January 1871 any such paper was handed to the prisoner.</p>

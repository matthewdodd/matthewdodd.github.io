                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 628). On Friday morning, 30th April, about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in St. Mary Axe, with two parcels, one in a paper, and the other in a handkerchief—he went into the Blue Pig in St. Mary Axe, and a few minutes afterwards a Jew went in—I then went in, waited a few minutes against the bar, and heard the sound of money in the parlour where the prisoner and the Jew had gone—I went into the parlour, and saw three coats lying on the table; the Jew snatched up some money from the table—I collared them both, and the Jew escaped by slipping out of his coat—I retained the prisoner and took him to the station—he there said he had purchased one of the coats, and he knew nothing of the other two—the three coats were all new, and were lying on the table in the parlour—the prisoner was sitting down and the Jew standing up with a coat and pair of trowsers on his arm, which he had carried in with him, and which he left behind him—I have not seen the Jew since—I found a handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket which was like the one which formed the outside of one of the bundles he was carrying, and I found the paper on the table which had composed the other bundle—both the bundles contained something, the handkerchief parcel was the largest—they were struggling with me ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>April, about half past 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and bought a coat, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">one of the three</hi>)—he asked for an invoice, and I went to the desk to write it out—the desk is at the back of the counter, and there was a stack of clothes before it; I went behind them, out of sight of the prisoner—I was two or three minutes making it out—I packed up the coat I sold him in paper—I do not know whether this is it, it would pack up a coat 1—before buying the coat, he tried on eight or nine; there was very great difficulty in fitting him—I pulled down about fifty coats in the course of serving him, which were placed on the counter near where the prisoner was—they were left there while I made out the invoice—these two other coats produced are precisely what I have in my stock; they have had marks on them, but they have been taken off—I am sure they have formed part of my stock.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe you cannot tell whether you have sold these coats or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot—we fit some customers much more easily than others; sometimes persons try on a dozen—I saw the prisoner leave the counter, but did not see him go out of the shop—there is a man outside the shop who must have seen him leave the shop—he is not here.</p>

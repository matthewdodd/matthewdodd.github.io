                  </hi>. I am an embosser—I live in Horse and Groom-yard. On Sunday, the 15th of November, I was washing my hands on the landing outside my room—the prisoner came down the stairs—she said her aunt lived up stairs, and she had left her in care of the room—she then followed me into my room, and began to pull me about in an indecent manner, and threw me down—I said, "I wonder you take the liberty to come into my room without asking"—she went and sat on the bed—I told her she had, better go, as I wanted to put my things on—she then got up and threw me on the bed—she afterwards left, and I missed a bag contain<lb></lb>ing the money stated, and a silk handkerchief—I went in pursuit, and found her in Holborn—I said, "You have robbed me," and I saw the bag in her left hand—I laid hold of her, and was going to bring her down Holborn, but a mob collected, and amongst them was a gang of fellows who rescued her from me—she said afterwards that she did not lodge in the house—I had not seen her before, and it turns out that nobody there belongs to her—I took the bag from her—it contained the same that it had before, except 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found her again, and said to her, "I want the handkerchief"—she said, "I did not take it"—I said, "You must"—she then said, "If you will come home with me to St. Giles's you shall have it."</p>

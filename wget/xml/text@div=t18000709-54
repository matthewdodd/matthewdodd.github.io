             sworn. - (Produces a German flute.) I got it out of pledge from Mr. Garton's, in St. Martin's-lane, the prisoner at the bar brought me the duplicate, on or about the 21st of March, I took it out.</p>
               <p>Wright. This is my flute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pawn it yourself? - A.Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The other things mentioned in the indictment are those to which the duplicates belong? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor and I have been acquainted for some time, we eat and drank together; at the time he charges me with stealing this flute, we were at the Coach-and-Horses, at a club, and finding our finances growing low, he desired me to go out and pledge the flute; I returned and tendered him the duplicate; I pulled it out of my pocket-book, and he desired me to put it in again; I was to have some money shortly from Mr. Williams, book-maker to the Prince of Wales, who was my master; he gave me the duplicate of these other things, which he said were articles grown out of fashion, and become less valuable; I received five pounds from Mr. Williams, and went into the country; when I returned, I learned that he had been circulating a report that I had stole his flute; hearing that, I went to him, and he told me, if I did not let him have some money, he would fix me; I afterwards met with him accidentally, at the Kings's-head, I think, in Holborn, where we had some conversation; Mr. Jones will prove what passed.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wright.) Did you ever give the prisoner instructions to pledge that flute? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. I am a comb-maker, in St. Martin's-lane; I have known the prisoner from a child; I knew the prosecutor about nine months ago, the prisoner brought goods from Mr. Wright for me to sell; Wright repeatedly came with him afterwards; I have often heard Wright say, in conversation, that Bell was indebted to him; some altercation took place now and then between them, but I never heard Wright challenge Bell with robbing him, but that he owed him money, and desired him to pay it; about three months ago, Wright called upon me, and requested me to go and see Bell, who had inlisted for a soldier; I went with him to the King's-arms, in Holborn, and there Wright asked Bell for the money, that as he was become a soldier, he might then pay him out of his bounty-money; he said, he had not received it, yet, as soon as he got it, he would let him have some; I heard little more of it till after the prisoner was in custody; I sent for Wright; Bell's father asked him, respecting this business, how he could attempt to take his son up for robbing him; Wright replied, he should not have done any such thing, but he owed him some money; he asked him how much it was, and he pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said, it was about eight pounds; he told Mr. Bell at the same time, that if he could get the order to receive this money from his commanding officer, he would let this matter drop.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was by at this time? - A.Nobody particular; Mrs. Bell was by, and my wife, and Bell the father; I never heard any thing but that he was a very honest young fellow up to the present time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. I am an iron-founder, at Lambeth: I know the prosecutor, Wright; I was present at the conversation on the morning of the day that my son was apprehended; Jones sent for Wright, I said, good God, how could you be so serve, surely he has not robbed you; I should not have done so, says he, if he had paid the money he had agreed to pay me; I asked him how that debt arose; he said, he had frequently lent him money, and he had had his German-flute; surely, says I, he did not steal it; why yes, he said, he had taken it out of his room, and some other things, that he would take care to prove; but upon going a little farther he flew out of the room; I was angry, a little alteration took place, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the day your son was apprehended? - A. It was the day of the last examination, when he was committed; Mrs. Bell was present, and Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the bounty-money? - A. I understand so; I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Wright say, that he had employed your son to pawn things for him? - A. I cannot speak with any certainty to that.</p>

On the 25th of June, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was in bed in my one pair of stairs front room, I heard the watchman say, landlord, come to the window; I went to the window and opened it; the watchman told me there was something the matter with the windows, he came past at two o'clock, it was all safe then. I went down stairs directly, I found my bar door broken open, and the till containing the money was gone, the street door was open, and one of the shutters was broke and taken down. I informed Mr. Griffiths the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing taken away - A. The till was gone, and the house was broken open. I saw the till the last thing at night, it was full of halfpence and penny-pieces, and one bar of soap was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner, or know any thing of the prisoner - A. Not till he was brought to my house about three hours after by a police officer, and the soap was also brought.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were in bed, what others of your family were there too - A. I had my three children in bed.</p>

            . I am a police officer. About five o'clock on Monday morning, the 25th of June, Griffiths, my fellow officer, came to my house and called me up, and said there had been a public house broken open in Wentworth-street; we went and found the head of the shutter cut enough to take the shutter down; we then went and searched the persons of bad character; I found the prisoner in bed with a girl in a court in Wentworth-street, about a quarter past six in the morning; I then went to a closet in the room and found these halfpence; he was in bed with a girl, undressed; they were in this handkerchief, I found a pistol in the closet, a center bit, and this small chisel, and under the pillar I found these bits of soap; I then took them to the house that was broken open and tried this chisel to two places where the lead had been cut away under the shutter; there were two places that fitted it; we then took him to the office and went and weighted the soap, it weighed three pounds nine ounces. In taking him to the office I asked where he got the halfpence; he at first hesitated, and I asked him again; he then said he had them from his father on Saturday night; he said he knew nothing about the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when you found the things - A. No; not exactly then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. His father keeps a shop, does not he - A. Yes, a cork-cutters shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl is an unfortunate creature that sees other men - A. She is; I have seen him with her a number of times; it is my opinion he entirely keeps her.</p>

            . You say that you had bought the soap on the Sunday night - A. Yes; that is the same sort of soap; it was in one piece, it is in seven pieces now; it is yellow soap.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You do not know so much of the soap as your daughter perhaps - A. No; I only saw it when it lay in the passage. I cannot swear to any of the halfpence; there were four pounds worth of halfpence and penny pieces in my till, not two shillings more or less, and all was gone. I did not count the quantity that the officer brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miller. When you found the soap under the pillow, how many pieces were there - A. Seven. I brought them all away.</p>
               <p>Q. The halfpence that you found in the closet, what quantity were they - A. Fourteen shillings and a halfpenny, that is the quantity that is here now.</p>

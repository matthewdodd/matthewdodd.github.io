Mr. Downs! that is our next door neighbour; then the prisoner turned him round, and took a parcel of handkerchiefs out of the window, and ran out of the shop; I ran after him and cried, Stop thief! and he dropped them in two parcels, and I picked them up.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not give them to him? - No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>In what situation were the goods? - They were in a paper in the window, laying by me.</p>

               <p>You were a good deal alarmed when he behaved in that manner in the shop? - I was hurt a little, but not so much as I was when he was at the watch-house: I am quite sure of his person, he was dressed the same.</p>
               <p>Are the goods the property of your husband? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, this robbery is of a particular kind; it is a constructive, and not a direct taking from the person; the goods were not in the direct personal custody of Mrs. Ellis when the prisoner took them; but they were in her presence, and under her protection: and it has been held, that where the taking of goods, in the presence of a person, has been the effect of the antecedent putting in fear, that shall be confined as a taking from the person; as for instance, where a man is stopped and desired to throw his purse on the ground, there is not a doubt in that case, because, there he actually parts with it in fear: here is also the additional circumstance of the prisoner's having a concealed weapon, and putting his hand in his bosom for that weapon.</p>

               <p>(A <hi rend="italic">translation of the letter was here read as follows:</hi>)—"My dear Parent,—I pray you to have patience until to-morrow. I was ignorant yesterday that it was a féte day to-day, and that Mr. Myers would not come, therefore I am without money; but to-morrow I will ask for some money, and be able to give you some the day after to-morrow. I will see a tailor for myself, and will speak for you at the same time. Tell me where I am to address him. You can send Leónidas to<lb></lb>morrow.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this letter sent after a demand had been made on this bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was written before I was sued, before the bill was due—I sent it by Leónidas before—I wish the letter were produced which I received from Mr. Parent before, which this is an answer to—I knew Mr. Myers while the pri<lb></lb>soner was at my house, but we became partners after the prisoner left—I used to give the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or half-a-crown at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the reason why you prayed him to have patience till to-morrow? A I had no money for myself—I did not know he had this bill in his posses<lb></lb>ssion at that time—I only knew that he had it when a person told me that it</p>

               <p>had been presented for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was only told of that on Friday, and the following Monday I received a writ—when I was in Paris there was no charge against me of having committed forgery—nothing at all—I have been in several places in Belgium after I led Paris—I did not go to any place when I got three or four piano-fortes—I was never charged with it—I do not knot a person named Lischtenthall, who deals in pianos—I never gave my own father into custody in London, nor charged him with anything at a police court—he came to my house while I was out, and made a noise—Mrs. Gui<lb></lb>gues was obliged, for the preservation of the peace, to call in the police-officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Explain what this bill of exchange is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I was very short of money, I made the bill for the purpose of trying to procure money, as I was always in hope of getting a partner that I might <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> my business—I accepted this bill, and gave it to a Mr. Coombs, to have money raised on it—I never got any money on it—Coombs gave it me back, as be could not raise money on it, and I put it in the cupboard in my own place, and it has been stolen from my cupboard—I have never seen it since—I gave my wife directions to write this letter, because the prisoner wrote a letter to me, which is now in my lawyer's hand—I can send for him now—this letter was written about the 20th or 25th of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for using such language as "Pray, have patience till to-morrow," to a man to whom you owed nothing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was only by good nature that I wrote him that—I had not had notice at that time that the bill was over-due, or was in anybody else's hands.</p>

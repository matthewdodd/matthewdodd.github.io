                  </hi>. I am a currier—on Tuesday night, about 7 o'clock, I was at a public-house with the prisoners—I had some words with Lane about a dog—about twenty minutes to 10, left the public rather fresh, when I was knocked down by Lane, and there was a scuffle on the ground—on getting up, I found my chain was broken, and my watch gone—I was some few minutes on the ground, as I was senseless, and on getting up I could not see the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, John's-place, Bermondsey, and am married—about 10 o'clock, I saw a tall man strike the prosecutor as I was standing near the Pitt's Head—a large crowd soon came round—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was covered with mud—two of the prisoners ran off; I can't swear which.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Pitt's Head, Bermondsey—on 15th March, the three prisoners were together in my house—the prosecutor hurt a dog by squeezing it in the door as it was going out, and Lane then threatened him—after which Lane returned to his friends, the prisoners—the prosecutor seemed rather fresh—as he came out of the house he spoke to me—Lane then came out, and I turned round for a moment, and in an instant all four, prisoners and the prosecutor, were on the ground.</p>

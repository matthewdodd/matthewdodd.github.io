               <p>Q. Is your warehouse part of your dwelling-house - Yes; they communicate together; I occupy the house myself; I let part of the dwelling-house out in accompting-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it - A. I think on the 21st of November, about noon time in the day, I saw the prisoner at the bar with another <rs id="t18101205-57-deflabel348" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18101205-57-defend594 t18101205-57-deflabel348"></join>, who had been frequently in the habit of working in my warehouse in Mark-lane, I knew the other soldier to be a notorious thief, because I had detected him in my warehouse, and seeing this prisoner with him I suspected him, and repeatedly saw him till about dusk in the evening, till it was about time to shut up my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At what o'clock did you shut up your warehouse - A. Usually at dusk in the evening, about five o'clock, or earlier that that, we hardly ever do any thing by candle light, I shut up my warehouse in the usual way, and examined all the locks of different floors in the warehouse, which I found secure. On the following morning, between nine and ten, I found the lock of the two pair of stairs floor which is occupied by Messrs. Lee and Brassey, they rent it of me; I found the padlock taken off, and the screw staple was broken, and the lock laid upon one of the steps of the warehouse stairs, the door was closed to, though the padlock was taken off; I pushed it open; I suspected that the warehouseman of Messrs. Lee and Brassey was in the warehouse. It was after I came out I should have told your lordship that I observed the screw staple was broken off; I called about in the warehouse, I found nobody there. On the evening I secured the outward door with an additional fastening. On the following morning I went to Messrs. Lee and Brassey's accompting house, then followed the information that the warehouse had been broken open, and a bale had been cut open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This dwelling house is part of your warehouse, do you mean to say so, it is divided into separate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050036"></xptr>tenements - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Messrs. Lee and Brassey are yearly tenants - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They hold it now of you until the end of the current year, is it so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to your dwelling house you live at Hackney - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are bills upon your house in town to let it - A. Yes; accompting houses to let, not my dwelling-house. I have another dwelling-house attached under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you sleep in No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 - A. I cannot mean to say that; I cannot divide myself into four or five parts; I have somebody in my dwelling-house until I can return and fill them up myself. They are all under one roof.</p>
               <p>COURT. This warehouse of Lee and Brassey is it under the same roof under which you live - A. It is; it communicates to my dwelling-house, and has done for twenty-four years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The passage to this warehouse is in the street - A. It is not. It is through my house, a communication under the same roof, they do not go into the street, the communication is from my dwelling-house.</p>

            . I know that Messrs. Lee and Brassey had a bale containing camblets and other stuffs. On the evening of the 27th of last month I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are wrong as to your dates - A. I was not informed until a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Lee and Brassey a bale of Norwich camblets - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had they it prior to the robbery - A. This bale of camblets they had in their possession two years. On the 27th I was informed that the warehouse in which the bale was deposited had been broken open, that bale had been cut open, and part of the contents stolen out. On the following morning a person brought to Messrs. Lee and Brassey's accompting house a newspaper, in which were inserted an advertisement, stating that several pieces of Norwich camblets had been stopped upon a person, and were to be seen at the Mansion house; I went to the Mansion house, and upon the five pieces of Norwich camblets shewn to me; I immediately recognized the numbers to be the handwriting of some person in the manufactory at Norwich, from whence Messrs. Lee and Brassey were in the habit of having goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your own mark upon them - A. No, I never saw the pieces untill I went to the Mansion house; I afterwards proceeded to the warehouse and examined the remainder of the bale that had been cut open, and upon comparing them with the pattern book I found six pieces missing, the numbers and colours of the five pieces which were shewn to me at the Mansion house, they corresponded with the number and colour of the five and six pieces that were missing. This is the pattern book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that these camblets they are of the same number, and the same colour and marks - A. Yes, and six pieces were missing out of the bale.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not other persons the same patterns and the same numbers - A. I have no doubt they have the same colour, the numbers I cannot speak to that.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city. On Wednesday the 21st of November, about twenty minutes after six in the evening, in company with Branscomb and Eldridge in Leadenhall-street, I observed the prisoner at the bar with a bag on his back just turning the come of St. Mary Axe, when he turned the corner I observed him to make a kind of a run, I immediately went after him and laid hold of his collar, I asked him what he had got, he told me he did not know; I asked him where he had brought it from, he told me he had picked it up, it had dropped from the tail of a cart, he did not say where; my brother officers then came up, Branscomb took the property in question. In taking him to the compter, nearly opposite of the India house; I observed his left hand down by his side, I desired him to keep his hand up, at that instant he threw something into the middle of the road, I called to Eldridge to pick it up, he did, which proved to be a large rasp with the end broken off; I immediately searched him, by a shop window, found in one pocket two knives and gimblet; we then took him to be the compter. We advertised the goods on the 28th Messrs. Lee and Brassey's people came to the Mansion house and owned them, saying they had been robbed. I went and examined the warehouse, I found a screw staple had been broken open, I examined the bale, and found it was cut, and the marks in the door corresponded with this rasp in two places.</p>

               <p>COURT. How long has this entry been made - A. I suppose two years; this bale was intended for exportation it could not be exported in consequence of the interruption with the communication to the Continent; the value of the pieces are ten pounds.</p>

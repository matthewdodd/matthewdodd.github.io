                  </hi>. I live at Merton-bridge, Wimbledon, Surrey, and am a linendraper. I have known the prisoner for many years as a person living in the neighbourhood—on 13th Sept. I had a gelding for sale—the prisoner called at my shop that morning, and asked me if I had sold my nag or cob—I said No, I had not, I did not care much about selling it, but I had had many applications about it, it was a horse that was very much admired—(the prisoner had been to me about three months before, and spoke about a gentleman wanting a horse)—he said, "Do you mean selling it?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What will you take for it?"—I said, "30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "Will you?"—I said, "Yes"—I had been wanting 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he went away, came back, and said, "I have been down to Gibson, and there has been a gentleman's groom inquiring if I knew of a horse for sale answering the description of yours, and I think it will suit him"—I know Mr. Gibson; he is a veterinary surgeon, and has attended my hone—I asked the prisoner if he thought the horse would suit, because it was out at grass—he said, according to the statement the man gave, he thought it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185505070084"></xptr>
               <p>would suit to run in a four wheeled chaise—I said I could hardly spare the time to go for him, he was in the field—he said, "Send the boy for him"—I said, "He wants grooming"—he said, "I will give him a rub"—I sent my son for the horse, and it was groomed by the prisoner—he said, "I think the horse will do; the boy may as well put a stamp in his pocket, and then if the gentleman buys it, he can give him a receipt and bring you the money"—I said, "Do you think it is likely he will buy it?"—he said, "Yes, I think there is very little doubt about it"—I got a stamp, and the boy put it in his waistcoat pocket—I put the boy on the horse—I told him to take it to next to Lady Foster's, according to what the prisoner said, and not to part with it to any one but the gentleman—the prisoner said, when he got there the gentleman might very likely want to have him shown off a little in a dog cart, so the boy could give him a ride in the cart—the prisoner was to show him off in the dog cart, if required, but the boy was not to leave it at all—they came round to the front of the shop—I heard the boy say to the prisoner, "Where shall I meet you?"—he was going to <hi rend="italic">cut off</hi> in a hurry, boy like—what answer the prisoner made I do not know—he said the gentleman lived at the next house to Lady Foster's, where the horse had previously been for sale—they then went away—in two or three hours the boy returned without the horse or the money—I was vexed with him, and sent him back again—I afterwards gave information to the police—it was near upon three months before I saw the horse again—it was then in the possession of Mr. Charlton, of Brentford—it was given up to me in the presence of Mr. Barber—I never saw the prisoner again until he was brought before the Magistrate, one day last week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a job master, and live at Langley Broom, near Slough. On 13th Sept. I was in front of Aldridge's Repository, in St. Martins-lane—I was going in to buy a horse there, about half past 11 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in front of the gates, standing by the side of a horse that he had for sale—he asked me if I would buy it—I looked at it, and told him it was decidedly too small, and I should not think of buying it—the horse was cool then, but it had been sweating, and he said he had ridden it up from Merton-gate; that he had taken it to Robinson's Reposi<lb></lb>tory, and he could not get room for it, and he had brought it there to see if he could sell it—he did not go inside—I left him, and went in to see the horses sold that I had marked out—I could not purchase one; they fetched more than I could give; and as I came out again, in an hour or two after, the prisoner hailed me, and asked me again to buy the horse—I said, no, I should stop and see one more sold first—it fetched more money than I meant to give, and I came out again, and was going to get some dinner, when he hailed me again, and asked me to buy the horse—he said, "You had better buy it; it is worth the money"—he had asked me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said it was too small a horse for me; but when I had seen the other horses sold, I was more induced to listen to him—he said he would sell it at a fair price—he said, "I will sell it if I can, if you like to offer me a price"—I asked, "Who are you? where does the horse come from?"—he said, from Mr. Childs, his father, who was a gardener, at Wimbledon—he said he had had it at a twelvemonth old, and it was then four or five years old—I said I would not buy it without seeing it in harness, and he gave a man a shil<lb></lb>ling to put it in harness—I said, "It is no use to me, being small; I will give you 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or I will go to Wimbledon to-morrow, and buy it of your father"—he said, "Well, I will sell it to-night, for I had as much as that offered me on my way, and I shall leave it as I go back;" and, wanting one particularly, I bought it for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not buy it without his giving me a written warranty with it (because it had a bad throat), and a receipt for the money, nor till I had ascertained that he was young Childs—two or three persons there told me that he was young Childs, and then I took it—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received of Mr. Barber, 13th Sept, 1854, the sum of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a brown gelding, warranted sound, and quiet to drive.

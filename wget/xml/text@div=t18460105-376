                  </hi>. I was the wife of the deceased, Edmund Connell, and live in Cooper's-gardens, Kensington. On the 2nd of Nov., between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I was with him in at the Coach and Horses pub<lb></lb>lic-house, Kensington—there was a raffle there—I saw the three prisoners there—White and Derman were there, they called for two pints of beer, and my husband called for another—Hogan asked my husband to let the beer go round—my husband said no he did not pay for the beer to have it go round—Hogan said, "No, you never come to a place to respect a person, except for beer or quarrelling"—my husband said he never had any of his beer, and he said, "I will take good care you never shall"—James Hogan said, "If you were within reach of my arm I would let you know"—my husband said he was there for him if he owed him any malice—my husband said, "I never saw an action of yours, but when you went with the Queen of Spain"—when my hus<lb></lb>band said "I am here for you," he did not put himself in a fighting attitude he merely stood up—I then went to Hogan and told him not to upset the company or kick up a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>—he up with his foot and kicked me in the side—I was hurt—I bent over and told him not to kick up a disturbance with the company, and when I turned round I saw the three prisoner all beating my husband with their fists—they pushed him forward with his back on the tap-room table—Ann Hogan had hold of his eyebrow in her teeth—the other prisoners were beating him in all parts that they could come at him—he was thrown off the table down by the fender—he was up and down four or five times, no sooner up than down—this lasted about twenty minutes—I am certain they were beating him all that time—he asked Roach for God's sake to take one of them off him, for he should be murdered—Roach took Barry off him—Barry then turned to my husband and beat him again, directly Roach let him go—I got my husband away—he said, "Come home, I am killed," and complained of hia side—he was very bad next morning, not able to work—he got another man to do his work—ho was able to walk to the police court, but not well—he wanted a <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to come back—he took to his bed on the Monday night and kept it till he died—he</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near did you live to Connell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within two hundred yards—he did no work after dinner on Monday till he died—to the best of my knowledge he had done his work all the previous week—he never told me there was anything the matter with him until he took to his house, and staid there till he died—I was not close enough to him on the Monday to see whether he worked that day, but he was on the works till dinner time.</p>

                  </hi>. I went with my husband's dinner on the Monday—Connell was then on his work, and he had a potato and a bit of meat with me—he asked me if my sister (Mrs. Hogan) was going to Hammersmith to take out a warrant for him—I said I did not know—he said if my sister would not take out a warrant he would not take one, and he put on his jacket and went off.</p>

               <p>he should go to take out a warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and he went away—there were four men there, and they had four pots of beer—Connell did not go to the police-court till about an hour after dinner—I cannot say whether he worked at all after that Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses, in High-street, Kensington. I saw the latter part of this <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was informed by one of my servants that there was a noise in the tap-room—I came from another part of the house to see about it—when I entered the room I saw Connell and his wife and Hogan and his wife in a severe scuffle, in the middle of the room—the two women's caps were off, and their hair falling about their necks—I desired them to quit the place—I saw no blows struck—Barry was in the room, but was not engaged in that scuffle—the four had hold of each other by parts of their dresses—I desired them to quit the place, and James Hogan, I believe, was the first that went out—Connell and his wife were the next—I followed them out to see them safe out of the door, and returned to make Ann Hogan leave the room—she begged of me to let her remain and adjust her hair and put her cap on, saying, at the same time, that Connell had caused the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he was not there at that time—I made them all go out—Connell has kicked up <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> in my house a great many times—he was the cause of a great many <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> about the beginning of Aug. last—my pot-man is not here—there was some dispute about who was to pay him for coming—he was requested to come and refused—I believe he saw the beginning of it all.</p>

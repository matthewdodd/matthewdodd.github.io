               <p>Q. At eleven o'clock that night, were you in company with two women of the town drunk? A. No; I did not offer one of them eighteen pence to go home with her- I had no money to offer - Murray did not send away two women, nor desire me to go home - I did not tell him I had been flaring-up at Hackney with half-and-half - this is all quite strange to me - I said, "How do you do, Mr. Murray," as I ran by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to him "It is all right, I have something here for them," placing your hand to your breast? A. No; I did not - if I was intoxicated, I could not be sober in three-quarters of an hour - I was not lying in Newmarket-street, in a state of beastly drunkenness, before I got to the station-house: my person and clothes were examined by

               <p>Q. Did you tell Haggerty that two men came along the street; one knocked you down, and the other struck you over the head? A. I did not - my hat was on the ground- I said nothing to Haggerty about being struck with a stick - Haggerty did not tell me there were no marks of violence on my hat, or any appearance of blood, till I took Wheeler up - he put my hat on my head - he did not examine my head, nor call Jones's attention to it, nor tell him there was nothing the matter with it; but that I was drunk - they examined my side - Haggerty looked at my jacket outside, but not otherwise - he found a hole there - he was not at the station-house, it was in the street- he looked at me - I know

            . I am a policeman. I was on the reserve at the station-house - Munns was brought there by two men, named Jones and Morgan - I opened the door, and seeing no policeman with him, I asked what was the matter - he complained of being knocked down, and kicked twice in the back - I let him in, and called our inspector - he sent me for Dr. Betson - he said, after he was in the station-house, that he found something pricking, as if he had been stabbed with a knife - I examined him about the loins - there were no marks of violence there - I examined his breast, and found a cut in his coat, almost big enough for a person's fist to go through - his waistcoat was cut not quite so large - his shirt appeared a very large tear - and, on another examination, I found a little cut which a sixpence would cover - it was stained with blood - there were stains of blood on his shirt - Dr. Betson said he thought the scratches were done by a person's finger-nails, and advised him to go home - he said, as he was treated so well in the hospital before, he wished to go there - our inspector, Mr. Young, desired me to go with him. Cross-examined. Q. You found next morning nothing serious had happened to him? A. The nurse said he had been cupped for a kick on the back - he wore a jacket the same as he has now - there was a hole in it nearly big enough to receive a man's fist - the waistcoat hole was not so large - the shirt had a tear in it much larger than the waistcoat - I believed his clothes to be cut with some sharp instrument - I consider that his shirt was torn - I thought the marks on his breast were done with three finger-nails; but the clothes appeared to be cut - I myself never heard a word about the knife till we got before the magistrate.</p>

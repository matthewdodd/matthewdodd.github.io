            . I am a constable. On the 14th of May I saw a woman going into the shop of a dealer in marine stores at Wapping - I followed her, and saw some brass furniture of sword-handles in the scale; I took it before the Magistrate - Judge was made acquainted with it, and we went together to the prisoner's house, in King Henry-yard - we there found some more property.</p>

            . I am Thames-police surveyor. I went to the prisoner's house - he was not at home - I then went to the office of Mr. Bellis, the Inspector of Ordnance, in the Tower, where the prisoner was at work; I told him his wife had been stopped with some brass; he clasped his hands together and said "I am a ruined man!" and begged Mr. Bellis to forgive him. I returned to his house, and found the articles, which I have here, in the back front room; I then went up stairs, and, in a room which was locked, I found some pistols - I was about to open a box - the prisoner said that was the worst job of all - I there found some musket and pistol locks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he ever tell you he had taken these things? A. No - he said "I am a ruined man" - I believe he is a dealer in flints.</p>

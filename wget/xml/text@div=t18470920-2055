May spoke to me on Ludgate-hill, and asked if I had lost anything—I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse—there was a sovereign and a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and a shilling in it—I had put my hand into my pocket at the corner of Ludgate-hill, to take out my handkerchief, and am quite sure I had it then.</p>

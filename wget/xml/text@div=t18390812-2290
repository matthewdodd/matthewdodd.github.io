                  </hi>. I am a tallow chandler—I live in Kingsgate-street now, I did live at No. 10, Orange-street, but my house has been burned down. On the 27th of July, in consequence of information from Mr. Harris, I went with an officer to the Orange-tree public-house, next door to where the fire was—I found the prisoner there, and gave him into custody—I traced some tallow to Mr. Atkinson's—it is the same quality and appearance as that on my premises—I know nothing further of the prisoner than seeing him on the building as a labourer, pulling down the ruins.</p>

I was policeman <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 16 at this time—on Saturday morning, 17th July, I saw Pope drawing a barrow at New Inn, Broadway—he took a wooden case off the barrow, took it into the house, and went away with the barrow—I left another officer in charge of the case, and went and apprehended Pope—I told him the charge—he denied all knowledge of it—I then went to where Toomey was employed, saw him, and told him I was going to take him for sending away a case of goods—he said that he had not, and he had not left the warehouse since he went to work, at 8 o'clock—the charge was read over to him at the station, and he said that he knew nothing about it—Mrs. Wallace was fetched—she said that he had been to her house and said that if a case of glass was sent for him, would she take it in for him—Toomey made no reply to that.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Wallace, of 26, New Inn Yard—I have known Toomey about six months—on Saturday morning. 17th July, he called on me between 8 and 9 o'clock, and asked me whether I would mind taking in a case that would come—I agreed to do so—he said that I was to keep it till it was called for—I said that I would—the case came, and a constable afterwards took possession of it.</p>

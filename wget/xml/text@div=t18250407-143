On the 15th of March I was out late with my team, and went to the Plough, public-house, Beaufort-buildings, about ten o'clock, with my son, to have a pot of half-and-half - one of my fellow servants was there; after drinking that pot we agreed to have a pot each, which we drank; it was then half-past twelve o'clock: I looked at my watch, and said it was time to go home, for I would stop no longer; the prisoner sat opposite to me, he followed me out and caught hold of my arm. I could not get from him, he would go home with me. I am sure I put my watch back into my fob, and had it in my fob when he caught hold of me; I did not go into any public-house with him - he wanted me to go into several; as soon as he loosened my arm, I put my hand down and missed my watch; my pocket was cut in two places, nobody but him had been near enough to cut it; he was a stranger to me - my son was with me all the time; I have not received my watch. I went to the same public-house next morning, and saw him sitting there; he said,</p>
               <p>"How did you get on when you got home last night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." I immediately went to Bow-street and got an officer, but when we got back he was gone. I went again in the afternoon, and he was there; I had him secured.</p>

            . I was at the Plough with my father; we had three pots there, and were both sober; my father took out his watch - I told him to take care of it, and put it into his pocket, as he did not know what company he might be in; the prisoner might have heard that - I can swear that he put it into his fob. We all three came out together - the prisoner followed us out; when I came to the top of the buildings, I turned into the Strand; he took hold of my father's arm, and insisted on seeing him home; I said, I was going that way myself, but all at once, by Catherine-street, I missed them; nobody but the prisoner went near enough to cut his pocket; we sat in a small box; there was only room for four.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of March I took the prisoner at the Plough.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I recollect seeing the prosecutor very drunk, and said I would see him home: he could not get in at home, and said he would see if he could have a pint of beer; I said, I knew a watering house which I thought was open; he stopped by the piazzas in Covent-garden, talking to two women. I left him for three or four minutes, and no doubt the robbery was committed then.</p>

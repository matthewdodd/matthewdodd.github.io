He came into my house on the 12th of October, about ten in the evening, I perceived he had linen under his great coat, I asked him what he had got there, he said his wife's or sisters gown, I laid hold of the table cloth, I saw it was not mine, the cloth was full of gravy and liquor as if it had been shortly used, and by his saying it was his wife's or sisters gown I thought he had stolen it. I lodged him and the cloth in the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the owner of it. - A. By the company that were in the house, there had been a club-feast there, we suspected that it belonged to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober. - A. I rather think he was elevated. The prosecutor's house is about three miles and a half from mine.</p>

I am the son of the last witness—I saw my father in Glasshouse Street on 8th January—I asked him if he would come and have a drop of gin—we did so, and stood outside the public-house—he said ''I am going"—I said "Go ahead," and not a minute after I saw him lying on the pavement in Glasshouse Street—I went and picked him up, and a woman said "Your father is robbed"—I then saw the prisoner about as far off from me as you are—he said "That is all I have taken"—that was a threepenny-piece in his left hand, and he had the purse in his right—he handed them to me, and a policeman came and <hi rend="italic">skated him</hi> off to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman X 40). About three o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 25th July, I saw the prisoner coming from the rear of Ports-down Road, in Clifton Gardens, in the direction of the back of the prosecutor's house—he was carrying these two bags in his hand, and as he came along I saw him put this screwdriver into the big bag—on seeing me he went back a little—he then came forward—I went back out of sight and he came towards me—I went to see if I could find a policeman in uniform—I was in plain clothes—not seeing one, I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Good morning;" he said, "Good morning," and asked me the way to the Great Western Railway—I told him I did not know, and asked him what he had got in the bags—he said, "Oh! you have no need to look; it is all right, I assure you"—I told him I was a police constable, and I should like to see—on looking in the bag I found this property and a candle partly consumed—I asked him where he got these from—he refused to tell—he said he was going to take them to the Great Western Railway to meet his master—I told him he would have to go to the police-station to satisfy us how he came in possession of them—I took the bags in my left hand and caught hold of him with my right hand—he struck me a very violent blow at the side of the head and ran away—I ran after him for about 300 yards, and then overtook him and knocked him down—we had a struggle, and he got away from me and jumped over some railings—I followed him for about 300 or 400 yards into another field, and there we had another struggle together for about an hour and a quarter—during that time he got on the top of me and ran a small chisel, which he took from his pocket, into the corner of my right eye, and also in several places in my face—he got my thumb into his mouth and severely bit it—he also bit my second finger; at the same time he took hold of me by the collar, and said, "You b—, if you don't let me go I will kill you"—we had a desperate struggle together—an old watchman at last came up and took him to the station—I had a rattle with me; no staff—I have not been able to find the chisel that he struck me with—I took possession of the property, and afterwards showed it to Mrs. Leate.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Inspector). On the 26th July I examined the prosecutor's premises, and found a mark on the back kitchen window at the bottom of the sash which this screwdriver just fitted—it appeared that the sash had been forced up—the catch of the window had been recently forced off, but had been put on again before I arrived at the house—it is in the parish of Paddington.</p>

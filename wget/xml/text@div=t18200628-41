            . On the 10th of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Burr-street with one Horman, who was tried last Sessions. I saw Horman lift the truck from the guard, the prisoner was behind him. Horman drew it opposite the London Docks, I then lost sight of them, and on turning the corner of Wells-street I saw the prisoner drawing it. Horman called out</p>
               <p>"To the right!" The prisoner saw me, went up White Lion-street, and at the corner of Wellclose-square he ran off - I secured Horman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you hear Horman ask him to assist in taking it to the Green-yard - A. No. I saw an officer of the Court of Requests drinking with Horman. I heard nothing of his having a warrant to arrest the prisoner. They were not going the way to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Horman asked me to help him with it to the Green-yard. I saw an officer who had an execution against me, and ran away.</p>

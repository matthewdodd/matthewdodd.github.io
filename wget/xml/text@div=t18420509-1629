                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, living in Weymouth-street, Portland-place. On Thursday, the 13th of May, I was at the Grand Jury-room door of this Court—I felt something pluck my coat behind</p>

               <p>—I felt my pocket and found that my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner walking away at a quick pace—I followed him out of the Court into the street—I said to him, "Young man, I think you have got my handkerchief"—he said nothing—a policeman came up, and the prisoner had the handkerchief in his hand—this is it—it is mine—it is marked—the constable took it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together just outside the Court—the prosecutor accused the prisoner of taking his handkerchief—I saw the prisoner take it from under his coat, and I snatched it out of his hand—I took him into custody, and going up the Old Bailey he rushed out of my arms, and struck me several times, and gave me a black eye which I have now.</p>

            . My house was burnt down some years ago; I was to build it up again. I was to lay out a certain sum, and to employ who I pleased. I employed Mr. Holland, the builder, to take the whole trouble of the building upon himself; the agreement with him was made in writing. I saw that writing executed; (the agreement is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Holland begin to build the house?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the Smith's work?</p>

            ; I did not know him till some months after he was employed by Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bills for Smith's work delivered in by themselves?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. They were brought by the builder. I paid all the accounts to the builder, and not to the particular workmen. I have all the bills here (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of the last receipt?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. The last receipt is for 131 l. but there is no date to it. There is a receipt dated 29 June 1767; that is the last bill. The first bill was for carcasing the house. The whole of these bills were for Smith's work. The pavement before the house was lowered, and the iron bars were lengthened: the order was given immediately to the proper Smith who had made that iron work to make an addition to it: it was given to Mr. Burnell; it was made directly; I should have left it as it was; the bills would have been brought me in, but the builder came himself, and said it was done in so bad a manner that he was ashamed of it; and said his son should draw me a fresh draught of a complete sett, and he would make Burnell take the iron work again. I was not to pay for any thing that did not please me; I had paid for the first sell that was put up, and not the present one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that charged?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. All that I have paid for is the first sett of irons that were put up before the pavement was changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bills delivered by Mr. Holland between your first and second iron work being put up?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I think I had not the bills in till afterwards; the building had been completed but a very little time; I don't believe the Smith's work was even done then. I did not hear that Mr. Burnell had any bill against me for at least twelve months; I believe I have that bill; I am not clear whether it is quite the same; the amount of this bill is 4 l. 18 s. 6 d. Mr. Burnell gave me this bill a little before the cause in the Sheriff's court after the arrest; the amount in the first bill was something about the same sum; I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050036"></xptr> the first bill back, I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Burnell been allowed for these alterations by Mr. Holland?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. He will answer that, if Mr. Holland had brought me in that account, I should have paid it immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Burnell was to be paid by somebody; Did not he make more than one application for the money?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. Two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not apply ten or twelve times?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No; nor half the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any expression you made use of at that time?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I knew Mr. Burnell then, and did not believe he could have used me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time the paviors came over against your door?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time Holland's bill came in?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No, I paid it in June, the bill was delivered about two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this (shewing him a drawing) is this the nature of the alteration?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I believe it was, but not quite so handsome.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Holland has charged for any more iron work than this?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I can't tell one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct Mr. Burnell?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I did give him particular directions to have the place stopped up. I can point you out four or five things in the bill that even Mr. Holland did not know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing said about an application being made to Mr. Holland concerning this alteration?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Council for the prosecutor. I understand you, that you was to give directions to the particular people?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I was, and I did give directions throughout the whole building.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the agreement between Mr. Holland and you was made known to Mr. Burnell.</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I can't say; but Mr. Burnell must certainly know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know that fact?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. I have no doubt of it, in my opinion.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Pyefinch to do all the work in his house; my son was the acting person; I stood security for him; I left it all to my son; he received and paid, and I believe Mr. Pyefinch was very well satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to do the Smith's work?</p>
               <p>Holland. Mr. Burnell was employed by my son to do part of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this affair of Mr. Burnell's.</p>
               <p>Holland. I do, by accident. I saw the work, it was very badly done; I bid my son at his own expence take it down and put up something that was handsome, which he did; in about half a year after Mr. Burnell came to settle the account with my son and some other business, he brought in no such bill as that read; he did not make a charge of that alteration till a considerable time after, Mr. Burnell said he had called upon Mr. Pyefinch, and he would not pay it, and said he had no right to pay it. Mr. Burnell said that it was a job of his own, that he would have it made immediately, and would not consult Holland about it, for he wanted it done in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no account made by your son to Mr. Pyefinch for this alteration?</p>
               <p>Holland. He never asked it, Mr. Burnell gave credit for the old iron work; my son paid him about seven guineas, which he was out of pocket, to make a pretty thing to please Mr. Pyefinch, for the first jobb before it was altered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Burnell, allowed by your son for the alteration, for if I understand right, the old rails were taken away.</p>
               <p>Holland. Mr. Burnell allowed for them, they were longer and more expensive; he was paid for these rails the last time out of my son's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mr. Burnell paid so by your son as to include the alteration of the rails?</p>
               <p>Holland. No, not a halfpenny, it was the alteration that Mr. Pyefinch gave himself; my son knew nothing of it for half a year: the bill for the first railing was carried in to Mr. Pyefinch, the alteration was never known to me nor my son, till all the accounts were closed; the old railing was taken down and allowed for as old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Burnell ever been paid by your son for that?</p>
               <p>Pyefinch. No.</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be material after what has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050037"></xptr> passed, to enquire whether Mr. Burnell can be guilty of perjury; the truth of the matter is this, the bill for this alteration was never carried into Mr. Holland; there can be no colour for a charge of perjury; Mr. Burnell should not have attended Mr. Pyefinch, it was indecent to be sure. On the other hand, this prosecution is worse, because it is a serious thing to bring an indictment for perjury; this is always the case, when people do their business with warmth and without temper.</p>

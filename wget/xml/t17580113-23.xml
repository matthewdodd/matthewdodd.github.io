               <p>Budd. That was kept in a cupboard in the back parlour. I look'd about, but could not find the key, and getting a smith, I open'd the cupboard before the prisoner's husband. The plate was all gone, and nothing left in the cupboard but a pair of steel snuffers. I look'd in the chest where the linen used to be kept, and found nothing but some tablecloths, a napkin and a pillowbier or two. I got a person to stay in the house while I went down to Eltham, to acquaint my mistress of it. My mistress sent me up again with

            , a fellow servant, to see farther about it. I asked the prisoner's husband if he knew any thing about the plate, he said he did not. I asked him if he knew any pawnbroker that his wife made use of, he said he believed he did. I took him to shew me, and at the corner of Half Moon Street, in the Strand, at a pawnbroker's, we ask'd if there were any plate there in the name of Mrs. Ross. The pawnbroker ask'd what plate it should be. We said a candlestick and some spoons, and other things. The pawnbroker fetch'd them out, the candlestick, the extinguisher, five large spoons, and two tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the pawnbroker?</p>
               <p>Budd. I have never seen him since her last examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Budd. This was on the 29th of Dec. at night. I having seen the things, left them there, and went with her husband to justice Fielding. The prisoner was brought there, Mr. Fielding was out, he came home in the evening, and she was examined, and own'd the taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she own?</p>
               <p>Budd. She own'd that the plate was my mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they mention'd all to her ?</p>
               <p>Budd. I don't know whether they were or not. She own'd all in general.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she took them?</p>
               <p>Budd. She had all these things in her care. The justice then committed her for farther examination. This was on the Saturday, the 30th or 31st. On the Tuesday following she was brought before the justice again, when she own'd she had pawn'd them. The pawnbroker was there. He said she had pawn'd them for upwards of 4 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Budd. His name is Hibberd. I think it was the journeyman that was taken up upon it ( The plate produced in court.) These are my mistress's property.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last in your mistress's house?</p>

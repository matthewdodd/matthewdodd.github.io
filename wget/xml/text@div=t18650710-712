                  </hi>. I live at Queen's-terrace, Woolwich-common—on the evening of 24th June, a little after 9 o'clock, I was outside my house, on the balcony—I noticed the prisoner go alongside my house about five yards from it—she entered a gateway on Mr. Webb's premises, and went a few yards up to the side of the house—there was some linen on a rope in the yard—she was about eight yards from me—I saw her put her left hand up and drag some linen off the line and put it under her right arm—she then left, and went up Jackson's lane—I followed her—she was walking slowly, and when she got in front of her house she gave the linen to a child who was walking with her—she had two children with her—she then went into the house—I came back, communicated with Mr. Webb, and afterwards pointed the house out to a policeman—I went in with him and identified the woman—I have no doubt she is the same person.</p>

On the evening of 24th June, from something that was said to me, I went to the prisoner's house in Jackson's-lane—she was not there—she was standing a little further along the road—I knocked at the door—she came to me and asked what I was doing there—I told her there had been some linen lost on the common from the premises of Mr. Webb—she said she knew nothing at all about it—I said, "You do not mind me looking in the house"—she said there was nothing there—I said, "I must search the house"—she said, "I will let you in"—and she let me in and walked round with me—I said, "I must have a look in this room"—she allowed me to look in, and then I looked in another room up stairs, but could not find anything—I said, "I must look' at the back"—she then passed in front of me to the back, opened the door with her right hand, and made motions with her left hand, as if she was throwing something out, which looked white—I undid the door and looked outside, but it was dark—it was some few minutes before I saw these things lying about three yards off—I found three pairs of drawers—I said, "Do you know anything about these things?"—she said, "No, nothing at all about them"—I said, "You must know, there is no one else in the house besides you"—she burst out crying, saying she did not know any-thing about them—it is her house.</p>

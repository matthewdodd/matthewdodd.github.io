               <p>Q. On the 14th instant, in what parish were you - A. In the parish of Harrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Kempton in the parish of Harrow - A. Yes; I left home at one o'clock in the day. I went across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got from home before you were overtaken by any body - A. I had walked about two miles, therefore it must be about half past one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you overtaken by any person - A. By this person.</p>
               <p>Q. What person do you mean - A. The prisoner; I am quite sure he is the man. When I was just going out of the field, I saw a man entering the field; as I went through the gate of the field I held the gate with my hand, seeing him so near. I did not turn round to look at him. I had not gone many steps from the gate before he caught hold of my arm; he did not speak. He dragged me down; I begged he would not hurt me. I said I had money about me; I would give it to him. He told me to hold my tongue. I screamed out. He said, blast you, I will murder you. He kneeled on my stomach, and with one hand he held my throat; I pulled the hand away from my throat. Then he put that hand into my mouth to prevent my screaming. Several times I dragged his hand from my mouth and throat. I bled at the mouth a great deal. He tore my gown to get at my pocket. He took a silk knitted purse, containing a two pound note; a dollar; a three shilling piece; and one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got them what did he do - A. He then dragged me round upon my face, and left me instantly. I never saw him leave me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a good deal overpowered and overcome with this - A. Very much; I could not speak. I walked back to the gate, but fearing he might be gone that way, I went towards Edgeware.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. Not till last Saturday. I have not the smallest doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am the daughter of a farmer; my father lives at Kempton.</p>
               <p>Q. It is about two miles from Kempton to Edgeware, and you had got about half way - A. I had got rather better than half way.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS CHAPMAN. I am a constable of Stanmore. I apprehended the prisoner in a stable, at the Crown in Stanmore, last Friday evening. On the next day he was taken to Miss Sims, and as soon as she saw him, she exclaimed, you are the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can give a true account of myself, where I was all that day.</p>

            . I am a publican, at Mill-hill. On the 14th of this month the prisoner came into my house, about ten o'clock, and about half past eleven I left him in my house, drinking. He was very much in liquor. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the time - A. I am sure as to the time, within two minutes. I left my house afterwards, and was not at home afterwards that day. On Monday week he was at my house, the Plough, at Mill-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is it from your house, at Mill-hill, to Edgeware - A. Three miles across the fields.</p>

            . I am a shop-keeper at Mill-hill. On Monday morning, the 14th of September, about ten o'clock, this man came to my house. He inquired for Mrs. Butler, a woman he formerly lodged with; he owed her a few shillings, he was to pay her. He said he had some boots he left there when he left his lodging. Mrs. Butler is my wife's sister; she came into the shop. He said, I ran after you to pay you. She said, I am going home; they both went out. He came into the shop a little after one. He bought a handkerchief; he was tipsy then.</p>

            . I am a carpenter at Mill-hill. I saw the prisoner twice on the 14th of September. I saw him twice from a quarter before two, to half-past two. The last time I saw him he was asleep in Upper-lane; I awoke him. Two mile from Hendon church, I passed him with my wheel-barrow. The first time I saw him was before two. I ascertained the time by Mr. Justice Le Blanc's carriage passing. I asked the coachman the time, he told me.</p>

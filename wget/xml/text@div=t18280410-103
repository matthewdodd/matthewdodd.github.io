            . I am waiter at the Britannia Arms. I went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner laying on the seat, and taking the watch from the pocket of the prosecutor, who was asleep with his head on the table; I pushed the table on one side to seize the prisoner, and caught the ribbon of the watch as it was going into the prisoner's hand - the prisoner goes by the name of Doggy - the prosecutor awoke, and said it was his watch. Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came in, and asked for the nine o'clock coach. He had scarcely spoken when the coach came up; he went out, came in again, and took out his watch, and placed it on the seat; Drummond came in, and took it up - no one went near him but the waiter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled clerk to Mr. Eden, and am ac<lb></lb>quainted with Mr. Lawrence, a very highly respectable gentleman, and his family, at Hammersmith—he was a conveyancer formerly, but is very old and infirm, and has retired from practice. In April, last year, I was introduced by him to the defendant Fuller, who stated to me that he was in difficulties, that his father-in-law, Mr. Chamberlain, had cheated him out of about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which be was entitled to by his marriage, and bad got him also to sign a something for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a release of some property which he was entitled to, and that he had sold the property, and let him have 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he first lent him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I understood, in the whole, 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had employed Saunders and Woolley, the assignees under his estate—that they had agreed to fit up his shop for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards induced him to give accommodation-bills, promising to take them up, if he could not, when they came to maturity, to the amount of about 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Reeve, of the firm of Walters and Reeve, who were relations of Saunders and Co., had served writs for the amount of two bills, one of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they had also served him with notices in bankruptcy, but be said, "Instead of serving me, I expected something of the sort; my brother was in the shop, and they served them on my brother instead of myself"—he said he was at variance with his father-in-law, and requested me to see Mr. Chamberlain, for the purpose of seeing if I could bring about a reconciliation between them—I went to Chamberlain—I did not succeed at that time—he requested me to call again, and he would give me a different account of the whole transaction—before I called again I had an interview with Fuller's father—I accompa<lb></lb>nied him to Reeve, on the 10th of April, to the best of my recollection—Fuller made a very fair proposition, as I thought—Reeve said, "I am on the</p>

               <p>right side of the hedge, I shall not accept any such terms; I shall go on, and obtain judgment and execution"—but I had been informed by Fuller the defendant, that the notices had not been served on him, and I said to Reeve, "The notices you have served are of no service, they are not legal"—Reeve said, "Then I will send an officer into Mr. Fuller's house, and he shall not leave till he serves him"—I said, "Very well, that convinces me what Fuller has said is correct, that these bills were accom<lb></lb>modation-bills, placed in your hands for the mere purpose of suing for them"—I saw Chamberlain again a day or two afterwards—he said Fuller had sent his wife to him, and told her to say that he was about to be made a bankrupt, and unless he (Chamberlain) sent in an execution on the se<lb></lb>curities he held, he would lose the whole of his money—in consequence of what he said, I went down to Sleaford, to see Mr. Holding, an attorney—Chamberlain said he was not aware of what securities he had, and I went down to ascertain—I know Capes and Steward—they are agents to Holding—on the 19th of April, after seeing Holding, Capes and Co. issued an execution—Mr. Eden was engaged after this by Mr. William Fuller, the father of the defendant, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> strike a docket—I went from Mr. Eden's then, in company with Mr. Fuller, to strike the docket against the son on a bill—there was an assignment made to the Sheriff on the 29th—Chamberlain took possession of the premises in Regent-street, where Fuller had been carrying on business as a shawl-dealer—on the day possession was taken of the premises, Fuller went to Mr. Lawrence's, at Hammersmith, and Hoad was left in possession—the shop-goods were sold by tender, by Mr. Cham<lb></lb>berlain, such as shawls and silks, to Hitchcock, in Regent-street, and afterwards there was a sale by auction—I remember the second fiat being issued, on the day the sale took place, by Mr. Bingham, on the 2nd of May—I was present at the sale—before the bankruptcy I was admiring the shop, and Fuller said, "Any thing you wish to purchase out of my shop, you shall have at cost price"—that was not after the commission was issued—I bought various articles of him—to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion, there was Robson's Directory, and the Royal Blue Book—I did not buy a pair of snuffers and a tray, or a slab before the bankruptcy—I bought two mouseline-de-laine dresses for Miss Lawrence, which I was after wards charged with stealing—I called on Miss Lawrence—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said, I went to Fuller, to bring down for her the two dresses she had been looking at—I told him they were for her—I paid him for them—I had no receipt—I took them to her—on recollection, one was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one was a sort of drab dress—I paid the money to Fuller—I cannot tell exactly the date of the transaction-it was in April, 1841—it was certainly before the levy was made, before the 19th of April—on the 6th of May Mr. Bingham sold the household goods and furniture, which had been assigned by the Sheriff—I bought a sundry lot at the auction, which included a marble slab, about 9 inches by 14—the umbrella-stand was a separate lot—I also bought a door-mat—I believe that was at the second sale, I cannot say—I did not buy any sheets—I have a list of the articles I did buy—I showed it to Chamberlain—I have a list of the articles I bought from Bingham—there were some hassocks, a glass, an umbrella-stand, a mat, and a piece of marble—I have been charged with stealing those articles—I showed this list to Mr. Chamberlain, I believe on the day, or the day after I received it from Bingham—I showed it to him at Mr. Lawrence's, in October—Chamberlain said I had given too much for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190007"></xptr>
               <p>some of the articles, and made some alteration in the price—that was the next night, on the same night as I received it from Bingham—Hoad was left in possession of the premises in Regent-street—Mr. Chamberlain met me one morning, I believe it was the 23rd of September, 1841, at Mr. Lawrence's, and asked if I would have the kindness to call at Regent-street, to pay Hoad his wages, discharge him, and desire him to pack up what trifling articles there were about the premises, and send them down by the carrier—I paid Hoad, and told him he was to leave on Thursday, and to pack up the articles, and send them by the carrier to Mr. Chamberlain, who had taken a house at Hammersmith, and I told Hoad to send me down the marble slab and um<lb></lb>brella-stand at the same time—after I had paid the man his wages he said, "There is something more due to me for washing"—I said, "Make out your bill, I will pay you"—I did so—he said, "There is a pair of snuff<lb></lb>ers and tray on the dresser, will you take them to Mr. Chamberlain?"—I said, "Yes," and he gave them me—I put them in my pocket, and went down to Hammersmith in the evening in the omnibus, and called at Mr. Law<lb></lb>rence's, where I met Chamberlain—I took the snuffers and stand out of my pocket, handed them to Chamberlain, and said, "Here is the snuffers and tray Hoad has sent you, and the other articles he has sent down by the carrier"—I gave them to him and he put them, as well as I can recollect, on the dumb waiter in the corner of the parlour, and took them away with him about half an hour after—a day or two after the carrier had brought some things to my house, I called at Chamberlain's, and told him the carrier had brought some of the articles which should have been left at his house, to my house—I bad not given the carrier directions to call at Regent-street to get the things in the first place—Chamberlain bad in my presence—that was, I believe,-about the 24th or 25th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—it was on the 23rd I had brought the snuffeid down, and the next day or the day after I was at Chamberlain's, one morning—he told me he had sent his servant down to the carrier to inquire if he had brought the articles, and while I was there the carrier called—Chamberlain told him to bring the articles down—a list was given—I can<lb></lb>not say whether by me or Chamberlain—I cannot tell how it was they were brought to my house—it was not by my direction—they were after<lb></lb>wards sent to Chamberlain's—I called the same morning and told him the carrier had left them at my house, and requested him to send Hooper, his servant's brother, for them, and he did call, and while I was at his house that night I saw them brought up, and Mrs. Chamberlain came up and. said they were all right—out of those articles I was afterwards charged with stealing the umbrella-stand, and a bag which contained the sheets—I had bought the umbrella-stand, but Chamberlain said he had purchased an um<lb></lb>brella-stand at Fuller's, and had desired him to send it to him, and he had not—I said, "Very well, you shall have it," and I let him have it—it only cost a few shillings—I had bought it, but gave up my purchase to Chamber<lb></lb>lain, and he had it—I had advanced money to Chamberlain—I had paid various sums on his account—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—altogether 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid for and advanced to him—one evening Chamberlain said at Mr. Lawrence's, "What you wish to purchase out of the sale Mr. Bingham will value; if you take them at his valuation I shall be perfectly satisfied, it will save me the auction duty, or, if you prefer it, buy them in for me, and you take them at the bought-in price"—he then said, "You are the only friend I have in</p>

               <p>the world—after I have sold my reversionary property I will pay you what I owe you, and will make you a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of plate into the bargain"—it was in consequence of his telling me I might buy at Bing<lb></lb>ham's valuation that I purchased the things I have named—I thought they were going very cheap—I bought the hassocks and things in this list, and have them now, except the umbrella-stand, which was sold to me at the first sale—the mat, the piece of marble, and the umbrella-stand, which I was charged with stealing, are in this list—I received this list from the auctioneer, signed by him—the last time I advanced money to Mr. Cham<lb></lb>berlain was in the latter end of last November, I believe—he wanted me to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused to lend him any more unless he would give me security for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also for the sums I had advanced—he said, "I shall be enabled to pay you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a month"—I said, "If I lend you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you will be able to pay me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a month"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will accept a bill for the amount"—he said, "Yes"—I took it to him and he refused to accept it—I commenced an action against him in December—I had not seen Fuller for a length of time before I brought the action—I do not know where he was, he was not to be seen—after I com<lb></lb>menced the action he and Chamberlain became very intimate—I saw them walking about the streets together—I remember my house being searched on the 3rd of January—I had not been before the Commissioner of Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy before that—it was immediately after I sued Chamberlain that the house was searched—I was not at home then—I was at Mr. Lawrence's, very dangerously ill at the time—while I was there Fuller, Reeve, and a messenger, as he called himself, from the Court of Bankruptcy, came to search Mr. Lawrence's house at Hammersmith—about seven or eight o'clock in the evening there was a very violent knocking at the door—they took away a book which Fuller had given me—it was the Analogy of the Old and New Testaments—also some little tassels that appeared to me like bell-tassels, and a piece of mouseline-de-laine, part of one of the very dresses I had bought of Fuller—there were some muslin curtains brought down which Fuller said were in the house—Mrs. Lawrence said, "Yes, there is," and desired the servant to go and fetch them down, which she did—Fuller said they were not his, and they did not take them away—they were white muslin curtains—I should think on that oc<lb></lb>casion they were at Lawrence's house two hours or more—they gave no intimation whatever to me that they had a search warrant for my house—I was in conversation with Reeve—the next step they took was to go to my house, and search—I was not present—after the 3rd of January summonses were served—I was summoned to the Bankruptcy Court to give evidence a few days after—I went before Mr. Commissioner Merivale, and was examined—there was an adjournment first—Miss Lawrence was examined—that was about the 12th of January—at the close of the exami<lb></lb>nation Fuller was examined at my request—I heard him give his evidence—Reeve was present—Fuller was examined on the 26th of January, and in consequence of what took place I indicted him for perjury at the January sessions, which commenced, I think, on the 30th—after I preferred the indictment against him, I saw no more of him—he was gone out of the way—I heard he went to Ostend—I did all I could to find him, but could not—in the very same month Chamberlain filed a bill in Chancery against me—It was postponed by some means till the 18th of June, when it stood for trial by a special jury, in the Court of Queen's Bench—I saw all the defendants</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190009"></xptr>
               <p>there, except Mrs. Fuller—it was not tried that day—it was afterwards fixed by the Court, at the application of Mr. Kelly, my counsel, and appointed for Thursday, the 23rd of June—Saturday was the 18th, as well as I can recol<lb></lb>lect—the defendants left me early in the afternoon, and I went to Hammer<lb></lb>smith, and that evening saw the male defendants, and one not in cus<lb></lb>tody, and two or three policemen, and a crowd about them—it was the very day the trial was expected, and was postponed till the 23rd—in consequence of what I heard I went to the Kensington Police Court on the Monday—a person calling himself the clerk of Reeve appeared against me, and applied to postpone the examination till the following Wednesday—I appeared then, and Reeve, Fuller, and Chamberlain preferred a charge against me—Reeve said he should defer the charge on which I was apprehended that very morning, (for the officer met me, and said, "You are my prisoner,") and charged me with felony—I was apprehended on the Monday as I was going to the office—Reeve then charged me with stealing from a box the mouseline-de-laine dresses, and the pomatum-pot—I had been apprehended on the charge of obtaining goods by false pre<lb></lb>tences—the articles were produced—that was one of the dresses I bad obtained from Fuller, and paid him for—the pomatum-pot I know no<lb></lb>thing of—it was not the pot which had been taken by the messenger from my house, and which I had seen before on the table with the other ar<lb></lb>ticles, before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy—I had never seen it be<lb></lb>fore—the one before the Magistrate was not the one which had been at my house—I believe they had changed it—the one taken from my house was my property—I know which pot they took from my house, because it was mentioned, and I missed a china pomatum-pot—at Kensington, before the magistrates, I took it up, looked at it,"and was persuaded it was so, as I knew nothing of it, and began to think they had changed it—I missed one which was mine, after the search—I believe it was the one I saw after<lb></lb>wards before the Commissioner—the one before the Magistrate I believe was not the same—I am sure the one before the Magistrate was not the same as that before the Commissioner—it was not anything like the one taken from my house—Mr. and Mrs. Fuller and Mr. Reeve were examined in sup<lb></lb>port of the charge, and I think Miss Lawrence was examined—I have seen Fuller write, and know this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposition</hi>)—to be his hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">George Fuller,</hi> being recalled, deposed, that it was the same pot Miss Lawrence was examined about at the Bankruptcy Court; that he had had the things in his possession since January, and that he had kept the pot in his portmanteau till he gave it to Mr. Reeve within the last month; that he did not recollect whether he gave it to him on the 22nd of June, or whether he took it to Ostend; he believed it was his wife's before they were married; and had heard her say a Mrs. Gundry gave it to her."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there from first to last any charge of stealing a pair of snuffers and tray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a great deal said about the snuf<lb></lb>fers and tray—I do not think they were mentioned on the first charge, but they were included in the charge of misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The depositions of the 18th of June being read, John Hoad</hi> deposed, that in 1841 he was in Fuller's service, upon whose bankruptcy he was after<lb></lb>wards placed in charge of the premises on Chamberlain's behalf, under an execution, where he remained from June till September, during which time he was frequently visited by Thomas Alley Jones, whom he believed to be Chamberlain's legal adviser; that about the beginning of September, by Jones's desire, he packed up, in three boxes', a marble slab, a pair of sheets, a table-cloth, a box of tools, a set of blacking brushes, a saw, and other articles, which were directed to "Jones, Grove-cottage, Hammersmith," which he delivered, with a bronze umbrella-stand, to the carrier; that on another occasion he handed to Jones a pair of snuffers and tray at his re<lb></lb>quest, Jones stating that he was going to take them to Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Napier Reeve</hi> deposed, that in April, 1841, a fraudulent fiat was issued against Fuller, under the control and with the assistance of Jones, which was subsequently set aside, and a new fiat issued, under which Alexander Saunders, of Regent-street, was appointed sole assignee; that in January he (Mr. R.) accompanied Thomas Hamber, the mes<lb></lb>senger of the Court of Bankruptcy, to search for concealed goods on Jones's premises, and there descried many articles, which Fuller identified as having been removed from his house in Regent-street, and among them a marble slab, and bronze umbrella-stand; that Jones subsequently stated, before Mr. Commissioner Merivale, that he had purchased the goods at the sale by Bingham, whereas he (Mr. R.) had just discovered that they had been removed from the premises by Jones, under a pretended direction from Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Perceval Hamilton Chamberlain</hi> deposed, that he never gave any such directions to Jones; that he claimed no property in the same, but, to the best of his belief, they belonged to the Fuller estate.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The depositions of the 29th of June were then readt on which occasion John Hoad repeated the substance of his former deposition.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">George Fuller</hi> deposed, That he went with Mr. Hamber to Jones's; he</p>

               <p>saw the marble slab there, which he considered was the property of his creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Perceval Hamilton Chamberlain</hi> deposed, that he had an execution in Fuller's house; that before the first sale of Fuller's effects, he expressed a wish to Jones to have the marble slab, which had been on the stove in the shop, but was then removed; that Jones said it had been removed, and if it was in the bill of sale from the Sheriff, it did not belong to him (Cham<lb></lb>berlain;) that he never gave Jones any authority to ask for any goods be<lb></lb>longing to Fuller; if he did ask Jones to get any thing from Regent-street, they were only articles belonging to himself; and that he never received a pair of snuffers and tray from Jones, in Miss Lawrence's presence, at her house."</p>

I should decidedly have said, "No'—it may be mine—allow me to see the contents—the only reason why I would swear to my belief about its being my handwriting, is the dash underneath—the signature is no more like mine than yours would be—I cannot swear it is not my signature—from the character of the writing.

               <p>me the liberty that I took with the different things at the same period—the authority from each to deal with the property was long after—Chamber<lb></lb>lain's execution was put in on the 19th of April—that was put in with my concurrence—I knew of it, I counselled it, and proposed it—there was a warrant of attorney—I went to Mr. Holding, Chamberlain's attorney—I think the notices on Fuller were on the 6th of April—they were earlier than my introduction to him—I was lending my assistance to Fuller and Cham<lb></lb>berlain to defeat the other creditor ultimately—the other creditor was suing as well as serving notices, with a view to the bankruptcy—they were pro<lb></lb>ceeding at law, and would in a very few days have obtained an execution—I think it was not Saunders and Woolley who were suing—the bills had been paid away to the attorney—I think they were the drawers of the bills—they were also proceeding at law—I was advising the parties merely as a friend—it was not until September that the authority was given me to buy what goods I liked, at the price Mr. Bingham put on them—in the mean time Chamberlain had been borrowing money of me, and inducing roe to lend him to a large amount—altogether I advanced him 637<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—out of that I received from Mr. Bingham the proceeds of two sales, which was, I think, 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. something, and 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received those amounts it Chamberlain's request—I received of Mr. Chamberlain 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, to pay tome of Fuller's creditors, to whom Chamberlain gave a guarantee to secure them in a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they sued Chamberlain for the amount, Chamberlain requested me to pay that amount, and I did so—I gave it to Mr. Eden/and he paid it to the attorney who was suing Chamberlain, and the receipts and vouchers are now in Mrs. Chamberlain's possession—I left them at her request with Messrs. Capes and Stewart, who told me that the had been there and received them—at the time I lent Chamberlain the 637<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he told me he was in difficulties in consequence of fuller's bankruptcy, that Fuller had received from him 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> rain him—he claimed a lien on the lease of, I think, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the lease of Fuller's house was to have been sold, by order of the Court of Review—it was subsequently put up—in the mean time I had lent him various sums of money—he led me to believe that he was a man of very good property—he said he had some reversionary property, and requested me to go down to Lincolnshire to see it, and he employed Mr. Eden to sell the pro<lb></lb>perty—I have a copy of the way in which the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was expended—I received the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15th of June, 1841—I think that was the day on which it was paid—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at Chamberlain's request, to a Mr. Bolton, of Hammersmith, for a kitchen range.</p>

               <p>wife—he said he did not like his wife to know how much he was in my debt—this is a statement of account by me, claiming a balance of 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—it is a false account, which I made out for the purpose of showing his wife—some of the amounts are correct—here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for barrister and clerk, that is right—they were some fees which I paid to Mr. Sergeant Scriven, for an opinion—I should say this paper was made out about Sep<lb></lb>tember or October, last year—I called, I think, on a Sunday morning, to offer Mrs. Chamberlain a seat in my pew—she had gone to church, and Chamber<lb></lb>lain then asked me to make out this account—this account is true as far as it goes, but there are items left out which I have not charged him for—I promised him that the opinion I obtained from Sergeant Scriven I would not charge him for—it is here, but that was for his wife—he was in my debt more than that—shortly afterwards he asked me for a further account—I ultimately made out an account beginning with 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—and reducing it by different payments to 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was made out en<lb></lb>tirely for the wife—with this is included a sum of 611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. plot 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid by me—there is a sum of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I have vouch<lb></lb>ers here—here is a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which I took up for him at the London and Westminster bank, and here is a receipt for 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a quarter's rent for the house in Regent-street—the balance due to me now is 252<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sued him for the whole amount that I had paid, 637<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving him to his set-off of course—I have set forth the schedule in my answer in Chan<lb></lb>cery—I have made payments on his account since October—on November 4th, 8th, 12th, and 17th, I paid some small sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at each time, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I have charged 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd as lent by me to Chamberlain, to pay Walters and Reeve—Chamberlain asked me to let him have a cheque for the amount, and I did so—the cheque was paid, and I have it here-on the 26th of April the fiat was bespoke—on Saturday the 1st of May I called for it—I anticipated Mr. Reeve's docket by a day, if the notices had been well served—I believe that was why Mr. William Fuller came up from Manchester—I swear I did not set him up as a petitioning creditor to get the commission myself—the fiat was obtained on Tuesday, the 4th of May—Mr. Eden knew of the docket on the 26th of April, after the applica<lb></lb>tion had been made—it was filed, and the Commissioner balloted for on the 6th of May—we did not proceed with it—we were advised not to go on with it when they went on with their fiat—on the 29th of April Cham<lb></lb>berlain's execution on the goods, by the assignment of the Sheriff, was perfected—I think the notices were served on Fuller about the beginning of April—I believe I have given an account of all the goods that had pre<lb></lb>viously been Fuller's, or Chamberlain's, that came into-my hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student at St. George's Hospital. My father and sisters reside at Hammersmith—I know Chamberlain, Ful<lb></lb>ler, and Reeve, and am also very intimate with Mr. Jones—about the lat<lb></lb>ter end of September I remember Chamberlain being at my father's house, in company with myself, my sister, and Mr. Jones—Chamberlain told Mr. Jones that anything he would like to buy out of the sale, if he would ask Mr. Bingham, the auctioneer, to put a value on it, he should be perfectly satisfied, or should he like it better to buy in at the sale for Mr. Chamberlain, he could take it out if he liked—he told Mr. Jones to take the proceeds of that sale as well as the former, and put it to his account, to be applied in reduction of his account—and he added that when he came</p>

               <p>into his reversionary property, which he was then selling, he would pay Mr. Jones the balance and make him a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of plate, for he was the best friend he had in the world—he also asked Mr. Jones to call at Fuller's house in Regent-street, and pay his man his wages before quar<lb></lb>ter-day, because he did not want to pay another quarter's rent by keeping on the house, and to tell Hoad to pack up whatever things had been left at that house for his accommodation, and any other loose things that might be in the house, and to send them by the carrier to Hammersmith to Mr. Chamberlain's, as they were trying to dispose of the lease—in the course of that same evening I saw Mr. Jones again at my father's house—Mr. Chamberlain was there too, taking tea at our house—Mr. Jones took out of his pocket a pair of snuffers and tray, and said to Mr. Chamberlain, "These are your snuffers and tray that your man Hoad thought inconve<lb></lb>nient to pack up with the things, and I put them in my pocket"—Chamberlain took them, and laughed at the idea of Mr. Jones bringing a paltry pair of suffers and tray in his pocket—Chamberlain took them away with him after staving the evening—we were then intimate—Chamberlain asked Mr. Jones if he had told the man to send down the other things that he had mentioned in the morning—he said, yes he had, and that he would do it—I remember a few nights after, taking tea at Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain's—Mr. Jones was there, my father, and sister—while there the servant came into the room, and said that her brother Hooper had brought some things from Mr. Jones, that had gone there by mistake from Regent-street—it was mentioned what the things were, but I cannot remember particularly what they were—there were many mentioned—Chamberlain said he was glad he had got all his things back again—this was in September—some time in October Mr. Jones again met Chamberlain at my father's house—(Cham<lb></lb>berlain was in the habit of coming to our house I should say, on an average, five times a week,) and after Mr. Jones came in after tea, in talking he pulled out a list of the accounts of the sale, and gave to Chamberlain—that was after the second or third sale—it was a little list that Mr. Bing<lb></lb>ham had written out, of his own things that he had bought—Chamberlain looked at it, and remarked that some of the things he thought were valued higher than they were worth—this is the list—Chamberlain asked me for a pen and ink, and altered, I believe, a glass from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a large pier glass—he then returned the list to Mr. Jones—he remarked that there was a marble slab in the list—he said he should like to have it, it would make a nice little bracket between his windows—Mr. Jones said, "You are perfectly welcome to have it if you send a servant for it; "here is a piece of marble 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down in the list—on the 9th of June last Mr. Reeve called on me at St. George's Hospital—I made a memorandum of it at the time, which I have with me—I had never seen Mr. Reeve before then, that I am aware of—he asked me if my name was Lawrence—I said yes—he said his name was Reeve—he said, "I have called on you to ask you whether you were in Regent-street on Sunday, the 12th of April twelve-month, and removed goods from Fuller's"—I said, "No, I was never in Regent-street on a Sunday in my life"—he was very cross at my denying that, and told me that a Mr. Preston had written a letter, telling him that I had done it—he then said, "Do you know a person named Thomas Alley Jones?"—I said, "Yes, perfectly well"—he was very cross—he said he was a scoundrel, a villain, and a thief, that he had not any thing in his house worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. except what he had stolen from the bankrupt George</p>

               <p>Fuller—he said, "I know he is not worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the world; if you have not been to his house, my dear Mr. Lawrence, I hope you will go, and see for yourself"—(he was then very friendly with me)—"you will find in one cupboard a lot of miscellaneous property and other suspicious things, plated goods, such as candlesticks, &amp;c.; I hope that you and your father will take care that your sister does not marry such a <hi rend="italic">scamp,</hi> but I will take care she shall not, for we are determined to transport him for stealing pro<lb></lb>perty from Fuller's creditors"—I said, "Really, Mr. Reeve, you must be mistaken, I know Mr. Jones to be a man of high respectability and pro<lb></lb>perty; it is only a day or two since that I saw his bankers' book, by which it appears that he had paid about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his bankers' account this year"—Mr. Reeve said it was all stuff, it was no such thing, he knew better; he could prove it was no bankers' book at all, but a mass of forge<lb></lb>ries—he said Mr. Fuller was below stairs, should he call him up, and he would state the same—I said no, I did not want to have any thing more to do either with Mr. Reeve or the bankrupt, and he then left me—I was examined before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy in Fuller's case—I did not there make the same statement as to the conversation at the hospital as I have now—I said in Mr. Reeve's presence that I had made a note of this, but as it was not in the matter in question there, I did not tell him it—on the 18th, about nine days afterwards, about half-past four o'clock, I was riding on the top of an omnibus, on my way from the hos<lb></lb>pital to my father's, and as we were passing through Hammersmith toll<lb></lb>bar, Mr. Reeve stopped the omnibus, and asked me if I had seen Jones—I said, "What do you mean?"—he then said, "Mr. Jones"—I said, "No, I hare not"—he said, "I have got a warrant for him, to apprehend him for felony" I was on the seat with the driver—I do not think there were any other pas<lb></lb>sengers—he said it quite loud enough for persons to hear—I went on to my father's house, and after I got there I saw Mr. Reeve again with Fuller, Chamberlain, and two policemen—they came to our house, and Mr. Reeve came and rang our bell, and asked for Mr. Jones—I should say there were nearly fifty people collected—I saw Mr. Jones's servant stand<lb></lb>ing in the middle of the road among the people, and Mr. Reeve said to one of the policemen, "Take that girl into custody, she is Mr. Jones's servant"—the policeman said he could not do it—Mr. Reeve said, Then watch her well, because when we take Mr. Jones we shall search his house," and he was pointing to our bouse, at the same time saying "That is a house that property is concealed in; they have stolen property"—he said this in the presence of all the people—I believe he only rang the bell once while I was there—they were walking about the Broadway and the street till I do not know how late—I myself put on a white jacket, and went among them—I do not think they knew me—they remained there till very late in the evening—Mr. Reeve was stopping every omnibus that passed—I do not know whether the policemen interfered so much, but Reeve, Chamberlain, and Fuller ran to look at every omnibus, and was stopping them while they were passing—I did not hear them make any inquiries—this was on a Saturday—I think I had been to Westminster Hall that morning about Mr. Jones's action—that was the day on which Mr. Jones's trial had been appointed for the 23rd—I went to the Kensington Police Court on the Monday following, and saw Mr. Jones there, in custody, on some charge—I do not recollect whether I saw any of the defendants there then—I think the hearing was adjourned till the Wednesday—I went again on Wednesday</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you get a waistcoat out of the Bankrupt's estate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was on the 20th of April, and to show how little I must have had pre<lb></lb>viously to do with it, I was down in Tenterden in Kent, and did not re<lb></lb>turn for many months—every thing I had to do with the bankrupt was previous to the 20th of April—I had no acquaintance with him—I did not think it odd that he should give me a waistcoat—he was at my father's house, and was boasting that a Mr. Pearson, a purveyor to the Queen, had given him a piece of stuff which the Queen had had a dressing gown made of, and he offered me a piece of it for a waistcoat—I liked the idea of having something which the Queen had worn, and I accepted it—I believe he said it had been made by a Scotch pedlar, that the Queen had greatly admired it, and had a piece of—it was about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—he said that <hi rend="italic">Mr.</hi> Pearson had given it to him on opening his shop as a sort of <hi rend="italic">deckoy duck,</hi> or something very grand to be in the window, something very attractive—I also had another waistcoat at the same time of exactly the same pattern, but another colour—I was measured in his house—I was only asked about one before the Bankruptcy Court—I could not answer what I was not asked—Mr. Reeve asked me, "Have you a waistcoat of the bankrupt's?"—I said, "Yes"—had he said "two" I should have said yes—I did not go there to conceal anything—the waistcoats were made by a tailor who he said he know could make them well, and I paid Mr. ful<lb></lb>sler for them—I did not in my examination before the Bankruptcy Court detail the conversation I had with Mr. Reeve at the hospital—I told Mr. Reeve I had made a note of matters that had occurred between us in talking that I thought then did not concern the question, but I had made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190028"></xptr>
               <p>a note of it afterwards—I did not, on Mr. Reeve further questioning me, say that it had nothing to do with it, and therefore I would state it—I did not answer in that way—I said, "Other circumstances occurred between us, the import of which has nothing to do with this, consequently I shall not now state it, but on arriving home I wrote down all I recol<lb></lb>lected of the conversation"—I stated but very little of what I have said to<lb></lb>day—everything was put in question and answer, and I could not go into things not asked me—I swear that the two waistcoats was all the property that ever came into my possession from the bankrupt's estate—to the best of my knowledge I never had any other property of the bankrupt's at any other time—I cannot think of any thing else—I firmly believe I never had—I cannot give a stronger answer—I do not consider I am bound to swear positively, but I am certain I had not—the next day I was off by the coach to Tenterden, and I never heard anything more of the parties till I returned some months afterwards—I left on the 20th of April—it was before the bankruptcy that I had these waistcoats—I did not think I was doing wrong in accepting them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not the day before you went to Tenterden, that you took away the goods in the cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I have never admitted that I took goods—I took some linen for Mrs. Fuller, who was coming to our house to visit, and I believe some books—I went on that occasion to fetch my waistcoat home—I had only known Fuller for two or three days then—I did not go there to breakfast, but breakfast being on the table they asked me to take some.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father, at Hammersmith. I knew Mr. and Mra. Fuller, who kept the shop in Regent-street—they came to stop at my father's house at the time Mr. Chamberlain put his execution into Fuller's house—Mr. Chamberlain lived at Hammersmith, near my father's house—we were in the habit of seeing Chamberlain, and were in<lb></lb>timate with him—Mr. Jones was a visitor at my father's house—I heard Mr. Chamberlain tell Mr. Jones, if there was any thing in the sale he wished to purchase, he might request Mr. Bingham to put a value on them, and he should take them at his valuation, he should be perfectly satisfied, as it would save him the auction-duty; or, if he preferred it, to buy in for him what he liked, and he might take them at the price he bought them at—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when Mr. Jones gave Mr. Chamberlain Mr. Bingham's account of the sales, at my father's house—Fuller was not lodging there at that time—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when Mr. Chamberlain returned it, he told Mr. Jones Mr. Bingham had valued some of the things at more than they were worth—he asked for a pen and ink, and altered the price of some of them, and said to Mr. Jones, "There is a little marble slab, I should like it if you have no objection; it would make a nice bracket for me to put be<lb></lb>tween the windows"—Mr. Jones said, "You shall have it whenever you like to send your servant for it"—I was present when Chamberlain requested Mr. Jones to pay his man Hoad two weeks' wages, and to discharge him—he was to desire the man to pack up whatever articles were left about the house, also the things left for his convenience, he wished to have them removed, as he did not like to pay another quarter's rent—this was the litter end of September, just before quarter-day—I remember Chamberlain was at our house when Mr. Jones returned from town, and called at my lather's house, and in my presence he gave Chamberlain a pair of snuffers and tray, saying, that Hoad had sent them from Regent-street—he told him he had discharged the man, and the man would send the other things down that day or the next; they were to come by Brown, the carrier—some things came down by the carrier, and, I understand from Mr. Chamberlain's servant, they were left at Mr. Jones's house by mistake—we were taking tea at Mr. Chamberlain's, and the servant came and said they were left, by the carrier's mistake, at Mr. Jones's, and Mr. Chamberlain sent the servant's brother for them, and he brought them from Mr. Jones's—I had two mouseline-de-laine dresses from Regent-street—they were brought by Mr. Jones at my request—it was some time in April, 1841—I had them made up, and my dress-maker's bill is dated the 19th of May—I had them previous to that date—I wore them nearly all last summer—Fuller saw me wear them repeatedly, and Cham<lb></lb>berlain also—I have drank tea at Chamberlain's house in them, and they have drank tea at our house; and on one occasion Fuller said the pink dress would not wash, but the other would wash like a piece of calico—speaking of them as dresses which he knew—this was in Mrs. Juller's presence—I had the dress on, and Fuller said, "My wife's blue dress, of the same pattern as that pink, will not wash, but the drab one will. like a piece of calico"—my dresses were drab and pink—I think I had the pink one on, but he has seen me in the drab one repeatedly—the drab one was produced before the Magistrate at Kensington, in June last—</p>

               <p>that is one of the articles Mr. Jones was charged with stealing—on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of January my father's house was searched—Mr. Reeve, Mr. Fuller and a messenger from the Bankruptcy Court, were present—these dresses were in the house then—Fuller took a piece of the drab one away with him—he did not take the dress—I was examined at the Bankruptcy Court—I believe it was on the 12th of January, by Reeve—a china pomatum-pot was shown to me there, as one taken from Mr. Jones's house—that was the first time I had seen it—I was only examined once, but was in attend<lb></lb>ance there from, I think, half-past twelve o'clock till three, or after—the china pot there was under my observation during that time—when I was in attendance at Kensington, in June, a china pot was produced before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate—it was not the one I saw in the Bankruptcy Court, but it was one of the articles Mr. Jones was charged with stealing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two papers</hi>)—I have not seen these before—Mr. Jones requested me to call on Cham<lb></lb>berlain, and ask him to return two memorandums he had given him for the purpose of showing to Mrs. Chamberlain—I called at his house in the morning, and in the afternoon, but he was not at home; but I met him, and asked him to return the two memorandums Mr. Jones had given him to show Mrs. Chamberlain, to satisfy her—Chamberlain said he had got the me<lb></lb>morandums, and he should keep them; that Mr. Jones had refused to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and that they were given to satisfy his wife, because he did not wish her to know he owed him so much money—he said he never would pay Mr. Jones a farthing of what he owed him; he knew he owed him more than 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he would never pay him a sixpence—I cannot state the exact date of this conversation—I think it was either the 7th, 8th, or 9th of December—it was in the early part of December, 1841, and he said he might get it as he could, he had nothing to show for it—he said Mr. Jones had received about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, but Mr. Jones had paid and lent him the amount of above 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made him so particular to inform you of all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked how he could act in that shameful manner towards Mr. Jones, who had acted as a friend to him, letting him have money when he wanted it and he had not a shilling to help himself—he said, "Jones has refused to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I hope he will live to want it, I will never pay him"—I said, "Mr. Chamberlain, you forget what money I have seen Mr. Jones lend you"—he said, "Oh, as to you, Miss Lawrence, I will take care you shall never prove any thing."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the conversation with Chamberlain, did it not strike you to say, "Why, you have acknowledged to me you owe him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in this conversa<lb></lb>tion?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He knew I knew he had acknowledged it—I said, "After you have made this acknowledgment to me, Mr. Chamberlain, do you mean to say you will go into Court, and swear you don't owe him the money?"—I told him I could prove what he owed Mr. Jones—he said, "I owe him above 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has had about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, but the rest he shall never receive from me"—I know nothing of Mr. Jones saying he only owed him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he brought the action for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he might dis<lb></lb>charge himself as he thought proper—Mr. Jones never said so to me—I have purchased goods out of Fuller's shop—I have no bills of parcels of any kind—I never receive a bill of any kind when I go to a draper's shop—I look at it, and leave it on the counter—I do not know a draper in town,—the first Article I bought at Fuller's shop was sixteen yards of satinet, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have no bill for it, because I was dining at Mr. Fuller's—I did not go there to purchase any thing—Mr. Fuller brought me a satinet dress and scarf, and said he would let me have it at the wholesale price—I said I did not come prepared to purchase, and did not know that my father would let me have it—I took it home that night, and it has been paid for—Mr. Jones paid, and I repaid Mr. Jones—I purchased the dress I have on at Fuller's—it is the sixteen yards of satinet—I bought a black satinet scarf and the dress together—I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the scarf—I had a beaver shawl, but I ought to explain how it was; the next day I dined at Fuller's, he brought a square beaver shawl, and said, "Miss Lawrence, I have brought some<lb></lb>thing to show you, it is quite new, I intend you to have half of it, and Mrs. Fuller the other half"—I said, "What is the price?"—he said, "That is of no consequence"—I said I should not take it, and he-afterwards sent it by Mr. Jones, who paid him a sovereign for it afterwards, and I repaid him, the day I had the shawl, the day Mr. and Mrs. Fuller drove down his phae<lb></lb>ton to fetch us to dine with him—Mrs. Fuller went up with me to dress, and she said, "Miss Lawrence, I have brought you a present of black lace" and I took it—previous to that I had given Mrs. Fuller some presents of bottles of preserves and currants—she brought me seven or eight yards of black lace—I mentioned that at the Bankruptcy Court—she told me it was French lace, but my friends, who have seen it, say it is Nottingham—I am not a judge of the value—it might be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" a yard—I did not go about Mr. Jones's dressing-gown—the very evening Fuller came I asked him to let me have another yard of the stuff—Mr. Jones had bought some to make two dressing-gowns—I asked Fuller to let me have a yard, as it would be a nice thing for my father—I did not go to the shop for the purpose—it was the day Fuller fetched us to dine with him—I did not get any curtains from Fuller—he left a set of curtains at our house, and requested me to</p>

There was a marble slab in the house—it was used to put on the top of the grate, to keep the soot from falling down—I have often seen Mr. Chamberlain at master's house—he came about the latter end of last summer—he took up his cane and said, "Mr. Jones, what a pity it is for you to have this marble to catch the soot on; I wish you would let me have it back again"—Mr. Jones said, "Yes, you can have it when you like to send for it"—I remember a china pomatum pot in master's house—I missed it about last January—at that time some parties came and searched master's house—I have seen it as long as I have lived there, which is three years—I should know it again—I did not see it at Ken<lb></lb>sington—I know Edmund Hooper, the brother of Chamberlain's servant—Brown, the carrier, had brought an umbrella-stand and some things to Mr. Jones's house by mistake—Hooper came to inquire about them the same day—I gave him two cushions, a bag, an umbrella-stand, and some sheets—I gave him all the things Brown had left, but the marble slab, as I heard master say he was going to have the slab down; I put it on the grate—Chamberlain's house is not far from Mr. Jones's—I saw Hooper take them into Chamberlain's house—I remember, on a Saturday in last June, Reeve, Fuller, and Chamberlain coming to master's house about five o'clock in the evening—I was standing at the gate—Reeve came first, and asked if Mr. Jones was at home—I said no—he then asked if I would let them in—I said no, I was not going to let anybody into mas<lb></lb>ter's house when he was out—I did not know whether they were thieves or robbers—Chamberlain was on the other side, waiting opposite—he went on while Reeve came and spoke to me—Reeve tapped me on the shoulder and said, "You are very right in standing up for your master—he said he came for some stolen property that was in the house—when I was going down the town Reeve and Fuller followed me—(I did not know where master was)—they were walking in the Broadway—they brought a policeman, and Fuller told him to take me—he did not say why—Reeve was with him, and heard what he said—the policeman declined—Fuller turned round, pointed to Lawrence's house, and said, "That is the house where the stolen property is"—Reeve was then standing with him—a great many people were then assembled about Lawrence's house—it was said loud enough for anybody to hear fuller said he meant to settle my master this time for they were determined to transport him—reeve was present then—fuller told the policeman to look well that he might know me, and to watch me well on sunday, that I might not go away<lb></lb>he said they meant to come on monday and take me, and they meant to take was</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190046"></xptr>
               <p>premises in Regent-street, for which, in the previous November I had paid a premium of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an annual rental of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had a stock worth 1800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., furniture worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and expended 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upward in additions; I had credit everywhere, money at my banker's, and at bright prospects of doing well as any man. From the detail I am about to lay before you, you will find much to condemn; perhaps, for myself, little to pity. Messrs. Saunders and Woolly were employed by me to make the decorations; I gave acceptances for their debt, and had a right to expect they would be met, having to receive a considerable sum from Chamber<lb></lb>lain, my father-in-law; the loan was postponed on account of some delay in completing the sale of the estate, and my acceptances were dishonored; I explained to Mr. Saunders my situation, and he had such an opinion of my honesty as a tradesman, and my faith as a man, that he was content to forego any further security, relying on the character I had earned by yean of honest servitude. In April, 1841, I received from Chamberlain 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was rather less than the sum I had been led to expect, and it was accompa<lb></lb>nied by a demand that I should give a warrant of attorney; perhaps it was right to require it, but it was unexpected on my part, and this, accompa<lb></lb>nied by a diminution in the loan, led to a quarrel; I was unable to take up the acceptances, and on the 6th of April, 1841, I was served with I writ and demand of payment within twenty-one days; it was the first and last writ I ever received; I was astounded and knew not what to do, and in an evil hour I went to Mr. Lawrence, of Grove-cottage, whom I had known in my early days, to seek advice how to act; I told him my case; on the following day Miss Lawrence came to my bouse, and said she had a friend, a gentleman to whom she was engaged, a barrister, who would see me safely through the matter, and no money out of pocket. Can it be won<lb></lb>dered that inexperienced and embarrassed as I was, I should gladly accept such an offer? securing, as I thought, the services of an eminent barrister, the nephew of Mr. Alley—little did I then know that he was an attorney's clerk. I was introduced to this friend, who was to set all ray difficulties straight—it was Mr. Jones, the prosecutor—I am precluded, from my situa<lb></lb>tion, from giving evidence on oath, but in the presence of God, before whose bar I must one day appear, I solemnly assert, that the first thing this man tried to persuade me to do was to get my brother Charles to declare he had been served with a process instead of me; as, however, he could not per<lb></lb>suade me to this, he stated he would hit on another plan, whereby Saonden and Woolley should be defeated, at the same time telling me my scruples were ridiculous, and that such things were done daily. How was it, you will say, that I did not at once repudiate not only the advice but the ad<lb></lb>viser?—well, indeed, would it have been for me, had I done so; but those only placed in commercial embarrassment can estimate the difficulties that surround a man, and make him listen to any mode which he hopes may serve him. It was then suggested that I should give a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to an auctioneer, a friend of his, who should strike a friendly docket, and carry me safely through; as, however, I felt some diffidence in placing my<lb></lb>self in the hands of a stranger, it was arranged that I should write to my father, give him a bill of exchange, and that he should strike a docket on it; this was on the 12th; on the Friday after my father had an internet with Mr. Reeve; from that Monday Mr. Lawrence and his daughter were constantly at my house, dined at my table, and on each evening carried away some articles from my shop, the old gentleman saying Lucy might take what</p>

               <p>she pleased, and pay me when my troubles were over. On Saturday the 17th, Jones came to my house from the country; he said Mr. Chamber<lb></lb>lain would put an execution in next Monday, and begged me to pack up some things which he could take away and secure for us; on that occasion he took a yellow painted box full of goods, among others two mousse line-de<lb></lb>laine dresses, various little articles of the toilet, also some curtains, both damask and muslin; on the following day, April the 18th, I saw him at Mr. Lawrence's house; he then stated that he had ascertained that Chamberlain's execution was not so much to be feared, as the docket being struck by Walters and Reeve, and advised me to secure so much of my stock as would enable me to start in business again; my scruples were overruled by Mr. Law<lb></lb>rence, who said it was of every day's occurrence; he instanced several per<lb></lb>sons who had followed the same plan, and were now worth several thousand pounds, and said that my credit would be better than ever. I was beguiled by his advice, seconded by the arts of Jones, and I executed the fatal deed on the following day. On Monday, the 19th, Charles Lawrence break<lb></lb>fasted at my house, and afterwards removed upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property at one swoop; silks, satins, and costly shawls, in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the account now in possession of the solicitors to the fiat, and which, I declare, I received from Jones himself, charges me with the very <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire on that day which conveyed away my property; about twelve o'clock on that day Chamberlain put in his execution. On the 29th April, early in the morn<lb></lb>ing, Jones told me in a great hurry that Walters and Reeve had obtained execution against me, and I must leave my house, or I should be put in priaon; I was then entirely under his control, I implicitly believed what be told me, and I left my house, never to return to it—yes, within sit months of my expending 1187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the premises, without anything to induce my departure but the lies of this Mr. Jones, I was frightened away from my house, and became a broken man. I have since ascertained, and if it is needed it can be proved, that his statement was utterly false; that Messrs. Walters and Reeve had no judg<lb></lb>ment against me, and that this was a mere pretext to get me away from my house, and leave my valuable property to his plunder. Previous, however, to this, my father had returned to town; an old stamp was supplied by Jones, and a note of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by my father on me, was executed at the Burton coffee-house, in Cheap side; a docket was struck on this; the act of bankruptcy being, that Jones and my father should go and knock at my front-door, inquire if I was at home, and that this should be denied. Jones and my father having parted from me in my par<lb></lb>lour, went through my shop, and knocked at my private door; as previously instructed, one of my young men, named Preston, denied me; they then gravely passed through the shop again, and returned to my parlour, laugh<lb></lb>ing heartily at the forms of law; they then went to the Bankrupt-office, and struck the docket; when my father returned, he told me how Jones had ken puzzled to describe himself, and that at last he had put himself down as clerk to Mr. Eden; which, he said, he supposed was some <hi rend="italic">humbug,</hi> Previous to that, I believed him to be a barrister, and a person of fortune, and was disposed the more implicitly to place myself under his control. I can ask myself now, how I could be such a fool? but I used to listen to the stories of this man and of his grand relatives, and little knew his <hi rend="italic">real history.</hi> On one occasion he wished me to dine with him at the Temple-hall, where, he said, champagne would be flowing in quantities;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190048"></xptr>
               <p>he was previously aware that I was engaged; he afterwards taid his health had been drunk by the Solicitor-General; he pointed out house in Hammersmith, which he said belonged to him; and was believed by myself and family to be a person of great importance; and the assurances of Mr. Lawrence and his daughter, that he was a man of fortune, induced me to place myself in his hands, and to plunge myself into that vortex by which I have been brought to destruction. I left my house on the 29th of April, and then went for a short time to old Mr. Lawrence's; I was there three days, with the bulk of my property, there concealed, and I then removed, by Jones's desire, to Manchester; while there, I saw in the papers that Walters and Reeve had got a fiat against me. I was asto. nished, and so was my father. We had been assured by Jones that hit fiat would prevent any other proceedings. I returned to town, and, by Jones's advice, it was arranged that I should be introduced to some soli<lb></lb>citor in the City, whose name would carry some weight, and support me in passing my examination—he pitched on Mr. Alderman Wood; an in<lb></lb>troduction was effected, I know not how; I saw the Alderman, and my balance-sheet, sketched out by old Mr. Lawrence and Jones, was laid before him; he took care never to let me see the Alderman alone. I understand now how it was that I was never trusted by myself. I begged Jones to allow me to restore the goods to Walters and Reeve. I said, now, as his fiat had failed and been set aside, the goods had better be given up to the creditors. Mr. Lawrence, Miss Lawrence, and Mr. Jones, prevented this; my scruples were ridiculed; and when I said it would be perjury to pass such accounts as sketched out by him, he said, for that matter, all bankrupts did it; he mentioned instances that he had knows, of men who had property concealed, and were afterwards successful in business; and when this seemed to have no effect, Miss Lawrence flung herself on the sofa in hysterics, exclaiming, that they had done all they could to serve me, and now I should get them all transported; (I should have mentioned that Miss Lawrence herself is half an attorney; with ber own hand she engrossed the affidavits in support of the fiat; she, Jones, myself, and my brother Charles's wife, met at Mr. Charles Anslip's apartments, and there she took as active and energetic a part as Jones him<lb></lb>self; that affidavit is now in the Court of Review; I have seen it; it would have gpne to Mr. Anslip's stationers, but there was not sufficient time;) at length I consented; I appeared before the Court, and passed my accounts; now his snares were completed, and his victim wsi secured—what mattered it to Mr. Jones and the Lawrence. however I re<lb></lb>sisted? I had sworn to my accounts—my property was then, and is now, in their possession. Jones had been hitherto dressed so shabbily, that it was the subject of remark; but "he is an eccentric man," was the explanation; now he makes a different appearance. Miss Lawrence, who, until then appeared dressed very plainly, suddenly appeared dressed in satins, the plunder of my creditors; while the very body-linen of my wife, taken out of kindness, as she said, was, without scruple, appropriated to her own person; my suspicions that they meant to leave me in the lurch were ex<lb></lb>cited by this. A short time afterwards I encountered a younger sister of Miss Lawrence's in the streets of St. Ives, and recognized on her shoulders a valuable shawl of mine, which I say plainly was and is stolen from my creditors; I had never sold it. I mentioned it to several parties with me; I gave information to Walters and Reeve, the solicitors to the fiat: they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190049"></xptr>
               <p>have written to Mr. John Lawrence, of St. Ives, charging his sister with being in possession of goods stolen from my estate; and all the explana<lb></lb>tion they could obtain from him was, that if I chose to subpoena any of the family, and pay their expenses, they would come up; when I have not a farthing in the world. In September, 1841, part of the goods were sent to my father's, in a box removed by Jones; it arrived apparently in the same condition, but, on opening it, a mousse line-de-lain dress had been removed; and a little china pot, a present to my wife in her childwood valued on that account; these form this subject of the first count in the indictment; these articles were missed, and again until found in the houses of Miss Lawrence and Mr. Jones. I most solemnly assert that they were removed from the box given to Jones, and taken away from my house on Saturday, 17th of April; I missed them immediately I opened the box; my wife was angry at finding them gone, but I said she must say nothing; we were in Jones's hands, and could not complain of the loss of such trifles; as, however, I had, as I believed, from 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods still re<lb></lb>maining in his hands, I sent to him to inquire what his demand against me was; his letters are now open to your inspection. I afterwards met him, and said if he would give me what goods he had I would give them to Messrs. Walters and Reeve, and never disclose to them what part he had acted in the matter; he laughed at me, and at length plainly said, that if I dared to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> it should be my ruin; he, perhaps, might get a short im<lb></lb>prisonment, bull that the assignees should never get their goods, and they would be sure to proceed, and transport myself and him. I made the only reparation in my power; I went to Mr. Alderman Wood, and told him all; by his advice I went to Messrs. Walters and Reeve—I confessed all that had been done, and, as they can bear me witness, without making any sti<lb></lb>pulations for myself as to mercy. I made a statement and signed it, leaving myself entirely in their hands; the consequence was that search warrants were obtained; the houses of Miss Lawrence and Mr. Jones were searched: in the former were the remnants of property once con<lb></lb>cealed; but in the latter, the house was filled with furniture that had once been mine. This Mr. Jones, professing to be a barrister and a man of for<lb></lb>tune, turned out to be the resident of a small cottage, value about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and the costly furniture which once decorated my premises in Re<lb></lb>gent-street, was there discovered; in the bed-room I recognized my door mat, and several other articles equally out of place, and the china pot was in the cupboard. As to the examination that took place by the solicitors to the fiat, that will speak for itself; and if, as men of business, you can read the examinations of Mr. Jones and Miss Lawrence and say that they are inno<lb></lb>cent, then I must submit to your verdict, only saying, that in this case vice would be triumphant. It may be as well to state that Mr. Jones, when be obtained this true bill against me, and got process on it, dared to appear at the house of Mr. Chamberlain at half past ten o'clock at night; my wife and Mrs. Chamberlain were preparing for bed, partly undressed, they were dragged to the station, Mr. Jones, accompanied by four policemen, personally superintending their capture; and he even dared to come to my house clad in my own clothes, the plunder of my wardrobe; I taxed him with it, and he did not, and dared not, deny it. I am charged with endeavoring to injure the character of Mr. Jones; if either he or Miss Lawrence had had a character, I should not now be standing at your bar but should have been a respectable tradesman, a respected master,</p>

               <p>and, I am sure, a prosperous man. Much was said yesterday by Mr. Bodkin about the indictment for perjury preferred against me by Mr. Jones. I am glad he did so, as it affords me an opportunity of account<lb></lb>ing for the delay which took place between the search warrants in January and the proceedings in June. I accidentally heard that I had been in<lb></lb>dicted; (in fact, I saw one of the Grand jury;) I knew not by whom, I fan<lb></lb>cied it was by my creditors; and until a copy of the indictment could be obtained I went to Ostend, having a cousin there, who keeps the English hotel; I was there three weeks, and a copy of the indictment was for<lb></lb>warded to me, and when I found that the two witnesses against me were Mr. Jones and Miss Lawrence, I returned instated, and walked the streets of London for months. Mr. Jones never intended to indict me for a shilling; I was still in the same apartment where he once called, and where one of his let<lb></lb>ters was addressed, No. 5, Waruick-court, Hol born. Mr. Jones told me that the creditors would take no proceedings against him until I had given them the opportunity of testing the truth of his statement by putting him into the witness box. I had no funds; I could not raise enough to defend my<lb></lb>self; I told Mr. Reeve that I was ready and anxious to be tried; I ob<lb></lb>tained an order for the <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> by Mr. Reeve's advice; I met my trial, and knowing myself to be perfectly innocent, gave Jones the opportunity of clearing his character. The indictment for perjury was under proceed<lb></lb>ings in bankruptcy; it became necessary, therefore, that the fiat should be proved; this could only be done by Mr. Reeve, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> prevent any <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> or pretext for Jones saying that the case failed on technical grounds, Mr. Reeve served the notice that I would take my trial personally at once, and gave him a pledge that any evidence which was necessary from his office, as solicitor to the fiat, should be forthcoming; he did this with my full knowledge, consent, and wish, for I was as anxious as he could be that the case should be tried fairly and openly on its merits, Mr. Jones called at Mr. Reeve's office the following day, and said he wished him to write him a letter; Mr. Reeve immediately sent the following letter; notice to pro<lb></lb>duce the original has been served on Mr. Jones, and the copy can be proved:—"Sir, I can have nothing to write to you about; to prevent any pretence for the case against George Fuller breaking down oo technical points, I give you notice that I will take care that any witness you require from our office shall be forthcoming, and that the residence of any others whom you may require shall be furnished, if known to us. I write this to prevent any mistake; the cause is entered on Monday—it stands No. 2. To Mr. T. A. Jones, 12, Villiers-street, Strand." Now, will it be believed, that on preparing for my trial at great expense, on the case being called on, Jones slunk out of Court, and it turned out that he had issued a <hi rend="italic">cer<lb></lb>tiorari,</hi> and this was his pretended anxiety to vindicate his character. This happened on Tuesday, the 14th of June. Mr. Reeve then said, "Now I have put you and Jones to the test, he is afraid of the encounter, and I believe all that you have told me. The same week a warrant was obtained against Jones, as deposed to by Mr. Clive, so that the delay which had occurred was not five months, but three days, and the statement that that had anything to do with the trial of Mr. Chamberlain is false. Mr. Reeve can prove what I have said is all true, and that so far from Chamberlain and myself being friends as soon as Jones commenced his ridiculous action against me, we were not even on speaking terms when Jones and the Lawrences' houses were searched—he can prove that all the proceedings of the assignees had been totally irrespective of Chamberlain,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190051"></xptr>
               <p>and that so far from his having anything to do with them, he never ap<lb></lb>peared in the case but when compelled. The china pot, which there has been so much said about, was never produced at the Bankruptcy Court at all on any occasion. Mr. Reeve sent a person out of court for it; it was in my possession; Mr. Reeve allowed Mrs. Fuller to reserve it; the other articles produced were all marked by Mr. Commissioner Merivale as ex<lb></lb>hibits; the mousseline-de-laine dresses were only bought a short time pre<lb></lb>viously; the black ground one I bought of Messrs. James and Co., of Friday-street, they cost me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each; is it likely I should sell them for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? No article ever left my shop to any customer without a bill being made and examined by a young man, and it was always stamped by the cashier in the books; the official assignees possess every book of mine. and the receipts show no such account; I most solemnly declare that they were never paid for.</p>

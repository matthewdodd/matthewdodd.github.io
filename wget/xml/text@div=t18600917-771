                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and keep a shop—I reside at 16, New-street, Dorset-square—I think this affair took place on the morning of 23d August last—I had fastened up my shop the night before, it was all quite safe—my attention was called to it in the morning—I saw it safe at 11 o'clock the night before—from a knocking at the door I came down into my shop on the morning of the 23d, some time before 6 o'clock—the door of the shop into the street was open, and also a kind of trap-door through which the shutters are passed—it is a circular window, and at the lower part of the window there are two small doors that take the width of the window; the shutters are kept under there during the day—if a man gets through that he could get into the shop, and then he could open the shop door—the bolt of this trap-door was inside—it had been forced—I bave seen the articles contained in this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my property—the handkerchief is mine that they are wrapped in—this bag is also mine—they are all my property—they were perfectly safe in my shop on the night before this door was broken into.</p>

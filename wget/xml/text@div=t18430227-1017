                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 91.) I saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning on the 17th of Feb. in Grove-end-road, St. John's-wood, going towards the Eyre Arms tavern. He turned and came back—he had this lead tied in this handkerchief under his arm—I asked what he had got; he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "You have slates, have you not?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "You have either lead or copper with it"—he said, "Lead, man, lead," and that he was going to take it to Mr. Ponsford's, in Grosvenor-square—he then said he fetched it from there last night, and took it to his lodging in Henry-street, Portland-town—I then took him to the station, and found in the bundle these eight pieces of lead—when put together they form one piece—it weighs 29lbs.—I went to an unfinished house at the back of the Eyre-arms, and found some lead gone—Mr. Brown was there, and identified this lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John's Wood-terrace. I have the care of a house in an unfinished state at the back of the Eyre Arms—on the 17th of Feb. I went to the house and found the policeman there—I looked over the house and missed this piece of lead from the water-closet—it had not been fixed—I saw it there the day before—I know it because I had had both the edges of it planed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Being unemployed I had been round by the Eyre Arms the day before; I came down towards Lowdon's-road, and I saw a man coming out with a basket, which appeared heavy; he shot it at the end of a heap in the street; I saw him cover something over, as if to conceal it; I thought I would wait and see what he had got, and I found these pieces of lead; I put them in my apron and buried them in a heap of sand; in the morning I went and got them.</p>

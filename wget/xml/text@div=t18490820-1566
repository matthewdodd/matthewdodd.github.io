                  </hi>. I am a bonnet-shape manufacturer at 1, Somerset-place, Hoxton—the prisoner has been my foreman some time—I placed great confidence in him—he had the whole range of the house, and gave out the different articles to the work-people—I had paper on my pre<lb></lb>mises of the same kind as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he could have access to it—it was kept in the shop he worked in—I used more of it than I could account for—no one else has had the giving of it out but him for the last three months—he had no right to have paper of mine of that description at his house—I firmly believe this to be mine—there is no mark upon it—it is such as I had on my premises—on 10th July I went with Morrell and Zinzan to the prisoner's house—Morrell said, "I have come to search for a quantity of property belonging to Mr. Osborne"—the prisoner said, "I am innocent; I know nothing about it"—we searched two back rooms, one on the first and one on the second-floor—he said they were the only rooms he had—we found these sixteen sheets of pink, and these twenty-two sheets of blue tissue<lb></lb>paper, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I went with Zinzan, and told the prisoner I was going to take him for being concerned with others in robbing Mr. Osborne, and I must search his place—he said he knew nothing about it, he was innocent—I found this paper in a cupboard down-stairs—I asked him how many rooms he had—he said two—I afterwards went there when he was in custody, and bis wife showed me into a third room—I was not in search of paper in particular, but for property of Mr. Osborne's.</p>

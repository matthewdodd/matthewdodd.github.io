               <p>Q. How long were you and this sailor drinking at this public-house - A. He went out about five minutes before me; I told him I would not be long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was; I went out to go home; the prisoner asked me for the watch out of my bosom; he was in the public-house, and saw the sailor give it me; when he demanded the watch I asked him what he wanted with it. I said it did not belong to him; I would not give it him; the sailor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140047"></xptr>sailor gave it me for safety Feeret was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you going to his lodging - A. No, he was going to mine. I refused giving him the watch; the prisoner took hold of me and kicked me down in the kennel, and took the watch out of my bosom; then Mr. Turnbridge came up and took us both to the watchhouse. Mr. Turnbridge took the watch from the prisoner; he has kept it ever since.</p>

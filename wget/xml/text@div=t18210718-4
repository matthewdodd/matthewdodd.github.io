            . On the 11th of June, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I was coming from Islington to the City, and observed the prisoner by the side of the New-river loitering about with another person, they were making motions, I suspected them, and watched them for a quarter of an hour. I saw them go to No. 10, Ashley-row, and look through the blinds, they then came back, and then went to another house, a baker came and they did nothing there. I went on the opposite side of the river, and looked through a large tree, I was about a hundred yards off. I could see that they were the same persons I saw before, I saw one of them open the window at No. 4, one of the two got in, I do not know which of them - the window was down before, I saw them lift it up, and one got in and brought out a writing desk, and a bundle, he gave it out of the window to the other, who took them while he got out, an apron was over the desk, they went down to the river, and crossed Canonbury-fields, I followed them at a distance behind, one carried the bundle and the other the desk, they shifted by turns, and went to the Rosemary Branch, I kept them in sight, and followed them to Queen-street, I saw Morgan, and pointed them out to him, I then went for a constable. They then had the desk and bundle. I returned, with a constable, and Morgan took the prisoner - he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain of him - A. Yes; the window was such a distance I could not distinguish which went in, but I am certain of them. The one who stood outside had his back towards me.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. I was at the corner of Queen-street, Pitfield-street, Hoxton, the last witness pointed the prisoner and another lad out to me. The prisoner had a bundle, and the other a writing-desk. I followed them into Old-street-road, the prisoner then took the desk and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180006"></xptr>the other the bundle, they turned down Charlotte-street, I sent the last witness for a constable, and continued to follow them to Willow-walk, where there is a court, leading to several other courts; and I thought I would take one, I said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" and laid hold of him. He said a writing-desk, which the other offered him 1 s. to carry - the other had ran off. I said, I must take him, he immediately threw the desk in my face, it was covered with an apron. I gave him in charge with the bundle - it was a small one.</p>

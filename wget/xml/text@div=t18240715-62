            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of July, about three o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner shut in the privy of a court, which is not a thoroughfare, and within two minutes walk of Umpleby's house - he said he lodged at Mr. Johnson's, just by; that he had been out late, and they were gone to bed, but as a lodger was coming out at four o'clock, and he could then get in, he did not wish to disturb them; he begged of me to let him stop there; and his appearance being decent I did not object. I went round at half-past three, and he was gone. I saw him in custody on the same day; he was then in a different dress. I went to Johnson's and found the dress which he had on when he was in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. Not to my knowledge. When he was in custody I recollected seeing him somewhere, but could not recollect where, his dress being altered, but remembered at last and said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, I spoke to you in the privy in Round-court; he said,</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Bloomsbury. On the 2d of July, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought two table spoons to pawn for 1 l.; he said they were his own, that he lived in Well-street, Drury-lane. I had received notice of this robbery, and said I suspected they were stolen, and must detain him - he made no answer. I told my brother to look after him while I went for the street-keeper - my brother not understanding me let him go; he ran from the shop when I came back, and turned up some of the back streets - we followed, and secured him in Bosiers-court, Tottenham Court-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the person who came to your shop - A. Quite. I lost sight of him in turning the corners.</p>

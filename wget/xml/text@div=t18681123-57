                  </hi>. I live at 12, Crown Court, Glasshouse Street—on the Saturday night previous to the 7th November, I was in Leman Street—I had been drinking too much—I had six or seven shillings in my waistcoat pocket, in a purse—I was knocked down by somebody, and my pocket torn out—my money was taken away—some of it fell on the pavement—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was afterwards picked up close to me—I called out, and a policeman came up—I did not notice anyone with the prisoner.</p>

On Saturday night, the 7th November, about 12 o'clock, I was in Leman Street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I ran to the spot, and saw the prisoner standing over the pro<lb></lb>secutor, in a stooping position—the prosecutor was on the ground—the prisoner was shaking him about, as if he was tearing his clothes—he was crying out—when the prisoner saw me he let go of the prosecutor and came up towards me—he was dropping the money as he came along—I afterwards picked up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took him into custody, and asked him what he was doing—he said, "Nothing"—I asked him what he was drop<lb></lb>ping the money for—he said he was not dropping any money—I took him to the station—the prosecutor came up and said he had been knocked down and robbed of his money—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—I told him I saw him standing over the prosecutor, and he said he did not—I searched him at the station, and found 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a purse, eight dupli<lb></lb>cates, and in his left trousers pocket this piece of cloth, which corresponds with a hole in the prosecutor's waistcoat—the prisoner said it came from his own waistcoat—I did not see anyone near except the prisoner.</p>

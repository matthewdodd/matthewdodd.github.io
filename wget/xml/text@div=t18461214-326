                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Lambeth. The prisoner lived with me—I spoke to her about a ring, which I missed from the looking-glass drawer—I had seen it safe a fortnight or three weeks before—she denied knowing anything about it, but afterwards she said she had found a ring on the floor, and given it to her mother—I went to her mother, and the officer found it.</p>

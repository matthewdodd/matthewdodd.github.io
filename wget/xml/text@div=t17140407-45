            </rs>. It appear'd by the Evidence, That Mr. Moor came to the Bar at the Horn and Horse shoe Tavern in Chancery-Lane, and enquir'd for one Mr. O Hara, who being there in Company with Mr. Plunket and several other Gentlemen, Mr. Moor went in, and Saluted the Company all round after a very friendly manner, but refus'd to sit down, or to drink, having drank very plentifully before. After mutual Salutations, he took Mr. Plunket aside, where they talk'd together a while, and then went out, and were gone sometime before the Company miss'd them, and concluded they were gone to Bed, it being past One of the Clock in the Morning; but some time after the Prisoner came in, and brought the Deceas'd Sword and Cane along with him, telling them he was afraid Mr. Moor was hurt. Bass, the Beadle of that part of the Parish, swore, That the Deceas'd call'd to him as he went along, and when he came to him, he found him bleeding very much, and led him home; and asking him how he came in that Condition, he told him 'twas an old Grudge, but would not say who did it. When he came to his Lodging, the Maid asking him where his Sword was, he said in Bream's Buildings, and told her likewise that one who ow'd him an old Grudge had paid him, but did not say who. Another Evidence depos'd, That the Deceas'd said he was barbarously us'd, the Prisoners Sword being in his Body before he was upon his Guard, his Cane hanging upon his Wrist at the same time. [Here the Beadle was call'd up again, and being ask'd whether it was light enough for one Man to see what another did at some distance, could not say it was.] Mr. Adrian Moor depos'd, That the day before he dy'd, the Deceas'd told him Mr. Plunket had done it; and Mr. Humphreys swore, That being at a Coffee house in the City, he saw the Prisoner; and asking him if he had heard of Mr. Moor's Misfortune of being wounded, he said Yes, and I am the Unfortunate Man that did it. By which Evidence it plainly appear'd the Prisoner did kill the Deceas'd. To prove it to be a premeditated Quarrel, some Witnesses appear'd, who swore that they fell out and fought together about 20 Months ago at the Swan Ale-house in the Butcher-row, and the Prisoner's Sword being broke, they parted; and others declar'd that Mr. Moor had divers times us'd very hard words against the Prisoner. Mr. Plunket, in his Defence, own'd that he had such a Skirmish with the Deceas'd, but that all was over, and reconcil'd long ago; to prove which, he brought several Witnesses, who declar'd that since that, and even a day or two before their last unhappy meeting, they had been extraordinary friendly, and us'd the most endearing expressions that could be to each other, and that the Prisoner had help'd the Deceas'd into several Causes, and once particularly favour'd him in the Court of Chancery, when by mistake he had made himself liable to a Penalty. As to the Crime for which he was indicted, he said. That the Deceas'd calling him out of the Tavern, they walk'd up Chancery-Lane together (he being in his way home) and the Deceas'd began to talk of a Bill of Costs to be paid by Sir

             in a Cause wherein he (the Prisoner) was concern'd, by which he fell into such a Passion, that he first struck him on the Head with his Cane, and afterwards drew his Sword; whereupon he drew his, and in parrying the Deceas'd got, his Wound; which was strengthen'd by a Witness who swore the Deceas'd, a little before he dy'd told him it was his own fault. He further prov'd, That as soon as he heard Mr. Moor was dead, he surrender'd himself to Mr. Justice Le Neve, and that he had never absconded from his Lodging during the whole time of his Illness. He also had a great many Persons of Distinction, who gave him the Character of a peaceable Man, and one readier to appease, than create Quarrels; and the Court summing up the Evidence in a very impartial and judicious Manner, the Jury brought him in <rs id="t17140407-45-verdict245" type="verdictDescription">

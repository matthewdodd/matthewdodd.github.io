               <p>What do you call working up? - Why for use; we have jobs at times, and I have occasion for a little plate.</p>
               <p>Did you melt it, do you mean that? - Yes, Sir, I melted it.</p>
               <p>How much of it might you sell? - About thirty ounces.</p>
               <p>Who did you sell it to? - I do not know in particular; I had people come sometimes which I oblige with two or three ounces and so on.</p>
               <p>Can you specify what particular pieces of plate they were? - Yes, there was a cruet-stand, a pair of salts, four or five table spoons, four or five tea spoons, a punch ladle, and two odd bottle-stands, I have one of the salt spoons now, there were three salt spoons to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing more to say? - Nothing more.</p>

               <p>How did it come out that you had got this gauze? - My Lord, Mr. Jealous and Carpmeal came to my house, and desired I would go up to Sir Sampson; and when I came there upon reflection I thought it necessary to bring this robbery to light?</p>
               <p>How long have you known Burgess? - About two months; between two or three months, pretty nigh as long as I have known Thompson, within a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did they generally come together? - Generally.</p>
               <p>Have you dealt with them both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, Mr. Burgess tells me he is a very honest gentleman? - I do not know how honest he may be, but they never went to do any robberies that ever I could hear of, but what Burgess used to carry the tools for them, both out and in;

               <p>Prisoner Thompson. Ask him what he has been for these two years; he is a person that was concerned at the Moorfields riot; he was confined five years for that; since that he has been sent down to the ballast lighter.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been at the ballast,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250094"></xptr> Mr. Ephraim? - A twelvemonth, my Lord.</p>
               <p>I am afraid it will not end there; your fate will be to come to the gallows I doubt? - I am not afraid at all my Lord; I have done nothing since.</p>

            . Mr. Ephraim said he had three salt spoons; the gentlewoman says, she only lost two.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250095"></xptr>Ephraim. To the best of my knowledge, I said, the plate was so broke that I could not tell whether there was two or three salt spoons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. I am not guilty; this Mr. Burgess is a very bad man, and bears a very bad character indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you shew that you bear a good one, that will be the best contradiction; and if he is so bad a man, how came you to be found at Ephraim's house in company with him? - I called there and he asked me to drink a glass of brandy, and then he sent for people to take me; Mr. Burgess came to me seven months ago, and he asked me if I would go and rob Cordwainers hall; I told him no, I was going to work; and I met him about six weeks after in the Temple, and he asked me then if I was at work, and I told him, yes; and he said he had got a good job for me to do; and he asked me, if I would go and rob (God bless my heart, I have forgot the name) it is an office in Bell-yard, the Bankrupts office; I told him, no, I would not, I was going to work; he said, he had several jobs for me to do in the city, if I would do it; I told him I would not.</p>
               <p>What is your way of living? because all this is of no use to you; if you had been a man of any character, he would not have proposed to you to go robbing? - My Lord, I am a carpenter by trade.</p>
               <p>Can you satisfy the Jury that the story that Burgess has told is false? - My Lord, I have not a friend in the world.</p>
               <p>Why if you was an honest industrious man, and was going to work at these times, there would be people enough to give you a character? - I worked last with a Mr. Waters, in Ivy-lane, Smithfield.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th Aug. I called on a friend in Ponsonby<lb></lb>terrace, about 11 o'clock in the evening—I then walked a little way along Millbank, towards my own house—near the gate of the Penitentiary I saw the prisoner—she asked me for some money—I said, "I have no money for you," and without more ceremony, she took hold of my coat, and put her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out a sovereign and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I took hold of her directly, and said, "You have robbed me of my money; give me back my money, or I will call a policeman"—she called another woman, who came, and the prisoner gave her some<lb></lb>thing, I suppose the sovereign she stole from me—the other woman went off—I took the prisoner, and looked for a policeman; and while the prisoner was struggling with me she took my ring from my finger—I struggled with her to get back my ring, and she bit my right hand, and ran away—the policeman, hearing my voice, took her as she was running away—I saw him take her—I know she is the woman that took my ring and money—I asked her for the ring—I said I did not care about the money, but I valued the ring—I had had it twenty-four years—I took the ring from her—I have lost the sovereign and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Harrow-alley, Aldgate. Mr. Nathan's slaughter-house joins my house—opposite there the prisoner had some premises—on Sunday evening, 26th Jan., I saw a lad named Rogers with a sack of fat on his shoulder—the prisoner was beside him, and they took it up to the stable belonging to the prisoner—I saw them come under the gateway—they both came out of Mr. Nathan's premises, and went into their own right opposite—I gave information, and saw the policeman go there—my boy took the fat out of the stable—Rogers was taken—I was present last Session when he was tried and convicted, and sentenced to three months imprisonment—(<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 485)—I have not seen the prisoner since the 26th Jan., till he was at the Mansion-house, and I had not seen him for a fortnight or three weeks before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slaughterman, carrying on business in Harrow-alley. My premises join to Mr. Howard's—I know the prisoner; he used to work for me—from information, I went to his stable on 26th Jan., and found in the manger 90lbs. of fat—I recognised it as mine—it was warm; the beasts had not been killed an hour—it was worth about 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have been looking after the prisoner ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you miss a quantity of fat from your premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went into the slaughter-house, and there was one sack half empty—Rogers had been in my employ, but was not at that time—they had got a cart up at the back of my premises, and climbed up, and broken the laths down—there were marks of their feet against the brick-wall—when they got in, they undid the bolt of the door, put the fat out, and bolted it again, and got out the same way they got in.</p>

I followed her down Long-acre, where she spoke to several apple women, she then went into St. Martin's-lane, and then to Little St. Andrew-street, and into a sale shop - I told my brother to watch her, while I went to tell my father; I then went and shewed Mr. Joy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150035"></xptr>the house where she was; but she was gone, and was found at a public house a few doors off.</p>

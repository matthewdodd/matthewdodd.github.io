On 17th June, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in Watling-street—the prisoner accosted me, and said she was in dis-tress, and had just come from Ireland—she asked me for assistance, and fol-lowed me till I got to the corner of Bow-lane—I had nothing but gold and silver—I gave her half-a-crown—she put her hand round my waist, and abstracted my purse—I caught hold of her, and charged her with taking it—I observed her make a motion towards her breast—she endeavoured to get away—the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—I saw my purse picked up at the place where I was standing with her—there was nothing in it—there had been six sovereigns in it—I had taken a few glasses of wine, but was quite sober.</p>

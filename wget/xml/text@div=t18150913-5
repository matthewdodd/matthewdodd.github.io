On the 16th of July, at about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I was at my window; in a few minutes, the prisoner and another came and tried Smith's door, with some instrument; which not answering their purpose, they went to a post at the corner of Book-court, and after hammering it, returned again, and after several hammerings they got it to open the door; the prisoner then went in, and the other stood upon the watch. I immediately went down stairs, and called one of the lodgers; but he refused to get up, and so I went myself; and then the one that was on the watch, ran away; and on going into the house, I found the prisoner behind the door, hiding himself; he had nothing about him but the ink-stand; the knives and the other things were packed up inside, ready to be brought out; some part of the printed cotton was in his hat, and some in his trowsers. I took him to my own house, and locked him up in my room until I had put my clothes on. I knocked at Smith's door, to see if any body lived there; and afterwards I saw Smith, when he returned home from the country with his milk, about six o'clock. I gave the things I found on the prisoner to the constable.</p>

When I returned, I found some of these things in the passage. When I went out in the morning I left my wife asleep, and she was so when I returned. I have also three children, who were in the house that morning; they were in bed when I went out, and also when I returned. My wife is not here.</p>

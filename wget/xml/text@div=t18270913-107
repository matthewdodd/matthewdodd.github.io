On the 17th of July the prisoner came and asked to look at it. I went and showed it him - he was very particular in going round, and said he would call in the morning upon Mr. Serancke; he went away, and said no more; when he left I pulled the door to and locked it; this was about eight o'clock in the morning - the parlour stove was then safe, and the copper in the back kitchen. I locked the parlour door, but left the key on the outside.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Euston-crescent. My little boy told me the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, that a man had gone out with this stove - I looked out, and saw the prisoner with it. I gave no alarm, as I thought it might be quite right. I afterwards heard the door shut again - I looked up, and saw the prisoner with some covings on his shoulder - I then sent to the person who had the key, to know if any person had fetched the key away; Miss Heffer came, and said she could not open the door, there must be some one inside. I went to the door, and sent my boy for a constable; and while he was gone the prisoner came out with this other stove.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he was taken? A. Yes, he passed our house, and was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and in going towards the house I met the prisoner with this stove. I stopped him - in going back, he said he was bringing it from his own house in Seymour-street; when we got to Euston-crescent we met the boy, who said he was the man who brought it out of the house - the prisoner then said he was employed by Mr. Sabine - I took him there, and heard from Mr. Sabine's clerk that he had no authority to go there; he ran from me, but I caught him again - I found some keys on him, one of which fits the latch of the door, and one fits the parlour door.</p>

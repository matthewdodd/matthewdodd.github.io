On the 26th of October, I was at the King's Head public-house, with these things in a bundle. I hadg one there with the prisoner, whom I knew before. I went out for a necessary purpose, and on returning met him coming out, and wished him good night; I went in and missed the bundle - the company told me something - I immediately went out. I saw him at different times, I desired him to produce my property, and on Saturday I had him apprehended. He always said he had not taken them.</p>

            . I am a cooper; I was at the King's Head; Arthur went out, and while he was out Baxter went out - they were both very much in liquor - they had been drinking together for an hour, and neither of them knew what they were about. I think the prisoner took the bundle out with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor, and went into a public-house with him; he asked me to mind his property while he went out for oysters, and when he returned it was still there. I did not think myself any more in charge of it, and never had it in my possession.</p>

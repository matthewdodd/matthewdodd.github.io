On the 16th of January, the servant brought this old lead up to me in the parlour - I marked it with my name on it; doubled it up in the same way, and put it under the counting-house stool, where it had been found - I missed it on the 17th of January, and sent for the street-keeper - I saw it again at half-past three o'clock; it weighed 61/2lbs. I stood at the top of the counting-house stairs, and saw the prisoner go out of the counting-house; I immediately missed the lead; the street-keeper (who is since dead) was there watching him, and brought him in; nobody but the prisoner could have taken it away; he had taken a plaster of Paris box out with him, which was brought back; the lead was found in the celler of the next house, which belongs to us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you put the lead into the box? A. No, under the stool; my husband is ill; we have entrusted the prisoner to receive bills - he has not accounted for some of them; I never told his brother that I would hang him if I could, or any thing of the kind - we employed him in the house till I found him dishonest.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Horne. I was ordered not to let the prisoner inside the house. I let him in on Tuesday evening, the 16th of January, about six o'clock; he fetched the coals up, and I said I would follow him down to shut the door - he said he would shut it himself; but I followed him down, saw him peep into the counting-house, and put this piece of lead under the stool - I carried it up to my mistress, who marked it; it was there the next day, at half-past three o'clock, when I showed it to the beadle; the prisoner came in at that time, and when he went out, we missed the lead; we folowed him into the next cellar, where the beadle stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150025"></xptr>ped him; he had then put the lead on a heap of bricks in the cellar; I did not see him put it down, but I saw him go out, and immediately missed it - nobody could have moved it but him; there was nobody in the house, but me and my mistress; I saw him come out of the cellar; I immediately went in, fetched the lead out, and he was secured; it had my master's and mistress's names on it, and was all over plaster of Paris; but I had wiped it clean with a towel when it was in the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him cover it with plaster of Paris? A. No; I saw him put it under the stool the day before; the counting-house has plaster of Paris in it; five or six men have access to the place, but there was nobody there but him; my master is confined to his bed - I saw the lead in the counting-house the very instant he came in; nobody could have moved it but him.</p>

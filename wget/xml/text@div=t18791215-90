                  </hi>. I am manager to Joseph Wilding, of Bolton, Lancashire, a washing machine manufacturer—he exhibited his machines at the Kilburn Agricultural Show, and distributed a number of prospectuses—on 20th August I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>) on a printed form from James Power requesting prices—I wrote a reply, sending a circular and price list, and on 25th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">B</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">It was dated from</hi> 45, <hi rend="italic">King Square. This ordered certain washing and wringing machines, and referring to Lawrence and Taylor</hi>, 76, <hi rend="italic">Aldersgate Street</hi>). In consequence of that letter I sent five washing machines and three wringing machines to 45, King Square, believing it to be a genuine transaction—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>) acknow<lb></lb>ledging their receipt—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">D</hi>), dated 15th September, ordering more goods—I replied to that by applying for payment for the goods previously sent—I did not receive the money or any reply; we wrote more than once—the next time I said I would come up and see him—on 13th October I came to London, and went with Mr. Hutchinson to 45, King Square—I there saw a Mrs. Allen—I looked over the premises rented by the prisoner; it was a small shed at the end of a back yard; it was locked up—by standing on a stool I could see through a window, and I saw two</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This requested 4 cwt. of butter to be forwarded to Mr. T. W.

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "6th October, 1879. Dear Sir,—I have been very ill, or should have sent back tubs and money. I will see to it now, though. I don't know what you mean by writing. I think you must have had a letter from some one else. I did not ask about poultry. I have not given your address to any one else. I don't remember mentioning anything about a customer who would give 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound more for butter. If any one has written to you, you may be sure they wrote to you because I won't give them more credit You say you can't send less than 3 tons of poultry. You must be joking; I could never pay for such a quantity.") I had offered to sell him tons of poultry—I received this letter of 10th October, acknow<lb></lb>ledging the receipt of the butter—I came up to London and went to the Agricultural Hall—the prisoner passed by me there; he looked at me and just spoke—I was talking to a gentleman; he never stopped—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—I went to 45, King Square, but could not find him—I went back to Wales, and on 16th October I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This explained that he was prevented returning to the Agricultural flail, and stated that he was not quite ready to remit.</hi>) I applied for payment once or twice afterwards—I got replies stating that he intended sending the empty tubs and the money, but he never did—seeing these printed bill-heads, I believed it to be a genuine concern of a man in trade.</p>

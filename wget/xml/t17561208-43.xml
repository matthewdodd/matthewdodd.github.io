               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Votier. I am very sure they were in the kitchen, and no body was there but she.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she with you?</p>
               <p>Votier. She was with me eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no lodgers in your house?</p>
               <p>Votier. No, none at all; the kitchen door was always lock'd, and the key brought up into my own room. When the things were missed she was charg'd with them, and fell down on her knees and own'd the taking them all.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Votier. The very night we took her up, which was on the 22d of November; she beg'd for mercy, and said if I would have patience she would fetch them again the next morning; she had the blankets from off the bed I lie on.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say they were?</p>
               <p>Votier. She said she had pawn'd them in Old Tothill Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a husband?</p>

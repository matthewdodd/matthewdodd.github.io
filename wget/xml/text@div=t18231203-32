On the 24th of October, about twelve or one o'clock in the day, this clock was safe; it was not fixed - it was an eight day table clock. I had had it seven years; it cost me 5 l. at a sale - I pawned it last winter for 5 l.; I believe it worth that. I have pawned it for that more than once. About seven o'clock in the evening. I came home - my wife came to the gate with the lantern to light me with the horse, and during that time some one must have jumped over the rails, and stolen it. As soon as she brought me the light, she turned back and went in. She was not out of the house five minutes - a child five years old was left in the room where the clock was. My wife let me in at the bottom of the garden, which is at the back of the house. A person must have got over the fence, and got in at the front door, for the gate was locked. I know the prisoner by sight; he was not in the habit of coming to the house. I went to his house on this night, in consequence of information, but he was not at home - he was taken a fortnight afterwards, opposite the Rosemary Branch, public-house, near to where he lives - I could not find him before.</p>

On a Friday night, two or three weeks before I went to Worship-street, which was two or three weeks ago, about seven o'clock, I saw him with a clock - he was going away from Matthews's; three more boys were with him; he was going towards the Robin Hood, which is near Matthews's; I am sure it was him. I did not speak to him - he had nothing over the clock - it was Matthews's, for I had seen it before a good many times. It was dark, but there is a gas-light by the Robin Hood.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Hyde-place, Hoxton. The prisoner has been occasionally in my employ for the last twelve months, carrying out parcels, up to the day of this robbery; he did not come to me afterwards - he did not come on the Saturday. I used to send for him when I wanted him; and did so once, but he was not at home. I employed him every day. He used to call for jobs; I paid him by the job, and owed him nothing. He was particularly honest to me. I have heard he has been apprehended once before, but I would employ him again; for, on the night of the robbery, the prosecutor came to me, and asked if I knew where

             lived. Grey and his father were with him. Knowing Woolf to be a bad character, I pointed out his house. He then said he had lost a clock; that Grey had seen Woolf take it. I saw him again about five or six o'clock in the morning; he said he had not succeeded in taking Woolf.</p>
               <p>Q. What connection had you with Woolf - A. None at all; not with Matthews, before that. I was walking up and down with an officer of Kingsgate-street Court, when they came up and asked about Woolf. I was then by the cottages, where the prisoner resided.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner and Woolf together - A. Several times. He has been kept out of the way ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time Matthews and Grey came to you, you did not see the prisoner again - A. No. He lives in Medland's-rents, Rosemary Branch.</p>

            . I remember going with Grey on the night of the robbery, and saw a gentleman on the bridge - it might be the witness. I asked him for Reynolds and Woolf; but I do not think either of them were asked for. I had a boy with me to shew where they lived; and it is not likely I should ask where they lived; or whether I spoke to the gentleman I cannot tell. I went after both Woolf and Reynolds that night.</p>

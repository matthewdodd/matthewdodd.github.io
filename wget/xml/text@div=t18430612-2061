                  </hi>, Jun. I am a boatman, and live at Laycock, in Wiltshire. On Tuesday, the 23rd of May, I missed a watch from the boat, which was on the Thames, coming from Reading to London—I had seen it safe at Read<lb></lb>ing on the Friday, in the cupboard of the boat, and I felt it there the next day—the cupboard was not locked—I and my brother were the only persons who slept in the place—the prisoner belonged to the vessel, but he was not on board when I felt the watch—he was employed till we got to Lon<lb></lb>don—this is the watch—it is John Snozell's, my father.</p>

                  </hi>. This is my watch—my son goes up with the barge—the prisoner generally takes our boats at Reading or Newberry—I met him in Castle-street, Reading, on the 31st of May—I said, "Well, Isaac"—he said, "Well, master, what stir have you been making about me?"—I said, "About that watch"—he directly said he took the watch out of the cupboard, and put it into his pocket, kept it a day or two, he was ashamed to give it up, and had pawned it at Wandsworth—I asked him for the duplicate—he said he had left it at Paddington—when I came to Paddington, he got it of a person, and gave it me.</p>

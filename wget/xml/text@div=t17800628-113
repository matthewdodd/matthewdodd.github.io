               <p>At about six o'clock, on Monday the 5th of June, I saw the prisoner very busy among the rioters at Mrs. Crook's; he was helping to pull up some of the joists of the house; I admonished him to get away. I knew him before. I said you skin gathering rascal, get away, or I will take you up some time or another. He seemed a good deal stupified with liquor; he did desist at that time, but I could not get him out of the house. I could not particularly attend to him afterwards among such a multitude.</p>
               <p>You are perfectly sure to the person of the prisoner? - Yes. I have seen the boys after him in Newgate-market making game of him; he is almost an idiot; I know him to be very weak. He used to gather skins in the market.</p>
               <p>How long did you observe the prisoner there? - For two hours.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>I come to prove the prisoner was at work with me on the Monday; he came about nine in the morning; he continued with me till eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Court. I caution you to be careful what you say? - I am very careful, and very sure he was employed in the yard till dinner time.</p>
               <p>What did you employ him at? - Jobbing at the skin-market in Wood's-close.</p>
               <p>What Monday morning was that? - The first Monday in June the 5th day of the month; he never went out of the yard till he went out with me between four and five o'clock in the evening; he went with me about Newport-market, St. James'-market, and Oxford-market to fetch sheep skins, and was with me till we came home to my master's at ten o'clock; he went down to my master and had a shilling of him for his supper. My master is Mr. Morgan Austin; he is a salesman, and deals in sheep-skins. We did not come into his gates till past ten o'clock. The last market we were at was Bloomsbury-market; that was about half after nine o'clock. My master is in the country now.</p>

               <p>How came you to be so sure of the time? - I am certain to the time; he was taken up soon after. He is a poor foolish lad, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280265"></xptr> will work sometimes, but when he has got a few halfpence in his pocket he will not work.</p>
               <p>How happened you to come here as a witness? - My master said I was to prove the time he was with me to serve a friend, not to forswear myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master-carman, and live in Northumberland<lb></lb>alley, Fenchurch-street. The prisoner has been in my service from ten to twelve years—he used to go out with my cart, and receive payments for me—he was to account for them the following morning—I remember his carrying some goods for Mr. Henry Smith on the 10th of August—what he received he brought to James Thomas, my book-keeper—he never accounted to me for the receipt of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that occasion—Thomas gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

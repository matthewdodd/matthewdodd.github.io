On Sunday night, the 27th of Dec., I was coming from the Hand and Shears Public-house Cloth-fair—when I got into Smithfield I was Knocked down by something backwards senseless—I cannot tell by what—it was all done in a moment—I had a galvanic gold ring on my finger, and a gold pin in my breast, from seven shillings to eight shillings in money in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, a silk handkerchief, a measure, and a pair of black gloves, and a letter—from the time at which I got home, I suppose I must have laid there about ten minutes—I went home and to bed—I saw three con<lb></lb>stables afterwards—Casey was one—he came to me and produced this portion of a letter which I had taken in my possession at the time I was assaulted—it was in my coat-pocket—I had taken it with me to take a measure with, and it is on it now—when I rose from the ground all my Property was gone.</p>

On Sunday, the 27th of Dec., I was on duty in Field-lane—the two prisoners named Williams, were given into the custody of myself and a brother officer, in Field-lane—Brannan was not with them at that time—he had been about twenty minutes pre<lb></lb>viously—this was about a quarter-past twelve on the Monday morning—I was not called to the spot by an alarm—I took this bar of iron from Thomas Wil<lb></lb>liams' trowers—I searched him at the station-house, and found on him this tailor's measure and a pair of kid-gloves—I afterwards took Brannan in charge, in Field-lane, at ten o'clock, on Monday night, on suspicion—I searched him, and found a pin, a ring, and a duplicate for a handkerchief.</p>

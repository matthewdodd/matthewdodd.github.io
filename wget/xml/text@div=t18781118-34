                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Sanders, shipsmith, of 9, Tranmere Vale Terrace, and have been in the neighbourhood 17 years—No. 9 is almost opposite No. 8—Holt and Ohlsen came to live at No. 8 in September, 1877, and when they were taking the things in, a sofa was fall<lb></lb>ing through the cart, and Ohlsen said to me "Please can you hold that; I will call my husband to help you"—I did so, and she called Holt—I was living at home all day—I never saw any one else living there—I knew them as Mr. and Mrs. Steele—he used to take the milk in of Hancock in his shirt—one morning he said out of the window, "My boy, don't bring the milk any more; you come too soon for us and disturb us"—he was in his shirt—I never saw the boy leave the milk any more—I could see out of my window into theirs, and they could see into mine—they had no top blind, and I could once see them undressing for bed in that room—I saw the light put out the night I saw them undressing—I saw them remove from there, and they followed the cart—I never knew of any one else living there with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It might be a week after they moved in that I saw them undressing—our street is narrow—I recognised them—I did not look at them long, for I made my own bed, and when I went to the window again the candle was put out—I took them for man and wife—he had no waist<lb></lb>coat on, and she was in her stays when I saw them—I never spoke to them before holding up the sofa,—I had no grounds for looking at them, and had no animosity against them—I thought they ought to put a blind over the window—a good many of the houses in that street are without blinds.</p>

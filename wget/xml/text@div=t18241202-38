            . I saw the prisoner come in about five o'clock in the evening, with another boy; they asked to look at some coloured silk handkerchiefs: while I was shewing them, the prisoner put a piece in his hat, which I saw when he was taking out his handkerchief, to wipe his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020017"></xptr>nose. I called Mr. Bond, and gave him charge of the prisoner while I ran out after the other boy; these handkerchiefs had been in a drawer which I took down to show them.</p>

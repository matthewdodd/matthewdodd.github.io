                  </hi>. I am married, but my husband has run away from me—I have been living with the prisoner as his wife for the last three months—on Saturday morning, 13th December, between 10 and 11, I got out of bed to dress myself—the prisoner had passed the night with me, and was standing in the middle of the room—my little boy, a son by my husband, opened the door, and said, "Mother, the young man has come to take your shawl out of pawn"—the prisoner then took my pocket off a chair, and took out my purse with all my pawn tickets in it—he put them in his pocket, and said, "You shan't have no shawl, and you shan't have no mantle, if that is the case"—I said, "Give me my pawn tickets, Joseph?"—he said, "I won't"—I asked him again, and he said, "You shan't have them"—I was going to put my hand in his pocket to take them out, and he took up this poker from the fireplace, got me back in the corner, and said, "I will kill you; I will kill you; I will be hung for you yet," and struck me three or four times on the head with it—it cut the side of my head, and cut my eye, which bled very badly—I screeched, "Murder," and the neighbours came down stairs—I was taken to a surgeon bleeding awfully bad—I fancied I was killed—this is the instrument he used, (<hi rend="italic">A fender standard for fire iron</hi>)—it was straight before—this was last Saturday—here are my wounds.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Cannan, a cabinet maker—at the time of this occurrence I lived at 101, Long-alley, next door but one to the prisoner and prosecutrix—between 10 and 11 in the morning I heard the cry of "Murder" and "Help"—I was up at the top of a friend's house, and it seemed to come from the prisoner's room, the second floor back—I ran down, found the door open, and saw the prisoner—he had got the pro<lb></lb>secutrix up in a corner: one hand was on her throat, and he had this poker in the other, with which he was beating her most violently—I said, "You good for nothing vagabond, you will murder the poor woman"—with that he ran at me, and was going to strike me with it, but I took it out of his hand, and he ran down stairs—the prosecutrix was bleeding most furiously from her head and eye—I took her to a surgeon.</p>

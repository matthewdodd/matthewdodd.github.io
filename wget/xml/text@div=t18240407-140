            . I am a Thames police constable. On the 26th of February, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner offering a brass cock for sale, at the shop of a dealer in marine stores, in Crown-street, Soho. I found the articles stated in the indictment on him; he said he got them from his father, who is a smith; that he was distressed, and took them from his father to get his shoes mended. I went to his father, who directed me to Burgess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in a public-house, and asked a man about a ship - he said I should find it difficult to get one, but he could put me in the way of getting one, if I could get some old metal, and take it to the shop in Crown-street - there were men looking out there, and if I gave them an incorrect account of them, I should be sent on board the tender - and this man I have since learnt is a police officer. I saw him at the office, but could not get to speak to him.</p>

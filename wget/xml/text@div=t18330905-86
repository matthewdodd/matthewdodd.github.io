            . My father keeps a greengrocer's shop. I remember the prosecutor and the prisoner coming, about three months ago, on a Monday; they left a bundle; the prisoner came on the Thursday afterwards and said, "If you please will you let me have that bundle," which I did, and he went away - I supposed the other boy was near - I had seen the prisoner about before.</p>

In consequence of what took place in the last case, I went to the prisoner's house—he told the inspector his address, which was No. 8, Charles-street, Woolwich—I found the two female prisoners there—they told me their names were Molloy, and that they were George Molloy's mother and sister—I told Elizabeth Molloy I had come to search the house in consequence of her son being put in confinement for a robbery in the Dock-yard—she said, "All the things in this house belong to me"—I said, "I must make a search, on account of Government property being missing"—I searched the parlour, the kitchen,</p>

I lost some fowls on the night of the 3rd, or the morning of the 4th of June; my servant locked them up in my hen-house on the night of the 3rd of June, her name is Sussannah Dyer. I am accustomed to wake at three in the morning, and at that time my cock used usually to crow; not hearing him at three, nor for a considerable time after, I rang the bell, and told the servant to go and see how the fowls were; she returned, and told me that only one of the fowls heads was left. I know no more.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner at the bar passed me, about four o'clock in the morning, of the 4th, at the end of Oxford-street, and was making his way down Crown-street, when I stopped him; he had a bag on his shoulder, and I asked him what he had got there; he said, watercresses. I said, I was very fond of water-cresses, and I wished he would give me a few for my breakfast; he made no reply, but threw down the bag, and ran off. I sprung my rattle. I put my hand into the bag, and found the water-cresses quite warm; for they were ducks and fowls; I found there were fifteen fowls, one with its bead off, and five ducks. The prisoner was stopped by the next watchman. I delivered the fowls and ducks in at the watchhouse, and that is all I know about it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hurdle; on the first day of Barnet races, I came to London with a load of hay. Going to Whitechapel market, the prisoner came to me in <placeName id="t17541204-12-crimeloc63">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you sell it to him?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unloaded it?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner keep that inn?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he talk of paying you for it?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. No, he did not; but I said I must either have money or a note, as I always have either one or the other. After it was unloaded, he had me to a butcher, who wrote a note by the prisoner's order; he said he could neither write nor read.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write ?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. I can neither write nor read. He gave me the note the butcher wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had bought the hay of your master?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the keeper of the White-bear inn ?</p>
               <p>R. Deman. No, I did not then.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was put in Bridewell for another such fact, and I heard of it, and I took Deman to see if he knew him; when we came there, the prisoner was making water: as soon as Deman saw him, as we were going in at the gate, he said, that is the man that is making water against the tub.</p>

I am an inspector of the detective police at Scot<lb></lb>land yard—I was present at the Court of Queen's Bench on 11th December last, when the prisoner was ordered to be prosecuted—I afterwards went to Mr. George Pulleyn's, No. 12, Churchyard Row, Newington Butts—Pulleyn was in court, and I knew that the prisoner had been living there some time—I searched the lodging, Pulleyn went with me—I there found some clothes which are in court, among them there was a striped shirt, it has been shown to Mrs. Miller—I took possession of some papers, which I have here—I saw Luie after this at Holloway prison—I went there with the order to bring him up to the Queen's Bench—I afterwards had some conversation with him in going from Bow Street to the House of Detention, on Saturday 13th December—previously in coming from Holloway he had asked me to advise him and I declined—he said "What had I better do"—I said "I can't advise you Luie, you are old enough to advise yourself"—he said "I was first spoken to in this matter"—I could not quite follow him—he was looking out of the cab window—ho said "Mr. W."—I said "What about Mr. W."—he said "He first spoke to me about this; Mr. Whalley first</p>

               <p>spoke to me of this matter in the spring of the year at Brussels, I was at a house of ill-fame there, and I saw Mr. Whalley in Brussels, stopping there with his daughter, and he said, Mr. Whalley, speaking of a trial that was hap<lb></lb>pening in England, said it made him ashamed of his country; that he said "One difficulty is that we cannot find anyone who saved a boat of a shipwrecked crew"—he replied "That would not be very difficult I should think; I have been a sailor myself," but nothing was particularly arranged on that occasion, or at Brussels at all"—he said "I saw Mr. Whalley a time or two after that, and I had communication with him—I first saw the man (speaking of the Claimant) about 4th or 5th July at Poet's Corner—I went early in the morning and I saw a man standing at the door who asked me my name—he had something the matter with one eye—I afterwards found him to be Baigent—Baigent asked me who I was—I told him Jean Luie—he said "Oh, yes, I know all about it; it has all been arranged"—he said "Bogle, the little black fellow was there, and I showed my fingers to him and he went into the inner room, I believe to tell the Claimant, for he came out shortly after," and said "If you are the man that saved me your little fingers are crooked"—I don't think there was much other conversation on that occasion—I had some further conversation with him on the following Tuesday—he said "Since I saw you I have had a visit from Mr. Whalley's nephew, Captain Nicholson—he brought me a letter from Mr. Whalley to say that he had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Harding for my support, and that he had got a private letter for me, but as the warders were present he could not give it to me"—I told him at that time that I would rather he told all this to the Solicitor for the Treasury—he said "Very well, if he will come I will do so"—I said "Very well, then, if you wish I will inform Mr. Pollard"—I went with Mr. Pollard on the following day and went into the cell—the principal warder said "This is Inspector Clarke, and this is Mr. Pollard from the Treasury"—he said "Not now, not now, I have been advised to hold my tongue"—this was about the 14th or 15th December last—he said on one occasion "I never intended to give evidence, I only intended to make some money; I never should have gone into the witness-box if it had not been for the violence of Mr. Onslow: he is a very violent man; I begged of him scores of times not to put me in the box"—he said "The reason I was not in the box earlier was that I could not learn my lesson sufficiently"—he said "Mr. Onslow gave me a book of evidence of the former trial and pointed out certain passages in it having reference to the shipwreck, which I was to learn, and I have sat up many a night to study the book; he also put his hand on his side to show me the position of the brown mark on the Claimant's side; he also wanted me to prove the malformation, but I refused to do that, as I was afraid of getting into a mess"—he said "I also had to see Janes, who I got the information about Australia from," (Janes was a witness called for the defence) and Captain Brown I had to see frequently to arrange about the evidence at Rio"—he said "Brown was to have the Dock Superintendant's place at Southampton for his trouble; Mr. Onslow was to have the greater share of the property, and I was to be his steward, and the witness Janes was to be put in a public house, and Mr. Whalley was to have some of the property"—he said "I was very reluctant to commence it, because I never was in Australia or America in my life"—I said "You astonish me, Luie, by what you are telling me; I cannot sup<lb></lb>pose that Mr. Whalley would have gone to America unless it was upon some information of yours"—he said "That was all a <hi rend="italic">barney</hi> and a part of</p>

               <p>the piece; it speaks for itself; if I had not been there I could not have told him"—I said "I cannot suppose that, Luie, because I found some plan of the harbour of Melbourne among your papers"—he said What paper do you mean?"—I said "A short history of your life, which I found at your lodgings"—he said "Yes; I wrote that, but I had nothing to do with the drawing at the back; you will see it is in a different hand-writing"—I am not so sure whether I asked whose hand-writing it was, or whether he told me it was Mr. Onslow's, but ho said it was Mr. Onslow's writing at the back—this is the paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the conversation went on for hours—he said he had been staying at Pulleyn's, afterwards at Rimel's, at Finchley, where I found this plan—I also found these two letters—the envelope is addressed to Mr. Jean Luie, late steward of the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi>, and signed in the corner "W.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I am speaking about a letter that was written to mo about making a thorough confession, and that I should be rewarded by the Tich<lb></lb>borne family and by the Lord Chief Justice, and all. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I know nothing of such a letter—I did not take that letter from you in the cab—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the only other writings that I have belonging to you, which I found at the lodging. (<hi rend="italic">The following letter, which was among these papers, was here read</hi>:" As you are now committed for perjury, I strongly advise you to make a clean breast of the matter, and disclose all you know about the evidence you gave, and also mention the names of the individuals at whose instance you came into Court as a witness. I may inform you that one of the judges who tried the case is related to the Tichborne family, and of course is strongly biassed against the Claimant. Should you make a full disclosure of all you know, you will not only obtain a full and free pardon, but you shall also receive a large sum of money, which will enable you to leave this country and go to America. On the part of the Treasury, and also on the part of the judges of the Queen's Bench, there is a strong feeling against the Claimant, and the fact of one of the judges being related to the Tichborne family will be a great thing in your favour should you make the disclosures I suggest. Write to the Solicitor of the Treasury, Mr. Gray, saying you will give every information required, and you will immediately obtain your freedom and also a good round sum. When you are at liberty you can assume another name, call yourself William Smith or Jones, and go to, Australia or America, and no one will know anything about you. You can easily regain your position in life on going to a distant</p>

               <p>quarter of the globe, with good means and money in your pocket, which you will obtain without difficulty from the Tichborne family, as the dis<lb></lb>closures you can make will completely defeat the Claimant, and on that occasion the judge who is related to the Tichborne family will, behind the curtain, give you every assistance. Write also to Mr. Hawkins, telling him you are willing and ready to make all disclosures. I am one who knows of the relationship alluded to and who is also a native of Hampshire.") I got that from the prisoner, but there were many thousands such; and I did not recollect it at the moment—I found this on the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">The envelope addressed "Jean Lute, a witness in the Tichborne Trial, but now a prisoner in the Metropolitan prison of Holloway." Post mark</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Charing Cross, December</hi> 12th, 1873.") That would be when he was in prison—I bad no means of making any inquiry about that letter, it supplies no address—(<hi rend="italic">A post card also produced by the witness was as follows</hi>: "Woodford, December—. To Mr. Jean Luie, the prison, Holloway, London. The kindness you showed to the half-drowned man is recorded in heaven; keep up your heart, notwithstanding the array of prosecuting witnesses, large numbers of persons have strong belief in your evidence and consider you may have been sent by providence to aid in restoring Sir Roger Tich<lb></lb>borne to his rights. Ps. 37, v. 38.") There is no other letter, that is all I have—you told me that you had been written to to meet a person at the Marble Arch, and that you went there for that purpose but saw no one—this letter was found at the lodging—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I have just returned from Margate, and was present at one of Mr. Whalley's addresses, by which I learn, you was to be a witness in the present trial of the plain<lb></lb>tiff; I should be most happy to meet you at the Marble Arch, Hyde Park, to-morrow at 1 p.m., when something beneficial for your future shall be----C.C.D.R.R.—<hi rend="italic">addressed</hi> 'John Lewis—private.'") I mean to say that you told me all the things I have now mentioned; and you told me further "I wish I had known you before I had got into trouble"—you said "You recollect my calling upon you in Scotland yard"—you did call on 13th November, between four and five in in the afternoon, and I saw you in my office there—I could not tell what you wanted—I had some conversation with you of course—I was cautious with you then—you invited me to drink with you on that occasion—you did not talk about the Tichborne trial in particular—I can't tell what you called for—you complained of being watched—I did not know that Captain Nicholson had been to the prison, before you told me—I recollect your saying "I should not have got into this trouble if it had not been for the folly of Dr. Kenealey forcing Mr. Hawkins to call rebutting evidence"—I don't know anything respecting Dr. Kenealey and all the lot turning you over—I showed you a newspaper in the cab—it contained a report of some part of the trial, you asked to see it, it was in the Caledonian Road, I think, I purchased it going along there—I don't know what part of the trial it was—I have no doubt it was the day's paper—I did not tell you that if you made a disclosure that would lead to anything respecting other persons, in my own mind they would not prosecute you—you asked mo, and I told you repeatedly that I could not tell you that—you said "What good will this do me"—I said "I know nothing about it, I can't tell you that it will be of any service"—you said. "It is no good of my getting other people into trouble if I am not to benefit by it"—you said you would have no hesitation if it was not for Mr. 'Whalley, you did not wish to get Mr. Whalley into trouble.</p>

We have, at your request, examined the Custom House records for 1854, for such a vessel, also newspaper file from January to July, but in no case can any <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> be found. Our Mr. Funcke does not recollect anybody by the name of Jean Luie"—When I read that to the prisoner he said that they had a motive for disclaiming all knowledge of him and of the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi>; that they had filibustered the vessel; that the vessel had been consigned to them, and she was called the <hi rend="italic">Helvetia</hi>, I think he said; and that they had altered her name, and appropriated her, and that was their motive for denying the existence of the vessel, and of himself—I did not say anything to that—he did not make any further statement about it at that time, but I had repeated conversations with him afterwards—he urged me to make inquiries, and so on—on 15th August I retired from the case—I believe these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in the prisoner's hand-writing—they are addressed to Mr. Rimell—I don't quite know what he is—I think he is a silver plate manufacturer—I have seen him constantly at Poet's Corner—he was a supporter of the Claimant. (<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "City Prison, Holloway, 12th December, 1873—Mr. Rimell—Dear Sir,—I have not heard from any one of you, and I fear that all are inclined to believe me to be the scoundrel Lundgren, as is mentioned by all those monstrosse witness. It is a hard thing for me to bare, and you know very well that if I can have no assistances given to me to bring Lundgren's relations here as well as Jean's, the two American ladies, and they two men now in England, who knows both the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> and myself, independent of that villain woman, who is a—, and living with another man than her husband Lundgren, as well as proper and independent medical men to examine me respecting rupture, I must be in a hopeless state. But this I mean to tell you: let the matter take what course it will, I shall declare openly in court that no one connected with this case, or any one else, has ever used any influence on me, nor attempted such a thing as to make me tell the fate and circumstances with Sir Roger. It is the truth, and nothing but the truth, and that it seems to me villany is practised all over the world against both Roger and myself. Harcourt asked me if I could defend myself. What does he mean? I wrote you last night a letter. I wrote also to Mr. W. Perhaps you have not received it. What am I to do? I am shut out from the world, and am starving. I must go to the criminal side to-night, as I have no means. See what Sir Roger says. I am willing to undergo any medical operation to prove that I am not ruptured, or have any cause with me.—I am, obt. fd.—Jean Luie. P.S.—If I am rendered assistance Sir Roger and all of you are saved." "December 22, 1873—Mr. G. Rimell, 29, Golden Square—Dear Sir,—by this I beg to acquaint all of you that I am here retained, and have heard nothing. This is a miserable life, and to suffer such—all for not being allowed to have my own way. But what is done cannot be altered. I refer you to my last from House of Detention. I had letter from Plas Madoc, wherein was stated that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been sent to Harding. If the same is not returned please take charge of it for me, as you will see in the printed form. I don't want to have any letters unless of the greatest importance. I conclude by wishing yourself and family a mercy Christmas, and with respect to W----, in Plas Madoc, and all friends.—Your obedient—J. L. N.B.—None of you would know me now if you was to see me")—I believe Plas Madoc is where Mr. Whalle's lives.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">Esq.</hi>, M.P. I went over to New York to ascertain the facts stated by the prisoner; I called on Mr. Funcke—I did not go on the prisoner's account—I went to Staten Island to the Custom House which has connection with Staten Island, where the vessels that would load at Staten Island might probably clear out—they clear out at a place called Porthamberg—I found a register at the Custom House; I did not find the clearing out of any <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi>, but I found such explanation at Porthamberg on the subject as accounted. I found in the Custom House books at New Bedford ships registered as belonging to. Baron Falkenberg, and I think one was called the <hi rend="italic">Falkenberg</hi>, I forget the other one, it was not the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi>—I found the existence of Mr. Funcke at New York—I found full confirmation there of what the prisoner stated—he gave me certain letters to Mr. Funcke which I delivered; they were not to Mr. Funcke, they were to servants of Mr. Funcke, both of whom were dead, but they were handed by me to Mr. Funcke and verified by him, and the contents of those letters were verified.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. After the prisoner had given his evidence in the Court of Queen's Bench, I gave him 5.2. on the day he was about to leave, I think it was the day after he had given his evidence—Mr. Onslow also gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we both gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think it was after the second day, I think it must have been the 16th, it was the day we signed the paper, the testimonial to character; that testimonial was written by me—I have been in Court most of the time while this trial has been going on; I wrote this, "that he has borne himself through all his life as a man entitled to confidence and respect"—I ask permission to explain specifically why I used those words; they were written with great deliberation under these circumstances, we knew that the Crown had in their service a great number of detectives engaged in following up any investigation, and ascertaining the character of every person that was called, or about to be called on the part of the defence, that every circumstance of their life was in the hands of the cross-examining counsel, and we came to the conclusion that if anything whatever could be found against this man unless he was a plant by the Government, unless he was put forward knowingly as the man he turns out to be, that that undoubtedly would have become known to the Government and would have been disclosed in his cross-examination. Therefore Mr. Onslow and myself, in considering what was due to the man, deliberately stated that we believed, having passed through the cross-examination as he did, that his character was by that circumstance well established; that was the reason—it was a matter of full consideration, and not written with any haste or carelessness—I signed it "G. H. Whalley, M.P." and Mr. Onslow signed as "Guildford Onslow, M.P.;" we desired to give as much weight to the testimonial as we could—we knew that the Government had detectives who knew the whole life of every witness, by the complaints that were made by those witnesses of the extent to which they were harrassed previous to being called, one person committed suicide in consequence, so we were told, and his widow had to be provided for—am a magistrate of three counties—I live</p>

               <p>at Plas Madoc—I have given you the reasons why we used those words "that he had borne himself through all his life as a man entitled to confidence and respect"—that was to the best of our belief; we certified it, of course, to the best of our belief—I gave him that certificate and put M.P. after my name in order that he might take it with him to America; we had the further object in it that in going to America he was to look up such evidence as he could collect and telegraph here, so that his evidence could be corroborated, believing as I did, and do, that his evidence as to the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> was true.</p>

POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that he was going to America on 16th October, after his two days' examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no further knowledge than that Mr. Onslow and myself requested that he should go immediately, with as little delay as possible—I knew that Mr. Onslow had given him a letter of introduction to the Dock Master of Southampton to give him every assistance to get away; I concurred in that—after he was in custody, I sent my nephew, Captain Whalley Nicholson, to the House of Detention to see him—I sent 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to another person, if he was in the state I was told he was, for his benefit—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan of Melbourne Harbour</hi>) I do not know the writing on this plan—I am almost sure it is not Mr. Onslow's writing; I would not be quite sure—it looks to me, so far as I remember the writing of the man, to be the prisoner's—the words are "Melbourne," "Sandridge," and "Williamstown"—I do not recognise it at all as the writing of Mr. Onslow—I could not undertake to swear it was not—I say it does not at all resemble it, but I think it does resemble the prisoner's—I believe it is the handwriting of the prisoner; that is my impression from the letters I have seen of his; but before giving a final answer I should be glad to see his writing; the letters he wrote to Mr. Rimell—I believe it is his writing—I should have said that it certainly was not Mr. Onslow's—I take upon myself to say that; to the best of my belief it is not—I went up with the prisoner and Mr. Onslow in a cab on 7th July to see the Claimant—I think I heard after that, in a general way, that he was put into the charge of the witness Pulleyn—I did not know that he was being maintained by the Claimant; I had no knowledge of any of those matters—I knew Pulleyn as one attached to the Claimant and of his services, more or less—I have had no communication with the prisoner in any form or shape before yesterday, nor had anything to do with his defence; but yesterday on coming here and finding that he was not defended, I immediately sent to Mr. Lewis, and said "Let him be defended."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that, as far as you were concerned, yesterday was the first time Mr. Lewis was retained for the defence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have had no communication whatever, directly or indirectly, with this man since he was sent to prison, since I was bail for him; I was bail for him for some time alone; I mean since he was at the police-court or before—I was in Court yesterday when the clerk said what he did say—I did not quite understand him to say that Mr. Lewis had been retained for the defence here; what I understood was that Mr. Lewis was retained at the police-court, and that he was again retained yesterday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> During my cross examination in the Court of Queen's Bench</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070053"></xptr>
               <p>I objected to answer the questions of Mr. Hawkins respecting the latest period of my life in consequence of a misfortune that I was really led into, but the Lord Chief Justice ordered me to answer the questions. I was compelled to do so, and I did it as it came into my mind at the <hi rend="italic">time.</hi> Numbers of witnesses have been called here against me as to the period of 1853 and 1854, one, according to his account, being himself a schoolfellow of mine. How is it possible for me to contradict these men when I am deprived entirely of assistance, either legal assistance or assistance of people whom I should have been able to bring forward? If I had time I should prove that they are mistaken—entirely mistaken—in the identity. It requires, in fact, a wonderful memory for any one to distinguish one man from another after a period of over twenty years' time, and especially when you have a man only just come into Court to discern an individual Had I been able to be defended, and produce witnesses, it would certainly have substantiated my story to a great extent. Of course in the later periods of 1862 and 1867 misfortunes have fallen to my lot. That undoubtedly is true, but respecting the time of 1852, 1853, and 1854, there is no truth whatever in what has been said. I don't say that people have perjured themselves, because if they have perjured themselves a vast number of witnesses who have been brought against Roger Tichborne must be as bad as they are in that respect. But I say I have been the sole victim of prosecution from a number of people amounting to nearly 300, no matter on which side. I think it is very bard indeed that I should suffer the inconvenience in which I am placed. It can be proved, and will in time come out, that the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> which I joined at New Orleans in 1852, and was with her up to July, 1854, is a fact undoubtedly, and it will be found to be true. Time will tell that, and it should have been proved satisfactorily both to your lordship and the jury, if I had had that ample means given me which I now stand in need of. Had it not been for the misfortune of this bigamy affair of mine I certainly should never have given the account which I have given, because I stood in the position that whatever turn I took, when it came to the period of 1855 to 1857, whether I admitted that or made any false statement or not, it would have fallen to my lot to be punished. I am very sorry that this has taken up the time so long, keeping your lordship and the jury for such a length of time through the calling of these witnesses, since I am not in a position now to bring forward evidence in support of my story. Very sorry, indeed, I am, but I trust that the time will come soon enough to prove my story and the fact of the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> in 1854. At the same time, I beg his lordship to be as lenient in his punishment towards me as possible, bearing in mind that I have still eighteen or nineteen months to be under servitude.</p>

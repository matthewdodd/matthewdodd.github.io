            . I am an assistant elder in the East India Company's warehouses. The prisoner was a labourer there. On the 9th of this month; it is the course for all the persons employed to go to breakfast at a certain hour; my attention that morning was called to something which occured in the place where the prisoner was employed; I went to examine some Cassia, upon the second floor, and while I was doing that, I heard something fall like pease. After I heard this, I proceeded up stairs towards the place where I heard the noise, in the third floor, which contains only coffee; I did not discover any thing upon entering the room; but on going to the farther end, where the bags were piled so as to form alleys, I found the prisoner at the farther end of the alley; suspecting he was after no good, I had him searched, and found on him about eighteen ounces of Bourbon coffee in his pocket; there was a quantity of that sort of coffee in the warehouse: I have examined some of the bags, and I found they were cut, one bag in particular; I examined the bags that were cut to find what deficiency; I had them weighed, and this bag was nine pounds deficient; I found some coffee on the floor, near a handful, against the place where the bag was; I have had this coffee, which I found on the prisoner, ever since; it is the same description of coffee with that which was in the plundered bag. I sent for Rice, the constable, to take the prisoner into custody. I said nothing to the prisoner at the time about the coffee. He said he was very sorry for it, and hoped I would over-look it, that it was the first he had ever taken, and he would never be guilty of the like again; but I said, I could not tell at that time what I would do.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I was attending on that day at the India House; I went with the last witness to search the prisoner; he had about half a handful of coffee in his breeches pocket; it was taken out before I got up to him, and when I got up there was about half a handful more not taken out. I examined a bag which had been cut, and it contained coffee of the same description as that found at his lodgings; he acknowledged his guilt, and hoped we would have mercy on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the warehouse to take the prisoner up; he said he lived at No.53, Lambeth-street. I asked him first if he had any coffee at home? he said, no. I found on enquiry, there was no No. 53, in that house; but I found he lived at 71, and I found there a quantity of mixed coffee in a bag, weighing twenty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, in which he said the coffee found at his lodgings he had bought from a sailor, and it was his own real property.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house. - A. Perfectly well. On the 27th of October he applied to redeem a watch that was in pledge for seven shillings, he laid down six shillings in silver and fifteen pence in copper; upon examining the money four of the shillings appeared to be bad, I told him they were bad, and I asked him if he had any more; he said he had got two shillings more in his pocket which he could change, but he had taken the whole in change of a note at a public house in Marybone, but the house he did not know. Afterwards, when he was questioned, he said he had taken them in change of a seven shilling piece; he then said if I did not like them he had other money; he pulled out his pocket book and shewed me notes and gold, and there was likewise two shillings in silver in his pocket book; I told him I must be satisfied before I let him go that he had no more bad money about him. I immediately sent for Mr. March the ward beadle, he searched him; in his waistcoat pocket he found seven shillings more, which appeared to be all bad; I marked the four shillings and delivered them over to Mr. March.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not seen his person before. - A. No, he appeared to have been drinking, but not so much as not to know what he was about.</p>

               <p>HENRY ROBERTS. On the 19th of April, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I was in <placeName id="t18240603-142-crimeloc763">Chiswell-street</placeName>

I turned round and missed my handkerchief - the man pointed to the prisoner, who was about twelve yards off, and said he was theman who had taken it - he ran away. I pursued, and lost sight of him as he turned into a court. The officer took him - he is the man who was pointed out to me.</p>

            . I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner picking a gentleman's pocket. I saw him take something from a gentleman's pocket and put it into his own. I pointed him out - he ran down Whitecross-street, and down an alley into a privy - a butcher kept him in the privy until the officer came - we found the handkerchief thrown down the privy. I had seen him about the streets before.</p>

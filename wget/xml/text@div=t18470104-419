                  </hi> I am a widow. I keep a general sale-shop at No.135, Whitecross-street—on Tuesday evening, the 29th of Dec., I was standing at my door between seven and eight o'clock—I saw the two prisoners walk back<lb></lb>wards and forwards—I told them to go away—they would not, and at last they were very saucy—I thought they were gone, and I went in doors for about ten or fifteen minutes—I was then called by Bryant—I went to the door to look for the prisoners, but they were gone, and I missed between three and four dozen spoons, which had been lying on a table, amongst other goods, about a yard inside the shop—I am quite sure it was the pri<lb></lb>soners I saw—I have seen them in the street, and knew their persons—I can speak positively to them—I went to my door about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and saw the two prisoners together—Cockling called to the other, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> here she is"—Cockling ran off, I ran after him as fast as I could, but could not catch him—in coming back I caught Waldron, and gave him into custody—that was about twenty minutes after I lost my spoons—he was taken to the station, and in coming back I met Cockling—I said, "I have caught you, what have you done with my spoons?"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You said, <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi>, there she is, "—he said, "I don't know a boy of the name of <hi rend="italic">Mike.</hi>"</p>

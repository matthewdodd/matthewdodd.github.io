            . I am one of the Marshalmen of the City; I found this trunk that I now produce at No. 6, Church-street St. Giles's, in the lower front room, Mr. O'Cornell occupied that room; the prosecutor saw the trunk, and said it was his; he produced a key that opened it; he claimed the trunk, and every thing in it, there was C P upon the trunk in brass nails; the watches were not in the trunk; I apprehended the prisoner in the street, about a hundred yards from O'Cornells's room, he was talking to a girl of the town in the street; I told him he was my prisoner, he said, for what; I told him if he would go with me to O'Cornell's where he lodged, I would tell him, he made resistance, for the moment, but we forced him there, and then I asked him if he knew any thing of this trunk; I took him in charge for stealing this trunk, I told him I must secure him, I took out a pair of hand cuffs; he made resistance, we were oblidged to throw him on the ground to handcuff him, and with great difficulty we put the handcuffs on him; a rush came from the outside by the people that had assembled, and smashed the door in upon us; the prisoner seemed to be in liquor, and said but little; the people found that we had pistols, they came no further; we took the prisoner to the Compter and searched him; we did not search him there, on account of the mob at the Compter we found on the prisoner's neck, this silk handkerchief, that the prosecutor claimed and swore to; in his left hand pocket a cotton handkerchief; the prosecutor claimed that also; in another pocket we found a key, exactly the pattern of the prosecutor's key; it was quite new, on the next day I accompained the prosecutor to the same room where the trunk was, we found in the room under a loose brick at the fire place, the coin I now produce, a spanish dollar, a half doubloon, and a quarter doubloon, and an English guinea; the prosecutor said they were his; under a part of the floor which had the appearence of having been mended, we pulled up a piece of board; we took a silver watch out of there; the prosecutor claimed it. Mrs. O'Cornell was bound over to prosecute, she has absconded; we found the other watch at Mr. Harper's, a publican, in Shorts Gardens, he is here, the publican produced the watch; the prosecutor claimed it; that is a silver watch. I have kept the silver watch, I found at Mr. O'Cornell's ever since, this is it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To prosecutor. Look at the watch - A. That is my watch, it is one of the watches that was is my trunk; I saw the pieces of money under the brick, they were the same kind of money, I had in my trunk; they were the same in number, except one Spanish dollar, he told me he gave to the woman: the trunk is mine, and all that is in it are mine; the handkerchief that was taken from his neck is mine, and also the cotton handkerchief.</p>

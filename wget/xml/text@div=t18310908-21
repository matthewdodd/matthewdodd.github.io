On the 9th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my shop, and sent my servant away with some goods - he was about thirty yards from the door; I went after him, to give him the bill, which he had left behind; I left my door open - I had seen the till about a minute before - I put some money into the bag, tied up the bag, and put it into the till, at the farthest part of it - when I came back I met two lads coming out of the shop; one of them said, "Have you got any oats?" I said Yes: he said, "How do you sell them?" I said 1s. a peck - I do not know who they were; I had never seen them before - I am quite sure I met them both at the door; they walked out, and I walked in - a lad, who stood in front of the door, said to me, "Have you lost any thing?" I had seen both the lads apparently come out of the shop - the door-way is very narrow, and there was a truss of hay at the door; I was absent more than a minute or a minute and a half; I went into the shop, in consequence of what the lad said, looked into my till, and the bag was gone - I was going down Thomas-street next morning, and met Mr. Flood, who gave me the bag, tied up as I had left it; I do not think it had been opened - the same money was in it - this is the bag (looking at it) - it contains twenty sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, a crown-piece, eighteen half-crowns, eighty-one shillings, thirteen sixpences, two 10l. and a 5l. note; they were all in the bag when Flood gave it to me - the notes are all endorsed.</p>

            . I am the son of Richard Allen, of Weymouth-terrace. On the 9th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing Bennett's shop, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter; I did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080026"></xptr>him before - there was somebody with him, outside, apparently watching Mr. Bennett; I saw the prisoner go into the shop, lean over the counter, and draw the till out - I saw him take something out, but could not tell what it was- a boy about his own size was watching outside, watching Mr. Bennett, who had gone about thirty yards, to his man; after he came away from the counter the one outside went into the shop to him - Mr. Bennett came back; they came out, and the prisoner asked how he sold his oats - I told Mr. Bennett directly; he went and looked at his till; - I went after the boys; they walked as far as the first turning, then turned down Thomas-street, and began to run - I am quite sure the prisoner is the boy who went into the shop; I lost sight of him at the end of Thomas-street, leading into Kingsland-road, where there is a narrow passage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If I was the boy, why did you not detain me in the shop? A. I cannot say - I went into the shop after Mr. Bennett came back; I told him as soon as he returned.</p>

            . I live in the Hackney-road. On the 9th of September, about ten o'clock at night, an alarm was given about somebody being in my garden - my wife went out, and I followed her; I found the prisoner there- my wife had hold of him; he was taken into custody -I searched the garden next morning, traced some footsteps, and at the end of them I found a bag, which I gave to Bennett with the money in it: he opened it in my presence - it contained two 10l., a 5l. note, some sovereigns, and silver; this was within five minutes after I found it - there was nobody in the garden but the prisoner and two Policemen; I found the bag about eight yards from where my wife was holding the prisoner - there were footsteps from the entrance of the garden, past the bag, down to where he was taken.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 9th of September I was on duty near Hackney-road - there was an alarm of thieves being in Flood's garden; I went to the back of the garden, and saw the prisoner running away - he went back into Flood's garden; he broke through the fence - I followed, and there he was apprehended; I searched him, and found a small key on him - another Policeman was there, but nobody else; I saw him come out of the garden, and rush back again - Flood's wife caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady had hold of me before he came up; he was running after two more young men. Witness. I saw nobody but him.</p>

On Friday evening, about ten o'clock, I was going along - I wanted to ease myself; I went down a turning - I did not know it was a garden; I got over the pales, and seeing it was a garden was getting over the pales again, and the lady laid hold of me, saying I had come to steal the flowers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Hacker's-court, Knightsbridge. I have only a room there—it does not open on the staircase—there is no passage to it—it is on the ground-floor—you open the door in the court, and then you are in the room—there is a room over head, but there is no com<lb></lb>munication between my room and the rest of the house—nobody can get in or out, except by going into the court—I do not know what parish it is in—the prisoner lived with me about three weeks before my loss, living in the same room with me, and slept with me—we are both unfortunate women—one morning in April, I felt her leave my side in the bed—it was not dark—it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—she lit the fire and washed herself—I went to sleep—when I awoke, she was gone—she never came back—I had had a watch under my pillow, with a silver guard to it—I missed them—I got up, went to my box, where I had another silver watch, that was gone—I did not keep the box locked—the prisoner often went to it—I missed a silver pencil-case, a gold-pin, a pair of gloves, and an apron—I never saw the prisoner again till I saw her with the officer—I had seen the pencil-case and pin safe in the box, I think, one day in the same week, but am not certain—I had seen the watch safe on the Sunday night—this was on Tuesday morning—I found the pin and pencil-case at Mr. Whitly's, No. 10, Lower-street, Lambeth—there was no person in the room that night but the prisoner—we went to bed between one and two o'clock in the morning—we took a man home with us that night, he did not stop in the room above ten minutes—he went away between one and two o'clock—we did not go to bed till after he left—the value of the property altogether was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

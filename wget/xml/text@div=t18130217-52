               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 19th of January last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners come to your shop - A. I only saw the prisoner Smith in the shop. I saw him come in; I was in the shop. He asked me the price of a pair of smallclothes. I asked nine shillings and sixpence; he bid me eight shillings. I told him I could not take less than nine shillings. In the mean while I was talking about that, the constable brought in Staples. The constable's name is Smith. The constable brought a pair of boots in his hand; he asked if the boots were ours. I told him they were.</p>
               <p>Q. They were, were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from what part they were taken - A. They were taken from the inside of the shop door. I hung them there myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you seen them there yourself - A. I suppose it was about twelve o'clock in the day that I had counted them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon. They were women's boots. They have our private shop mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Smith talking with you - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith afterwards searched - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable find any money upon him - A. Yes, he did. I cannot say how much.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw Staples and Smith together go up Tottenham-court-road. That was before they came to Mr. Lowther's. I saw them together about three o'clock; they went towards Mr. Lowther's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch them - A. I walked after them, and when they had got an hundred yards I missed them all at once, and in about three minutes Staples returned back again, running, with something under his coat. I catched hold of him by the collar, and he threw these boots down. I took him back to the shop, and I saw the prisoner Smith there in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him return back running he was running as if from Lowther's, was he - A. Yes. I searched Smith when I went back. He had got about seven or eight shillings in his pocket. I did not take it from him. He told me he was going to buy a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cantrill. How many doors are there to your shop - A. Two doors.</p>


               <p>Q. Is yours a corner shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these boots hang at the door that Smith came in - A. Yes, at the door that Smith came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in sight of you in the shop (the boots) or not - A. They were in sight of me, only Smith was standing before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it had not been for Smith you should be able to see them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith, the patrol. How long were they in your sight altogether - A. Not hardly a minute. It was not above an hundred yards from where I stood.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cantrill. What is the value of them boots - A. Five shillings. We gave five shillings and sixpence for them; that is the cost price.</p>
               <p>Staples's Defence. I was going up Tottenham-court-road after work; I saw these boots lay between that gentleman's shop and a butcher's shop. I picked the boots up, and carried them openly under my arm.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. My lord and gentleman of the jury, as I am before the Court, and if I may not too far transgress upon your time, I must humbly hope you will indulge me with hearing my case, being placed at a bar of justice, to answer a charge of felony, for the first time in my life. My lord and gentlemen, I have it not in my power to retain able counsel in the law. The candour which marks the proceedings of this solemn Court, whose wise discernment will not let conviction meet upon such evidence which this day appears before your lordship, and do beseech I may be permitted to state that on Tuesday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Tottenham-court-road to purchase a pair of breeches which were for sale, hanging against the door. I enquired the price. I was answered nine shillings and sixpence. I offered eight shillings, and during the time I was agreeing about the purchase, an officer brought in the other prisoner. The officer searched him, and found a pair of half boots. The officer came there to enquire if they were their property. The shopman said, they were their property; and in consequence of the officer saying he had seen me with the young man, I was taken as an accomplice, whereas I came in the shop to purchase a pair of smallclothes in a fair and open way. The officer insisted upon doing his duty in taking me in custody as an accomplice. I beg leave to state in the presence of the Court, I have no knowledge whatever of the prisoner, Staples, nor to my knowledge had I seen him before. I had left my father's house half an hour before, for the express purpose of buying a pair of smallclothes. Will the officer say that I was in the company of Staples; that I knew that he had the boots. No. He stopped him, and searched him, and found the boots, and the merely saying that we were together, I am brought to a bar of justice. Your lordship's goodness and great capacity I trust will say I am perfectly innocent in this case. I always have borne in life the character of a hard working lad.</p>

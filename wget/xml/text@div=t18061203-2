               <p>Q. Were you in Hyde Park on the 1st of November. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was it. - A. On Saturday the 1st of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. At what hour was you passing through the Park. - A. Between eight and nine; I had been in Charles-street, Portman-square, I was going from there to the Edgware Road, I was afraid that I should be too late, I came across Cumberland Place from Berkley-square, and went into Cumberland Gate, Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>Court. You came to Hyde Park at Cumberland Gate. - A. Yes; as I came to the bason in <placeName id="t18061203-2-crimeloc7">Hyde Park</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was he running or walking. - A. He was walking.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going the same way that you was. - A. No, he met me, he kicked my heels up and fetched me a blow over the side of my cheek, I fell on my back, and the prisoner demanded my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. What did he say when he demanded your property. - A. He said d - n your eyes, give me your property; he first attempted at my watch, he put his hand into my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your breeches pocket. - A. Yes, I had a ten pound note in that pocket, and a one pound note, one guinea, some silver, a silver tooth pick, and a small key, he took part of which, leaving the one pound note, and one guinea, and one shilling, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take the whole contents of your pocket out. - A. No; the prisoner then ran round the bason towards Kensington Gardens, I pursued him a short way, but I did not think it prudent to follow him in that direction; I came back into the same road again.</p>
               <p>Q. What road. - A. The foot path in Hyde Park; I thought that he belonged to the barracks in that neighbourhood. I went to Portman-street barracks, I asked the centinel how long the roll call would be, he said in ten minutes, and I described the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find him that night. - A. No, I stated that I had been robbed, I described his person to the centinel and to the sergeant, in the orderly room; they brought down one man in the same dress, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Court. You have not told us what the dress was which that man had on that robbed you. - A. A white jacket, a short dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. Was his head covered or uncovered. - A. He had a round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what they call a drill dress. - A. Yes, it is I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his face covered or uncovered. - A. Uncovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him plainly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did see him plainly. - A. I did see him plainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. What sort of a night was it. - A. A very light night.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that it was moon light or star light. - A. The moon was getting up, I do not know whether it had made its appearance or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. Had you such an opportunity of seeing the person's face that robbed you, of knowing it again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this transaction take up; how many seconds. - A. It might be a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. During that minute or two did you make an observation upon his face. - A. I did, I fell on my back, so that I had an opportunity of viewing his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any arms. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor a stick. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the ten pound bank note which you had been robbed of had you yourself or any other person written any thing. - A. The person who writes Mr. Stackfold's letters always writes upon every one of his notes.</p>

               <p>Q. By bill do you mean a bank note, or what do you mean. - A. A bank note; I gave it back into his hand, says he I will tell you what to do with it, put it into your big coat pocket, and roll the coat up, and if the gentleman comes here to day, and knows me, he cannot find any thing on me; I put it in my big coat pocket, and rolled my coat up. On Monday morning we were going on guard, it rained that morning, we put our big coats on; he went to the Queen's guard and I went to the King's guard, we went up for our messes for our dinners, he was there before me, he waited there till I came there, he said to me we will go and change it, he told me that he would go and have a pot of beer and change it.</p>
               <p>Court. Change what. - A. The bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he would go and have a pot of beer and change the bank note. - A. He said we will go and have a pot of beer and change it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. Where did you go to. - A. We went to a public house and called for a pot of beer, I do not know the name of the house</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the person if you were to see him. - A. No, we went there and called for a pot of beer and change, and I pulled the note out of my pocket, and gave it to the girl, the girl took it to the bar to her mistress, and brought it back again, and told me that she could not change it; we went out immediately and went to Mr. Shaw in the paved alley.</p>

               <p>Q. After she told you that she could not change, what did she do with it. - A. She gave it into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030005"></xptr> hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what sort of a note it was. - A. No; we went from there to Mr. Shaw's in the paved alley down by St. James's. When we went in there he called for a pot of beer and change for a pound note; we went into the tap-room and sat down, I pulled it out of my big coat pocket and put it into his hands; he looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the prisoner. - A. Yes, he looked at it, he told me, and he said it is ten pounds; says I, if it is I will have nothing at all to do with it; you fool, says he, Shaw will not take any notice of it, because says he there is not much difference between calling for change of a one pound note and a ten pound; the landlord brought the pot of beer; he gave the note to me, says he give it to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillants. Who said so, the prisoner. - A. Yes, I took it out of his hand, and gave it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that you took out of his hand and gave to the landlord. - A. The note; I gave it to the landlord, and the landlord took it into the bar; we stopped there and we drank three pots of beer, the landlord did not seem to bring the change. I went out about half past two o'clock and made water; when I came back I asked the landlord for the change, he told me it was ready there if I would come forward; he gave me the change of a one pound note on the table that he called for. He asked me if I knew what I had given him, I told him it was a ten pound note; he gave me in change a five pound note and four one pound notes. We went out from there.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you and the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the change. - A. We went out from there, and I says, Robert says I, you shall have every farthing of it. I pulled it out of my pocket, and gave it him into his hand, he took the five pound note out of the rest, and a shilling dropped when I took it out of my pocket; he told me that he would not have any more, that he would give me the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Shaw, the keeper of this house present at the time that you divided the money. - A. No, he was not, we were out of the house at the bottom of the paved alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations what was on the back of the note. - A. No, I know there was some writing on the back, but I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the note you received from the prisoner was the note that you gave to Mr. Shaw. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the note that you had wrapped up in your great coat. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that part of the money that he gave to you. - A. I spent some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the rest. - A. I gave it to the sergeant.</p>
               <p>Court. You spent some of the money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much. - A. I do not know, he took out half a guinea and a seven shilling piece out of my knapsack (i. e. the prisoner).</p>
               <p>Q. That was part of the money. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Westminster on that Saturday night; near Hyde Park corner I met Mr. James, and as he was passing by me he looked me in the face very hard and turned back and followed me very near up to the bason. He asked me what o'clock it was, I told him that I thought it was between eight and nine o'clock; I was going to go on the right hand side of the bason, and he took to the left side of the bason; he asked me to come after him, as he said he would give me something to drink. He asked me where I had been, I told him that I had been in Westminster; he says, you get plenty of fun there with the girls, yes says I there is plenty of girls there; he says had you ever any connection with a man, no says I nor never will, I would not with such a thing as that, it is quite against human nature, says I. He says if you will go along with me I will give you this, and he pulled something out of his pocket, a piece of paper, I did not know what. I asked him if I should look at it, he gave it into my hands, I did not know what it was besides it was a bank note, I did not know what note it was, it was too dark to see; when I had the note in my hand I gave him a push while he was down, and I ran away to the barracks, The next morning Gibbons came up to my bedside and he awoke me, I cannot say what time in the morning it was, it was not day light; says he there has been some robbery committed in the Park last night, says I I cannot help that; says he I am told it was you, I never robbed any body says I, I am sure. Says he if you have robbed him and if you have got any notes about you, the best way is to give the notes to me to put in my great coat pocket for fear of a search, I gave him the note, I did not know what note it was, he put it in in his great coat pocket and rolled the great coat up. We went on guard on the Monday, we took our great coats, unrolled them, and put them on just at Constitution hill; he went on the King's guard and I on the Queen's guard; we met at the barracks at dinner time. After we had done dinner we went out together, I told him we had better change the note. We went to one public house, they would not change it; then we went to the paved alley to Mr. Shaw's and got change, we drank three pots of beer and went out to the bottom of the paved alley, I told him that we must part the money, I got a five guinea note, he had the rest. I was on the Queen's guard when I was took, I was brought up to the King's guard, they asked me several questions about this robbery, and I denied it. They marched me up prisoner to the barracks, they tried me by the company and punished me that afternoon; I was put in the black hole all night, and I was taken to Bow street the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Gibbons) You have heard the story that the prisoner has been telling. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing of this story about James. - A. No, he did not tell me nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you how he came by the bank note. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him the character of a good soldier.</p>

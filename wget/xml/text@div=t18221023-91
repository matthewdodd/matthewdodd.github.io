I lost this property; it was safe at nine o'clock, on last Sunday night, in the cabin-chair, when I went to bed; the sovereign and box were in my pocket; the other things were the clothes I had pulled off. I turned out of bed at half-past six o'clock, and they were gone. I found all but the sovereigns and box at the office.</p>

            . When I asked the prisoner where he was going, he said, ashore, to wait for George, who was gone to Gould's-hill, which is a quarter of a mile off. This bundle was in the boat; I asked what it contained; he said, a jacket, waistcoat, trowsers, and handkerchief. On searching him at the office, I found two handkerchiefs in his hat, one of which was the prosecutor's; he said they were his property. In the evening I learnt that a snuff-box and the sovereigns were gone. I went to search him again, and he pulled out a sovereign and 1 s. 10 d.; he said a friend had been to see him and gave it him.</p>

            . I am a Silk Dyer, and lost this Gown off the Pole the Saturday before Christmas; about 6 o'Clock in the Evening, we dy'd it with two Breadths of Burdett, an Olive Colour, the Burdett was marked in the Sleeve with a (D).</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made up?</p>
               <p>Robins. It had been a Gown, but was in pieces, sewed together for the Conveniency of Dying. There was about 10 Yards of it in all, when we had sewed it together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you should have indicted him for stealing 10 Yards of Silk.</p>
               <p>Robins. We always call such Things Gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the general Course of your Business called Gowns?</p>
               <p>Robins. Yes, never any Thing else; 'tis a common Term, it had been a Gown, and was to be a Gown again: It was unfinished, and could not be used till it had been to the Waterers; therefore I sent Notice to the Trade to have such Things stopp'd if they should come to their Hands. Word was sent me by this Gentlewoman that she had watered such Goods and delivered them to a young Man. I went to her, and the young Man was sent for, and she swore to him.</p>

            . I live in Widegate-Alley. Bishops-gate-street, the Things were brought to be watered one Evening when I was out; when they were done, they lay a Day or two before the Prisoner called for them; I delivered them to him myself. I heard no more, till about (I think) a Fortnight ago, when the Prosecutor sent this Notice and Description of the Goods: I remember the Mark (D) in the Sleeve: This I think was either on Saturday or Monday Night. I don't swear these were the Things the Prosecutor lost, but they answered his Description.</p>
               <p>Q. By common Course of your Business can you water any Thing, so as to be fit to be delivered in four or five Hours?</p>
               <p>Bryan. Yes, if Necessity requires it, and we have Work in the House to do it with</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been done before the Prisoner called for it?</p>
               <p>Bryan. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the Prisoner came and fetched it away, that the Prosecutor sent his Servant with this Notice?</p>
               <p>Bryan. I think it was Monday was Se'nnight; but if the Prosecutor lost them on Saturday, we could not have got them done.</p>

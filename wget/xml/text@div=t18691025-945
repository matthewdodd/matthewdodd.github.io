About 4 o'clock, on the morning of the 25th September, I was on duty in Crouch End, Hornsey—I saw the prisoner with an umbrella in his hand—I wished him "Good morning;" but having some suspicion, I pushed against him, when I heard something jingle in his pocket—I asked what it was, and he said, "What it that to do with you?"—I took him to the police-station, Highgate, and searched him—I found two sets of silver castors, six silver spoons, two pencil cases, a gold watch, a lady's card-case, and a knife with a broken blade—on his person were three coats, two pairs of trowsers, and a table cover round his neck—I gave the knife with the broken blade, to John Harrison.</p>

On the morning of the 25th September, about 6.30, I visited Mr. Webster's house, No. 1, West Field Villas, Hornsey—that is about a mile and a half from Crouch End—I found the house had been broken into, and I called up the prosecutor—a panel had been cut out of a door leading to the kitchen—the scullery window had been forced open—in the door I found a piece of the blade of a knife, which corresponded with that which the last witness gave me.</p>

I am a clerk in holy orders, and live at 1, Westfield Villas, Hornsey—about 11 o'clock, on the night of the 24th September, I went over my house, and looked all up—the scullery door and the place where the panel has been cut out were all safe—I was called up by Sergeant Harrison, and found the scullery window bad been forced open—these things found upon the prisoner are all mine.</p>

I was standing by the side of the bar when the prisoner came on the 17th—the bar-maid said to me, "Look at this crown, is it a bad one?"—it was a bad one—I gave it her, and fetched a policeman, and gave it to him—it was in my possession till I marked it—I never quitted the presence of the policeman—it was never from the bar—the policeman and one or two more looked at it previously to my marking it—it was not at all out of my sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at Lambeth, and also at Sutton—I began business at Lambeth in 1841—Holmes is my son; I set him up in business about three years ago, with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen him at Forest Hill on several occasions, he had a very nice stock; I purchased the premises there—I was always willing to let him have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he only had to ask me—his business appeared to be conducted in a genuine manner, and I thought he was getting on very nicely—he was my shopman at Sutton for three years, and the business increased very much—he is excitable and violent—he had at one time a severe illness, which affected his head, and he is so excitable at times that it is quite grievous to see him—he is only 27—I have sold many wringers at Sutton—Skinner and Co., are respectable ironmongers.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of William Brown, a linen-draper, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On the 22nd of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I slept in the shop, which fronts the street, and goes back<lb></lb>wards—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I am the only person who slept there—the windows and doors were all safe—there is a back window facing the garden—I put the shutter up to that window, put a bar across it, and bolted it—the window is a large square in the shape of a door—it is large enough to admit a man through it—it opens, and has a rail before it with a sort of door to it—the window is more than one square, but there is one square in it which opens—there are about twelve squares to the window—one of them will open large enough to admit the body of a man—the other windows and doors were all properly secured—the dwelling-house is over the shop, and the family sleep up stairs—nobody could have come down, and done any thing to the window after I was in bed—about two o'clock in the morning of the 22nd, I heard a noise, similar to rats—it continued about half an hour—I then heard it where the rats are not ge<lb></lb>nerally in the habit of coming—that excited my suspicions—I still listened, and heard a hem from a human voice—I was not certain whether it was in the next house, or in the shop—I sat up in bed, and listened very atten<lb></lb>tively—I got hold of the rattle, and turned one notch round, and said, "Is there any one there?"—every thing was then still, which I thought strange, as making a noise does not make the rats quiet—I then got a piece of serge which laid close to me, and threw it towards where I heard the noise—I still heard some noise, and turned the rattle round again, and said, "Is there any one there?"—I received no answer—the counter just comes in contact with my head as I sit in bed—I still heard the noise—I waited till it came over the fan-light, and I was looking down the counter, and by the re<lb></lb>flection of the light from the fan-light, I thought I saw something move—I sprang up, and inquired who was there, but received no answer—I immedi<lb></lb>ately jumped upon him, and seized on him, I struck his head with the rattle, which broke—I then struck him with the handle of the rattle, and he called out "Murder"—I dragged him out of the shop into the passage, and gave the alarm—it was the prisoner—the family got up—I got a light, and exam<lb></lb>ined the back window—before the light was brought down, I dragged him to the place where I first struck him, and when the light came, I saw where he had got in—the window was wide open, and the shutter down—the sin<lb></lb>gle pane of glass was thrown wide open—it was all quite secure when I went to bed—it is large enough for the prisoner to get in, and he could not have got in at any other place—there are several gardens behind the house—there is a railing to our garden, and the other gardens have a wall to them—it was snowy weather—it had been snowing that night, and there was</p>

               <p>snow on the ground—the policeman has traced the foot-marks in it since—I found three chisels a few yards from where the prisoner had got in, on the floor—the shop is about twelve yards long—he was given to the policeman, sod a chisel or screw-driver was found on him, a candle, a knife, a comb, and a necklace of beads, and some songs and paints—I did not know him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said before the magistrate that he forgot to bolt the win<lb></lb>dow. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That is wrong—I put up the shutter and bar, and the iron bolt into the bar; but a screw, which screws the bolt, was wanting—I said that before the magistrate; but I am certain the bar was secured with the bolt—there are about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On the night in question, I was called in, about three o'clock, and went to Mr. Brown's premises—I found the prisoner there, leaning on the counter, with his hand to his head, which was bleeding—it had a cut on it—I searched him, and in his left hand coat pocket I found a screw-driver, a candle, and a knife—I saw Callis take three chisels from the floor—I asked the prisoner next morning coming from the station-house to Hatton-garden, how he became possessed of the three chisels—I did not make him any threat or promise—he said he used them in his business, as a brass pattern founder—I never saw him before—I went out to the back window when I took him—it was then snowing—I traced foot-marks from the window across four gardens; then across a nine-inch wall—I did not compare them with the prisoner's shoes—he must have come from Stud-street over eight or nine gardens.</p>

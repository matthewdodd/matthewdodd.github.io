            . I am a commodore in the Company's service, and superintend the labourers. On the 26th of December, the prisoner came to work at eight o'clock, and was repairing a chest of black tea; at half-past eight he was sent on an errand - returned in half an hour; was sent out again at a quarter to ten, and should have come back in half an hour - he returned about a quarter to one o'clock, and appeared to have drank rather too much, but was sufficiently sober to work, or I should have reported it to the elder; he went to work, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him putting his right hand into a chest and take it out full of tea, and put it into his breeches pocket. I thought I must be deceived, but I watched and saw him do it again. I got within three yards of him; he came to me and said, "Master, will you come to-night and take something to drink, and smoke a pipe?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will, Collins." He then returned to the chest, repeated it again, and I reported it to the elder; he was searched, and about 10 ozs. of Congo tea found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the least suspicion of him before - A. Not the least; he was a hard-working, quiet man. Three other men had been out with him - all four were drunk; he did not know that I saw him. I do not think he would have done it if he had been sober.</p>

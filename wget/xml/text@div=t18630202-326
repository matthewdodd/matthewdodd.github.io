On Wednesday evening, 21st January, about half—past 5, I was with Rowland, another officer, in Newgate-street—I saw the two prisoners, and two other men, not in custody, in company—Marshall was carrying this roll of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I followed them into Skinner-street, about fifty yards—I then stopped Marshall, and asked what he had got there, and what he was going to do with it—he said, "Ask that man there; it belongs to him," pointing to Watson—he then threw the cloth between my legs and ran away—Rowland took Watson is custody; Marshall got away—the other two went away first, as soon as we went up—I was in plain clothes—I had never seen the men before—I saw Marshall again on the 26th, in the custody of Rowland—I have not the least doubt at all about his being the man I saw on the 21st.</p>

               <p>down, and ran away too—I asked Watson what he was going to do with that bundle—he said, "Me, sir? I don't know anything about them people; I have just come out of that house"(pointing to a house in Skinner-street) "where my father lives"—I took him to the house he pointed to, and found he was not known there—I then took him to the station—I searched him, and found an old pair of gloves, and two handkerchiefs on him—I after<lb></lb>wards took Marshall, about a quarter-past 12, on the night of the 26th, in High Holborn, pretty close to Brownlow-street—I told him I wanted him for being concerned, with three other men, one of whom was taken into custody, for stealing a roll of cloth, from Mr. McGregor's warehouse, in Cheapside—he said he did not know anything about any roll of cloth—I told him I was quite certain he did, and I should take him into custody—I then took him to Smithfield police—station, searched him, and found a pawn—broker's duplicate on him—he gave me his correct address—I had not known him before—I have no doubt at all that he is the man I saw carrying the cloth on the 21st.</p>

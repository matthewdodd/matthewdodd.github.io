At five minutes after two o'clock he had left work - I took him to the office to be searched, and told him he must be searched there, for I suspected him - he made no answer. I fetched the Excise officer and commodore - he unbuttoned his breeches and produced a bag containing 17 ozs. of Twankay, from between his legs - it corresponded with that in the chest.</p>

            . I am a commodore. I produce the tea and the bag. The prisoner walked very wide, which induced me to suspect him; and when he took his coat to go away, he took his apron, and turned his back towards me, and stood so to put his great coat on, and buttoned it over. When he came into the service he gave his address at No. 15, Duke-street, Westminster. I went there, and we could not find him.</p>

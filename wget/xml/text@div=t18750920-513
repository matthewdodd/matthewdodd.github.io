                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs.

I was on duty on the evening in question—I was called into the premises, 48, Bishopsgate Street, and took the prisoner to Bishopsgate police-station—he asked the inspector to allow him to go outside as there were two or three gentlemen waiting—he was allowed to go with Mr. Barker—I walked on one side—Mr. Barker accom<lb></lb>panied him, but no one else—he went to Fore Street and back—he turned about of his own accord, and was about half an hour out altogether, but failed to point out any one—I went to Cloudesley Road—there is a person from that place in attendance here, I believe—that is the address on the back of the cheque—I also went to Newington, where I found his wife and nine children—he first gave me his name at the station-house as George Shaw, and after being placed in the cell he gave me his proper name, George Shaw Pollock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was at the Bishopsgate Station on the 4th September when the prisoner was brought in—he made the following state<lb></lb>ment voluntarily:—"On the Friday afternoon I was in Gracechurch Street when I met a man by the name of Tupe, whom I had known for some time; we' got into conversation. I told him I was not getting on very well and was hard up. He said 'If you meet me tomorrow afternoon I shall be able to lend you a few shillings. I went this afternoon to Lombard Court, met a man named Miles, and asked him if he had seen Tupe, he said 'No, but knew where to find him at 5'oclock as he had an appointment with him.' I asked where, and he replied at a public-house in Fore Street where there is a hoarding. I went there at 6.10, not expecting to see Tupe, but he was there, and we both went into a public-house. I called for a pint-of four ale, and asked Tupe whether he could fulfil his promise. Tupe said he unfor<lb></lb>tunately had not succeeded in getting the money he wanted, but if I liked to do a little turn for a friend of his he would pay me for it. I asked Tupe what it was, and he said he would fetch his friend, which he did. He brought Drewett back. Drewett told me to take a cheque to 'Dirty Dick's' (Barker's, in Bishopsgate Street), get some grocery for him, and bring him the cash. When outside the public-house, I asked why he did not go him-self. He replied that he did not want to go in the neighbourhood because a few 'bull-dogs' (meaning detectives) were about. We left Drewett at the corner of London Wall and Moorgate Street, and went on towards Bishops<lb></lb>gate Street, and I then asked Tupe if it was 'all right.' He replied that he had known Drewett for some time, and he believed it was all right. I asked him if I should sign my whole name or two Christian names. He said 'Your two Christian names will be all right; you can sign it; George Shaw will do, or anything.' When I came out to find the parties I could not; they were nowhere about. I will assist you all in my power." Shephard was present when he made this statement, and took his wife's address—the prisoner suffered no interruption when making this statement.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say that he offered to assist us in anything he could—I want Mr. Drewett for forgery, but cannot find him—there are three in the affair—I heard there has been a man by the name of White in Lombard Court, since the prisoner was arrested, who said that Tupe had done him out of a cheque on Saturday—whether it referred to Drewett I don't know.</p>

               <p>White. We found all thes e Goods in her House.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you know how the Prisoner came by them? Had you ever, at any Time, any Conversation with her? When you found the Goods in her House, what did you do then?</p>
               <p>White. Sir, the constable took them away, and carried them before Justice De Veil. He took her up and committed her to Gaol.</p>

               <p>Davis. She ask'd what we would have for them; and we told her two Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to her when you went in? Did not the Prisoner Burn say something to her?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, my Lord. No further than shewing her: He untied them and went up one Pair of Stairs, and shew'd them to her one by one, and she ask'd us what we would have for them; and we told her two Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, my Lord. She knew how he came by them, because he had brought several other Things to her House.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been with him?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she never ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Davis. Only ask'd us where we took them from, and we told her.</p>

               <p>Davis. She said she would not give the Money. Please you my Lord, she and her Husband got out of the Bed, and got a Guinea chang'd, and gave us five and twenty Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When she said she would not give two Guineas, what did she say she would give?</p>

I did not say it was you; I said it was James's Daughters, and, my Lord, we found this Fellow, Burn, (the Prisoner) in the Cock-Lost at this Merrit's House: We open'd a litle Place where he sat, and I said to my Brother Constable, shoot him, if he won't come down; with that he came down directly; I got away immediately, knowing what Place we were in being so very near Black-Boy-Alley, and knowing what desperate Folks have been there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 102, Curtain-road. I have the medical treatment of part of the poor of the parish—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of Thursday, the 1st of March, I was called to the house where Mills lives, to the ground-floor back-room—the door was locked, and the key had been taken out—I looked through the key-hole, and there saw the body of some person lying apparently dead—I could see by the bed-clothes that there was no vitality, because there was no motion—I forced the door open with my knee, and on entering found the body of a female which has since been proved to be Emma Crips—the features of the face were those of a person who had died in a fit—she was perfectly dead, and from the little warmth that remained, I should suppose she must have been dead, varying from two to three hours—this was near upon ten o'clock in the morning—I cannot say for certain How long she had been dead—I hastily, at that time, looked over her person generally, but preceived no marks of violence about her, and no external cause to accounts for her death—on the table I perceived the fragment of some bread, and little portions of meat, two phials, and two tea-cups—the phials and the tea-caps each of them, appeared to have contained laudanum—by the smell and taste of each of them, I am satisfied of its being laudanum, and I should judge of the usual strength—on one phial was written, "Poison." and on the other, "Laudanum, poison," and part of the label of a particular chemist—I saw two papers on the table—I examined the body of Emms Grips externally, and found no bruises or marks whatever—on the Satur<lb></lb>day morning, by order of the beadle, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body, and examined the stomach and intestines with care—I could find no traces of laudanum—I found nothing but the remains of the ordinary food</p>

               <p>had taken—I found nothing of a deleterious character, nor any thing induce me to suppose that she had taken poison—I then proceeded to examine the head, and found the vessels of the brain highly congested, and the base of the skull a quantity of bloody serum. Quite sufficient to oc<lb></lb>cssion oppression on the brain, and to be the cause of death—I found the food of a light meal in the stomach in a state digested—rather in the <hi rend="italic">duo denum</hi> than in the stomach, it had been digested—if laudanum had been taken, at or about the same time with the food, the food would have taken up, the laudanum would have been absent—there was no smell of laud<lb></lb>anum in the contents of the stomach, and there was nothing to disguise the smell; therefore, had laudanum been present, it would very easily have been detected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that be so if the food had got to the <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe, vegatable poison is so when taken up, so that we can hardly expect it to he found in the stomach, if digestion had taken place—if the food and lau<lb></lb>danum had been taken at supper overnight, and I not examine the body or two or three days, the smell and appearance of laudanum would most decidedly have escaped—I should have expected that it would—the appear<lb></lb>ance I observed about the brain very much corresponded with the ap<lb></lb>prence usually observed in cases of death from laudanum.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the contents of the two phials, divided between two per<lb></lb>sons, have been sufficient to cause the death of either of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> very small doses of laudanum, smaller than that, have been the cause of death—three-quarters of an ounce is, with many individuals, about sufficient to scense death—at the same time, by habit, enormous quantities have been taken—the appearance of apoplexy would be the result of having taken landanum into the stomach—laudanum will destroy life sometimes by pro<lb></lb>ducing apoplexy—that appeared to be the case in this instance—suppose<lb></lb>ing it to have been taken, there was nothing at all in the appearence I saw, inconsistent with the supposition of death having been caused by taking laudanum.</p>

At the latter end of February, or the beginning of March, the prisoner applied to purchase some liodanum—he wanted a small quantity—I asked him who and what it was—he said it was for a medical gentleman, who was accustomed to take laudanum—I let him have a small portion—sixty drops, and after labelling the phial, "Laudanum, Poison," he paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and left the shop—it was a half-ounce phial—I have seen a phial which was found at the lodgings—I should say that was the same—the label was printed—it was on when I saw it afterwards—he brought the phial with him—I should say that was not enough to destroy or do mischief to any one—he did not come to me again after that.</p>

                  </hi>. In October last I was in search of a situation, and saw in the newspaper an advertisement, in consequence of which I went to 7, Lambeth Court, where I saw Adrian and Ferdinand Marchant—the name on the door was "Beaumont &amp; Company"—they made out that they were Beaumont &amp; Co.—I was engaged as office boy—I often saw the prisoner there—there was no business going on at all—they spent their time in sing<lb></lb>ing and dancing about the place—the prisoner was not introduced to me—I knew his name as Alfred Marchant—he came there nearly every morning—I recollect the 4th November, when I was there till about 6.45—Ferdinand was there, and Alfred came with a truck with skins; I helped take them in—Ferdinand did not tell me anything about the skins then; he did subsequently, but Alfred was not present—I recollect Mr. Kingham calling on a Saturday; I don't recollect the date—I cannot recollect how long since it is that I saw Ferdinand—I remained in the office a week after he went away—he told me nothing about Kingham, except that he was in a hurry for his money—they spoke in French when not addressing me—I do not know; I assume it was French—Adrian went away a long time before Ferdinand, I think three weeks or a month—the premises were closed after I left—I had no idea they were going, they went suddenly—they rose me a shilling every other week nearly; they were to give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when they went away and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next week—I did not get <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money—I don't recollect how many weeks I was paid for—there was nobody else there besides; no other clerk and no books.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 285, Old Street, as importer of foreign goods—the prisoner called on my clerk the first week in Novem<lb></lb>ber—I saw him on the previous Monday, the 1st November—I had seen him before, but had had no transactions with him—I knew him to have beentravelling for a party of the name of Fevrier—he said he knew a person who could buy skins—I did not know prisoner's name—I have it signed in my books as "Marshall"—I had heard him called Marsall—he was about four months in the employ of Fevrier—I told him I would give him samples, and asked the name of the buyer and whether I could see him—he said I could not see him, but he would take the samples and submit them to him—I let him have three dozen skins as samples; the value of them was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they have never been returned to me—he mentioned the name of a firm (Underwood), of Birmingham, and spoke of their buyer as Mr. Clarke, and that he was in London—he said he would submit the samples to him and let me know the following day—when he came on the following day he said the price was rather high for some of them, but Mr. Clarke had returned to Birmingham, and he produced a card of "E. Beaumont &amp; Compy."—I had never heard of them before—he spoke of Mr. Clarke, of Birmingham, as being connected with a highly respectable firm importing oil from Italy, and that I should have to do business with them—I said I would rather do business with Underwood; I asked him then how he. knew Underwood—he said he had been in the leather trade in Paris for about twelve years, and that Underwood was a very large buyer of the firm he was connected with in Paris—then he said I could not see Mr. Clarke as he had returned to Birmingham, and he made an appointment for me to see Messrs. Beau<lb></lb>mont til; Co. on the following morning and gave me the card produced—I called there the next morning and saw the prisoner and the boy (the last witness), and the prisoner said to me "Mr. Beaumont's partner is not in" I said I would return in about half an hour—I went back again and he came to meet me at the the door and said "Mr. Beaumont's partner is in," and conducted me to a desk and introduced me to a person as Beaumont's partner I had no idea that he was a brother of the prisoner's—he said the goods were considered by the person who had seen them as being inferior and high in price, and would I take a discount off the price—I said I had given the quotations as low as I could make them—I produce a letterpress copy of the invoice prices quoted amounting to 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for eighty-five and a half dozen skins—the prisoner was present—I refused to take off any discount, and said I had agreed to give the person who negotiated the sale a commis<lb></lb>sion of 5 per cent in the presence of the prisoner—he said "Well, in consi<lb></lb>deration of your giving Mr. Marchant this commission, we will not say anything about the discount and would take them at that price—he called him "Mr. Marchant," and not his brother—I said I had other goods with these, Russia goods and sheep skins for the backs of chairs which would do equally well as morocco, and to break them would be a loss—he said he knew a man who was a very large buyer of these goods and probably he could do with them, and after going into the matter and an approxima<lb></lb>tion of what they would be, consented to take the whole parcel at 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the terms of payment being thirty days—I wanted cash—Underwood was the person referred to as the large buyer whom he spoke of in the presence the prisoner and Ferdinand—I had taken with me a stamped bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. thinking there would be no difficulty in having the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—he he said "We cannot afford to do it, all we get out of the transaction</p>

               <p>is a commission ourselves"—I said "I would rather have the balance in cash I have brought a stamped bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he took another 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp from his pocket-book—the goods were afterwards fetched from my shop in Old Street—the prisoner came and said that the goods were to go that night to Birmingham—I said I was so much occupied I could not attend to it then, but would send them round the following morning—he said "I will go and fetch Messrs. Beaumont's man"—I said I should much prefer having them counted, but he came back with a man and a barrow—he said he bad come for the goods, and I said I should not have time, that it was much too late to send them away, and if the goods were left there I should have them prepared and packed ready to go, he said "No," they had got packing cases of their own, and they would prepare and send them that night—he waited, having the man there, and I asked the man in the presence of the prisoner if he was Messrs. Beaumont's man, and he said he was—I have seen him since—he is the porter of Sambrook Court—the goods were taken away at about 6 o'clock in the evening—I arranged I should call on them the following morning which I did—the prisoner was there and Ferdinand came in after—Ferdinand said in the prisoner's presence that the goods had gone off to Birmingham that morning, and then we had the conversation about the bill—I wanted cash for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptance"—I produced my stamped bill in blank, and he produced another stamp from his pocket, and another bill for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn, and they were accepted by Ferdinaud Marchant, and were handed to me—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got no money whatever—they were signed "E. Beaumont &amp; Co."—they came due and I never got a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—as to the commission I said to the prisoner "It is customory to give the commission when the goods are paid for, that is my experience"—he said he thought otherwise, and he was going to take a tobacconist's business in the Edgware Road—I was curious enough to ask the man's name, and he said "Johnson," and he said he wanted the money to buy the business, which he had agreed to do for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I demurred at paying—there were two silk dresses I had of which I believe he had samples—they are not in the ordinary course of my trade, but were taken on a contra account from some person, and he agreed to take them and the balance (2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) in money, which I gave him—I went to Sambrook Court about a week afterwards, when they seemed to be getting on with their business as usual—I did not see any one at first, but ultimately I saw Ferdinand Marchant—my suspicions were then aroused that my goods had been taken from me by fraud—I did not speak to the prisoner about it, though 1 saw him at the time—they wanted to get some more goods from a person in the Hackney Road—I did not speak to Ferdinand in the prisoner's presence—I met him at the entrance of the door and said I must request his address where he slept last night—I then pressed him—he refused to give it to me at first, and I said "If you do not I shall give you into the custody of a police-constable"—he then took out his pocket book and took out two envelopes, one bearing the address of "34, Mount Pleasant, Gray's Inn Lane," and the other "8, Mount Pleasant"—on the following day I applied for a warrant to issue from Old Jewry against the prisoner—I never saw Ferdinand afterwards—I went to the place of business again and found the boy there, who said they had gone away—I have been there since the boy left—I could not get in, it was shut up—when I got the address, was Friday, the 18th November—I have since had occasion to go to Paris where I saw Adrian in charge of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner called on me neither of us said any<lb></lb>thing about commission of 5 per cent.—it was spoken about after the de<lb></lb>livery of the goods, before the bill of exchange, because I mentioned to his brother then that I had to pay him commission, and that I could not take off the discount—the commission was not mentioned except at the conclu<lb></lb>sion of the sale of the goods in question—I knew he was selling on commis<lb></lb>sion for a tenant of mine, and I assumed there would be a commission, as it was his living—he did not tell me he was to make a profit of the trans<lb></lb>action—I knew I was not selling to him—the reference was given to me the day before the goods were delivered—I called on Mr. Purvey in Bedford Square—he has a house there and servants—there is a Mr. Underwood of Birmingham—I believe he is not here, neither is Mr. Clarke.</p>

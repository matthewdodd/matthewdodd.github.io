               <p>The prisoner at the bar came the 2d of April to my house, and asked for a lodging, he brought some meat in his hand, he said, he had been making particular enquiry about me, my wife broiled his meat for supper, he went to bed about dusk, I was busy at work; when I came in I told my wife he locked more like a thief than any thing else; he behaved very well that day and the next night; which was Saturday night, he went to bed very soon, and he got up that night and went out, my wife heard him.</p>
               <p>You did not hear him? - No, I did not, on Sunday the I got up very early, he had opened the door, one of which was locked and barred; when I got up I found the door open where he slept, I thought he was a thief, and the things were taken that is mentioned in the indictment, and from the mantle-piece over the tap-room he had taken a very large brass pestle and mortar, and a pair of large candlesticks, I searched a little further in my hurry before I had any clothes upon me; he bespoke a bit of bacon to keep him the next week, instead of which he had stolen all the bacon, and there was a parcel of pieces of linen put up in an old pillow case; there were three beds in the room he slept in, he had one to himself, one was empty, and the other a poor old man of fourscore laid in, there were four sheets and two blankets; when I came down in the morning, the door was unlocked, and he gone, and all the things gone, and the door shut after him, it was unbolted, the bar down, and the bolts drawn; I happened to go to Brentford market, and saw the prisoner; I found none of the things, the prisoner was taken up on the Tuesday following, about eleven, I took him near Turnham Green, going into the country; I took him to the Pack-horse; the first thing I said was, here you are, I have been many a mile after you, and I will swear to you, he said nothing, but hung down his head.</p>

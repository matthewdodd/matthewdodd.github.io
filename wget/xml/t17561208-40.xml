At my going out of town I had lent him a pair of leather breeches. They were ripped in the side. He left me in the country, and would not serve me at Maidstone-Fair, and I challenged these to be my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Earles. I live in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you charge him with stealing the breeches which you lent him?</p>
               <p>Earles. No. I challenged another pair upon him which I remarkably knew, by their being flit up the seam. The pair laid in the indictment are not them which I lent him. When I challenged them, he had them upon him, and he afterwards confessed them to be mine before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any parcels of breeches committed to his care?</p>
               <p>Earles. No, none at all to him.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose care were they ?</p>
               <p>Earles. I had them in my own care.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not fell for you did he ?</p>
               <p>Earles. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Council. Then he must necessarily be trusted with them.</p>
               <p>Earles. Yes, he had a right to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What any of them ?</p>
               <p>Earles. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. You say you lent him a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Earles. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of them ?</p>
               <p>Earles I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not sell them, and account for them to you?</p>
               <p>Earles. I will not take upon me to say he has, or he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he ever accounted with you for those breeches that you found upon him?</p>
               <p>Earles. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you before the mayor of Maidstone?</p>
               <p>Earles. Not about a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you there say you thought he did not take these breeches with an intent to steal them, but to make use of them; having accounted for the others you lent him ?</p>
               <p>Earles. I never said so.</p>

               <p>Earle. It is customary in our trade for our journeymen to wear those cheap breeches, but not to sell them for doe skin. They wear them that poor people may imagine they are better made, and a better sort; but they are not to run away with them.</p>

             in taking the examination of the prosecutor, relating to something that he charged the prisoner with having stolen. It was a pair of breeches. Some circumstances appeared very extraordinary, and of such a nature as might well justify our taking bail for Goston's appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take bail?</p>
               <p>Justice Pell. We did; upon the whole it appeared to us it was owing to a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prosecutor did not say he believed the prisoner took the breeches with no felonious intent.</p>
               <p>Pell. He did say so; after I had open'd the nature of the design he was carrying on, I put it close to him whether he could with a safe conscience see this man convicted for stealing these breeches, and receive the punishment in consequence thereof. He said, '' Sir, I don't believe he did design to rob me, the whole affair was but a quarrel. I employed him at two fairs, Sittingbourn for one, where he received a great deal of money for me, for which I made him an allowance; and after that he took me up, and with great barbarity carried me before the mayor. After that I charg'd him with having my breeches; then coming to town, and being advised by some attorney, the sessions being then begun at Hicks's-Hall, I went and got a bench warrant, and had him taken up.'' He went farther and said, it was customary in trade, when they contract for those people whom they call barkers to attend them at fairs, to give them breeches in order to wear, and as I understood it, with intent to impose on those that came to buy. On my examining Goston, he told me he had sold three or four pair of breeches which he had worn at the same fair; and as it appear'd (those being sold) he must have return'd either without breeches or have put on a pair of his master's, I brought both parties to this, for both to leave their disputes. The prosecutor had challeng'd Goston with a pair of breeches; the other said they were his, and he was to wear them till he got to town, and then they were to reckon and settle. It was recommended by an attorney to draw up articles of agreement between them, and they agreed to it. There was a gentleman who said he had trusted Goston with hundreds of pounds, and it was customary in that trade for the servants to put breeches on when they go out of town, in order to wear them, and then sell them for second-hand breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is it not customary in the trade to lend people in the situation of the prisoner breeches to go down to fairs with, on such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

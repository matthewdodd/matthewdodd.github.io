I live with my father, Thomas Wallis, of the Brick-layer's Arms, Lower Norwood—one evening between the 14th and 21st of March, the prisoner came there—I do not remember the date—she had a glass of spirits, and gave me a bad shilling—I put it between my teeth, tried it, and gave it her back—it was soft—I told her it was bad, and she gave me some coppers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer-seller, at Knight's-hill, Lower Norwood—on Friday, 13th March, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a glass of ale—I served her, and she gave me a twoshilling piece—I tried it, to see if I could bend it, I thought I had not, and put it on the shelf—as soon at the prisoner was gone I detected it—I had given her the change, and she was very soon gone—I went to look for her, but did not find her—I put the twoshilling piece in a box on the top of the shelf, apart from other money, and a fortnight afterwards I gave it to a constable—on Satur<lb></lb>day night, 21st March, the prisoner came again and asked for a glass of ale—I served her—she gave me in payment a bad twoshilling piece—I knew her as soon as she came in at the door—I told her it was bad before I looked at it—I saw it was bad when I did look at it—I went round to the door to keep her from going out, telling her I could not put up with this, I should give her into custody—I told her she had called upon me about a fortnight ago, and given me a bad twoshilling piece for a glass of ale, and that I had given her the change—she said she did not recollect coming before—I then sent for a constable—my wife was behind the bar at the time, and she said, if the prisoner would give back the change, and pay for the two glasses of ale she had had, as it was a busy night, we would let her go—she then gave my wife a good half-crown, and she gave her a threepenny piece back—I then told her to be off about her business, and never come there again—I kept both the bad florins—about a quarter of an hour after she left, a constable came back with her in custody—I gave him one florin on that day, and the other on the Sunday evening.</p>

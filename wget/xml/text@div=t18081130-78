I did; I have a sample here; they are a heavy sample of Irish oats and beans, which are of a particular quality. It is my practice with my coachmen to serve out half a bushel of oats and beans for the day; they are put down together and turned up with a shovel.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there at the time - A. He was, but I did not know who they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the bag with the beans and oats to Mr. Holt - A. I did not, I set them down in the house and went out to my horses directly; I put them down in the presence of Mr. Holt.</p>

            . I keep the Angel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness bringing in a bag containing oats and beans - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag contained oats and beans - A. There was about a peck and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house at the time - A. He was in company with Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper, we called him Jem. The prisoner was making high words with the cook; when this bag was brought in he ceased to be quarrelling; the horsekeeper took up his hat and lanthorn and went home. The prisoner sat silent a little, then he took the bag and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Fagg's man lodge in your house - A. No; in the neighbourhood. I asked the prisoner at the door how he came by that corn; he said he had got it at Uxbridge; I said I should like to see a sample; he said nothing, but went on homewards; I followed him, I went to his door, I called halloa; the prisoner came out; I said I was not satisfied respecting the corn, and insisted upon seeing some of it; I asked him where the bag was; he said the bag was within doors, but the corn was in the stable, the horse was eating of it. He conducted me to the stable; I went up to the manger and took out, with his leave, some handfuls of the corn; I then came home with the corn; it was oats and beans mixed, I have got a sample of the corn that I took out of the bag that night; the prisoner followed me and asked me what I hurried for; I said I have got what I wanted and I thought I should soon have him. The constable has the sample that I took from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was the prisoner taken up - A. When I returned home I sat down in my own room; the prisoner came in and sat down; he went out; I judged he was gone to the horsekeeper; I went to the horsekeeper's room, he was gone out; it was about nine o'clock. I went to the magistrate to advise with him what was best to do. The prisoner was apprehended that night; I went to the horsekeeper; he gave me the key; I brought him to my house; he went away before I could get a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's examination taken in writing - A. It was not, I believe. The prisoner said that he got them from Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper out of the bin; he said the horsekeeper owed him two shillings; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300056"></xptr>called upon him for two shillings in order to buy corn for his horse; the horsekeeper said I cannot pay you, I will give you some corn out of the bin; he said that was the only time he had ever had corn of the horsekeeper; he knew those that had it.</p>

               <p>COURT, to Holt. Do they appear to be the same corn as Mr. Fagg's corn, so far as you can speak to your knowledge - A. I believe them to be samples of the same corn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are precisely the same sort of corn.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the value of these oats and beans - A. The beans about two shillings, and the oats about one, rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The justice wanted me to confess, and almost urged me to say it; they said they would quit me if I would tell the truth; by their urging of me I said I had them of the horsekeeper</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

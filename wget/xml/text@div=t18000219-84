               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Those nails are similar to those you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost thirty or forty pounds, and the prisoner had only two or three pounds? - A. Five pounds and three quarters.</p>

               <p>Q. Nailers that made those nails, did not make them for you only, but for others as well? - A. Certainly.</p>

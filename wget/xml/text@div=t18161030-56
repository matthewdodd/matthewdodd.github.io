            . About nine o'clock on the night of the 12th of October, I went to get a pot of beer; my husband went with me. When I came into the passage, I saw a strange woman come out at the door with my candle in her hand; she said I have got your candle. I said who are you, and what do you do with my candle, what have you been in my room for; she said she wanted me, and was sent by a person who lived opposite. I asked her who, and she said she did not know the name; but she said if I would let her go down stairs, she would fetch the woman, but I said no, I fear you have robbed me. I called to the lodgers to open the door on the same floor; I asked them if they knew the prisoner, and they said no. I called out stop her, she has robbed me. Then she said, no I have nothing; see, I have nothing in my hands. With that they looked about her clothes, and found under her apron an apron of mine, wet, which I had just washed; it had hung on the back of a chair, presently we found the remainder of the things thrown carelessly down, but within the door.</p>

             is indebted to him in the sum of twenty-seven pounds, for money that the said John Kelly had and received for the use of the deponent, and this deponent maketh oath that it has not yet been paid to him.</p>
               <p>MR. COOK. Q. What public-house did M'Laghan keep at the time of the appraisement - A. The Black Horse in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed on his part to survey the furniture - A. I was employed by Mr. Nicolls, the comer-in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was employed by Mr. Laghan - A. Mr. Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you an inventory of the goods - A. I have, and the receipt of the sum total. The sum total was fifty-six pounds ten shillings. This valuation was made on the 27th of December, 1810. The account was settled between M'Laghan and Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the settlement did any person attend - A. Yes, the brewer's clerk and the distiller's clerk. The brewer was the landlord; he received the rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money paid by Kelly to him - A. Yes, by M'Laghan's request. Mr. Kelly asked M'Laghan if he should pay the creditors: M'Laghan said, yes. The money was paid to the creditors. There was some money left: I saw that handed over to M'Laghan. I cannot speak to the actual sum. The money paid over to the defendant he received as all that was coming to him without any objection, and he seemed very well satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the total charge of Mr. Kelly for his trouble on that occasion - A. Six guineas; that is a fair sum for the trouble he had with it, and whatever was the remaining sum was paid over to M'Laghan.</p>

            . Were you employed by M'Laghan at the Black Horse in Barbican - A. Yes. One hundred and ninety-six pound was the appraisement. This appraisement was made in the book at the time; one hundred and thirty-six pound five shillings and five-pence was the balance after deducting the taxes and rent from one hundred and ninety-six pound five shillings and five-pence. One hundred and thirty-six pound five shillings and five pence was the sum the defendant had to receive. My clerk made this accompt in my presence; that money was in my possession. On the 26th, me and Cook settled the business. It is usual to have all the tradesmen who have demands on the public-house; they were present. There was Mr. Dellafere for a book debt; the landford for a years rent had forty-five pound; the book debt, I think, was fifty-three pound two shillings and five pence; Mr. Maxwell, the cooper, for guaging, one pound six shillings and six pence. Mr. Windus, the distiller's account, was fifteen pound fifteen shillings and eight pence; then there is six guineas added to it, my charge, that was deducted that made one hundred and twenty-seven ten shillings and seven pence, leaving in my hands a balance of sixty-eight pounds fourteen shillings and ten pence. I paid him the balance before all the gentlemen present. My clerk put all the notes down. I paid him either with my own hands or by my clerk, and he was very well satisfied. This was on the 27th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. From that 27th of December until May, 1812, was there any money transaction between him and you - A. None, whatever. When the agreement was first entered into he received the deposit himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterward arrested at his suit - A. Yes, on or somewhere about the 5th of November, 1812, in Castle-street, Leicester-square. I advertised his house; that money was to be paid me again. I had two pounds of him for advertising the house. I think that was the sum itself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in custody - A. Not long. The gentlemen of the office took my word to find bail. I was not in custody a great while.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor addressed the jury in behalf of the defendant, and Mr. Adolphus replied.</p>

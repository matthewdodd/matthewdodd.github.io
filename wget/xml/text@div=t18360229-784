                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Broughton-place, Hack<lb></lb>ney-road. On Wednesday, the 13th of January, the prisoner came to my house, complaining of a rheumatic affection in one of her thumbs—I looked, and said I would attend to it—she said she would call in half an hour—soon after she was gone I missed this brass powder-folder—she never came again.</p>

Since that I have referred to my book: a particular circumstance occurred, and I can swear to the day—I have not the least doubt she is the person; and with respect to the swelling of her thumb. I see now one of her thumbs is swelled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Miller, a pawnbroker, of the Kingsland-road. This powder-folder was pledged by the prisoner for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 13th of January—I am positive she is the person—she came again on the 29th, and then I stopped her—she came to get an affidavit of a cloak she pawned at the same time as she pawned this—I am posi<lb></lb>tive she is the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I went to your house on the 29th, I asked you for an affidavit of a cloak—you asked, "What name?"—I said I did not know whether it was Webb or Jordan; because I lent it to a person of the name of Webb. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

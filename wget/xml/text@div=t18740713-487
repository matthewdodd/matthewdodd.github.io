                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Parnall as foreman in the cutting department—Betts has been four years in the service as salesman, and Taylor was for seven or eight years up to November last in my department—he left early in November, and started in business in High Street, Kingsland—up to 12th December last he was a customer at Messrs. Farnham's for ready money, and after that up to 1st June he was a customer on credit—I have seen him there frequently during that time pur<lb></lb>chasing of Betts among other salesmen—on 1st June I saw him there making purchases of Betts; on that occasion I particularly noticed them—I saw one piece measured by Betts, not in Taylor's presence, after he had gone—he was with Betts about a quarter of an hour that day—after leav<lb></lb>ing Betts, Taylor went into another department and purchased something; I only saw him in one department after Betts—in the course of the after<lb></lb>noon I caused inquiries to be made at the entering desk and then went to our head clerk, and also to the packing department; I there found six parcels from Betts' department addressed to Taylor—I took one piece away and measured it, it was 20 yards—it was not the same piece I had seen Betts measure; this is the piece—these are the six pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130037"></xptr>
               <p>that were in the packing-room—after measuring that piece I communi<lb></lb>cated with the head clerk, and next morning, 2nd June, I went to a drawer of Betts' in the counter, and found there these two pieces of paper; they are Betts' writing—the sis parcels-were left in the packing-room all night, and were sent to Taylor's next day by Vale, the porter—it is customary for the packers to leave one end of the parcel open—these parcels were not open at one end when I saw them in the packing department—they were all tied over.</p>

Parnall's on his premises?—he said no, only those two pieces he brought away the day before—I then sent for Mr. Williams, who is in Messrs. Parnall's employ—Taylor said that he never bought more at a time than would make a pair of trowsers or a waistcoat or a suit—Mr. Williams came and said, referring to those three parcels, "This is Messrs. Parnall's cloth"—Taylor said "Yes, you are quite right. I bought them of Betts"—I said "How long is it since you had them?"—he said "About two months ago"—the top one was I believe marked 9182, and I asked him how much the quantity was—he said "That I bought for 3 yards and I have used 3/4 of a yard"—Mr. Williams measured it, and I measured it also; it is 4 1/4 yards now—the second piece is numbered 7443—he said "I bought that about the same time for 7 yards," and that he had not used any of it—it measured 8 3/4 yards—he said "I bought the light-coloured cloth for 10 yards and used 1 1/2 yards of it"—it was measured and contained 13 yards—I asked him about the invoices—he looked on his file and said that he could not find them, and I looked after<lb></lb>wards—while I sent the officer for one of Mr. Parnall's men Taylor referred to a piece of cloth and said "When we go to a firm they sometimes do give us a yard or two in; you need not say anything about that"—I said "I would rather you would not say that, because whatever you say to me I shall have to mention at the Police Court"—I took him to the station and took charge of the cloth, the buckles, and the braid—on 3rd June, after he was remanded, I made a further search and found this piece of braid on a shelf under some velvet in the shop—Betts wanted to see me—I went to the station and he gave me some information about the braid—I then saw Taylor, showed him the braid, and said "Betts says that you were there with him on the Monday and asked him to get you a piece of braid and you understood that he was not to enter it"—Taylor said 'That is quite right; I shall say nothing to you, what I have got to say I shall say to the Magistrate up stairs"—he also said "I have been seen at the Old Bailey and have been told all what you have found, so you see it is no news to me"—I had previously cautioned him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the entering department—I find in my book an entry on 8th April in my writing—I made it from information given me by Betts—when goods are sold Betts calls them over and I enter them, and then I call them back again to check it—the goods here entered to J. Taylor, of Kingsland, are numbered 7,440 to 7,447, omitting 7,443, and the total amount is 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have another entry on 1st June—from information given me by Betts, six lots of cloth and a gross and a half of buckles to J. Taylor; total, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have entered the ready<lb></lb>made clothing as well—that would be entered by somebody else, but it went into the same invoice which was made out and sent with the goods—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Betts came to me with a piece of paper with the lengths on—he sometimes came with them in a book, sometimes on a piece of paper—he calls them over to me, I don't look at his paper—the lengths are measured before that—a parcel may contain 100 yards or 10 yards—there is no check that I know of, but I should not like to say—I do not send in the account, the ledger is in the counting-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Parnall &amp; Co.—on 2nd June, I was sent for to Taylor's shop, and found him there and Davis—I saw the three pieces of cloth there; one is numbered 9,182, and the quantity is marked "3"—I know that as being in our possession—Taylor said that he had bought it for 3 yards and had used three quarters</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I was in Messrs. Parnall's service about five years as warehouseman and salesman—Taylor was a cutter in the service when I first entered—he left last November—we knew each other—after he left we were rather friendly; and he invited me to go and see him at his shop, 80, High Street, Kingsland—on one occasion when I was there an end of silk attracted my attention—I recognised it as being in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's stock previously—I told him so, and he said "It is not worth while saying anything about it now, I have had it by me these twelve months and am afraid to use it in case it should be recognised"—he also said that he would show me how I could make a pound or two for myself—I asked him in what way?—he said "When I order any goods you can send mo longer goods than I order and charge them the lowest price, and if there is any difficulty about it, we can settle it when you come to see me again, I can make it right with you"—this was about the beginning of December, before he had opened the shop—Lam sorry to say that I fell in with his views, and the first parcel he had was early in January—I entered the parcels in fictitious descriptions and less lengths—the mis<lb></lb>description was to account for the size of the parcels; 10 yards of pilot would make as large a parcel as 20 yards of fine cloth—he told me if I did it in that way that would account for the size of the pieces—I should think our transactions amounted altogether to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I caused to be delivered goods 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in excess of what he was charged, and I have received from him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4 garments, and a length of alpaca—I cannot remember any particular instance before June 1st—on June 1st he came to the warehouse—he had told me previously that he was coming—he selected the goods which I have here and asked me to do the best I could with them—they would not make a very large parcel, and if I would let him have them he would see me next night and make it all right with me—six or seven pieces were selected—these memoranda (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the purpose of entering the goods are in my writing—he brought a pattern and said he wanted a quarter gross of mohair and three gross of trim<lb></lb>ming</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130042"></xptr>
               <p>braid—I got some braid from Mr. Knocker and three gross of buckles—it was my duty to get those goods and get them entered with the cloth, and I described the three gross of buckles as a gross and a half—I gave the braid to Taylor and he put it in his pocket, and said "I will take this with me, it is not worth while entering this"—I mis-described the articles as to quality and price—this memorandum agrees with the invoice—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was found in my desk is in my writing, it is a correct list which I was to keep in case I was interrogated—Taylor told me to say that I had made a mistake in entering them—I used to see him at his shop in the evening sometimes once and sometimes twice a week—I had not stolen anything when he spoke to me about making a pound or two—I never stole any other things but those I sent to Taylor—I was in the cloth line before I went into Parnall's service—I was with Moses &amp; Levi two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never stole anything but what I stole for Taylor, but Mr. Watts told me that he had suspected me for some time—he did not say how long—some silk was lost from the alpaca department eighteen months ago—I was told to look for it but it was never traced—they thought it might have got between the fixtures—it was not under my control, I had not charge of the alpaca department, but it was adjoining my warehouse and you might call it the same—they did not examine my books—I am sorry to say that I fell a very ready victim—I fell into it thoroughly and made my fictitious entries under Taylor's guidance—he was a cutter when he was in the firm, and I have an idea that he knew all the rules of the establish<lb></lb>ment; he found out a good deal by questioning me—he gave me directions how best to steal the goods and how to secrete them—I told Mr. Watts that the goods would not reach 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not tell him I had received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides clothes; I said that I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and I thought it amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now because I have been thinking it over—I have been in custody six weeks—whenever I stole anything I made an entry of the genuine transaction for my own desk; they are not in my desk now, they would be destroyed after he got the goods, because there would be no further reason to keep them—I first became a thief about January 10th—the largest amount I have stolen at one time is 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but never to this extent before—this is 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on one occasion Taylor came and paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the cashier—one of the foremen, Mr. Leonard, a cutter, lived in Taylor's house, and he sometimes saw me when I went there—I made no secret of being there—the house is two miles and a half from the prosecutor's place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was slate coloured silk which was missed twelve months before, and it was slate coloured silk which I saw at Taylor's, and what he said was not worth inquiring about as he had had it twelve months.</p>

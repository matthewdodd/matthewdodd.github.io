               <p>Did you ever receive a note from her? - Yes, on Wednesday the 5th of March; the prisoner had owed me 100 l. and upwards for two years, for houshold furniture; she came to my house with a pretence to pay me part of this money.</p>
               <p>Where had you delivered the furniture? - At Chelsea; she told me on the 5th of March that she had a note drawn upon Mr. Tutte, for 50 l. she said, if I could discount it she would pay me 10 l. of it; knowing that there were so many forgeries about I rather suspected the note; I told her I had not cash enough in the house to discount the note, I would go and ask my neighbour that lived just by; I meant to know what he thought of it; my neighbour, Mr. Atkinson, suspected it to be a forged note; when he saw it he came back to my house and asked Mrs. Thomas if she presented that note as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? she said she did; he asked her again; she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177704090017"></xptr> again that she did; he told her he rather suspected it, because the signature of the note was not like the hand of a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Was any thing said about who he was, or what he was when the prisoner was present? - The prisoner knew that I knew Mr. Tutte very well.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Tutte live? - At Kensington-gore; Mr. Atkinson proceeded to ask several other questions; whether she would chuse that he should enquire of Mr. Tutte concerning this note? he said he would discount the note for me, but he did not chuse to discount the note without he knew the person well that it was drawn upon; Mrs. Thomas said that Mr. Tutte was at Oxford; he asked her if he should write to him? she did not chuse that that should be done; he asked her how it came if Mr. Tutte was at Oxford that the signature should be one hand and the body of the note another? her answer was, that the note was written by a person in town and sent in a letter to him to Oxford, for him to sign, and then returned back to her; Mr. Atkinson said, he would decline having any thing to do with the note; he went out of my parlour, I followed him to the door: said he, I will go to one Barnarda, I think the name is, that keeps a confectioner's shop in the Haymarket; for there Mrs. Thomas said she had paid a note of Mr. Tutte's a little before, and that Barnarda would give satisfaction that this was a real note; Mr. Atkinson said, if I would keep her in suspense a little time he would go and enquire; he came back and said Mr. Barnarda told him he had received such a note; he said, if you go to Mr. Strong who is attorney for Mr. Tutte, he will know the signature as he does business for him; when Mr. Atkinson told me that, I asked Mrs. Thomas for the note again, and told her I would try elsewhere to get cash for it; we took it to Mr. Strong; he said it was not Mr. Tutte's hand-writing, and advised me to take Mrs. Thomas before Sir

               <p>Upon the afternoon of the 25th of March Mr. Blades brought me a note; he told me he was to receive some money out of it in part of the payment of an old debt contracted by Mrs. Thomas; I went to Mr. Blades's house; I asked her, do you present this as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? she said, she did; I asked her again, do you present this as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? I observed that the name Francis was not rightly spelt; I said it does not appear to be the hand of a gentleman; she said, gentlemen you know frequently write very bad; it is done in haste; I said, Madam, you will pardon me, there is a deal of care taken in writing of it; but it is done by a very bad writer; it appears to me to be the hand of a lady; no, said she; I said, Ma'am, will you give me leave to ask, how had you it from Mr. Tutte, from his own hands? she said, no, not from his own hands; how then? she said Mr. Tutte sent it me; said I, if you will be kind enough to leave this note with Mr. Blades, he shall walk over to Mr. Tutte's this evening; if he acknowledges it to be a true note of his, you shall upon my honor have cast for it to-morrow morning; Sir, said she, that will by no means do, for Mr. Tutte is now at Oxford; at Oxford, Madam? yes, says she; how had you the note then from Mr. Tutte? said she, I received it by a letter; I said, the note seems to be of one hand writing, the signature of another; how do you account for that? said she, I sent the note down to Mr. Tutte, and he returned it by the next post to me signed; I still objected to it; she said, it was a matter of indifference to her, if Mr. Blades or I did not chuse to give cash for the note, there was a Mr. Barnarda, who kept an 'Italian warehouse in the Haymarket, who was perfectly acquainted with Mr. Tutte and his hand-writing; that the last week he had given her cash for a note of Mr. Tutte's; hearing this, though it was a very suspicious thing, yet I thought if my friend Mr. Blades had an opportunity of getting 10 l. of the money that he did not expect to get a halfpenny of, it would be an advantage; I was in hopes it might be a true note; I wished her a good evening and walked through the parlour into the shop; Mr. Blades followed me; I told him I should be exceeding glad if he could get 10 l. and that I would step across the way to Mr. Barnarda to know the truth of it; I went to Mr. Barnarda and told him the story; he said he was neither acquainted with Mr. Tutte or his hand-writing; he had seen his hand-writing once, and from seeing it that once he had an opportunity of knowing a person who could acquaint me of every circumstance; he referred me to Mr. Strong; happening to have some knowledge of Mr. Strong, Mr. Blades and I went to Mr. Strong.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You told all these suspicions to Mrs. Thomas that you believed it to be a forgery? - Indirectly, I did tell her so.</p>
               <p>Enough for her to understand you? - Sufficiently so.</p>
               <p>She directed you to a Mr. Barnarda who had discounted a note of Mr. Tutte's? - No; and if you please I will give you my reasons for saying that.</p>
               <p>Counsel. No, I don't want your reason.</p>
               <p>Do you know he did not? - I know he did not.</p>
               <p>This woman staid there the whole time while you went to enquire about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She told you she had received this note from the hands of Mr. Tutte by the post? - Yes.</p>

             of Kensington-gore? - I do.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - Yes; I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Look at the name subscribed to that note, and tell me if you can say, whether it is his writing or not? - I don't believe it is.</p>
               <p>What are your reasons for not believing it is? - It is very different from his usual way of writing.</p>
               <p>In his usual way of writing, how does he spell his Christian name? - Francis.</p>
               <p>This is spelt Frencis? - It is.</p>
               <p>Independent of that circumstance of the spelling being not like his manner of spelling, is the character like his? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Then upon the whole do you or not take it to be his hand-writing? - I don't believe it is.</p>

               <p>He sent them sometimes by the post? - That I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have these declarations of his been since this affair or before? - Since this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tutte is a student of Christ Church, Oxford, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And I believe he chiefly resides there? - No; he now resides at Kensington-gore; he has been appointed committee of a lunatic.</p>
               <p>But still is a student of Christ Church? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There have been some connections in the family between Mr. Tutte and Mrs. Thomas? - That is not within my own knowledge; I have heard so.</p>

               <p>COURT. Mr. Blades says they asked the question; they both say she knew that they knew that she was acquainted with Mr. Tutte.</p>

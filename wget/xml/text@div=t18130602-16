            . Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her - A. Yes. On the 28th of April last, between seven and eight in the evening, she came up stairs; I lodge up one pair of stairs. I saw her come from my bed-room door; she went up the second pair; I was in the front-room. On hearing a noise I came to the door, and went into the passage: I came outside of the front room door, I saw the prisoner come from the bed-room; she went up the second floor, and asked for a false name; she asked for the name of Clark. I went into my bedroom, and found my watch was gone; it hung in the pocket at the head of the bed; I had seen it about ten minutes before the prisoner came on the staircase. It was a metal gilt enamelled watch; I gave seven pounds for the watch; I think it is worth forty shillings. When I came out of the bed-room, the prisoner was coming down the second pair of stairs. The person of the house came up the first pair of stairs, and stopped her; she saw my watch in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again - A. Not till the next morning; a lamp-lighter picked it up, and brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the girl was coming down stairs what did you do - A. She pushed by the person of the house, and went into the street; I ran after her, and Mrs. Smith ran after her; we cried stop thief: an officer came at the time, and took her. I saw her searched, nothing was found upon her, but a gold pin. The prisoner was taken in custody. That is all I know.</p>

            . Q. You keep this house, do you - A. I do; I am a widow. When the prisoner was on the stair-case, I was below; I heard a noise like breaking of glass on the stairs. This was between seven and eight in the evening. I ran up stairs, and finding a strange girl there, I asked her how she dare take the liberty of going up stairs without knocking or asking. She said, she did. The lower room is a shop, there is a private door in the passage; she had opened the private door in the passage, and went up stairs. The prisoner passed me on the stairs; I saw a watch in her hand; I screamed out that she had got the watch. I saw the watch, seal, and ribbon. She pushed by me, and ran out into the street, through the passage; I and

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn; Field-lane is in my beat. On the 26th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was on duty in Holborn, near Field-lane - I heard a confusion, like people wrangling; I ran to the spot in Field-lane, and observed a number of people standing, and the prosecutor in the middle of them, without his hat; his head was cut, and bleeding profusely - there were about twenty people round him; I asked him what had happened; he said he had been knocked down by a party, and been ill-treated, and pointed to the prisoner as the first who struck him - he then said he had lost his hat and handkerchief; I could find neither of them on the ground - I then attempted to take the prisoner; I do not mean to say that he ran, but he sidled away; I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house - he said nothing when the prosecutor charged him with knocking him down; he said nothing to me about the prosecutor having insulted any female, but when he had been two or three minutes in the watch-house, he said he had been taking liberties with his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point out where his sister was? A. He did not - I looked out at the door for the person, and there was a woman of loose character at the watch-house door, but when I opened it, she ran away - his brother followed him down to the watch-house, and was about to name something of the kind, but no sister appeared; the brother said he had not seen it done, and no attempt was made to bring forward the sister - I understood that his mother, sister, and brother were all at Guildhall; but they did not offer to give evidence, nor interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person who was represented at Guildhall as his sister, in Field-lane, when this happened? A. No, my Lord; the prosecutor complained of being hurt about the body with kicks - his head was cut, and bleeding very much; I did not examine the wound; it was on the back part of his head - I never saw the hat or handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the prosecutor in liquor? A. He appeared to have been drinking a little, but was perfectly sensible - he gave his statement to me very clearly.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 1, Peter-street, Saffronhill, and go out washing - I was going down Field-lane, about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock on this night, and saw the prisoner knock the prosecutor down; three or four girls stood by, who appeared more like prostitutes than any thing else - I saw no other man; when he was knocked down, the girls fell on him, and beat him - one of them said, "Pitch into the b - y b - r;" his head was cut, and his hat knocked off; it could not be found afterwards; he was got up by the assistance of some persons who came round; his head was cut very much, and bled very much - he appeared almost senseless; he asked for his hat, but it was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him walking before the prisoner gave him the blow? A. No; I came by at that moment; he appeared to have been drinking a little, but very little - when he was lifted up, he was able to give an account of himself, not as if he was stupified with liquor - the prisoner said he would go and fetch his brother; a young man came up, whom he called his brother, and inquired into the case, and the watchman came up and took him - I saw no man by at the time the prisoner knocked the prosecutor down; I did not see him take liberties with any girl - the girls went away when the prisoner was taken; neither of them said that the prosecutor had been insulting them, or I must have heard it - I think I have seen the prisoner about that quarter before; I know none of his family.</p>

            . I am an officer of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - Wesson was bleeding very much from behind his head, and accused the prisoner of knocking him down, and said his hat and handkerchief were taken away while he was on the ground; the prisoner denied the charge; he denied striking him; no female came into the watch-house - a man, who called himself his brother, came in, but nobody else - his mother, brother, and a young woman, who he said was his sister, were at Guildhall, but were not before the Alderman; the young woman made no complaint against the prosecutor to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The prisoner is fourteen years old; he has been employed by Mr. Brittle, of Denmark-street, Soho, glass-blower. On Tuesday, the 26th of December, about ten o'clock, the prisoner was going to his place of residence, Richard's-buildings, Field-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110026"></xptr>in company with his sister, a young girl, twelve years of age, they met the prosecutor coming from Saffron-hill down Field-lane, towards Holborn-hill - he was very much intoxicated, so much so, that he could scarcely stand; he began to take very unbecoming liberties with the prisoner's sister, which induced the prisoner to interfere, and, after remonstrating with the prosecutor for such gross behaviour, the prosecutor made no more ado but knocked the prisoner down, and in the scuffle the prosecutor's hat fell off; some person on the spot picked it up, and ran away with it; it is most likely some person belonging to the Jews' shops in Field-lane had ran away with it. The prosecutor caused the prisoner to be taken to the watch-house, and he was committed for trial. After having the prisoner taken, he could not find his hat, nor could he prove that the prisoner was in company with any other boy that evening, as he was merely going with his sister. The only person who can prove having seen any thing of the affray, is a woman, who says she saw it as she stood at the bottom of Holborn-hill, near the end of Field-lane; the situation of which does not run immediately in a straight direction, and it is impossible the woman can speak the truth. The prisoner's late master can give him a good character, and, if the Court will discharge him, will take him into his service immediately.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I live at No. 1, Richard's-buildings, Field-lane, and get my living by crying things in the street. I was not with my brother when this happened, but he ran home to me before he was given in charge; he came to me about five minutes before ten o'clock, and said, "Come, for a drunken man is ill-using your sister."</p>
               <p>Q. This was before ten o'clock? A. Five minutes before ten. My sister is twelve years old - she was coming home with my brother to my house, it being boxingday; she lives over the water, in Christ-church parish - he did not bring her with him when he came to complain. When I came up, I heard a man crying out that he had lost his hat - this was before ten o'clock; he was very much intoxicated, and could scarcely stand; he was reeling about - I asked him what was the matter; he said he had lost his hat, and that was all he said, and all that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not see him streaming with blood? A. No, not at the time I saw him, he was not, as I perceived - the watchman came up, and took my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear his head was not cut, and streaming with blood at that time? A. I could not see it - I will not swear it was not so; I saw it bleeding in the watch-house, when he showed it, but not before - his hat was off when I came up, but Field-lane is a very dark place, and there are no lamps: when I came up, my sister was in Field-lane, several spaces from him; I sent her home; I did not attend the examination at Guildhall - I was at work; my sister did not go - she was over the water - I am sure she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain before a Justice of this man having ill-used her? A. No - my mother lives at No. 2, Brunswick-place, Brunswick-street, Christ-church - my sister lives with her - I heard her give an account of what happened that night; I did not take her to the watch-house to state it; they would not let any one in - they shoved me out three times - my sister followed me and my wife; I heard her tell the people outside the watch-house door, of the prosecutor having taken liberties with her - she did not tell the watchman; she was about as far from him as I am from your Lordship; there was no time to complain, for he was dragged away like a dog - she could have called out that he had insulted her, but I do not think she could have been heard at that distance, because there was such a tumult of people and such a bother - I did not hear her say any thing; I was following my brother - I saw the watchman ill-use him very much; he shoved me out of the watch-house - I was afraid to speak, for fear of being locked up myself.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and am in Christ-church school - I was twelve years old last September. I and my brother were coming up Field-lane on boxing-night; the prosecutor met us, and began indecency with me, he being so much intoxicated with liquor; I had hold of my brother's hand - my brother asked what he did it for, and he struck my brother - he was terribly drunk - indeed, he reeled up against me, and began to maul me about: he laid hold of the bottom of my petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. He struck your brother; did he knock him down? A. No; but by his striking my brother, he fell down - he did not fall from any blow; nobody struck him at all he fell from his drunkenness; he fell into a door-way on his back - he got up, and struck my brother a second time - I did not see my brother strike him; I was then crying from his ill-usage - he fell down again, and hit his head against the side of the door-post; he got up again, and said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody touched him? A. No; my brother went to fetch my eldest brother from Richard's-buildings - I staid by the prosecutor; I did not fetch my brother - it was the prisoner who did; I stood by the prosecutor the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nobody to take care of you, if he had chosen to be impudent again? A. There was a moltitude of people round; I waited till my eldest brother and the prisoner came back - he did not touch me when the people were there; they were not women of the town who were round; there was only one young woman there besides me, she was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you out so late at night? A. I came out at six o'clock, and had been getting my Christmas-boxes - I had no other time, because I was at school before - I got the Christmas-boxes over the water, where my mother lives; I have been in Field-lane at night before, and was never insulted - I went to the watch-house with my eldest brother, but they would not let either of us in; I saw the watch-house door open, but could not get in - I saw the watchman lay hold of my brother, but was not near enough to tell him I had been ill-used; I was as near to him as I am to your Lordship; I could not tell him for the multitude of people and the noise - I said, "Please, sir, that gentleman insulted me first" - many people heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110027"></xptr>that; my eldest brother was with my younger brother then - I told the people he had taken liberties with me, and many people spoke to him.</p>

             re-examined. I did not see this witness there when I took the prisoner - I did not notice any woman there, but I was intent on taking the prisoner; no complaint was made of the prosecutor having taken indecent liberties with any woman - if the witness had complained when she was as near to me as I am to your Lordship, I must have heard her.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Now, will you persist in this story, after what you have heard? A. Yes- I swear it is true. I did not go before the Magistrate the next morning, for I was ill at home, at my mother's - my mother and sister-in-law went, but I was ill, from the ill-usage of this man, and the blows I got from the multitude.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck you? A. The prosecutor did; he struck me about the head three times, and knocked me down - he gave another young woman a black, eye thinking it was me; I did not know her - she went away, and I did not hear her complain. I did not tell any Justice or watchman that the prosecutor had struck me, or behaved indecent - he struck me on the back of the head, with his knuckles; I had a low-crowned bonnet on, and it hurt me - I had a sick head-ache the next day, and could hardly get out of bed; I laid in bed till three o'clock in the afternoon - I had no bruises - the place could not be shown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody interfere in seeing a man like that strike a little girl? A. There was nobody there then; the watchman was almost the first who came up, and when he came I was crying - my brother went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now, there was such a crowd he could not hear you complain? A. Yes - the people in Field-lane were all at their doors, but nobody interfered.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did your sister, that night, when the watchman had hold of your brother, complain that the prosecutor had struck her three times? A. I did not hear rightly what she said; she has complained of it since, scores of times - the first time I heard her mention it was when I went home from the watch-house; I did not hear her mention it at the watch-house door, but there was such a mob there; I do not know that I saw her when I followed my brother to the watch-house - I did not walk home with her; she walked a great distance behind, with my wife; when she got home she said she had been much ill-used by the prosecutor, and he had struck her; I did not attend to state this to the Justice, because my only dependence is on my business. The prisoner had been about a fortnight out of employ, and got his living by selling things in the street. which his mother bought for him; he worked at Mr. Holmes' glass-house three years, and he also worked in St. Giles.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness, and live in Richard's-buildings. The prisoner came to fetch my husband about five minutes before ten o'clock, and said his sister was being ill-used by a man - my husband went out, but I did not follow till after he was in the watch-house; I found my sister outside the watch house door; she did not go there with me - my husband was then in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very late for a young girl to be out? A. She and the prisoner were both going to sleep at our house that night. She told me the prosecutor had taken indecent liberties with her, and struck her - she did not say where; I saw no mark of her having been struck - I blamed her for not giving him in charge. They would not let me into the watch-house; I called out to some of the watchmen who were coming out, that he had struck my sister, but they pushed me out; that was not the watchman who is here; I called out loud enough to be heard in the watch-house, but they would not hear me - she did not tell me where she had been struck. She went home with me that night, and slept at our house - I am sure of that; she did not sleep at her mother's that night; she got up early in the morning, went home, and went to bed again, as she tells me. I was at Guildhall when the prisoner was examined, but they would not let me in, nor yet my mother-in-law - I asked to be let in, and said I could give evidence, but they would not hear us; I said it was my brother who was in custody, but they would not suffer us to go in; my sister was at home, at her mother's, at that time - I did not go home to see how she was that afternoon, for I had business to attend to- I did not know she was ill till I saw her the next day, or two days afterwards; I heard my mother say she was ill, but did not ask what was the matter with her. I recollect now she did say to my husband she was unwell, before we went to Guildhall, when she called for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you did not hear of it till the next day? A. I did not hear my sister mention it till the next day. My mother called for us to go to Guildhall, between ten and eleven o'clock - I think my husband was at home then - he sells baked-potatoes about. I saw nobody at Guildhall, to tell them the prosecutor had struck my sister; I said I had come to speak for him, but not that I came to complain of the prosecutor having struck her.</p>

             re-examined. I did not see the prisoner till he had got up to the prosecutor. I saw no girl in his hand - there were three or four girls together, and I think one of them was like the witness - he did not appear to be leading any of them.</p>

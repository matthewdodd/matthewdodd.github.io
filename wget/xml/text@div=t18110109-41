No. On the 18th of December I saw him, I told the people of the yard if he came to let me see him; when I saw him I said, what makes you so long before you come to my yard, it is a month ago you took my stable; he said his master was taken ill at Woolwich, and he was going to him on the next day.

            . I am a constable of St. Martin's in the Fields. In consequence of information I went down to Mr. Hornby's stables, on Wednesday the 19th of December, about eleven o'clock at noon, we got a ladder and looked through the window, and saw the horse that was described in the hand-bills in Mr. Hornby's yard, Bedfordbury; Mr. Hornby was by at the time. When I looked in the stable and saw the horse, Clark broke open the stable door with a chisel that Mr. Hornby lent him, we found only one horse in that stable, that horse was claimed by Mr. Baxter himself, he came down and claimed the horse as his; the horse is now in Mr. Baxter's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrowsmith. Is the horse in Mr. Baxter's possession - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Donaldson. Did you see the prisoner - A. Not till night. In the stable I found this saddle and bridle, I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrowsmith. Look at that saddle and bridle - A. They were taken from Mr. Baxter's stable, I am positive the bridle and saddle is the property of my employer, they were in the same stable out of which the horse was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Donaldson. When did you see the prisoner after this - A. About ten minutes past five on the 19th we apprehended him coming towards the stable where the horse was in; he was about six yards from the stable; we were in another stable, we let him go past, I said I got you, and took him in custody; he was troublesome; we searched him in the public-house, we were obliged to make use of great force, we found the key of the stable upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hornby. Is that the key of the stable that you let to him - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Donaldson. After we had put him in the watch-house I and Clark went up to his lodgings, Clark told me it was his lodgings, I found his wife there. In searching his lodgings, in a pail under the dresser, I found this halter with the initials of C. B. marked upon it.</p>
               <p>Harrowsmith. I will take my oath this is the halter that I left the horse tied up with on the 17th; it is one out of the two. And the horse is a gelding.</p>

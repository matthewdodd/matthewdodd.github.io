            . I am a gardener. On the 22nd of May, in the pleasure ground of Mrs. Fisher; behind the shrubs I found a bag. I opened it; it contained a quantity of netting; supposing it to be stolen I set a man to watch it, to see who came to fetch it away. The man went at five, and watched till seven in the evening; at seven o'clock I went to see whether the man was where I wished him to be. During the time I was there, the prisoner came and tried to reach the bag over the pales with a hook stick; not being able to draw it, he got over the paling and picked up the bag; I asked him what he did there, he said he had come for that bag, he thought he could make a shilling of it; I told him he must go with me; he begged that I would look over it, and let him go, he was very sorry for what he had done, it was the first offence; he was a poor man, and had been out of work all the winter. When he was before the magistrate, he said the net belonged to Mr. Wells, and hoped they would be merciful to him. We tracked him from our paling, across the grass, to Mr. Wells's shed.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 23rd of August, I was on duty, and left my wife in my room; I came home between six and seven o'clock in the morning, found the door locked, and the key outside; I went in and found the place all in confusion - I went up stairs, and missed a number of things; my wife had absconded during the night - my house was not broken open; on the Monday morning following, I went to the station-house at Hackney, and found the prisoner in custody - my wife was there also- I found a coat and handkerchief of my own, and a night-gown of my wife's on the prisoner; I have known him between two and three months - he did not visit me, but he resided within four doors of me; he had the coat and handkerchief on.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. On Thursday morning, the 23rd of August, I was in Hackney-church-yard, and saw the prisoner, two women, and a lad, sitting on the tomb-stones, between four and five o'clock in the morning; I went and asked what they did there; the prisoner said, the woman sitting on his right was his wife, that they had just come from Canterbury, and being unable to obtain a lodging, had walked about the streets all night; I saw a bundle behind the prisoner, and asked him what it was - he said it was some things belonging to himself and his wife; I noticed a copper tea kettle, and asked if that belonged to him - he said it did; he then said he had a situation at Mr. Jackson's, who I knew, in the parish - that he had been out a few miles to meet his wife; his story appearing consistent, I did not detain him - I saw a tea-caddy in the bundle.</p>

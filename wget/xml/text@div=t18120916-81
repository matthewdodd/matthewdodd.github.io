               <p>THOMAS STICKLEY. I live in Great Windmill-street, Piccadilly. I lost the kit of salmon on the 24th of August, in the morning, about seven o'clock it was taken from Mr. Austin's cart</p>
               <p>WILLIAM AUSTIN. Q. You carry fish for the fishmongers - A. Yes; the salmon was put in my cart by Mr. Stickley. I got into the cart, and moved these kits. I got out of my cart again. I had not been out of my cart five minutes. They said, a man had been caught for thieving a kit of salmon. I ran back to my cart. I saw it was the kit belonging to Mr. Stickley.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, I saw the prisoner take the kit from Mr. Austin's cart. I thought it was not his own property. I pursued him, and took him back to the cart, and a constable was sent for. The prisoner said, that Mr. Martin had sent him for the kit. This is the kit.</p>
               <p>Stickley That is my kit.</p>

This morning I came over London-bridge; a man asked me if I wanted a job, I said I did. He said, if I would carry that kit of salmon on in his cart, he would give me sixpence. Mr. Rogers followed me; he said, where are you going with that. I said, I am going to Mr. Martin; he said, it does not belong to you or Martin; directly I took it back. He did not give me time to stop and find the man. I have been led into this very innocently.</p>

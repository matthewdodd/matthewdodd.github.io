                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). Caroline Lefevre came to school to me, two years after which I agreed to take her to live with me; but she was a very naughty girl very much addicted to thieving, particularly the children's school-money, when she was entrusted with it to give it me; which I have looked over but have given her a stripe or two with the cane used in school, to try to break her of doing it, bat never to injure the child. I would send her for two loaves of bread, she would give me one and spend the other money; she would often serve me so by the meat and tea, which she often got a smack for, to try to break her of if; she always said she would not do it again, but did it the very next time she went out; and the filth that she speaks of was this, we all sat down to dinner off hashed beef and potatoes; I got up from my dinner to go after a younger child that was asleep, to bring it down to dinner, and said to Caroline, "empty that pan while I am gone up-stairs;" when I came down again I began to eat two or three mouthfuls, and thought it tasted very nasty, then looked and saw what it was; I asked her how it came there, she said it was a bit of wood, I said it was not; I said "I have eaten some, and you eat the rest;" she did it to serve me out because I asked her to empty the pan, but whether she eat it or not, I know not; I did not lay a finger on her for so doing, only told her to eat it, as she had put it for me; as to the burn on her hand, I told her three times not to touch the mat while I was rubbing the iron, and she would, and the iron did touch it as I was rubbing it on the mat, and did burn it; and the cut that is at the back of her head, she fell against the bedstead, backwards. The sticks were made for flags for the children when they went for their treat, but were never used</p>

               <p>to beat any child with. I took this child, intending to train her up to take my school when I died, and to leave her all I had, which I told her step<lb></lb>mother when I took her; and have often asked her if she would go home, but she always said no, she would not go home. I took her for company, and to try to break her of some of her bad ways, if I could; to ill-use her I had no such thought, nor to keep her without her food, or I should not have found so many slices of bread and butter, fish, and meat thrown into the cupboard where she sat close to, to have her meals, partly eaten and thrown there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) The prisoner did not give any reason for beating the child when I was in the room—she used to have to put the forms ready, and I suppose it was because she could not get them quick enough, or get the children to their seats quick enough, and the child said, "Pray, governess, don't beat me, I will do it, governess."</p>

On the night of the 16th of December, I made my premises safe before I went to bed. I was called up at half-past two o'clock and found a piece of linen on the floor, and another on the counter, which were not there when I went to bed; the fan-light was broken in two places. There was some linen piled under the fan-light, within the reach of a man's arm; two pieces were taken, and the rest of the articles mentioned in the indictment. The fan-light was broken at each end; it reaches across the shop. About 10 minutes afterwards, I heard the rattle spring, and the watchman brought one piece of linen and part of the shawls, saying, he had found them in Cleveland-mews, which is at the corner of my house. I went there. Brown found the remainder of my property. The prisoner was taken soon after.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROWN. I am a watchman. The last witness called me; I found his house broke open. I examined about and found part of the property in a basket in a cart, in the mews. About four o'clock two men came down Martin-street; one said to the other, it is a very bad job: they went down Howland-street into Russell-mews, which leads into Cleveland-mews. I told the other watchman, and we concealed ourselves, to catch them. I stood behind some dung, and he was behind the court; in five minutes the prisoner came down the mews, and made a stop, opposite the cart, in which we found the property. I laid hold of him immediately, and brought him to the watch-house; his shoulders were covered with muddy feet marks, as if some body had been standing on them. A piece of cotton was found in his breeches pocket; he said, he had slept in a cart, in Fitzroy-market.</p>

               <p>EDWARD WEST. I am a watchman. I found the property in a cart in the mews, covered over with a blue apron.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to the mews with Brown; I hid myself by the cart; in about five minutes the prisoner came down the mews, not quite so far as the cart: Brown laid hold of him, his coat was muddy on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>HENRY HOWARD. I am the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I found a piece of print in his pocket, and a latch key; his shoulders were muddy, as if somebody had been standing on them: it was a dirty night. He said, he picked the print up in the mews, when he went there to ease himself. Fitzroy-market is quarter of a mile from the mews; the print was not dirty at all. (I produce it.)</p>

               <p>JAMES WOODCROFT. The print found on the prisoner is mine, and hung over my fan-light, when it was broken; a person standing on another's shoulders might easily reach my fan-light.</p>

            . On the 11th of March I received a cargo of malt for Messrs. Reid and Co. Hubbard and Horrod were with me in the barge. We arrived at Hawkes's Wharf about half-past six o'clock at night: it was then light. I and Horrod went on shore, and left Hubbard on board. We returned on board at half-past eight o'clock, and found every thing safe. Hubbard went on shore about nine o'clock, and returned at about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning. About twenty minutes before twelve o'clock I thought I heard somebody stepping on the fore part of the barge where part of the malt was stowed. I called out"Shinah," meaning Hubbard. I then went and walked on the top of the bulk, and heard somebody about fifteen yards off. I walked round the bulk, and found every thing safe. (We pack the malt so that we can tell whether there is a sack missing.) I returned into the cabin, and the tide having left the barge, I thought there was no danger. About twenty minutes before one o'clock Hubbard came on board, and said the barge had been robbed. Horrod and myself went and walked round the bulk, and missed four sacks of malt out of the midship of the barge. We returned to the cabin, and in the morning, at daylight, I missed four more sacks from the starboard side; the tarpauling was put over again: they might have been taken before, but I did not miss them. We missed, in all, eight sacks, consisting of thirty-two bushels. My master's name was on the sacks; they were new and fresh marked. I saw four of them about a week after in the possession of the officer, and believed them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I cannot positively say, that they were the same sacks, but am sure they were my master's.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORROD. I have heard Horne examined. He has spoken correctly: they were all right when we went on shore. Between twelve and one o'clock we missed four sacks that lay outside; they would be the most convenient to take from the outside of the barge; the others were taken from close forward (outside.) It was high water about five o'clock that afternoon; the barge was on dry land when we missed them; the water had left her three hours.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FARRANT. I am a corn-chandler, and live in James-street, Covent-garden. On the 13th of March last the prisoner came to me, (he was a stranger to me before), and asked me whether I was a buyer of malt. He said he had some which he wanted to sell for a relation of his of the name of Hawkins, of Alton, in Hampshire. I asked him to show me a sample; he produced a sample in a bag, but not in a regular sample bag. From the appearance of the malt, I knew it would not answer my purpose. He pressed me very much to buy it. I asked him the price; he said, "three, three." I told him I did not understand him, and asked him if he meant 33s. or 3l. 3s. He said, "three guineas." I told him the malt would not suit me. He then desired me to name a price. I told him I did not like the malt; but if I was inclined to be a buyer, I could not give more than 56s. for it; he was going towards the door, and then returned and said, it was a very low price; but if I liked to have it, I should. I asked him where it laid. He told me it laid at Greenwich, but he would cart it to my premises, provided I would give him the money for it, and he would bring it the next morning at seven o'clock. He said he had four quarters of it, (that is, eight sacks.) In consequence of what had passed, I gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is an unusual kind of malt.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been malt that did suit you, what would you have given for it - A. I would have given 4l. for it.</p>

I asked him from whom he received the malt: he said, from a man of the name of Hawkins, of Alton, in Hampshire. I asked him if he had received any directions for the sale of it. He said he had received a letter. I asked him to produce it. He seemed agitated, and said he had not brought it with him, but that it was at his place at Portpool-lane. I inquired of him where he had brought the malt from that day. He replied, that he had brought it from his place in Portpool-lane. I asked him what price he was to sell it at. He said his relation was very much distressed, and in consequence he was to get as much as he could for it. He did not mention the number of the house. We secured him. I went back with Thomas (who had come with the cart), to Portpool-lane: he took me to a house which, he said, was the prisoner's. I found nothing there.

About the 13th of March, he called on me, a little after five o'clock on a Friday morning (I mean the morning he was taken up), he said he wanted my master's cart, and horse, and me, to go with him to the other side of Westminster bridge - We went over the bridge; the prisoner then got out of the cart, and a man came and spoke to him-it was quite dark; another man came to me, and said, "come along with me." I went to the water-side with him, he told me to back the cart to an old barge that was there - I did so, and two men, who were in the barge, threw the sacks into the cart - I believe there were eight sacks; they then told me to go away. I took the cart to the place where the prisoner got out, and found him there, ready to receive me; we then went to Mr. Farrant's, James-street, Covent-garden - We did not go to Portpool-lane first; we found Adkins, and the other officer there; I afterwards shewed them where the prisoner lived in Portpool-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We went about thirty or forty yards from the bridge to load the cart, and came back to the prisoner. - I knew him before, and have carried coals for him; he was not present when the men threw the malt in.</p>
               <p>SILVESTER DRAKE. On the 15th of March, I was working at the Waterloo bridge, and found four sacks there, it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - They were rolled together, and tied round - They had the name of "John Earl," upon them, in black and red; they were very wet, and appeared to have been in the water sometime, and to have had either barley or malt in them. I gave them to Horrod, for Mr. Earl.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL re-examined. I had no other sacks marked in this way, except what was at Kingston, and what were in the barge.

             re-examined. The malt is coloured this way for Reid and Co. only. The causeway went further into the river than the barge; the barge would have been afloat at high-water-her stern was towards the river.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About five weeks before I was taken, I was at a public-house, and a man came in and said, he had a man who sold corn for him, and asked me if I would sell some for him; he said it came from Alton, in Hampshire, from a man of the name of Hawkins, who was in trouble. He brought me a sample, and said he had four quarters of it. - I agreed with Farrant to buy it; the man came to me to know if I had sold it, when he told me to borrow some sacks, and I borrowed two of Mr. Baker. He desired me to bring a cart to the foot of Westminster-bridge, which I did, and a man came out, and told me to wait till he loaded the cart.</p>

On the 21st of November, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to look at some stockings; I shewed her some; she said she had not money enough for them, she would go and ask her husband for more money. She came back again, and asked to see some prints. I shewed her some but they would not suit her. After she was gone, I missed a piece of callimanco. I had nobody but myself in the shop at the time; I could not follow her.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that during the time she was there, there was no other person in the shop but you. - A. There was no other person in the shop but me at that time. She came again on the Thursday, to look at some muslin's for her husbands handkerchiefs; I shewed her eleven pieces, the prices would not suit her. She asked to see some gloves; I shewed her some, she bought one pair; while I was looking for the gloves, she rolled a piece of muslin up in her bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her - A. No, I did not, when I had shewn her the gloves, I counted over the muslins, instead of being eleven pieces there was only ten, I missed one; she kept the pair of gloves and paid for them. She went away, delivering the muslin to me before she went; I followed part of the way home. She hid herself in some stable in Bankside. Soon after, she started; I followed her to the constable's house, and gave charge of her to the constable. He went with me to search her lodgings, where we found three duplicates of some stuff that was pawned on the 22d of last month. I went with the constable afterwards, to see the stuff and the calimanco at the pawnbrokers; it was exactly the colour and pattern of that which I lost.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wright a pawnbroker. On the 22d of November, the prisoner pawned one piece in the morning, and the other piece of calimanco in the evening; I lent her 3 s. 6 d. on one piece, and 2 s. 6 d. on the other. They are part of the same piece. I knew the prisoner perfectly well before; I did not suspect her. Her husband is a taylor, he lives in the neighbourhood. This is the calimanco.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The pattern and colour is exactly such a one that I lost, and the quantity found amounts to the same that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that is the same calimanco that you lost - A. I have not the least doubt whatever, that it is the same that I lost, there is no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it is the same - A. Yes, it is the same. It was all in one length when stolen from me. I have looked it all over and there is the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth the whole twenty eight yards - A. Seventeen shillings.</p>

            . On the morning of the 23d of November, between eight and nine o'clock, Mr. Powis brought the prisoner to my door and gave her in charge to me, for stealing a piece of calimanco and other articles. The prisoner begged to be liberated; I told her I could not suffer felony to be compounded without going before a magistrate. She said she had three children at home; I went home with her to see about the children: Mr. Powis accompanied me to her house where she lived. I then asked her for her duplicates; she then refused giving me her duplicates, but she opened her drawer, and I was going to look in it, she took out a roll of paper, which she was going to throw in the fire; I catched her hand and took from her a duplicate of a piece of calimanco stuff, pledged at Mr. Wrights for 2 s. 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060011"></xptr>she then replied you have got it all, and I hope Mr. Powis will be merciful to me on account of my children. I told her I must see further, among an hundred duplicates I found another duplicate of Mr. Wrights, a piece of stuff, 3 s. 6 d. the same date as the other; I looked further and found one on the 21st a piece of stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Powis. I understood you only found two pieces, do they form the twenty eight yards - A.It was taken in one piece and cut into four.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all found at one pawnbrokers - A. No, at two pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>JAMES HARRIS. I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar come to your house - A. Frequently; on the 23d of November, she pledged a piece of calimanco for 3 s. 6 d. I think it was eight yards, she had 3 s. 6 d. on it, and 4 s. on the other piece, pledged on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I swear it is my property.</p>
               <p>GOODENOUGH. The four pieces compleated twenty eight yards, it was measured in my presence.</p>

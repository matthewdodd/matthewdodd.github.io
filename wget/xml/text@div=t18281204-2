The prisoner has lodged in our first-floor for six years - he does not do any business, but lives on his half-pay, I believe, I took some carpets up stairs on the 24th of October; I was in the room, and was going to take them down stairs - the prisoner came into the room where I was, with a drawn sword in his hand - he stabbed me with it; he said nothing to me before he stabbed me, nor had I said any thing to him - he stabbed me four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you between the different times he stabbed you? A. No. The sword went through the carpet; I do not know how many times it went through the carpet, but I had one stab in my side, one on each knee, and one in the stomach; I called out, and my uncle came - the prisoner then went out of the room: I do not know where he went to; when he was gone I locked the door - my uncle did not come into the room at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked the door did you look at your wounds? A. No; blood came from all of them - I called out of the window, and my uncle came up to the landing-place; I unlocked the door, and went on the landing-place, and my uncle took me down; I was confined to my bed for a week - a surgeon attended me; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the extent of the wounds in your side? A. Rather more than half an inch deep; the one in my stomach was very small - it was not deep; one of those on my knees was about three quarters of an inch deep, and the other about half an inch; the surgeon attended me every day - I got better at the end of the week; the surgeon was called in about ten minutes after: I have always been on good terms with the prisoner - he was always civil to me; this happened at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard the prisoner talk to himself? A. Yes - I have heard him talk to the chairs, tables and things; he has done this at different times, nearly all the while he has lodged with us: I am nearly sixteen years old- he used to call the chairs and tables by different Christian names, and tell them to answer him - that was all he used to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long used he to continue this? A. I do not know; I used to go up stairs at times and hear him, but I never used to stop to listen - he had his meals in the house, but not with the family - he had them alone; I had not observed any thing else about him - he had friends who came to see him; I have heard him talk to them rationally.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this time, did you ever perceive any thing of violence about him? A. No - he would not speak to any body for a week together sometimes, and we used not to speak to him, for he would not answer us; he did not appear to me to be in possession of his right mind.</p>

On the 24th of October, I heard her call out and went up stairs; when I got to the top of the stairs, I met the prisoner with the sword in his hand, pointing it right at me - he never spoke at all; I went down stairs again as fast as I could, and made an alarm - persons came up with me, and he was then blowing the fire in his room; I went up to my niece and found her at the door, bleeding - I took her down stairs: I did not see her wounds - we went for a surgeon, who dressed them: she was confined to her bed about a week before she got about; I have lived there twelve months - the prisoner has been there all that time; I never exchanged twenty words with him - I have heard him talking to himself, but what about I cannot tell: he did not appear like a man in his right mind - I never heard him quarrel with my niece.</p>

            . I live about thirty yards from Pace.'s. On the 24th of October, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody - I went up stairs and found his room-door locked; I called to him to open it - he came and did so directly; I asked him to sit down in a chair - I looked round for a sword, and found this one; it is a sword in a stick - it was in the stick when I found it, up in one corner of the room; I told him he must go with me, and he requested I would allow him to put on another suit of clothes - I said it was not worth while, as he was going a very little way; he then requested me to allow him to lock up his apartments, for all the property there belonged to him - he did so, and we went down stairs together; I took him to Lambeth-street Office - he appeared very sullen and quiet; he never spoke.</p>

            . I am a widow. The prisoner is my nephew - he was under my care from eleven years old, for seven years; he is now forty-two years old - I consider him a deranged man: In 1815 he cut his throat, and he escaped from my house after that, with a wound in his neck - here is one of the hand-bills I circulated to have him found; I afterwards put him in the White House, Bethnal-green, which is a madhouse - he was there six or seven years, in and out; I have known him run about quite naked - I am certain he is subject to fits of derangement; since he has left the White House, he has exhibited symtoms of derangement - when he was sane, I always found him a very humane, kind man.</p>

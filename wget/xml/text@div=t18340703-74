On the 14th of June, I had a £5 bank note, which was folded up in an agreement, in my counting-house - I had a boy, named Linnean, in my service, who swept out the warehouse - when I had missed this note, suspicion fell on him, and, in consequence of what the boy said, the prisoner was taken - he had been employed by the servants to do what was wanted - the prisoner fell on his knees in the street to beg my pardon - he declared the £5 note had done him no good, for he took it to the Bank, got five sovereigns for it, and, in coming through Newgate-street, he felt in his pocket, and he had lost the money through a hole in his pocket.</p>

            . I lived with the prosecutor - I picked up the letter, and laid it on the counting-house desk- I then saw the note, and put it in my pocket - I went on an errand, and met the prisoner - he said, "How is all at home?" - I said, "Pretty well" - I showed him the note, and asked him what it was - he said, "It is a £1 note; I will get it changed at the Bank for you" - I said,"Could not you get it changed at a shop?" - he said, "I do not know; is it a foreign one?" - I said I could not tell - he looked at it, and said, "It is all right" - he asked where I got it - I said, "I picked it up" - he said, "Never mind where it came from" - I did not tell him where I picked it up, and I am sure he said it was a £1 note - I can read a little, and I saw the words "Bank of England" on it - the prisoner told me to call at his home in the evening, and not to tell his wife of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell me you found it in Hatton-garden? A. No; I said I picked it up - I did not say it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to work, and met this boy, who said he had found the note opposite the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk—on 5th November, very near 2 o'clock, I was returning from the Haymarket, and when I was at the second lamp in Cockspur-street I was suddenly seized from behind, and fell violently on my face to the ground—I called out "Police"—I could not see who the persons were who seized me, or how many there were; but there must have been more than one—I rose up, and was held in a leaning position backwards by a hand thrust over my eyes, and my arms pinioned behind—I called "Police" again, when a hand was slapped on my mouth—I felt two hands at my waistcoat-pocket, where my watch and chain were, which I protected with my hands—after that I felt a hand grasp my throat tightly to take my scarf-pin—they bent the pin and then commenced unbuttoning my waist<lb></lb>coat, and endeavouring to release the chain from my button-hole—the police then came near, I believe, for the men pushed me to the ground and made off—they did not succeed in taking anything from me—the police did not come to me—I have a scar on my face, and a large bruise, which were inflicted in the fall.</p>

                  </hi>. On 5th November, about 2 in the morning, I was in Cockspur-street, and saw the prosecutor, but not before he was attacked by that young man, the shortest prisoner of the two (<hi rend="italic">Paynter</hi>)—he picked Mr. Prior up, chucked him on his face, and walked away from him—the other prisoner was close by him—the gentleman hallooed out, "Police," and the two policemen walked round the corner close together—I did not see them before Mr. Prior was knocked to the ground—the prisoners then walked away, and Thompson aaked me for a light—I told the police, in the pri<lb></lb>soners' hearing, that they were the young men who knocked Mr. Prior down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240089"></xptr>
               <p>and the police took them in custody—there were no other persons near—Thompson threatened me at the police-court—he said, God blind him, he would make it hot for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Was I speaking to a female when I asked you for a light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said, "I shall not give you one"—there was nobody else with you when the gentleman was knocked down—a man came to the station and said that you were not the man, but there was nobody but you two present when the gentleman was knocked down—the lady in my cab said that she could not swear to either of you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> I want to know why the lady and gentleman are not here; they swore positively at the station that I was not the person. I was coming down Cockspur-street, heard the disturbance, and came up and saw the gentleman on the ground. I asked the man for a light, and he said I think you are one of the men who were attacking that man, and the policeman took me; that is all I know of the transaction. This man is a perfect stranger to me. I certainly said, "If you accuse me of this I will make it hot for you." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was a lady inside that you said that to, but you threatened me at the station-house—the lady is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see these two men together before Mr. Prior was attacked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This young man had got Mr. Prior, and was chucking him down when Thompson passed by; he was eight yards away when the other chucked him down—Thompson never touched him, but he was close by the side of him, and in his company—after Paynter left the gentleman he went to Thompson; and when the policeman came, Thompson asked me for a light, and then called Paynter, saying, "Come on, we are going home; we have not done anything."</p>

             the beer in a silver tankard, and set it upon the table. The prisoner said there was a third gentleman coming, dressed in green, and if he should enquire for a gentleman, to let him know that he was in the parlour. Another gentleman came and went into the parlour.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. About half after ten o'clock, as I was going to the street door, I saw the parlour door was left open. I looked in and saw one man in the room, who was a stranger to me. My husband was in the tap-room. I saw the tankard on the table. He turned round and saw me looking in at the crevice; he sat down again and seemed rather frightened; upon this I went into the street, and looked in at the parlour window. The curtains were drawn, but I observed him for five minutes. I saw him take up the tankard and drink and then put it down again. I am sure that man was the prisoner. After that I saw him take the tankard up and put it behind him, under his coat. I stood on the step waiting his coming out. When he came out I took hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he had got under his coat; he dropped the tankard then at my feet; I kept fast hold of him; he dragged me the breadth of two streets. When he found I kept fast hold of him, he attempted to slip his coat off, but I held him till he was taken.</p>

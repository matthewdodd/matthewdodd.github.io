                  </hi>. I am collecting clerk to Messrs. H. and E. Rosier, of Limehouse, and have been so forty years. On Saturday, 10th Jan., I was in Rose-lane, Stepney, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—I was walking along, with a leather travelling bag in one hand, and an umbrella in the other—the Black wall railway runs across Rose-lane—there are three arches, one crosses each of the pathways, and one crosses the road—when I got within about sixty yards of the first archway, the prisoner Miller came off the footpath as deliberately as possible, and came towards me—when he came close to roe, he stopped in front of me, and said, "Old gentleman, we have been waiting for you"—I was instantly seized from behind by two men—I turned my head sharply, and saw there were two—one took charge of my arms, and the other took charge of my head—my head was pressed down, and something as cold as possible put over my face, I could neither speak nor see, no further than I know that the man who met me in front, took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—the weather was cold at this time; it might have been a hand that was put over my face—Miller tore the watch through my buttons—he tore the buttons off my waistcoat in doing so—finding that he could not get the guard off my neck, for I always button one side of it in my braces, and it was a strong solid gold guard, he seized it with all his might, and broke the guard—it was enough to cut my neck through, indeed, I wonder it did not do so—he broke the guard and took the watch away—I then felt his hand going to my right hand pocket—having a considerable sum of money in my left pocket, I struggled to get my mouth clear, and sang out, "Police!"—and at that instant I received a blow which knocked me down, and knocked my senses completely out of me—my recollection never came to me again until the next day—I fell on my arm, and have not been able to lift it to my head since—I recollect nothing after I was knocked down, until I found myself at home the next morning—I live at Barnet—the prisoners were taken into custody, I think, about seven or eight days afterwards; and when I went to the police station to see them, my recollection had not rightly recovered, and my eyes were so bad, I could not actually trust to them—I would not then swear to Miller, but I stated to the magistrate that, to the best of my belief, he was the man—I can now firmly swear he is the man—I never saw my watch again—I understand that my carpet bag was picked up, and brought to the station, but I know nothing at all about that.</p>

               <p>Queen-street, Ratcliff. On the day in question, I was coming from a pawnbroker's shop in the Commercial-road, with a basket in my hand—I saw Mr. Harris coming under the railway arch in Rose-lane—he was just going into the arch, and I saw Williams come over, knock him down, and run away—that was the first that I saw—I did not see any watch taken—I did not see any other person—I know a man named Briney—I saw him at the corner; I suppose he was looking out.</p>

On Saturday morning, 10th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was talking with another lad, and we happened to turn round, and saw the old gentleman lying on the ground at the end of the court, and the prisoner with his leg across him—I cannot exactly say which prisoner it was, because he was off in au instant—but when the old gentleman was walking into the station, the other prisoner laughed as he was going in—I only saw one person close to Mr. Harris; the other one was a little way off, down by the court—that was Briney—I know Miller—he is the one that laughed, as the old gentle-man was going into the station—I know Williams by sight—I saw Briney, Miller, and Williams, all three together, before the robbery was committed—I cannot exactly say how long before—it was that same morning—I cannot say whether Williams is the man that I saw standing over the old gentleman—I cannot say who it was.</p>

            . I am fifteen years of age. On the 29th of February last the prisoner took out a guinea and a half out of his master's drawer, and on the 10th of March a guinea and 15 s. he said he was to lend it to his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your master at that time?</p>
               <p>Stafford. No, I did not; he said he would put the money in again.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he did not put it in again?</p>
               <p>Stafford. He never told me he did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell your master of this?</p>
               <p>Stafford. I told him of it the 30th of July.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of July a thing belonging to a watch-chain was lost; I told my master I knew nothing of it; we had some words, presently he found it in the shew-glass; I am innocent of the charge laid against me; I was afraid my master should see a letter I had received from a young woman from out of the country, and he should beat me, made me run away.</p>
               <p>He called his three brothers and two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

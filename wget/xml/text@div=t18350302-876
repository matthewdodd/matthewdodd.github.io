                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Taylor. I know the prisoner—on the 18th of February he came to our house for the linen, and I gave him a pair of sheets to take to Mrs. Thomas, who washed for us—he brought back the other articles, but not the sheets.</p>

Q.</hi> You told me you did not always receive the thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not; but I received these because mistress was ill—I missed the sheets about half an hour afterwards—the basket was by my side that time—there have been blankets and other things lost—the prisoner only brought one basket in that day—I think it was Wednesday—perhaps I had a dozen bundles and baskets to examine that day.</p>

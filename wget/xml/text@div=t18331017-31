               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it not the custom of your trade, that to certain customers you sell your music at half-price - to others at full price; to certain customers you sell at a price between the two, and to certain other persons you give it away? A. Yes; what we give away to professional persons, we generally,(but not always,) write their names upon - what we sell always goes out in the same state it is in the warehouse - it cannot be sworn to.</p>

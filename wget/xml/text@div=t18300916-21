               <p>JURY to MR. KING. Q. Have you allowed him to keep money, and account for it afterwards? A. Yes, he has kept money for a month and accounted for it afterwards, but I was not aware of it at the time - I thought the people were running bills.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever given him to understand he was allowed to do that? A. No, I was not aware of it - he has paid me a considerable sum together, which he has received daily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, at North Road, Lewisham—on the evening of 29th June, about 6 o'clock, while some person was engaged delivering bottles at my place, I saw the prisoner, with another boy, looking through the window as if they were watching my movements—a young lady came in for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I took 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket; I gave her change for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I placed the note, and the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my purse, which I put in my desk, behind the counter, while I assisted the man with the bottles—the man who was with the prisoner walked into the shop and stood by the counter—I said "What do you want?"—he made no reply—I said "Wait a minute, I will be back in a minute, and attend to you"—I had to go into my side ware-house, and when I came back he had left the shop—I went to the door and looked, and said "Hi!"—I saw the prisoner and the other man about ten yards from the shop—the prisoner said "We will be back directly"—they were walking—I went back into the shop, and missed my purse from the desk—I went in pursuit of the men, and saw the prisoner running over the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 6 or 6.30—the two men were looking in at my window—the prisoner was one of them—I was watching him and he was watching me—I knew him by his voice, and by his face—he said he would be back directly—I had a suspicion of them leaving the shop, that they had robbed me—they were both together when I spoke to them—I called from my shop door "Hi!" and the prisoner said "We will be back directly"—I then went and looked in the desk, and my purse was gone—the other man was rather younger than the prisoner—I should know him again—I saw both their faces as plain as I see yours—I put my purse in my desk on the counter—it is close to the window where he was looking in, within a yard—a person would have to go round the counter to open the desk—there is nothing to prevent a person going round—I was only away about three minutes—I am quite sure I placed the purse in the desk—it was a leather purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lampit, Lewisham, and am a baker—on the evening of 29th June, I was going towards Lewisham Bridge, about 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and another man running, followed by Mr. Pitman—he said something to me, and I ran after them—the two men separated, and the prisoner ran over the Lewisham Bridge, round the embankment, and jumped into the Plough tea-gardens—I went round to the Plough and saw the prisoner in front of the bar—he asked me if I had caught the two men I was running after—I said "No"—I sent someone for Mr. Pitman, and he came in, and gave the prisoner in charge—I know the urinal at the Plough—the prisoner did not pass that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was standing in front of the bar with his coat and hat off—he had had some ale—he had finished then—the two men were dressed in black clothes—when I saw the prisoner he had no hat or coat on.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a labourer, servant to Mr. Summers: On Sunday, the 19th of October, I went to fetch the cows out of the field, between five and six o'clock in the morning; I saw a tall man go out of the foot-path to the other side of the field, with something under his right arm; he went to the hedge, and then he got into the ditch, and then he returned to the foot-path; he had no parcel with him then; and then he came within fifty or sixty yards of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he near enough for you to see his face?</p>

               <p>- A. No; I went home, and milked the cows; after that, I went to the ditch, and found a goose dead, with the feathers on; I then returned to my master, and acquainted him of it; I left the goose on the same spot; then my master went to look at it, and I know no more of it.</p>

               <p>- SUMMERS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Tottenham: In consequence of an information I received from the last witness, I went and fetched a goose home from the ditch, and shewed it to Mr. Pratt; it remained till six o'clock in the evening at my house; I then carried it to the place where I took it from, and watched it some time; and then Mr. Hill and Mr. Iredale watched.</p>

This Man followed me from Stock-Market to Honey-Lane-Market, and put his Hand up my Petticoats, and said he would give me Six-pence to lie with me, then he said he would give me but Three-pence. I said I could not take it, and said I had not Three-pence to give him; he said I should go into Honey-Lane-Market, and that I should not go till he had lain with me; and he laid me down upon a Stall to lie with me, and gave me this Six-pence. <rs id="t17430223-7-verdict38" type="verdictDescription">

The Prisoner return'd, If you are never paid, must not I be paid? Whereupon some high Words arose, and the Deceas'd gave the Prisoner a Blow in the Face, (which struck him backwards) and drew his Sword; upon which, the Prisoner went to the Window, where his Sword lay, and drew likewise; that they Parry'd together for some time in the Room; That the Room being small, the Prisoner follow'd the Deceas'd to the Stair-head, where they continu'd Fighting till the Wounds were given. The Evidence for the Queen-endeavour'd to prove farther, That in the time of the Fighting, the Prisoner broke the Sword of the Deceas'd; that the Deceas'd with the Hilt end of his broken Sword, disarm'd the Prisoner, and told him that he gave him his Life; That when all was over, and the Swords thrown away, the Prisoner took up the point end of the Deceased's broken Sword, and gave him the Wound in his Belly. But this did not appear by Mr. Gibbons, the only Person present, nor that there was any interval of Time, the whole Fray being ended in less then two Minutes. The Prisoner, in his Defence, produced divers to prove that there had been no premeditated Malice, between him and the Deceased, as likewise several Persons of Worth to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of an honest peaceable Man.

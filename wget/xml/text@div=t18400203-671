                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, living in Beaumont-terrace, Stepney. On the 8th of January the prisoner came to my house, between one and two o'clock—he asked for an apartment—I said I could not give him a positive answer till Mrs. Pickford came home—he came again, and we let him the apartment—he said his name was William Maynard, that he was a midshipman on board the <hi rend="italic">Rhadamanthus</hi>, in the West-India Docks, and had come from the Isle of France—he wanted to lodge for seven weeks or more—he said his father was a major at the Isle of France—he came in without a reference—he could give none—he brought no boxes or luggage—the next day he said he was going to the ship, and would bring me a parrot—it did not come—he left on the 13th, without notice—after he was gone we missed a watch off the mantel-shelf in the back-kitchen—I found no such ship as he mentioned—there had been such a ship, but she was a government steam-vessel, and had been gone three weeks—I saw the prisoner afterwards in the Whitechapel-road, and collared him—he begged me not to collar him—I said I would keep him fast.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 13th of January I left my house at half-past ten o'clock, leaving in the house Jacobs, an apprentice—I had seen the watch at twenty minutes to ten o'clock in my husband's hand—the prisoner had it in his hand, and was laughing at its gaining an hour in the day, and at its being so curiously <hi rend="italic">navigated</hi> as to require to be put back half an hour at night—when I came back, at half-past twelve o'clock, the watch was gone.</p>

She left me and the prisoner in the house—he gave me a coat to brush—when I had done that I went into the yard—I turned my head, and saw him take the books off the table, which he had been reading—no one had came into the house from the time my mistress left till the prisoner went away at a quarter-past eleven o'clock—I did not miss the watch till twelve o'clock—no one had been in the kitchen besides me and him—no one could have come in without my seeing it.</p>

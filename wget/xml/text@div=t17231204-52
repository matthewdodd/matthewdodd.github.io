             depos'd, That being in his own House on the 23d of July, between six and seven a Clock, he heard a great Noise, and Hollowing near Cripplegate, and saw about 20 Men with great Sticks and Clubs. That they came to the House of a Neighbour of his, Mr. Jones an Apothecary, making a great hissing, and shaking and rattling of their Clubs; and did in the like Manner at the Crown Tavern and Crown Coffee-house, marching backwards and forwards, and in an Hour's Time got a great Number together, and about eight a Clock they made two Bonfires, one on one side of Cripplegate, and the other on the other. That when one of their Fires was pretty well burnt, they came again to the Crown Tavern, and he saw a great Club thrown from among the Mob, which hit a Man and knocked him down. Then they throwed Stones and broke the Lamps at the Crown Tavern Door, and afterwards retreated to the Bonfire. Then some Gentlemen went out of the Tavern, and went as near the Bonfire as they durst to venture, and read the Proclamation, after which they were quiet for some Time; but afterwards they came up again in a great Body, he thinks some Hundreds, many of them with Clubs and Staves; and as he was standing at his own Door, some of them came up to him and struck him. Whereupon he retired to the Inside of the Door, and bolted it, then they broke his Windows. That there were in the Coffee-Room about four or five Persons reading the News, who being frightened at their breaking the Windows, and throwing in Stones, they ran up Stairs, and before he could bolt the Back-door, they came to it, burst it open with great Violence, broke his Sconce which hung in the middle of the Room, heat and bruis'd him very much; and as he held up his Hand to save his Life, was struck on it, so that it broke the Bone, of which he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172312040009"></xptr> lame, and like to be so as long as he lives. They having continued there about two Minutes, some Gentlemen that were at the Crown Tavern came down, and they went away. That there was no Provocation given the Mob, that he knew of, and what was done afterwards he could not say, being so battened and bruised, and wounded to the Scull, that he was render'd insensible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams depos'd, That between nine and ten a Clock, the 23d of July aforesaid, he heard at his Door a very great Noise of hissing and following, but they went away, and about an Hour afterwards came again with a greater Number, hissing and hollowing, and crying our, Down with the House, but went away again. After which he went to some Gentlemen who were drinking in his House, having been upon Exercise with Captain Saunders in the Artillery Ground, whose Company had mustered there that Day; and be himself also being Major of the White Regiment, they being at his House at Supper, he acquainted them with the Danger he apprehended he was in from the Mob, and desired them to assist him in case of need. That afterwards the Mob came again the third Time, broke all his Lamps, his Lanthorns and Windows, almost half way in his Passage; and he having sent up for them to come to his Assistance, being afraid they would have pull'd down his House, according as they had cry'd out, the Gentlemen came down and drove them out.</p>

After that another Messengers came up, and said, they had broken Major Adams's Lamps; and that several People had been knocked down, and Sticks had been flung into the House.

The other Constable had likewise a Staff brought, and in about a Quarter of an Hour they grew very unruly, and threw Stones, and broke the Lanthorns. That then he spoke to them again, saying, Do you know what you do? That he there saw Lant with a great Stick, flourishing it; and, as he thinks, going to strike him. After this they grew more violent, and threw Sticks into the Passage; upon this some Gentlemen, who were in the Tavern Passage, were for going out, but he disswaded them from it, that they might give no occasion or pretence of their being the Aggressors, and none did go out; and he clapp'd his Staff cross the Door. That some Persons advised the Reading the Proclamation; that they went out to read it, but they were so push'd and shov'd about that they could not read it; and he was forc'd, for fear of being more abus'd, if not murthered, to withdraw; but afterwards it was read, and he had his Head broken going to read it; and the Mob pursed them that had been reading it to the Door, and threw Sticks and Firebrands in very violently, and broke the great Lanthorn to pieces, and pressed so against the Door, which they were attempting to shut, that a great many People could not shut it against them. but they forced their way in, and Mr. Bates was very much wounded. That then being driven out they retired to the Bonfire, and they went to read the Proclamation at the Bonfire that was on the Inside of the Gate, but the Gates were shut, and he put his Staff partly in between them, to show his Authority, but they refus'd to open the Gate, so they went round, as has been before depos'd, and there Kits was taken, who said the Constable was a Fool and a Blockhead, for reading the Proclamation. That the Cry was, High Church and Williams. And, that in the whole, he never did see a more unprovok'd, and barbarous Abuse of People, that gave them no Provocation in Word or Deed in his Life.</p>

When they came to the Door they found the Lamps and Windows broken, and heard several had been wounded, and tho' he spoke to them very civilly, he was forc'd to retire, and in the Passage he receiv'd 4 or 5 very Severe Blows, Stones and Sticks being flung in as thick as Hail; that then there came some Gentlemen down Stairs, and forc'd them to retire; that he saw Lant with them at the Tavern Door, when he was going out to read the Proclamation, which was done without making any Disturbance; and that they had assaulted the House before this Time. Being ask'd by the Council for the Prisoners, whether there had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172312040010"></xptr> Men gone out with Swords, Muskets, and Bayonets?

               <p>The Council for the Prisoners were, Mr. Hungerford and Mr. Kettleby; who during the Course of the Evidence for the King, were not wanting in cross-examining the Evidences for the King; and so also in the Defence of their Clients spar'd no Pains or Rhetorick to clear them of the Charge of a Riot, by laying it upon their Accusers, which they attempted to do by the following Evidences.</p>

That they had Guns and Bayonets, to the Number of 4 or 5, and Swords waving, and they were the Cause of the Riotous Doings. That he saw them come out twice, and fell upon them, and they ran away like Sheep.

That some Gentlemen in Scarlet came out with Swords drawn in their Hands, and walk'd towards the Bonfire.

               <p>Mrs. Brown depos'd, That she saw it from the Beginning to the End. That they made a Bonfire, and rejoyc'd about it, and when it was about half burnt out, two or three came in Red Coats, and one with his Sword drawn, and one said, There should be no Bonfire. One of them was Captain Stray, and they put the Bonfire out, and went into the Tavern again, and stay'd there about half an Hour, and in the mean Time the People put the Bonfire together again. And afterwards the Captains, and Men in Caps, and two or three in red Coats, came to the Bonfire, and said, There should be no Bonfire. And there was hardly any Body at it but Boys and Girls, and they threw it about, and one Stick of Fire lay in the Front of the Passage of the Crown Tavern. That a Man came by, and said, What do you throw the Fire about for? And kicked the Billet, and it broke Adam's Lanthorn.

That he went to Cripplegate, and the Bonfire had been kick'd about, and they were making it up again. That there was a great running through the Gate, and there were Persons in Scarlet Coats, and there was knocking down of People. That he saw one with his Piece levelled to shoot; that he commanded the King's Peace; that he saw Captain Stray there, and that another came with his Sword drawn, and he thereupon commanded the Gates to be shut.</p>
               <p>This being the Substance of the Evidence, as to the Fact, the Prisoners call'd Witnesses as to their particular Persons.</p>
               <p>As to Kite, some Evidences appear'd, who depos'd, That he had been drinking from about five, and was with them till half an Hour past ten.</p>

Upon this Mr. Willis was call'd, who depos'd, That being at a publick House, he heard of a great Disturbance, about seven or eight a Clock; that Mr. Jones's House was assaulted, that he went, and they said, those that assaulted Mr. Jones's House were gone. That he afterwards saw Lant among the Mob; said he was sorry to see him there, advised him to go home, and gave him half a Quartern of Brandy to do so. and, that he did afterwards charge him to aid and assist him, but he could not keep him in his fight for above two or three Minutes, and afterwards he heard he was taken up.

               <p>The Course of the Evidence, on both sides, being finished, and the Council for the Prisoners having made their Remarks upon them, Mr. Attorney General reply'd, That as to the Evidences for the King, they were Persons of Reputation; which had no wise been impeached, or called in Question. That they were to the Number of ten or twelve; who were uniform in their Evidence. That they being generally there upon the Spot at the very beginning of the Riot, and where the Injuries were done; and many of them had suffer'd great Damage, they must of necessity be able to give a more exact Account, than those Persons, who; some came by accidentally, some stood at a Distance, and some saw through Windows, and some saw one part; and others another; and, as it appear'd, not one of them the whole; so that their Evidence must needs be imperfect, and perplex'd as to Time, scarce one of them speaking to any Thing that was done before nine a Clock, when it appear'd by several Evidences for the King, that the Disturbance was begun before eight a Clock. The Judge having summ'd up the Evidence on both sides, the Jury went out, and after a short stay, found John Lant guilty of the <rs id="t17231204-52-verdict276" type="verdictDescription">

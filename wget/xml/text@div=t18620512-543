                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer—on 4th April, I was staying at Gregory's Hotel, Cheapside—on that morning I met with two women—the prisoner is one of them; I will swear to her—I met them in Long-acre, and accompanied them—I treated them, and afterwards accompanied one of them to her house, which I afterwards ascertained was at No. 9, Coal-yard, Drury-lane—it was the first door out of the passage to the left—it was both a sitting-room and a bed-room—after I had been there some time there was a knock at the door, and the girl that was along with this woman went out—I said, "Where is she going?"—the prisoner said, "I will go and fetch her"—she went away and brought another—I said, "I am going to leave, I sha'nt stop here;" and when I said that, two men came in and made an attack on me—the prisoner was with me then—I said, "I am going;" and the men stopped me—I said, "It will take you all your time"—they rushed on to me; I struck light and left; they struck too; and one of them said, "Have you got it?"—I had an overcoat on—I belong to a country town where they know how to use their feet, and I believe I could have licked the whole four—I knocked one of the men over; I <hi rend="italic">dropped</hi> him—the women got hold of me by the collar of my coat, tore my scarf off, and hung on to my throat—I had the men under me; I was giving it to them; I meant mischief—I did not like to lose my property—they got me down, and when I was on the ground my gold watch and guard were taken out—the prisoner was throttling me at this time—it is a very difficult position to be placed in—I rushed out of the house after the men—I was after the man to knock him down—I had seen my watch and chain safe perhaps about an hour, or half an hour before this—I looked at it when I left a party, a little after 12—I met the women, perhaps, an hour after<lb></lb>wards—when the man said, "Have you got it?" I heard no reply, all I saw was a dart—they put their hands up and made a dart—they opened my overcoat while I was standing on the defensive, and I felt my watch go, but did not see it—I felt in my pocket and missed it—the men then left me, and I followed them—I did not succeed in catching the prisoner—I met the policeman, returned, and pointed out the house to him, but it was closed—we had had a drink, and I cannot tell you how long I was in the prisoner's company before the men came in.</p>

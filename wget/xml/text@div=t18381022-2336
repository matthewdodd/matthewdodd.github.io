               <p>Tavern, in Lower Eaton-street, Pimlico, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner was in my service, and left last Novem<lb></lb>ber—on Sunday morning, the 4th of March, I went to bed, about one o'clock—my house was closed and fastened before I went to bed—I took my cash-box into my bed-room—it contained three £10 Bank of England notes, five £5 notes, forty—on e sovereigns, one half-guinea, five half-sovereigns, six half-crowns, seventy-three shillings, and ninety—on e silences—I placed the box on the drawers in my bed-room, and locked my bed-room door—after I was in bed, I heard a noise under my bed, bat supposing it was the kitten, I did not disturb myself—I awoke a few minutes before six o'clock in the morning, found the cash-box and property all gone, and the room-door unlocked—I also missed a few shil<lb></lb>lings from my pocket which was by my bed-side—I alarmed my brother and sister, who came into my room—this made a little noise in the house, and while that was going on, I heard a noise as if the dining-room window was thrown open, and somebody dropping into the street—I looked out of window, but saw nothing—this was about day-break—I gave information to the police—I afterwards saw my box, and part of my property.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a servant at that time in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot recollect her name—I think it might be Carver or Carder—she remained in my employ about a fortnight or three week after I missed the property—she had given me notice, and was on warn<lb></lb>ing before the robbery—we did not make any cry of police when we found the window open—I have recovered my box again in the same state in which I am lost, locked, and with the same property in it—I have not sustained any low—I had locked my door—the dining-room is on the first floor—I cannot tell how high the window is from the street—there are some railings in front of the house—I do not know how far they are from the window—it was a minute or two after hearing the window open before I went to look out—there is a wooden door on the staircase which comes up the full height of the landing—that door is generally locked inside and out—there is no door which a person would have to get over—my servant has not been examined before the Magistrate or Grand Jury.</p>

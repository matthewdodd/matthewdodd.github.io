Coulson is the landlady of that house—on 24th March last, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was in the kitchen—the two prisoners were there, an artilleryman and Margaret M'Donald—the artil<lb></lb>leryman said he had known Walsh for some time, and he called him <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—Mrs. Coulson said he was as far out as he was in, for that was not his name—and she said, "Who fetched you in here?"—there was a quarrel between them, and she struck him—he was going out the back way, and Walsh said that was not the way to get out—I opened the front door, and he went out—he was out about a quarter of an hour—the prisoners then opened the door and went out—I went out, too, and saw the artilleryman standing outside the door with his hands against the wall of the house—Walsh said, "Here you are, yet, you b—, are you?"—the artilleryman said, "John, John, don't strike me no more"—he was drunk—with that, he ran down to the waterside, and Walsh followed him and Mrs. Coulson after him, she had a piece of the tongs in her hand—Walsh ran over to the waterside, where the artilleryman was standing, and made a blow at him—there are some steps leading down to the river—I cannot say how many—the artil<lb></lb>leryman was close to the steps at the time—Walsh did not hit his head, but knocked his cap off, and the artilleryman fell into the water; I did not notice whether he made a step back, or not, I only saw him fall into the water—Coulson gave Walsh the piece of tongs to try to save him—she said, "Save him"—Walsh said he would not jump in he could not swim, and he was afraid he should be drowned—Mrs. Coulson gave him the piece of tongs—he threw it into the water and said, "Drown, you b—"—Mrs. Coulson and I gave an alarm.</p>

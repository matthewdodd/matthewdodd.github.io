                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Josiah Buttress and Son, silk ma<lb></lb>nufacturers, in Steward-street. On the 22nd of Aug. I gave Galloway a cane of silk, which weighed 8lbs. 10<hi rend="italic">oz.</hi>, and at three different times I gave him ninety-three bobbins, which contained about 41bs. 8oz.—that would make about 100 yards of silk—the silk and bobbins have never been returned, which they ought to have been about the 1st of Oct.—on the 20th of Oct. I received information, and went to Galloway's house, and the silk and bobbins and every thing was gone but the harness and reed—the silk was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I remember the cane and shute coming from Mr. Buttress, and on Thursday, the 19th of Oct., the prisoner Patterson came with my husband to the room—he took up the shears, cut the cane out of the loom, and went away with it in a bag—my husband went with him—that was about eleven o'clock; but, about ten, Holloway had come, and taken some shute out of my husband's box—my husband took some at well, and they both went down stairs together—they were not both present on either occasion.</p>

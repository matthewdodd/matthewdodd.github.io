               <p>prisoner in my house at ten o'clock, at which time I cleared the house of customers and closed it, and secured my doors and windows, and went to bed about 10.30—I got up next morning at 5.55, and found the kitchen door open, and a pane of glass in the back kitchen window broken, the hasp broken, and the window raised sufficiently to allow a man's body to pass through—the kitchen door had been opened from inside, as if the party had come in at the window and gone out by the door—I went upstairs and acquainted my missus, and I afterwards missed 170 cigars, 100 of which had been in one box, and 70 in another, and a portion of brandy from a decanter—I gave information—these cigars were afterwards shown to me, and correspond with what I lost (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the wholesale price is 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 100.</p>

On the morning of the 15th I received information from the prosecntor, and went to the prisoner—I told him the Railway Inn had been broken into, and that he was strongly suspected of committing the robbery—he said he knew nothing about it—I searched his jacket, and in the pocket I found ten cigars, and in what is termed the long bag, part of the kit, I found some more broken, about the same quantity—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of the cigars—he said he bought them at some shop, he could not say where—85 cigars were afterwards handed to me in this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were found secreted in different parts of the room—they were given to me in the room in the presence of the prisoner by the sergeant of the regiment—I think he said he found them in the coal-box, near the fire in his room—the prisoner admitted that was his hankerchief they were tied up in.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on the morning of the 16th—seeing he was a young soldier, I asked him what service he had, and he told me—I asked him if he was aware of the nature of the charge, and if he was properly charged and cautioned, and he made some evasive answer; "but," he said, "I never took the cigar, sir; they were given to me out of the front door after closing hours on the Sunday night. When in the house on the Sunday morning I asked the landlady to give me some cigars, as I was going out to India. After the house was closed on Sunday night I came and threw a small pebble at the window, and the landlady came down and handed me the cigars"—I then said to him "But you have written a letter to the landlord, asking him to forgive you," and he admitted to me that he had—here is the letter written by him to the landlord, and signed by him—I got it from the landlord. (The Court <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that as there was no evidence of the handwriting the letter could not be read.</hi>) I was at the hearing before the Magistrate—there was a remand, at which I was also present—the wife of the prosecutor and the servant were there by my order, and the prisoner declined to question them.</p>

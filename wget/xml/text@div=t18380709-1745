                  </hi>. I am at present residing at Sfppingnarn, near Eaton. At the time in question I lived with the Reverend William Tyrrell, at a village, two miles from Leicester, as housekeeper—the prisoner was in the habit of coming there twice a week, for the last twelve months, to teach the German language to Mr. Tyrrell—he ceased to attend at the end of De<lb></lb>cember—my master had some plate in his house, it was kept in a spare room, near master's study—the articles for the family use were left out is that spare room—on the 15th of January, this year, I had occasion to go to where these things were kept—the room was not kept locked, but the drawer, in which the plate was, was kept locked—I found it unlocked, and the key in it—it had been locked before, to the best of my knowledge—I missed about twenty table, or dessert-spoons, ten tea-spoons, about twenty silver forks, two silver ladles, and one pair of sugar-tongs.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar; he lived some time ago in Little Turnstile, Holborn, but afterwards moved to Weston's Park, Linculn's-inn-fields: On the 2d of October, I called at Mr. Gilbert's house, in <placeName id="t17951202-26-crimeloc138">Weston's Park</placeName>

I looked at them, and they were of a very bad quality; I said I would only take half a piece, that was 15s. she gave them to me, and I gave her half-a-guinea in gold, and she gave me a half-crown piece in change; I have counted them since and found but 14s. 101/2d.(produces them): I think, if I recollect right, there are 375 pieces, or 357, I don't recollect which, but I think it is 357; there were two women, appeared to be market women, by their dress, purchased a piece, and there was a pockmarked man, dressed like a blacksmith, came in for some; I told him they were of such an indifferent quality, I should like something better; he said, if I would give him an order, he would make them to any size or thickness I liked; he said, he would have a partern for me, if I called again; I called again, and he shewed me a few halfpence of a thicker quality, much better; I asked him the price of them by the piece, and he said he could not sell them for less than nineteen shillings; I offered him eighteen for one paper, and he seemed to be rather affronted; he said, he thought I was such a customer, and I came away; I went afterwards with the officers; Mr. Armstrong, I believe, was one; I went to the door and rung the bell, one of the daughters came to the door, she looked through the hole of the door as before; when she saw it was me she opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020037"></xptr>door, and the officer immediately went in; a search was made, but I only saw part of it; I did not see any thing found, and I came away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been acquainted with this man? - A. It might be two months; Macan gave me a direction to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him up till fourteen days after this? - A. The magistrate thought the best way was to have them all taken up on one day, for fear of giving an alarm to the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you have never done business with Macan and Dunlop? - A. Never in my life in the bad money way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never gone about with them when they have been passing bad money? - A. Never; I might have been in their company when they were felling.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were concerned with them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I went with Rogers and Armstrong to search the house, and apprehend the prisoner: On the 16th of October I found nothing but some silver and halfpence in a bason, which turned out to be good; after that Armstrong and all the officers but me went away and left us with Gilbert's daughter; they staid away some time, and I went to see after them; I met Gilbert in Turnstile; says I, Gilbert, how does the world use you? says he, but poorly: where do you live now? why, says he, I hardly know; says I, then I will tell you, for I have just come from your house, and I took him into custody, and carried him to his own house; then we took him in a coach to the Crown, in Clerkenwell, and there I searched him, and upon his person I found 110 guineas, all in one purse, 25s. 6d. in silver, half-a-guinea in gold, and these papers, which appear to be bills of parcels; the money was all good, and I returned it to him.(The papers were produced and read.)</p>

            , he begged of me to go with this message; accordingly I took this order, and went and took this money, and brought him it. Then he called upon me a second time, and I took the second order, and went likewise. The third time he came to me, and begged I would go. I said, I had no occasion to go on his errands, he might go himself. He said, the man is sick, and much desired me to go; he said, he sent to Mr. Mauger, and Mr. Mauger said, he would not pay any body, except he came himself, or the man that brought the first order. He is since fled; I sent the constable after him, and I fancy he apprehended what I wanted.</p>

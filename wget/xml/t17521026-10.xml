The lock of my room door was broke; we put it ajar when we went to bed, Aug. 22, and in the morning, when I awoke, I saw it standing open. I took no further notice, but went to my business. When I returned my wife had miss'd the things mentioned from off the bed, and was obliged to sit in only her flats for two days. Was not this a barbarous action? About seven or eight days after, I met with Poll Merrit, and

There was another with them; they passed on; then I thought Poll Merrit had my wife's gown on New I am come to the touchstone. I said to my wife, when I came home, If ever I saw your gown, I saw it on Poll Merrit's back. I looked for them several nights after, and could not see them. But now, Sir, I come again. I heard

Bid her look out of the door, said I. She did. I said, I'll come up and give you some beer; but I did not. Then I went to my wife, and told her I believed I should find her cloaths, and said, If I come back again, I don't find them; but if I stay, depend upon it I am there. Then I went to them, and said, I am come to give you a dram; then my wife came up, and said, What must you and I have this discontent for? What do you do here? Poll Merrit had my wife's gown on her back, one of my wife's petticoats on, and my shirt made into an apron; the other had the other petticoat on.

               <p>Mr. Rickards met me and this woman together in Long Lane. He asked me to go and drink a dram; I said no. He asked me what made me go in that manner; if I would come he would give me something; I did not know he was married. He had often attempted to make me be concern'd with him, but I never would; he was in a very bad condition with the soul disease. At last I went and drank with him; then I went home with him; there he bid me take the things. Then he said they were his wife's, and she was one of the drunkenest things in the world; and said, if Poll Merrit or you will come and live with me, I shall be happy.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is a false story. I never kissed her lips, or touched her hand in my life. She did once live over my room, but she had a husband. I have admitted her into my room, she has made my bed, and I have given her a dram, that is all.</p>

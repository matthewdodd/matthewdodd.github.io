I selected some of that wine to send Worthing—I selected eighteen bottles of port from one bin and eighteen from another—one eighteen was marked with black wax, with the word "port" on it, and I wrote in pencil on a label, the bins from which the wine was taken—I laid it flat on each eighteen of the bottles—the direction was afterwards written at my office at Wantage—this is the direction, in my hand-writing,(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) "W. Shipley, Esq., Union-cottage, Worthing—to be forwarded by Brighton railway—Feb., 1847," and on the address there are other words and figures, which are not my writing—I should say this label is my hand-writing—it is what I felt on one of the eighteen bottles at Childery.</p>

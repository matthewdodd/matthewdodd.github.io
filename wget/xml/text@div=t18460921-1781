                  </hi>. I am a policeman, in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company. On Saturday, the 22nd of Aug., I left this Court at half-past five o'clock—I went to the Cock public-house, New-street Golden-square, at a quarter after nine, to call on a friend—I did not find my friend, and as I was coming out the prisoner had a stick in his hand—there were two men together—when I passed them to go out of the house, the prisoner said, "There goes the b—railway policeman"—he immediately drew a sword from the stick, and stabbed me in the back, under the right shoulder—I im<lb></lb>mediately seized the sword, and told him he had stabbed me—I cannot say whether the stab was given with any force—I was four feet from him—I told the landlord he had stabbed me—the landlord said, "It is a serious thing; make it up with him"—I said, "No; I don't know the man: I have given him no provocation, nor spoken to him, pushed against him, or anything"—I was in great pain for a week—I poulticed the wound and fomented it—I had my police-coat on—here is the place where the cut was, and this flannel shirt is also cut through—the wound bled.</p>

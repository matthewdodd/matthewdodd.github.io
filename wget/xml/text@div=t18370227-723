                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Mark Davis Knight, who lives in the parish of West Hackney. On Friday the 10th of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs from the kitchen, and came down again in about five minutes—I had left the doors shut—there are two kitchen doors—one of them opens into the yard, and the other into a little hall—I went through that door to go up stairs, and left that door open—the door opening into the yard was shut and latched—there is no other door leading into the yard but that—there is one window at the back of the kitchen, and one in front—they were shut and fastened—when I came down I found the yard door open, and my shawl gone—I had seen it hanging on the inner door when I went up stairs—I ran to the yard door, and went out at the gate—a young woman opposite gave me information, and showed me the prisoner, three or four rods from the gate—she could not hear what was said to me—she was walking on the road—I ran after her—she asked me what business I had after her—I told her I was after my business—I called to somebody in the road to fetch a policeman—she began to run then, and ran a very few steps—I kept up with her—</p>

               <p>she gave over running, and turned down St. John-street—she walked to the bottom of that street—it is not a thoroughfare, and she turned back again, and came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the top of the street—I met a policeman, and he asked what was the matter—I gave her in charge for stealing my shawl—he asked her where the shawl was—she said she had not got it, and did not know any thing about it—she was then brought to master's house and in the yard a young woman lifted her cloak up, and found the shawl tucked underneath her arm—it was the one I had lost—this is it—the prisoner said she had bought the shawl, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—when I first said she had got the shawl, she said she had not been near the house—nor near the door.</p>

On the 10th of February, a little after five o'clock, from information I received, I ran down the Stoke Newington-road, and when I came to the corner of John-street I saw the prisoner coming up the street, followed by two young women—I ran down and met them—the prosecutrix said, "I give this woman into custody for stealing my shawl"—I asked the prisoner where the shawl was—she said she did not know, she had not seen it, and knew nothing of it—I took her back to the house where the prosecutrix lived, and the young woman lifted her cloak up and found the shawl under her arm—I asked her how the got it—she said she had bought it of a woman—Mr. Knight's house is in the parish <hi rend="italic">of</hi> St. John, at Hackney.</p>

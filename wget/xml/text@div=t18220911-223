            . On the 1st of September, in the morning, I was at a public-house in <placeName id="t18220911-223-crimeloc1189">Piccadilly</placeName>

I went up to the counter, took out my watch, and returned it to my pocket again; he immediately rose up, and snatched it from my pocket; I laid hold of him; a scuffle ensued between us; and several people came round us; he threw it over the settle, and then broke from me. I followed close behind him - the people knocked my hat off, and he got into the street, and ran across the Haymarket into Coventry-street, a man stopped him; and I secured him without losing sight of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Were you sober - A. I had drank two pints of beer, and might have had one glass of gin, but no more; I was collected, and had been with no women at the house, nor did I treat two women to my knowledge; I did not see the landlord; a woman sat next to the prisoner, and he was next to me; I did not tell the Magistrate that he handed the watch to another man; I heard Bellamy, who is not here, say that he threw his arm up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this house with a girl of the town, and drank some beer. This gentleman stood up by the bar, and several women were round him; there was not room for me to get up. I said I should go home. The woman wanted more gin; I rose up to get her a glass, and the gentleman charged me with the theft, which I am innocent of.</p>

            . I keep this public-house. I remember the prisoner coming, and saw the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110100"></xptr>come in. I was there all the time; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his watch. I was very near, and saw nothing to make me think he could have done it. I was thunderstruck to think how he could take it. I saw no struggle between them; it might pass without my seeing it, while I was giving change and taking money; but if there had been a struggle, I must have seen it - if the watch was taken, it must have been done in an instant. Strachan was in company with two women of the town, who pretended to say they saw the prisoner take the watch; but after the prisoner went out, I shut the door, and would not let them in, but they afterwards returned. Strachan was half and half, and the women were drinking with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner run away - A. A person said he saw the prisoner take the watch, and went for a constable; and while he was gone, the prisoner certainly did make a rush and go out, but he had been in the house five or ten minutes before that - he was taken and brought to my door - I would not admit them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who brought him to your door - A. The prosecutor. I saw no attempt to collar him. When the man said he saw him take it, he gave the man a thrust aside, and went out. There was a man with the prisoner, and another with the prosecutor.</p>

On Tuesday last about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, she was apparently very much intoxicated at the time she asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed her some she tumbled them about a good deal, she said her husband was a market gardener, at Walham Green, she complained that the handkerchiefs were not good enough, I shewed her some others, she chose one at eight shillings, she said she should like to have another, and then a third, she desired to have them all three put in paper, that she had not money enough, and left a deposit of five shillings, saying that she should return for them, her cart was at the corner of Sloane Street, and she would return and take the handkerchiefs away. In the meantime she was going out of the door, I missed one of the handkerchiefs which I had previously shewn her, I went out of the door and stopped her, one of the handkerchiefs dropped from her as she was before the window, not the one that I missed, then there dropped a second and a third, and the one that I missed came the fourth, and then a fifth dropped on the step as we were returning in; there were two other pieces dropped one with two in it, and the other three, they are not brought forward, the others were five single handkerchiefs, they dropped from between her legs, I believe the five handkerchiefs to be mine, I shall only swear to one that is six shillings, they cost me more, we sell them at eight shillings, that one has our mark to it. The prisoner was in liquor.</p>

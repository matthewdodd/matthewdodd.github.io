                  </hi>. I was an inspector of the G division of police—on Saturday, the 26th March, in consequence of information, I went to No. 2, Smith's-court, Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Inspector Bryant and the other witnesses—the door of the house was open—we proceeded to the first-floor room—the door was fastened with a drop bolt on the inside—we broke it open with a sledge hammer—the three prisoners were in the room—the two men were sitting at a table at the back window—the female was standing between them—the men were engaged in rubbing counterfeit coin between their finger and thumb, what they call <hi rend="italic">slumming</hi> it, to give new coin a black appearance like old coin—the female immediately rushed towards the front window, which was behind me—the men stood up from the table, and Hayward rushed towards me—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Charley,</hi> I have come to pay you another visit"—he said, "All right, all right, Jemmy! You have got me to <hi rend="italic">rights;</hi> I knew you would have me some day: I am better pleased by 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that you have got me, and not—," two others whom he named—I examined the table, and on it, and by it, I found twenty-two florins, three crowns, and twenty-nine shillings, all of which are counterfeit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some were on the table and some on the floor—I found on the table this box, containing black composition in a wet state—it in used in a wet state—I found in Hayward's pocket one-and-sixpence, and I saw Johnson throw down three florins, which I believe were counterfeit.</p>

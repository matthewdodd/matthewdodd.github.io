               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A I had been drinking, I was sober enough to know who took my bag away. I have known the prisoner this twelve years. He wanted to buy a cart, he wanted to borrow three guineas of me, I pulled out my bag and laid it on the table, I promised him he should have three pound or three guineas; he looked at the bag, took it up and went away. I staid there some time and then I went after him, I did not think he was going to rob me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you remain in the public-house. A. I suppose the best part of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you got out and looked right and left, and could not find him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where his wife lived. - A. Yes; I made the best of my way to where his wife lived, in Pye-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his wife at home. - A. I did not go to his lodgings; I went to a public house that he used, and enquired for him; I staid there some time, and when he came home I asked him for it; he denied it, and said he had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again. - A. No; there was some part of it found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the two pound notes and the one pound notes. - A. No, none of the notes; there was fourteen pounds in notes; there was fifty-three pounds fifteen shillings in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You are a coal porter; they tell me you are the best natured man at the waterside; you knew this man a long time, you and he have drank together a great many times. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have done a kind act one for the other. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a great deal together. - A. We had both of us been drinking there.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to purchase a cart; you threw your bag on the table, and said, do not want money. - A. No, I meaned to give him three guineas; I put the bag on the table by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than three or four guineas in the bag. - A. I had; I cannot tell how many guineas I had.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I have got the purse and some part of the money here. On the 20th of March in the evening I was sent for to a public house in Pye-street, Westminster, where I found the prisoner Bland and Piety, and a man of the name of Evans. Piety told me of his loss, and gave charge both of Evans and Bland. I conveyed them both to the watchhouse; I searched Bland; I found a half crown and a few halfpence; he told me that was all the money he had in the world; he refused to tell me where his lodgings were when I asked him, and said his stable was in 
Tothil fields. I went and found them both within an hundred yards. I searched them both and found nothing there. On the Monday following, at the office, I saw Mr. Cope's man give the prisoner half a guinea; I learned that some money was left at Mr. Cope's, a liquor shop, just by Newgate market. I went there and found thirteen guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that purse. - A. Mr. Cope, in the presence of

            . I am servant to Mr. Cope, he keeps a liquor shop in Newgate-market. On the 20th of March the prisoner came into my master's shop between the hours of six and seven in the evening; he asked if Mr. Cope was at home, I told him no; he said he wanted to leave a little money with him, I told him he might leave it with me, I would take care of it. He left with me thirteen guineas and a half; that is the bag and the same money.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Is that your bag. - A. I believe it is, there was a string in then; this is what the gold was in; there was another bag larger than this, that had the notes in, and this bag was inside of that.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That is my bag what I put my silver and what I took in, I have had it two years. I left thirteen guineas and a half at Mr. Cope's, because I was drunk; I left it for safety. I went round with that man, he said he would lend me some money; I said I had money, I wanted none, but I had none about me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

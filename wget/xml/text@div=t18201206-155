            . I am fifteen years old, and live at No. 4, Exeter-place, Chelsea, about three hundred yards from North-street. On the 15th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw Pace, and we picked him of his watch in North-street. I was returning from the Cobourg Theatre with the three prisoners - I had known them five or six years. I live with my father, who is a boot and shoemaker. Mr. Pace was intoxicated - the prisoners asked me to rob him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised - A. Yes, I was never asked to do so before. I said No, I should do no such thing; they said I should - I said,</p>
               <p>"If I must I must."</p>
               <p>Q. You said "We picked him" - A. Yes, we picked him up, and walked him along as far as Hooper's-court; Witham then unbuttoned his coat, took out his watch, and told me to take care of it - I took it home. They took a purse, a breast-pin, a pencil-case, a pair of scissars, and 1 l. 17 s. 6 d., Ross took them - he lived with Mr. Inselwood, a dealer in marine stores, in North-street. We left the gentleman and went home.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN RODMAN. I am a bottle-dealer, and live at No. 3, Seymour-yard, Bryanstone-square. I have known Ross six or seven years; I used to live at Chelsea. On Tuesday fortnight or three weeks, I was at his master's, packing bottles, which I had brought of him; Ross sat by the fire and said,</p>
               <p>"I have a bargain to sell," and produced a shirt-pin. I asked what he wanted for it? he said 18 d. I said I did not think it gold. A Jew boy came by, and he shewed it to him, he offered 1 s. for it. I said I would give him 18 d. for it, and bought it; Snowsell came to me about it, I had given it away. I fetched it and gave it to him, Mr. Pace claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known him - A. Six or seven years. I thought he was Inselwood's son.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked any of the family if they allowed him to sell it - A. No. I gave it to my wife's cousin. If it had been worth two guineas I would have sold it for that - if I could have got four guineas for it I would.</p>

             re-examined. Rodman gave me the pin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What relation are you to Clark - A. He is my nephew. I do not see him once in three months. He came and told me of the robbery first, and said the prisoners came for the watch, but it was hid in his father's workshop, and he could not get at it, but they said they would tell his father if he did not. He went to his mother's drawer and got them 3 l. instead of it. He gave me the watch, and I took him before the Magistrate the same night.</p>
               <p>(Pin and watch produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to CLARK. Q. This is not the only robbery you committed, you took 3 l. from your father - A. That was to give to them. I did not propose to rob the gentleman. Ross had all the money, which was 1 l. 17 s. 6 d. I did not know Snowsell was my relation. I have heard my mother say Mrs. Snowsell was my aunt. I was not easy in my mind while I had the watch.</p>

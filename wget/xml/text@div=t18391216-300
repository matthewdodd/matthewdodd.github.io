                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Dolphin-place, Holborn. On the evening of the 9th of December, I went out about six o'clock, leaving the prisoner to take care of my room—she had been three weeks with me—I returned in about an hour, found my door closed, and the key in it—I found my bed stripped, and missed two blankets, an apron, and two combs—the prisoner was gone—I ran out directly to look for her, and found her in about an hour down Clerkenwell-green—I laid hold of her arm, and gave her in charge—she knocked me about a great deal until the policeman secured her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You sent me to pawn the counterpane and blanket. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I never employed her to pawn any thing for me at any time—I did not go with her to the pawnbroker's—Clerkenwell-green is about a quarter of an hour's walk from my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was seven or eight weeks with her—she sent me to pawn them, and came and met me outside the pawnbroker's, and I gave her the money. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

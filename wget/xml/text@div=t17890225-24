               <p>Mr. Bumstead. I apprehended her, she was passing my door, and from what my daughter told my son, the prisoner was brought in by my son, I immediately called my daughter and the porter, and they both knew her; I told her if she would make confession, and tell us where the things were, we would proceed no further; they were never found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Nicolls. I saw her in the street before she was brought in, I knew her directly, she did not object to coming into the shop; the shop where she was brought into is not the shop where she bought the muff, my master has two shops, the shop is just opposite, it is a little further on; the young man was taken with her but discharged.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, most of whom had known her from her infancy, and gave her a very good character.</p>

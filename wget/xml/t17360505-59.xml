            . The Prisoner and another Man came to our Shop to cheapen Ribbons: I shewed some, and then they would look at some Handkerchiefs: I shewed them some, and among the rest, a Dozen that were just come in. I saw him clap three Lustring ones under his Coat, he had two great Coats on, besides his Wastcoat: upon that I ask'd him what he had got under his Coat; why, says he, do you think I would steal any thing? I don't know, says I, and reaching over the Computer, I unbuttoned his Coat, and down dropt the Handkerchiefs: His Companion immediately took them up, and threw them in my Face, and then they both ran into the Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the Dozen of Handkerchiefs under his Coat?</p>
               <p>Dobey. Yes, his Companion took them off the Ground, and threw them in my Face: The Prisoner took the Dozen of Handkerchiefs, as well as the three odd ones, to the Door to look at them.</p>

            . While my Fellow-Servant was searching the Prisoner; I saw the Dozen of Handkerchiefs drop from under his Great Coat to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you stand, when you saw this?</p>
               <p>Elstob. By your side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Hark'e, my Boy, you need not grudge going to Hell, when you swear so. Before the Lord-Mayor, they valued the Goods at 30 s and now they value them at 40 s. which shews 'tis a malicious Prosecution. They had the Goods in the Shop, and came after in the Street, and charged me with stealing the Things they had in the Shop the same Time. <rs id="t17360505-59-verdict292" type="verdictDescription">

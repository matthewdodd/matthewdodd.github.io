Oil Sunday; the 19th of October, the prisoner came to the house—I answered the ring, and he asked if Mr. Northwood was at home—I said, "No"—he then asked if Mrs. Northwood was at home—I said, "No"—he put a note into my hand, but as neither Mr. nor Mrs. Northwood were at home, he said he would call next morning; about nine o'clock he called, and asked if Mr. Northwood was at home—I said, "Yes"—he put the note into my hand, and said he would wait for an answer—I asked him into the passage, and shut the door—I gave the note to Mr. Northwood—he read it, and went into the passage—the prisoner was gone, and the coat which had hang in the pas<lb></lb>sage when I let him in.</p>

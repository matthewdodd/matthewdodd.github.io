            . I am a potter in these gentlemen's employ. On the 2nd of April I was in the pottery. I saw a load of straw brought to my master's stables by a man of the name of Livermore; the straw was received by Harris and Farrow; I saw Farrow put two parcels of hay into the cart. Harris was looking towards the wheel-wrights shop, apparently as if to look out to observe whether any one saw it. Harris put a bit of straw over the hay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not.</p>
               <p>Muller. Harris went with the cart and with Livermore up the hill; Farrow went after them in the course of a few minutes, and I saw them go off the premises.</p>

            . I am a chaff cutter in the employ of the prosecutor. On the 3d of April Livermore brought a load of straw to the stables; Harris and I agreed to let him have a truss of clover hay of Mr. Hope's; I went into the loft, and put a truss of hay down in two parts. Harris looked about the yard to see if any body saw us. Harris then put a truss of straw into the cart to take to Mr. Vigne's stable, for his nag to lye upon; he never sprinkled any over the hay; he chucked it in any how. Harris went up the hill with the cart, and Livermore; I followed a few minutes after. When the cart got from Mr. Vigne's I saw him take the straw out of the cart, and the cart went on. I went into the public house, and Harris came to me; he told me that the man had given him a shilling to spend for the straw, and one shilling and three-pence for the hay, that was two shillings and three-pence all together.</p>
               <p>Q. You were charged and taken up upon this and was admitted an evidence - A. Yes.</p>

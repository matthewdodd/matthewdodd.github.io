             sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. Thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q. If you speak that which is not true do you know what will happen to you? - A. I should be done something to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you thing it a wicked thing to speak untrue? - A. Yes; I live with Mr. Porter: On the 23d of February, about a quarter past nine in the evening, the prisoner came in and ordered a pot of beer, and change for half-a-guinea, to be carried into Vere-street, but he mentioned no particular house, he waited at the door till I took it with him; I carried it to the first house on the left-hand side, a picture-shop; he said, that was the house; I set the beer down at the door, there was a light in the shop; I gave him the change, he looked at it, and put it into his right-hand coat-pocket, and then he gave me a farthing instead of half-a-guinea, and then he run away as fast as ever he could; I ran after him, and the watchman stopped him at the corner of Oxford-buildings; he was secured, and taken into the tap-room, and searched, and three shillings and two-pence halfpenny was found in his pocket, with other silver; he had conveyed a seven-shilling-piece into his handkerchief, and when he took his handkerchief out of his pocket the seven-shilling-piece dropped out; he was taken to the Justices on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not pretend that he had been sent by a gentleman in Vere-street? - A. No; he mentioned no gentleman, nor any person; he said it was to be carried into Vere-street.</p>

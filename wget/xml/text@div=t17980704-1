            , one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; On the morning of the 29th of May, a little before one o'clock, I was standing at the turnpike-gate, in Tottenham-court-road, in the Hampstead-road, I observed the prisoner at the bar leading a horse towards London, it was just light enough to discover him; I went on to the turnpike-gate, seeing he wanted to go through without the turnpike-man getting up, and I knocked the turnpike-man up; he got up, and the prisoner asked him what the toll was; he said, three halfpence; he said, he had got but a halfpenny, which he held up; I then said to him, whose mare is this, for I know the mare somewhere; he said, he had brought her from the fair; I then asked him who his master was; he said his master's name was Waterman; he said to me, I dare say you know two or three of that name; he said he lived no great way from Highgate; he then said to the turnpike-man, I will go back and get some more money, he turned the horse round and away he went. I went up to my father, who was just coming off duty, and told him what I had seen, and he came down with me towards the turnpike, and we met him on this side the gate coming to town; he had not come through the gate, he had got round by some houses; there was a woman on the mare, and the prisoner was leading her; we then took him to the watch-house; this is part of the halter he was leading the mare with, (producing it); we took the mare to Mr. Francis's, about three o'clock in the morning. On the Tuesday following, I had got the mare out giving her some water, and Mr. Cook saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the mare you took from the prisoner was the mare that Mr. Cook saw a week after? - A. I am perfectly sure of it; he immediately owned her; Mr. Johnson has got the mare now at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know why Mr. Johnson is not here? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cook.) What is the value of this mare? - A. About three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

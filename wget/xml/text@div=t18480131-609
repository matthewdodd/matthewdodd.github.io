                  </hi>. I am clerk to the General Screw Steam Shipping Company, in Mark-lane. On 31st Dec. I was in my office, on the first floor, at five o'clock in the afternoon—I had my cash-box out, and was making up my money for the day—(I had before that seen a man named Hillier—he had come to our office frequently—I had seen him on the pre<lb></lb>vious morning)—a person, whom I firmly believe to be the prisoner, came in—he stated in Dutch, which I do not fully understand, that he wished to go to Corunna—he had an opportunity of seeing my cash-box and the money, and he might have heard it chink at the door—I told him we had nothing to do with Corunna, and referred him to another place in the street—he went out, came back in about five minutes, and said he did not want to go to Corunna, but to Rotterdam—we have vessels go there—I took him to another office, on the other side of the landing—Mr. Galley and some other clerks were there—I left my cash-box in the safe—it is an ordinary safe, with the doors standing open—I locked the cash-box, but not the safe—this is the cash-box—there was 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, in gold and in silver—when I went across to the other office, I closed the door of my own office, but did not lock it—no one was left in it—when I got to the other office, there was an inquiry made by the prisoner in Dutch—he speaks very little English—we remained there three or four minutes—while there, the prisoner shot the bolt of the door inside—that fastened the whole of us in—it made no noise—he was referred to the Rotterdam broker, Mr. Rahn, opposite—a clerk came and opened the door, and the prisoner went out and went down stairs—I immediately went into my room, and found my cash-box gone—when I looked down the stairs, I saw some one, and my impression si that it was Hillier—he was about two stairs before the prisoner—the prisoner was between him and me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Lanning and Co. The office I was in on 31st Dec. is opposite to Mr. Dickinson's—he came into my office, about five o'clock, that evening, with the prisoner—the prisoner followed him in, and immediately shut the door—I did not observe him do anything to it besides shutting it—there is a bolt to it—at the time he was about to leave, the door was bolted, and he shook it, and made a great noise, which could be heard by any person on the landing—I could not say whether it had been bolted before he interfered with it—I told a clerk, named Henry, to go round and open the door—he had to walk about six yards to do it—the prisoner was making efforts at the door, as if not aware of its being bolted, but it must have been him who bolted it, as no one else touched it—not more than a minute after that they left, Mr. Dickinson came and complained of his loss—I went to Mr. Rahn's, which is immediately opposite—the prisoner was not there, and had not been there.</p>

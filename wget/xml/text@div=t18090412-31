               <p>Q. Were you in your shop when somebody came into it - A. I was in the parlour, my parlour has a glass door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On the 1st of March, a few minutes after nine in the evening; I am sure of it, the watch was set.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any candles alight in your shop - A. Yes, for two hours or more; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Your parlour is behind your shop, and separated from your shop by a glass door, is it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And none of your people were in your shop - were they - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the shop any time before - A. Yes, about three or four or five minutes, I cannot exactly say; no longer. I was in the shop, I let a customer out and fastened the door after them; I am sure that I shut the door myself and fastened it with the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop door one door, not a hatch at the bottom - A. No, it is all one door, a glass door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in this parlour did you hear any thing - A. When I was in the parlour I heard somebody spring the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the latch of the shop door - A. I heard the latch of the shop door; I turned my head, I did not rise out of the chair; I looked through the glass door, I did not see any one come in, I saw the door go, I could see over the bottom of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the shop door was open - A. It was perfectly open when I turned my head; I did not get off my chair till a gentleman came past; he sung out to me there is a thief in your shop; he was at the door; I believe he stepped in the shop; I got up and went into the shop when I heard the gentleman speak; the gentleman catched this man upon his hands and knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell me what yoo saw - A. I saw the gentleman had got the man by the collar; I saw a gentleman in my shop, he had hold of the prisoner Bolton.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the gentleman come in the shop - had he got within the door of your shop, or was it at the door that he had got hold of him - A. He was about a yard within the door way; the gentleman had hold of Bolton by the collar, Bolton had been down upon his hands and knees; he gave the alarm to me, I catched hold of Bolton by the collar, half outside of the door; the gentleman said there was another; I did not see another in the shop, or looking in at the window. Immediately after that I left Bolton in the shop with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut the door, or any thing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he staid quietly in the soop, did he - A. No, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to when you left him in the shop with your wife - A. I went to the gentleman that Tiffen insulted outside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off did you catch hold of Tiffen - A. He run about a hundred yards, I saw him running; the gentleman said he was the man; he and another tried to strike the gentleman three or four times. I got him by the collar myself, and resigned him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then come back to your shop - A. No. I did not; he got away from the watchman, he stripped himself of his clothes, I saw him pull of his clothes; he crossed Goswell street and went up Gee street. I followed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him taken - A. Yes; Lewis, a black man, took him; I am sure he was the same man; he was brought back and taken to the watchhouse, from there, after he was put in the watchhouse, he was taken to Clerkenwell prison; I accompanied him there; he struggled, we were obliged to tie his hands. While I was at the watchhouse Bolton got away.</p>
               <p>Q. That you know nothing about - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Bolton in your shop - A. No; Bolton came up to the watchhouse door while I was there present - I said this is the man that I had by the collar in the shop; then he went towards Whitecross street, he on the right hand pavement and I down on the horseway; I got before him and caught him by the collar, and brought him back to the watchhouse. I am sure he is the same man. I told him he was my prisoner, that he was the man which the gentleman caught on his hands and knees in my shop. Then I brought him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In your shop you have cheese, butter, and bacon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You go through the shop into the house to go up stairs - A. Yes. I have been robbed twice before.</p>
               <p>Tiffen. The gentleman says I was apprehended by a black man. Lewis can testily that he never apprehended me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Lewis is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure he is the same man that was apprehended - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the person that came into the shop - A. Mr. Dennet.</p>
               <p>Tiffen. I would wish to ask the prosecutor if he ever saw me at his shop - A. I never saw him to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120023"></xptr>Tiffen. Nor you never saw me in company with this man - A. I never saw either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JOHN DENNET. Q. Do you know the shop of Mr. Salmon in Goswell street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going by one evening, and seeing somebody in the shop - A. Yes; on the 1st of March, a little after nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were you walking along the street - 
               <persName id="t18090412-31-person333">A. </persName>
            Yes. On the 1st of March, a little after nine in the evening, just as I came to Mr. Salmon's shop, I saw something going up the three steps of the shop, it looked something black, like a great dog; I stopped to look, I thought it was a very large dog, I stood a moment, I perceived it was a man upon his hands and knees going into the shop; the shop door at that time was open, and it struck me that it was a man going to rob the shop. I stepped back just round the door post, there was a passage close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stepped back to watch - A. Yes, to watch. I cast my eye along the front of the window, I saw another man looking into the shop window; the other man then came from she shop window - Tiffen did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tiffen the other man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him before, did you - A. Yes, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know his name to be Tiffen, did you - A. No; I never heard his name before; I was in the dark, I could see him plainly by the light of the window, I knew him by sight. The moment he came from the shop window by the door, he either said George or Thomas, I believe, I cannot say which. The prisoner Bolton, I believe, did not hear him; he passed the door a few yards, he returned again; when he came by the door, he said d - n you George or Thomas, or whatever name it was - you are done.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he said that, where was the other person that you had seen - A. About two yards in the shop, going forward in the shop upon his hands and knees; I believe Bolton then heard him speak, and then Bolton was withdrawing out of the shop; I stepped into the shop, and caught hold of him by the back part of his coat; I asked him if he was going to rob the man's shop - he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any one else in the shop - A. No. I asked him what business he had there; in the mean time Mr. Salmon came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call him out - A. No further than my speaking loud; Mr. Salmon came out of the parlour, at least the back room; I then delivered him into Mr. Salmon's care; he was then off his hands and knees; when Mr. Salmon came to me, and I delivered him up to Mr. Salmon, I said to Mr. Salmon take him into custody, there is another concerned in it, I shall see him in a minute; in the mean time there came round ten or fifteen people. I turned round and saw Tiffen, I said you are the rascal that was concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you saw in the crowd was the same man that you had seen outside of the window, and who had spoke to him - A. I was sure he was the same person. As soon as I told him he was the rascal that was concerned with him he drawed himself in an attitude to strike me; I had a stick in my hand, and a bundle under my other arm; I struck him across the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he did make a blow at you - A. Yes; with his fist; he then attempted the second time to strike me; I struck him with my stick; he would have struck me if he could, but he could not get at me; he ran across the street directly, I pursued him across the street; I struck him once or twice going across; he ran down Sutton street, just at the corner of Sutton street I struck him across the shoulder, he reeled and fell down. One of the watchmen came up to me and was going to collar me; I said go and take hold of the thief; then he was taken hold of by the watchman in my presence; the first watchman that came up could not hold him; the second watchman came up; he stripped himself out of his coat and he did make an attempt to run, after he was stripped out of his coat; he was stopped by a third watchman. I left him in the care of the watchmen; I never saw him any more till I saw him at Worship street. I went home after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Tiffen was the man that you have been speaking about - A. I am sure that Tiffen is the man that spoke to him, and the man that was at the window; he went as far as Gee street after he spoke to him, and there he stopped by the post; I saw Bolton go into the shop; I took him in the shop.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SPICER. I am an officer of the parish. I was sent for; I found both the prisoners in the watchhouse; I took them to prison.</p>
               <p>Bolton's Defence. I was going to Mr. Wood's in Aldersgate street with some work for my father; my shoe came untied coming home, I put my foot upon the step to tie my shoe; the witness said here is a thief in the shop; I had no occasion for stealing of any thing. I declare to Almighty God I know nothing of the young man.</p>
               <p>Tiffen's Defence. I was walking on the other side of Goswell street; I was very much in liquor; I saw a mob on the other side of the way, consequently I pushed myself into the mob; this gentleman was accusing one and another; he said, you were with him; I argued with him on the subject; he 
               <persName id="t18090412-31-person334">drew</persName>
             a large stick and hit me on the arm; I ran away and he pursued me and struck me. I never had any discourse with the other young man before this transaction.</p>

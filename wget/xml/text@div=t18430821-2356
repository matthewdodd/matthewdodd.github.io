                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Pardey, and live in Cromer-street, Saint Pancras. On the 26th of July these two coats were behind the door, and the trowsers were on the foot-rail of the bed—about three o'clock in the day I left the bed partly made and went into the kitchen—in five minutes I heard footsteps—I came up stairs quick and lightly—I saw two men coming out of the room—the prisoner was one of them—before I reached the top of the stairs the prisoner left the house, the other turned and asked for Mr. Pardey—I said, "Who wants Mr. Pardey?"—he said, "Mr. James, of Clerkenwell,"—I said, "Who is that man that is gone out, and what do these clothes do on the bed?" I went to the street door and saw the prisoner, the other man left the house, and they were just joining together—the prisoner stood stock still at the post, the other man went to the left towards Brunswick-square—I watched him a few minutes, till the policeman came in sight, and the prisoner took to his heels—I said, "Follow that man, he has been in my house"—I desired him to search him—I went home, and found these coats and trowsers were lying on the bed in a heap together, and the bed partly made—they had been removed about a yard and a half, and had been unhung from the hook on the door—I had shut the door on the single lock—the things belong to my lodger, Frederick Thomas George Crees.</p>

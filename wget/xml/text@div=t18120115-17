On Saturday morning my warehouseman informed me that a piece of goods was bid in the coal cellar, I went down, in the cellar I found a bundle placed in a hole in the coals. I took it up and untied it, it was tied up in the prisoner's apron, and inclosed in it were two pieces of white, and one of grey calico, I tied the bundle up again, and it was replaced again in the coals. I got two officers, it was agreed that they should be in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150028"></xptr>passage of the adjoining premises to ours. At a quarter after four they were in waiting, I called the prisoner up to shut up the warehouse, I saw this done, and at half past four I left as usual, as if to go to my dinner, I turned into the passage to the officers, and there waited with them his coming out. About five o'clock he came out, he was directly siezed by Drinkwater with the bundle upon him; I accompanied them with him to the Poultry compter, he was searched, the officers took his keys, we then went to his lodgings, the officers searched his box in my presence, they found in one of his boxes 102 l. in bank notes, and on Monday morning they found two pound more, for his having part of the money, there appears a satisfactory account from a memorandum found in his book, there is an accompt of his having sold some lands for ninety pound, and among these notes there were 65 l. marked as received on the 9th of March. therefore, I suppose that is part of the money; here is an accompt found among his papers, which is a sale of goods, which exactly correspond with our goods in his hand writing.</p>

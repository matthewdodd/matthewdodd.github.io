            , he is nephew to the prisoner at the bar; I followed him into Thames-street from the water side, and I went to the head of him and I said, where are you going with this? after we had taken this man to the watch-house we went back again, and we met this man, the prisoner, and another in Thames-street with a plank on their shoulders, one at each end, the two men carrying one plank; Mr. Coopey's man was the first on the road; I asked him where are you going with this? he said, he did not know; says he, I don't know nothing at all about the matter, there is my master at the other end of the plank.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner hear what the ohter man said? - There is no doubt of it, the plank was about twenty feet long; I went to Mr. Coopey, the prisoner at the bar, at the other end, and said, where have you had this from? he rather hesitated, and at last he said he had it from the water side; I asked him whose it was? he said he did not know; I asked him if it was his property? he said, that somebody had been with him and he had them to cut up, and he was taking them home, I asked who ordered him to take them home; he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wainwright, mind what you are speaking of, I did not hesitate.</p>
               <p>Wainwright. I asked him if he knew who owned them? he said, he could not tell; then says I, don't you know who employed you? says I, you must drop it and go along with me; I took him to the watch-house and I asked him can you give any good account who these belong to? I asked him if he knew who the person was if he could find him? he did not know; I left him at the watch-house and I went down to the water side again, I and my partner both together, at the water side at the same place, there were two boys pulling the planks on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plank when you took the prisoner to the watch-house? - I left it in the street, and when I came back again I found it in the same street; his partner's name was Williams, he is not here; I went before the magistrate the next day, and the prisoner was committed, not that day, he was remanded till the day following; then the nephew was ordered for a witness, he was bound over in a ten pound bond to give evedence; I have not seen him here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You asked him whether those deals belonged to him? he said, they did not; he never claimed them; you asked him whether he knew the person that employed him? you said he told you he did not know the man; you know where this man lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him before? - I knew something of him; he lives in East Cheap; he was going in a direction towards his house.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a sawyer? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he was carrying them to cut them up, but he did not know who the property belonged to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you got the plank here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you had seen some deals on board a ship at Iron Gate? - I had been at the wharf and measured two or three lighters before this lighter came up, but I never measured any from this lighter before it was stole,</p>
               <p>Q. It has no mark of Mr. Dickenson's? - It has not; I cannot swear it is Mr. Dickenson's; I can say on empting the craft there were sixteen missing, but I cannot say that of my own knowledge.</p>

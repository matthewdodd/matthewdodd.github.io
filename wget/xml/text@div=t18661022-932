                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at Charing Cross Hospital—on Sunday evening, 9th September, about half-past seven o'clock, a child was brought there by the prisoner—she did not give its name then, she did afterwards, she said it was Alfred Charles Holmes—she said it was her own child—it was dead—it was about fifteen months old—I told her that it was dead, and she began to cry, and said, "Oh! no, it is not dead"—I examined the child, it was very thin, and its clothes were very dirty and ragged—it was covered with vermin and dirt—its weight was eleven pounds—that is not the usual weight of a child fifteen months old—it ought to be from fifteen to twenty pounds at least—its height was the average height of a child of that age—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—its stomach was quite empty and contracted—it contained no food or trace of food—the body was very free from blood, and there were no signs of fat—there was slight disease of the lungs, but, apart from thinness, there was no disease of any organ—I attributed the child's death to want of sufficient nourishment—there were no signs of severe diarrhoea—if it had had slight diarrhoea there would not be any signs.</p>

I live at No. 59, Chandos Street, and keep the "One Tun"—on Sunday afternoon, 9th September, about two o'clock, the prisoner came there—she had a child on her knee—she called for half a pint of beer—after she had drunk the beer she asked me if I would make a pennyworth of port wine—I told her it was unusual, but, as I knew her for some time, I said if the wine was for the baby I would give her a glass of wine, which I did—she dipped one of her fingers in it, and moistened the child's mouth—I observed the appearance of the child—it was very</p>

               <p>sickly, and appeared to me that it would not live many hours—I told her so—I did not notice whether the child drank the wine, I was busy with other customers at the time—the other customers were begging and praying of the mother to take the child to the hospital immediately, to have medical advice—she said that she could not go to the poor house, that when she left it two or three months ago she had been supplied with bed and bedding, and she had lost them—I have known the prisoner very nearly three years—she has sometimes been to my house twice a day, sometimes once, and sometimes not at all—she was an occasional passer-by—I think she had been at my house the day previous to this Sunday—she came for drink—she generally called for half a pint—sometimes she would come once, twice, and three times a day, and sometimes she would not come for two or three days—I have never seen her incapable or the worse for liquor—she used to bring her children with her—she did not give them any of the beer to my knowledge, she might.</p>

I am a widow, and live at the "Horse and Groom" public-house, Maiden Lane, Covent Garden—on Sunday, 9th September, the prisoner came to my house about a quarter to two o'clock—she had a baby with her—she called for half a pint of fourpenny ale—I noticed the child was ill, and asked her what was the matter with it—she said it was consumptive—I asked her if she had any advice for it, and she said she took it to the Charing Cross Hospital twice a week, and that they were giving it cod liver oil—she attempted to give the child some beer, and I said, "Don't give it some beer, I will give it some wine," and I gave it some—I told the prisoner if she came to my house I would give it a little port wine or arrowroot, or beef tea, seeing the child was so very debilitated—she came again in the afternoon, about ten minutes past five o'clock—she had half a pint of ale—she told me the child had been sleeping ever since, and I said it would sleep a long time before long, the child was very ill—she came in again about eight o'clock with a boy, and told me the child was dead—she was crying—I begged of her to go the union in the morning, because she did not seem very well clad—it was a damp sort of day—she said that her children sold fuzees in the street, and I said that was a very dreadful way of getting her living, and she had better go to the union—she did not make any remark.</p>

I should think the prisoner did not bring the child to the Charing Cross Hospital, from what the porter said—I should not see her if she did—she said she brought it to see one of the visiting physicians—there was no disease of the mesenteric glands—the glands were hardly visible—a child may die from partial neglect—in such a condition it would require more nourishing food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am relieving officer of St. Martin's workhouse—I have known the prisoner close on two years—that is since April, 1865—her husband died on 14th April, 1865—she was admitted into the workhouse in that month—she was close to her confinement at the time she was admitted—the child was born after her husband's death—she was confined in theworkhouse, and remained there close on twelve months, down to 19th April, 1866—she applied to be allowed half a crown a week and a set of bedding, which was granted—they gave her two sets of bedding instead of one on account of her four children, because they did not consider one would be sufficient for her—the reason for her not receiving the half-crown a week any longer was that the board did not think proper to give it her, and said they would receive her into the workhouse, and she was informed of it by the chairman—I made the order—the allowance was discontinued at that time—she did not receive any more half-crowns after the 20th August—she did not avail herself of the offer to come in—I did not see her for some time after that—I saw her a week before the child died, in front of the railway station, Charing Cross—she had got some matches in her hand, but I did not see her offer any to any one—the blankets that were supplied to the prisoner were gone from the room that she occupied—I went to the room—I have never seen any of the bedclothes or bedding—the value of the bedding was from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., flock bed and bolsters—no allowance was paid to her after she refused to come into the workhouse—her own statement to me was that she did needlework—her allowance had ceased for three or four weeks at the time I saw her at the Charing Cross Station—it was on 20th August that I went to her house—I saw her standing in Bedfordbury nursing the child—the last opportunity I had of noticing the child's features was on 20th August—it looked delicate, but did not appear to be ill—she was nursing it as a mother would do—I should think it had been delicate since its birth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Howard Ravenhill, and others, at Rotherhithe—on the morning of 31st October, I discovered that some lead had been removed from the roof of a building there, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I gave information to the police, and some one was placed to watch the premises—about half—past 3 in the afternoon, from what I heard, I went to the back part of the building, got on to the roof, and found the lead had been removed three or four feet from where I had first seen it—it was rolled up and placed at the edge of the gutter—it had been detached from the gutter when I first saw it—there was about 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 22 lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Ravenhill and Co.—on 31st October, I was at work discharging coals from a barge into the coal kilo, and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner on the roof of the building, close to where the lead had been removed—I saw him come from there and go away—I spoke to my foreman—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody one day last week—I am sure he is the person—I was about thirty yards from him.</p>

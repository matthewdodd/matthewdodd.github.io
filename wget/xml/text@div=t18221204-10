On the 26th of November, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I went out and left nobody in the stable - I locked the doors. On returning I found the stable door unlocked, and bolted inside. There is a stair-case leading from the stable to my room, which is over the coach-house. I drew back and stood quiet. A man gently opened the door, and locked out - I ran up, locked him in, held the door and called the watchmen; we burst the door open, and found the two prisoners there, who were strangers. My box coat was moved off the coach box, and put on the splinter-bar; it was my master's, and worth 5 l. Four coats were taken out of a box in my bed-room; also two pair of breeches, and four waistcoats, and all put in a heap ready to be tied up, and carried away. A phosphorus box was found, which was not there when I went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Does not your master allow you less wages on account of your sleeping there - A. No. There is a passage leading from the stable to the house. I am sure I locked the door. The box coat was a new one. The property is not here.</p>

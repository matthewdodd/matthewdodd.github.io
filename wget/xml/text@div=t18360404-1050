                  </hi> I am carman to Mr. Laurence Dorgan, a glass dealer, in Sheppy-yard, Little Trinity, Minories. I cannot say whether it is Holy or Little Trinity-parish—on the 31st of March I went there in the afternoon to look for the foreman—my master has a warehouse there, on the second floor—I found the prisoner on the top of the stairs, with a basket containing fourteen decanters, which had been taken from a shelf in an inner warehouse—there was another man with him, he was not secured he ran down stairs, and left a hat and decanter by the side of the basket—the prisoner lifted a basket from his shoulder and ran up two or three stairs—in two or three minutes he come down, went down on his knees, and begged pardon—he begged I would him go, and said he had been into it by the other—I left him in charge of a man on the first floor, and fetched Forrester—i found the warehouse door open—the lock was shot, as it would be when it caught and there were marks on the door, as if a small instrument had been applied to wrench it open—there was a hay fork near, and the marks are such as that would make.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to the prosecutor. I was there nearly the whole of that morning, till nearly two o'clock—I locked the warehouse door when I went—i took the key to the counting-house—I returned in about twenty minutes, from what I heard—the door had been wrenched open—I had seen the prisoner in Sheppy-yard is the morning, a little after ten o'clock, I think—i saw one or two others, but not in company with him—sixteen decanters were missing from the inner warehouse—they were safe when I left, at a quarter before two o'clock.</p>

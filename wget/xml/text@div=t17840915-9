             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in the service of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; these are the two notes Mr. Pilgrim put a stop to at our office, they were brought in; O, 103, was brought into the Bank, 5th July, it was brought in by one Mr. Bridale, taken at Drummonds by one of the out-door clerks of the Bank; the other was brought into the Bank the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>Court to White. Lok at these two notes, and tell me whether these two notes are the same you received at Drummond's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of these notes? - They appear to answer the same numbers and sums, I cannot swear to the identity of the dates, because I did not take them.</p>
               <p>Court to Castle. This O, 103, forty pounds, is that a sufficient description of a bank note, that it cannot be mistaken; are there never two notes of the same sum and number? - Not on the same day.</p>
               <p>But none of these people can speak to the day, they did not take the dates. - These notes have been traced back to the office from the indorsements.</p>
               <p>But independant of that, I suppose you had forty pound notes of the letter O, and No. 103, in other months and dates besides these? - Undoubtedly we may.</p>
               <p>You never saw, I understand, on the same day two notes of the same number and letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you the same month? - Yes, it may happen the same month.</p>
               <p>Then unless you have the date, the number and letter are not sufficient alone to identify the note? who traced them by the indorsement? - Mr. Pilgrim first gave the intimation at the office, and enquired if these notes were out-standing; he then gave a check.</p>
               <p>How did Mr. Pilgrim get at the dates?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I applied to my banker for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150039"></xptr> them, and when the notes came in, I found their dates answered exactly to those I had from my banker.</p>
               <p>There appears several names upon the back of the notes, but Mr. Bickerstaff, Mr. Rock, and Mr. Barugh seem to be the names which approach nearest.</p>
               <p>Court to Laws. Look at these two notes, have they the name of Barugh on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that your writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are these the notes you received, one from Harvey, and the other from Dare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Pilgrim. Is Bickerstaff here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. The difficulty is to be satisfied that these notes that were paid to Rock by Barugh, were the notes that you lost; now unless had gone to Fuller's, and taken the dates, you would not have known them? - No, only by the numbers and sum.</p>
               <p>That is common to all notes that are issued at different days, though not the same day? - They are, but there is the circumstance of Mr. Vaughan giving me the account of the dates of them.</p>
               <p>Court. But you should have brought the persons here, which took down in Fuller's books, the numbers from the receiving clerk? - I did not know that was necessary.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never made any personal application to Mr. Barugh, nor should I have brought this matter before a Court, but I thought it very extraordinary, that these two notes should center in one person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Counsel. You know these same circumstances would have convicted Bickerstaff, because they were in his hands? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>You know it is possible that they both might be in any honest man's hands? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. Would you wish for Mr. Barugh to go further? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, unless we can clearly fix the identity of the notes, that is, that the very notes that Barugh paid into the hands of Mr. Rock's servants, were the very notes Mr. Pilgrim lost, all this evidence goes for nothing: now as it seems to me, the proof fails in this respect, Mr. Pilgrim has no means of fixing that these are the very notes which he lost, but from the information which he has collected at the house of Fuller and Co. his bankers; for the letters, and numbers which he does know, is no proof that these are his notes, the date is the thing that is to fix; where the date, and the letter, and the number all correspond, certainly that is a proof of the identity, for they never issue two notes on the same day, of the same number and letter, but they do issue notes of the same numbers and letters on different days; there being that chasm in the evidence, which I see no means of supplying, I do not think it is material to call on the prisoner to make his defence, therefore, I think the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is the request of the Gentlemen to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Court. You may withdraw, I can have no objection to your withdrawing, but I wish you to understand me first, Mr. Pilgrim has lost two Bank notes, Mr. Barugh has circulated two Bank-notes, then Mr. Barugh should be called to account for them, because then he is found to have circulated those notes which Mr. Pilgrim has lost; but unless it is proved that they are those notes that Mr. Pilgrim has lost, there is no charge against him; now that is the point in this case; and if after this which I have told you in the face of your country; you think it a point to be doubted, whether a man is to be convicted when there is no evidence against him, you may withdraw if you please, it is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>The Jury then gave a verdict.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got his account-book? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You settled with him once a fortnight? - A. I do not; the cashier, Mr. Stephenson, receives the money, and I settle the accounts of the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In the prisoner's book is there any account of any money received on the 6th of October? - A. There is none received on the 6th of October, but there is money paid by him.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you constantly in the habit of asking him whether he had received any money, regularly every fortnight? - A. I cannot say that I did every time, but at sundry times I have done so.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first entertain any suspicion that he had received any money of Mr. Locke? - A. On his last settlement that we had on account of his wharfage; I asked him myself whether he had received any money for wharfage, in consequence of my sending the bill in, the man brought the receipt; he denied receiving the 5 l. 13 s. 8 d. of Mr. Locke; I had told him I should send round, and I did, and Mr. Locke came with his receipt; this was on the 19th of January, he mentioned one sum of Mr. Stapleton, and that is the only one he mentioned, and that was for wharfage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a refreshment contractor, at 14, Church Street, Pimlico—I have business at Lillie Bridge Grounds, Filham—on 29th September I was going along the grounds, and in my left-hand jacket pocket was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bag of silver, from which I had just paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had to pass through a crowd, and got hustled, and was set upon by Booth, who struck me about my head and face with his fist—I had not had words with any one—there were eight or ten others—when I got away from them I felt in my pocket for my handkerchief and the bag of silver was gone—Squire took him in custody, and said "Leave him to me; get away."</p>

I am an auctioneer's assistant in Great Russell Street I had no employment on the Monday, and while on the Lillie Bridged rounds I stood by a bookmaker, and there was a great rush after a pony race to draw the money, and Mr. Fenn came up to receive his money and accused me of stealing his ticket, and struck me on my throat I asked him what he meant, he turned away and I followed him. A constable came up and laid hold of me and I was given in charge for stealing a ticket Mr. Fenn charged me at the station with the assault, and the constable asked him if there was anything more, and he said he had lost a bag of silver containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I knew none of the people there. The bookmaker promised to come here and prove that he had a bet and drew 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him with a ticket.</p>

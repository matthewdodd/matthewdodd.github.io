            . My brother was a porter to Mr. Fenwick; I used to go to fetch his dirty linen; I saw the prisoner there - he has taken things off the counter and put in with the dirty linen, and I took them away: I have seen him take pieces of silk and cotton; I gave them to my mother, who pawned them; the prisoner told me to tell my mother to make as much as she could of them; I never pawned any, nor went with my mother to pawn them; I got them two or three times; the linen was washed and taken to my brother; I took the prisoner the money which my mother gave me - I took 10s., 15s., and 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Your brother was porter to the prosecutor? A. Yes, but he is not there now - he was dimissed after the prisoner gave me the articles; he is not here - he is at home, but was not there when we came out; I do not know why he went out; my brother was in the shop, cleaning lamps when the prisoner gave them to me; there was no one else in the shop - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I did not tell the Magistrate that I had pawned them: I did not think I was doing wrong; he told my mother at one time, when I was in the room, that they were all down in the book; he did not tell me he had a number of articles left on his hands, and that he had intended formerly to have gone into business.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BROWN. I am mother of the last witness; she has brought some silks and cottons in my son's linen from the shop - she sometimes said I was to make as much as I could; she said she brought them from Mr. Mussared - I pawned them at different pawnbroker's; I think I twice got 1l., and sometimes 10s., 15s., or 18s.; I sometimes sent the money by the child, and sometimes I took it him myself; I sometimes gave him the duplicates, and sometimes kept them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not threaten you with a prosecution? A. I was taken and locked up for three days; I was then ill for a fortnight, and was carried to the Westminster workhouse; I had no communication with any one. I should not have liked to have pawned things for my son unless I knew he had come by them honestly; I knew the prisoner was a shopman; they were remnants, but that did not excite my suspicion; I knew he had been going into business for himself, and being a repectable man I thought he might have them of his connections; my son is at home - I did not leave him there when I came out - he did not know he was required to be here, or he would have come; he has been living with me ever since he left the prosecutor, which was about a month after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you get for your trouble? A. Very little, sometimes enough to get me a loaf or a cup of tea: I do not know how I came to go to different pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of them are there? A. Eight or ten; I have the strongest recollection of three or four of them - I have no doubt of them all, except this piece of stuff, which I do not so well recollect; the prisoner had been in my service five months - he came with a good character from Messrs. Williams and Pearce, silk mercers, two doors from my house; when he left me he went to live with Mr. Clift; I had not discovered the robbery then, but he had staid out two hours, and I dismissed him; I have since heard he was going into partnership; he never told me that he had any goods of his own.</p>

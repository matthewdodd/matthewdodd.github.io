On the 1st of June I saw him going out of the room with my hat on; I called to him, but he was gone - I then got up, and missed these other things, which had been safe that morning; I went down, and told his master - other persons had gone through that room, but they were safe when they went out; I went and found the prisoner at Greenwich fair, with my shoes and hat - the other things are all gone: he said he had not had my things, I was a bl - y liar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked the prosecutor to do my work, as I felt unwell, from the effects of drink; we had both been drinking the night before - I asked him to lend me his hat and shoes, which he agreed to do; being holy-day time I wanted to go out, as my master said I might go out at any time, if I could get the prosecutor to do my work - I went to the fair, and met the prosecutor, who accused me of robbing him; I said, "I have no property of yours but what you lent me;" he would not listen to any thing, but gave me in charge for stealing his coat, waistcoat, and trousers, besides the hat and shoes, which I solemnly declare he lent me - he offered to settle the affair with my mother if she would give him 3l. 10s.; I had got his situation, which he had lost through bad conduct, and he wanted to regain it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE. There is no truth in what he states; I never lent him any thing, nor did he ever ask me - he went quite unknown to master.</p>

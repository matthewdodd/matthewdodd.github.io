                  </hi>. I am chief officer of the ship <hi rend="italic">Coromandel</hi>, belonging to John Scott and another. The prisoner was employed on board—I have lost 150lbs. weight of rope—I did not miss it till the officer of the dock came to me—I had seen it safe between decks about two weeks before—the ship was in the docks—the rope is here, and is my master's—the prisoner had no busi<lb></lb>ness with it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 12th of Dec. I stopped the prisoner coming out of the docks—he had 150lbs. of rope concealed under a quantity of wood, in his truck, and a small quantity of rope on the top—he said, "That is all I have, Mr. Taylor"—a constable said, "What have you got at the bottom?—I took down the tail-board, and found the rope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was employed to clear out the bold of the ship, and was to have the rope, and matting, and stuff, for my trouble; I cleared the hold out, and was on board a week and two days; I asked the mate for a pass—he said, "What do you want to put in it?"—I said, "Rope, matting, &amp;c, &amp;c."—Mr. Taylor asked what I had in the pass—I said, "I don't know, I can't read"—he said, "Have you any more rope?"—I said, "No," because the mate's pass will not permit any rope to be taken out.</p>

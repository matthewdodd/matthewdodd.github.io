On the 23d of December, a few minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, I left the shop, and went into the next room. I heard a crash at the shop-window, as if the glass was broken in. I instantly ran out of the door - (it was a few minutes after nine o'clock) - and heard somebody cry</p>
               <p>"There he goes!" and saw a man running with a drab-coloured coat on; he was immediately joined by another man, who came from one side of the road - they ran together, I followed them as far as Plough and Harrow-lane, which is not one hundred yards from our house. I turned down the lane after them - I followed them out of that into a narrow lane, then into Sound-lane - when they got down there they stopped; I went to them. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, mate! have you lost your way?" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not lost my way, but you are the persons who have broken our window." One said they had broken no window, for they had just come from Brentford. The other laughed, and said</p>
               <p>"It is not us." I asked them to go back with me - Baker said he should not go back with me, but asked me to go with them, and they would show me where they lived. I said I was without my hat, and should go no further. Baker took off his hat, and offered it to me, I said I should not take it, and then came away. When I got to the top of the lane, I called out,</p>
               <p>"I know your name is Baker, and I shall have you to-morrow" - I knew him before. The other man was the prisoner, Wilkins; he is a watchman. I am sure he was the other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. This was a very foggy evening - A. It was foggy. They ran down the lane between two hedges.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Baker the same evening (the 23d of December) about nine o'clock in a narrow passage, within three doors of his own house, talking to a man in the passage - Wheatley was with me, and gave him in charge. I told him he must go to the cage with me; he swore he would not go that night, and threw the knife down which he had in his hand. I went to collar him, and he struck me - I had charged him with the robbery. He told Wheatley, jun. that he did not know how many pins he had lost, nor the value of them. On the Thursday morning, about ten o'clock, I took Wilkins at Hammersmith - he was a watchman of Hammersmith at that time, and on duty the night of the robbery - his beat was rather below the prosecutor's house - I believe Sound-lane is in his beat. I charged him with the robbery; he denied it, and said he had been to Brentford that night. Wheatley gave me the pin.</p>

About five o'clock, on the night of the robbery, I was going to see if we could get a job to run and light the coaches, it being very foggy - we could get nothing to do. As we were returning home we had some beer at Hammersmith; we met a girl, and gave her a glass of gin. I left Wilkins at the public-house, at the corner of Plough and Harrow-lane, with her. I returned, and overtook Wilkins in Sound-lane. Wheatley came up, and said he suspected we had broken his father's window, as we were the first men he overtook, and he had been told we had ran down the lane. He asked me my name, and where I lived? I told him to follow me home, and offered him my hat. I was taken up at supper-time, and refused to go, as the constable had no warrant - I never struck him.</p>

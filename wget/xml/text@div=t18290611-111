            . I am a tailor. I knew the prisoner by working for my master, Mr. Merrell, a tailor - he came there on the 6th of May, about twelve or one o'clock, and asked for work; he was told Mr. Merrell was not at home - he came up stairs into the workshop, up three pairs of stairs, and must have passed the clock; he staid there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went away - I did not see him again; he said he should go and get a pot of beer over at the Red Lion public-house, and as he went out I looked out of the window, and saw him with the clock under his arm - that was at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110052"></xptr>one o'clock; I followed him, and took him in Whitechapel, with it under his arm - I asked him to go back with me; he refused, and began kicking and fighting, and I lodged him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not another person with me when you saw me with the cloak? A. Yes; I never saw that person with the cloak, but when I took it from you I gave it to a boy to carry it; the man who was with the prisoner snatched the cloak from the boy - we got it from him, but could not secure the man; that man did not interfere before that. The prisoenr had got to Whitechapel before I stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Union-terrace, Commercial-road. The prisoner was my shopman from September, 1836, till the 30th of May—it was his duty to enter goods in this book—he received money on my account, which he should account for when he came home—all the entries in this book are in his hand-writing—I have no entry at all of this 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—nor of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has entered the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mrs. Ross, but has not accounted to me for it—when I returned in the evening to settle his accounts, he was gone with all the money he had taken that day—there was no cause for his leaving that I knew of—I had left home about two o'clock—he knew I should be absent some time—he left the book behind—I did not see him again till he was apprehended, which was nearly two months afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at 31, Fore-street—on 17th November, between 5 and 6 in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop—he said he wanted some fancy rings for presents—he selected a lot of jewellery and fancy goods to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put the invoice before him, and asked him if he was going to pay for them—he said, "I should wish you to send them home"—I said, "I will do so," but I had my suspicions—I accompanied him myself—when we got to the corner of Cripplegate-buildings, in Fore-street, he said, "I want to make a little call; if you will go on to my house, I will meet you in about ten minutes"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Brown"—he told me his house was 21, Chiswell-street—I went there and inquired and gave a description of him—he did not come back there—I immediately hurried home and was told something—I then looked over a card of wedding-rings which had been shown to the prisoner in my absence, and I found on the card a gilt wedding-ring substituted for a gold one—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had shown some to him among the goods and jewellery selected—this card was shown to him—I am quite positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am shopwoman to the last witness—I remember the prisoner coming in on the 17th November—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—he was in the shop an hour, I should think—I was there the whole time—I saw him go out with Mr. Emberson—the prisoner returned, it might be five minutes afterwards, alone, and said he wished the wedding-ring changed as it was not large enough for the lady—I then showed him a card of wedding-rings—he tried on two—he returned me the ring—I thought it was one of those that had been on the card—he then went away—Mr. Emberson returned about ten minutes afterwards—the card was looked at and I then found this ring—it is a brass ring, gilt—the value of the gold ring is 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

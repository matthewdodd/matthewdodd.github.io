                  </hi>. I am a steam engine smith, in the employment of Messrs. Moseley, of Westminster Road. On 28th July last, I was at the corner of the Tower public house, at the corner of Tower Street, Westminster Road, and saw the prisoner—I had some conversation with her—I did not know her before—two of my children were there during the time—she said she had been a governess, but was out of a situation, and that she could teach my children in the way they ought to be brought up—she asked me if they could say their prayers and their hymns, if not, she could teach them—after a little time she called me out of the house, and asked me if I was known there, and said she was not in her own neighbourhood, and she was short of cash, would I be so kind as to get her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed—she pro<lb></lb>duced a roll of paper out of her pocket, and inside those, fifteen or sixteen pieces of paper—it was rolled up, and at last the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was produced, and I aid, "Is it a good one?"—she said, "Yes; or I would not ask you to change it"—I took it into Mr. Salisbury, the landlord, and he changed it for me, and I gave the change to the prisoner—I wrote my name on the back of the note; that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my name—we sat there, and had something to drink for some considerable time afterwards, when it was proposed for us</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Tower public house, in Westminster Road. I remember changing a note for the last witness on 28th July last—I wrote my name on it two days afterwards when I paid it away—this is the note—Gray wrote his name on it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 76). I took the prisoner into custody on 12th Oct., in Webber Street. I told her that I wanted her for passing a forged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, at the Tower public house—she said, "If I did, I did not know it was a bad one, as I had it from a gentleman"—she lives in Granby Street, Waterloo Road—that is about one of the worst streets in London, a regular den of brothels and thieves—a woman who was not a prostitute would not be likely to be seen there—there are but two decent women there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had known her as an unfortunate girl, had you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; some time—there are two or three respectable persons in Granby Street; there is the public house, and the greengrocer's shop.</p>

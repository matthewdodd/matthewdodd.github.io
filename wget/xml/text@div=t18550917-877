On Thursday, 6th Sept., about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock in the morning, my wife awoke, and directed my attention to a noise in the wall, which separates my house from Mr. Reeves's, as if persons were breaking in—I listened for a few minutes, and heard it myself, and then went into the dining room underneath, when I heard it more plainly—I then went into the parlour, and heard it more plainly—I then went into the street, listened at Mr. Reeves's shutters, and was quite convinced that men were at work—I spoke to a policeman, he rang the bell, and then I heard a noise, which I supposed was the dropping of their housebreaking instruments, and after that a tremen<lb></lb>dous crash, as of something falling, which turned out to be three or four feet of cooking stove—Mr. Reeves opened the door, I went in, and saw a large hole partly cut through the wall which divides his shop from mine—his is a milliner's shop, but the house was supposed to be empty, as the furniture had been removed—there might be a bedstead or two, as Mr. Reeves was living there—the shutters had been up for a day or two, and bills on them—I found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and a stock and bit, on the floor—the circle of the hole was large enough to admit a man's body, but it was not completely through.</p>

On Thursday morning, 6th Sept., I was aroused about 4 o'clock, by the breaking of glass—I opened my bed room window and saw a man, about two yards from me, just stepping off the tiles under my window—that is the roof of No. 6, Ryder's-court—it was nearly daylight—he was stepping on to the roof of the next outhouse—the tiles run in a line with Mr. Franklin's, and are behind Mr. Reeves's house, about thirty yards from Mr. Reeves's back premises, from which he appeared to be coming—he went down into Mr. Dillman's yard, which is next door to mine—I heard him fall, but can<lb></lb>not say whether he jumped or dropped—I then saw the prisoner Mansfield on his hands and knees, about a yard from the window, and he followed the other man, and went down into the same yard—I am certain he is the man—he was dressed the same as he is now.</p>

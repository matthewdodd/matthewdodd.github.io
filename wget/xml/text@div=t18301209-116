I have known the prisoner three months - he lodged in the same house with me; he has been in my room, and I have asked him to have a meal, or any thing out of friendship; I missed the articles stated - they have been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And I believe you have pawned things for him and he for you? A. That I deny - I never pawned a great coat of his; the landlord and landlady did not give me warning to quit, on account of the way I was going on - I had notice to quit, and then went to Market-street; the prisoner called there, but he was denied calling, over and over - I never pawned any thing for him at all, nor my wife, except one silk handkerchief, which he asked her to pawn for him and bring him in a bit of victuals; that was in the Edgware-road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever know of his pawning any of your husband's property? A. No - I have pawned things myself; he used to drink and smoke a pipe in our room - he has visited us in Market-street, and my husband was always glad to see him; I never forbid him the house, nor has my husband to my knowledge - I never pawned any thing for the prisoner; if he had asked me I would not have done it - I did pawn a silk handkerchief for him because I was foolish.</p>

I went out with my brother to watch Hall—he went on towards the Crown and Anchor—I then saw Palmer, and the other man—they approached together, and went on talking about 200 yards, then the other left them, and went into a baker's shop, and the two prisoners went on on the other side of the way—when the little one came out of the baker's shop, he went on eating a roll—he went on the same side as the baker's—he did not join the prisoners again—my brother sent me on to follow Hall and Palmer—I did so, and saw three policemen—I told them something, and they went in pursuit of the prisoners—when the policeman had been spoken to, I saw Palmer look round, and then run—Hall ran after him—they ran in the same direction, and as they ran I saw Hall hold up his hand, and throw something over Mr. Cormack's garden-wall—there is a little bend in the wall there, and it was close at the bend that he threw it.</p>

I met this witness, and in consequence of what he said, I and the policemen went in pursuit of the prisoners—while they were running I saw Palmer pass some-thing to Hall—it appeared to he something in a white paper—I then called, "Stop thief,"—a gentleman collared Hall, and I saw Hall hold up his hand, as if to throw something over the wall—I did not see any thing thrown—I pursued, and took the prisoners—I found on Hall three farthings and a tobacco-box.</p>

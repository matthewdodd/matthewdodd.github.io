                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I live at No. 21, Vine-street—I am a looking-glass maker—the prisoner was in my service. In conese<lb></lb>quence of information I went to some lodgings which I understood to be his, at No. 22, Portpool-lane—I found there ninety-nine unframed looking-glasses, some quicksilver in bottles, and some old quicksilver that had been scraped from old glasses—I believe them to be part of my property.</p>

I live in the house where the prisoner lodged with his wife—I saw those things found in the room he occupied—I had noticed some things in the cupboard, and took some steps to ascertain whether it was quick-silver in the bottle, and in consequence of my suspicions I gave information to the prosecutor, when he returned from Italy eight weeks ago.</p>

My wife came back before me. When I returned I examined the door and found that the staple was forced out and the work was gone. It consisted of three-quarters of mode silk. I had only this room, I had no concern with the rest of the house.</p>

               <p>Archer. This silk has the same mark and is of the same breadth as some which was left in the room, for the piece was cut. The value is nearly three pounds. The quantity now produced and that left in the room together make exactly the quantity of my silk, and correspond with that quantity which I had delivered out to Boston, my workman, to weave for me; and there is a white knot in it by which Boston knew it the moment he saw it; indeed he had before so described it.</p>
               <p>Boston. There is a mark upon it by which I can positively swear it is the silk worked by me. The mark is a white knot of silk tied to three threads. There is nobody in the trade that ever used that mark but myself.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner between seven and eight years. I never heard any harm of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at her house that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he at your house that evening? - He was at my house, from the hour of five till nine; he never was out of my house.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - On the 12th of January.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - For a particular reason, I took a memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that? - I had a carpenter did a little job for me and I set down the day, it was old New-year's day.</p>
               <p>Where is your house? - No. 1, Swedeland-court, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that from where Boston lives? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got that memorandum of the carpenter's about you? - The carpenter has it.</p>
               <p>Have you looked over it since? - I saw it in his book.</p>
               <p>Was it the 12th of January there? - Yes, it was Old New-year's-day. The prisoner lighted the carpenter while he was doing the job.</p>
               <p>Was the carpenter there more days than one? - Not at that little trifling job, but he was before that, the particular days I cannot remember, he had been there before.</p>
               <p>Why do you fix it for the 12th of January that the prisoner lighted the carpenter? - The man's work was finished that day, and he could put in no more till that was off the loom.</p>
               <p>Was he absent at all during that time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he was or not? - To my knowledge he was not; I was down below stairs, up and down; I never missed him or heard him open the door.</p>
               <p>Was you out of the room where he was? - Not half an hour together.</p>
               <p>Archer. I would have you be so kind to understand, and the jury, I never saw the man; and were they to bring him in guilty, I would strive to the utmost of my power not to have him executed. This woman should be cautious, to say she never heard any thing amiss of him! Only please to ask her whether he was not sent from the justice's on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Was he sent from the justice's on board a ship? - He never wronged me; he was sent as a pressed man.</p>
               <p>The question is, what is his character in general? - As an impressed man he was sent from justice Wilmot's office for a soldier.</p>
               <p>But has he a good character? - To my own knowledge he has.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you any other partner? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did he live from the prosecutor? - On the other side of the water. On the 31st of July I was in company with Cook, and searched his house, and found the anchor.</p>
               <p>Court to Hodges. Where is this anchor kept? - On the open Wharf. On high tide any body might come on my Wharf, from the river, and take it.</p>
               <p>Riley. I searched the prisoner's warehouse, and we found the anchor, on the 31st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it concealed or open? - It was laid in the warehouse, with a quantity of oakum over it.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know whether the prisoner ever deals in these things? - There were some tons of new and old rope in the warehouse, but I saw no more than this one anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the stock? - In the room of wood it is iron fixed at one end of the anchors; he said he had changed it with some captain of a ship, in room of another; he mentioned the name, but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110121"></xptr>really forget the name at present; this was the 21st of July.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner then is a person who deals in ship stores? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. And this is a kind of a thing as ship store, and here you found it in his house twenty three days after it was lost? - Exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

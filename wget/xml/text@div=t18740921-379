I am a licensed victualler of 4, Redgate Court, Minories—on 18th August between 2 and 3 p.m. I served the prisoner with worth of gin—he put down a shilling—I gave him the change, and two or three minutes after he left I took the shilling out of the till and found it was bad—there was no other shilling there—the prisoner came again the next day for 1/2 oz. of tobacco, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he also asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin—I saw that he was the same person who was there the day before—he gave me a bad shilling—I caught hold of him, and said "You were here yesterday and paid me a bad shilling"—he said "No, I never was in your place at all"—I marked the shillings and gave them to the constable—he was dressed the first day as he is now, but he had a white apron on, and on the second occasion, though he did not show it, the prosecutor found a white apron on him.</p>

I am manager of the Clerkenwell Tavern—on 8th August the prisoner came in, and the lad served him—he tendered a shilling—the boy tried it between his teeth, and said "I am afraid this is a bad shilling"—I went to the prisoner and said "Do you know that this is bad?"—he threw down a good shilling, and received 101<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back—as I went round the bar he snatched up his change and ran out, and met a man—something passed between them, and he then went up Wood Street—I went to meet him at the other end and met a constable, to whom I pointed the prisoner out, and he was then taken to Clerkenwell Police Court, remanded, and discharged, as the Mint authorities said that it was his first offence.</p>

I dispatched the goods on 31st July, with this invoice (<hi rend="italic">for Ml.</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—on August 3rd I received a letter from Stern acknowledging the receipt of the goods, and asking if I had another microscope on hand; I replied to that, and received a letter ordering a polariscope—Stern afterwards called on me, and said that he had received the sample order, that he had received the instruments, and had had two American buyers with him, and he thought he could do a good business with them—I showed him some samples, and he chose them and said that he wanted them for shipment—I wrote this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his presence, and the goods were dispatched on 9th August to 26, Finsbury Place North—they came to 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and all the other goods were sent to that address by rail—the microscopes were sent on</p>

I put them in hand, but before sending them wrote to the reference which he had given, and received this reply: "Memorandum from Jado and Levy, 4, Catherine Court, Tower Hill. D.

I dispatched the goods on 28th September, value 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and about 1st October sent in a statement of account, and afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the account and requested hills to be sent for acceptance at two months' date</hi>.) I then forwarded two bills and received them back accepted, payable at the Continental Bank—the first bill fell due on November 6; it was presented through our bankers, and returned to us marked "No account"—the other bill is not due yet—after I received those acceptances I received this further order (<hi rend="italic">For three microscopes</hi>)—I did not send them, and Stern called on the 12th, and asked if the package had been made up for Birmingham—I said that I should like to have the money before giving a further order—he said "Mr. Stern will very likely let you have cash if you write, and I will write too"—I wrote and got this reply (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the same hand as the other letters—it says "We decline to send cheque instead of acceptance, and beg to say you will please cancel our order"—I did cancel it, and saw no more of Stern till I saw him in custody—I have been taken to a number of pawnbrokers, and identified a number of the instruments I sent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Woodland Road, New Southgate, and am a clerk to Carter and Son, ivory merchants, of Fleur de Lis Street, Norton Folgate—a man named Oberdorfer called in September with an order for ivory combs for the firm of Jado, Levy, and Co.—he gave a reference in writing to Messrs. Mezler and Co., of 4, Bow Lane, Cheapside—I have not got the order—I called there and saw a young man who said that the firm was respectable—the combs were supplied on the 21st September to the value of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and were delivered at 4, Catherine Court, Tower Hill, the terms being payment in a month—on 25th September I received this order dated 24th September, it was addressed to the firm, and is for combs to the value of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we delivered the goods to Messrs. Jado and Levy, at 4, Catherine Court—on 2nd October two persons called, one of whom was Oberdorfer, and I showed them samples of ivory combs similar to what they had bought previously—they said they had come from, and in fact I knew that they came from Jado and Levy—they said they wanted the combs to ship to South America, that they had an order for 248 dozen, but they could not decide as the terms wore not liberal enough—they went away undecided, and next morning we received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed Jado and Levy, ordering</hi> 248 <hi rend="italic">dozen combs marked with the "Elephant" stamp, and urged a little extra allowance, as their profit was very small, to be delivered not later than the following Thursday</hi>.) The "Elephant" stamp is a distinctive die of the figure of an elephant, which we use for the South American trade—this is the receipt for them signed "Jado and Levy"—their value is 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>—the goods were all supplied—before we completed this last lot we wrote a tatter at 12 or 1 o'clock in the day intimating to Jado and Levy that we should require cash payment on delivery of the goods—on the following Monday, 10th October, I think, I called on them for payment, and found they were not there; a boy in the office said that Mr. Levy was not in, and had not been in—I said "Is there any chance of his being in?"—he said he did not know anything about it—I went there twice afterwards with the same result, and I never saw them again until I went to the police-court—I have never been paid for the goods—I did not see our goods at their office—Levy came down <hi rend="italic">the same</hi> day of writing the letter, and asked for immediate delivery of the goods—he said "I will pay you a cheque for the whole account on Wednesday, the 10th, we want the goods directly down for shipment, as we want to send them off at once"—I have seen the combs Sergeant Lythel has produced, and identify them as some of ours—we, of course, believed they were intended for the South American market, and that the prisoners were carrying on a genuine business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Cornet, manufacturer of shirt-fronts and collars—on or about 3rd or 4th September we received this printed memorandum: "Jado and Levy to Cornet and Co. Please call on us with samples of collars and oblige, yours truly, Jado and Levy." I called at 4, Catherine Court, with samples of collars and cuffs, and saw Mr. Levy—I showed him collars at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen—he de<lb></lb>murred at the price, and offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said they were very cheap, and I could not sell them under—he said he had a buyer from Germany, and if I left the samples he would speak to his buyer and see what he could do—I left the samples, and shortly afterwards wo received this written order for thirty dozen collars, dated 10th September, on the same headed paper—the collars were all assorted sizes, and we had to make them—it took two or three weeks to do so, and in the interim he came to our office and inquired if we could do a lot of job fronts—I said that we had a lot in stock, but they were not "job," because they were saleable, but if he liked to introduce trade in Germany we would give him the usual terms, and if he liked to pay cash he would have 5 per cent., or 2 1/2 per cent, or one month's credit—I went there afterwards with the samples and saw Mr. Levy and Mr. Oberdorfer—he showed the samples to Oberdorfer and gave him a memorandum of the prices, and he added a slight addition in German—I understand German—when I was going out he followed me and said "Will you come and have a glass of ale?"—I said "Yes," and he said "That gentleman there (Oberdorfer) is my buyer from Germany; it is a good tiling to have a house here, for I get a little thing out of it, but you must not tell him about the fronts I buy, that is my affair; you give me a price and I shall get an order"—I then left him—shortly after<lb></lb>wards he called at our office and saw Mr. Cornet and produced this order for 185 dozen insertion fronts in assorted sizes—the goods were delivered—there are three references on the back of the order, viz., Mezler, E. Stern and Co., and Edwards, of 26, Finsbury Place—I went to the references</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100027"></xptr>
               <p>before I sent the goods—they were to be paid for by cash, but when I called for a cheque Mr. Levy said he wanted two days, and so I ordered the goods back again—he said they must be there by 4 o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon for shipment, and that he gave me references, and I ought to have inquired—I said the references had nothing to do with that, as it was a cash transaction, but on a future occasion I might make use of them—he said "I shall pay for those goods after they have been checked by my packer; I must have two days until my packer returns the invoice"—I went back to my principal and he advised me to call on the references—I first went to Edwards, and the report I had there was that they knew Mr. Levy to be agent for three several first-class German houses; that he was certainly a respectable man, but they had had no business transactions with him—I asked Mr. Edwards whether he would trust him for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "For such a sum as that I should not hesitate at all; I believe <hi rend="italic">Levy</hi> to be thoroughly respectable"—I then went to Messrs. Stern and Co., 26, Finsbury Place, and found the door closed, with a placard on it, "Return shortly"—from there I went to Mezler and Co., 4, Bow Lane, and inquired for the principal, who, I was informed, was out, and would return at 2 o'clock—I then returned to our office and saw Mr. Cornet, who, on the recommendation of Messrs. Edwards, gave me instructions to deliver the goods at Catherine Court—I went with them, accompanied by a porter—I saw Levy and Oberdorfer, who counted the packages and made 104, and Levy counted them and finally made 94—Levy signed this receipt for them—I did not go to Stern again before I delivered them—I went to Stern's the next morning about 11 o'clock and saw him—I recognise the prisoner Stern as the same person—he then wore a bushy beard; I have no doubt as to him—I presented him with a note written the day pre<lb></lb>viously by Mr. Cornet, and he said "I have had money transactions for about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Messrs. Jado and Levy, and I think them perfectly safe"—I asked him whether I could safely trust them for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I should not mind trusting them myself for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I thanked him and left—on the Wednesday Mr. Levy came to our office and said that his customer had objected to two numbers of insertion fronts, because he thought them too dear—the value would be about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he asked us if we would take them back—he said he was too much of a business man to force us to do so, but if we would take them back it would be of great service to him, otherwise he must bear the loss—he asked us if we could find a market in France, and we said it was quite possible—he said "There is a bill coming due for 240/., but I find three days' grace is given in England, which will make it Saturday; I should like you to delay your pay-day till Saturday next, when a cheque will be ready for the whole amount"—after some delay we consented—I called on Saturday at 12—Mr. Levy was out and I waited till he returned—I saw him and he said he had been to the bank to inquire whether the bill was met, and he thought it would be illegal to give a cheque not knowing whether the cheque was honoured, so he told me to call on Monday at 10, when a cheque would be given without asking for it—I did so and found a placard on the door, "Will return after 11"—I called again at 11 o'clock, and saw a man there waiting for Mr. Levy—he asked me if I had come for some money, because Mr. Levy had left instructions with him to say he had gone to the West End to collect some money, and he would be back at 4—I went at 4 and waited till 5, but Mr. Levy did not return—I called on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100028"></xptr>
               <p>Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock and shortly afterwards Mr. Levy arrived—I said "I have called for the cheque I was to have without asking for it—he said "Those goods you sent me were not worth half the price and shan't pay for them; I shall see Mr. Cornet this morning at 12 and he must take them back"—I said it was useless to call at our place, for we should not hear of any such proposition, and I didn't like his shuffling ways, and should place the matter in other hands—that occurred in his own office the last time he was there—all the goods had been remove from there with the exception of one dozen collars—Mr. Levy did not calm at our office at 12, and we have not seen him since—I went there on "Wednesday and saw bills presented and many people inquiring for Mr. Levy—the office was not closed until about Friday, when I called at about 11—we have not been paid a penny for our goods—we believed they were <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> merchants, and that the goods were intended for the German, market—on a Sunday night in October, in consequence of a telegram from Sergeant Lythel, I went to Leicester, and at the police station I was shown 45 dozen of our shirt-fronts—identify these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) as a portion of those we supplied on 1st October.</p>

A dozen all round, for which I paid him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were nine distinct varieties—I believe they all had the elephant mark, but I did not look at all—he gave me a receipt for the money—I afterwards saw Sandman at the Leicester police-station—I asked him where he got the combs—he said he bought them of a party named Levy, of Houndsditch, I under<lb></lb>stood</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister—I got an assignment* from the licensees of the publishers of some steel plates of Sir Edwin Land-seer's of the right to use the plates for the purpose of lithographing a transfer as taken from the steel plates—at the time I acquired that right there were 7,000 copies of a particular picture on hand, and I took the whole stock with the copyright—the old stock was quite unfitted for my purpose, and I took steps to get rid of it, and saw a man named Spannier with reference to them—I shortly afterwards received a visit from a man named Rock, who stated that he had formerly belonged to Christchurch, Oxford; had been a student at one of the Inns of Court; that he was a brother of a Shropshire clergyman; that he had a large acquaintance-amongst shipping agents in London, and if I paid him a commission he—would place this old stock amongst the shippers, and would be able to take the whole stock of engravings for export to the colonies. He called a second time and said that he had known some shippers of Finsbury Place, E. Stern and Co., for some time, and would give them an introduc<lb></lb>tion to me, and they should call upon, me and take a quantity of my goods—I said that I did not wish them published in England, and should like them if possible to be exported to the colonies, because the issue of the old stock in this country would interfere with the improved issue, and that Messrs. Stern and Co. would want them for the Cape of Good Hope—afterwards I received a visit from Stern, who brought me this letter from Rock: "4, Grove Place, Acton, W., September 28th. Dear Sir—T bearer, Mr. D. Stern, of Stern and Co., may be able to buy a quantity of your pictures, and I trust the introduction may lead to business.—Yours truly,—Rock." Stern brought with him two men, one of whom I subsequently saw in his office, who I believe was his clerk; the other I believe to be Oberdorfer—Stern said "I am a shipping agent," and he gave me to understand that he did a considerable business with Germany and the colonies, especially the Cape of Good Hope—he said, referring to the man I believe to be Oberdorfer, "This is a merchant from the Cape of Good Hope; he has a considerable business there in engravings and lithographs, and I think he will be able to take a vast number of these engravings"—the engravings were there, and samples of a large number of copyrights which had been offered to me—he took a sample of "The Challenge "and marked in the corner of it the date and his initials, and samples of other pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer—they were copyrights which had been brought me, and I had not finally decided whether I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100030"></xptr>
               <p>would accept them—he marked them all—I said that I was not at all anxious as to the new copyrights, but the old stock, "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary," I was anxious to get rid of—he said none the less he should like to take the samples—he and Oberdorfer made a number of remarks about the pictures; some they thought particularly suited to the Cape market, especially "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary" after Stern had marked the samples he asked me the terms on which I would sell the engravings—I had previously told him the price of the old stock—viz., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each.—the proper price in this country would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—that is what the original plates sold at—he said "We do a large business with Berlin, I suppose you will be satisfied if we give you a bill on some firm in Berlin"—I said "I know nothing about bills and business matters, the only thing I can understand is cash"—he said "I will consider the matter and write you further"—afterwards I got this letter, dated October 1st, 1877: "Dear Sir—Please forward 2,000 engravings of The Sanctuary,' and 2,000 engravings, 'The Challenge' at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 5 per cent, cash, payable on 15th insr., and oblige, dear Sir, yours respectfully, D. Stern and Co. References—Messrs. Mezler and Co., 4, Bow Lane; Jado and Levy, 4, Catherine Court, Seething Lane, E. C." I first called at Messrs. Mezler, who occupy the ground floor in Bow Lane—the premises seemed to be stocked with valuable lithographs—I saw a clerk, who said that it was very difficult to find Mr. Mezler in, as he had so many engagements—I left my card and said "Will you tell Mr. Mezler to write to me to this address and give me information as to D. Stern and Co., who have referred me to him <hi rend="italic">?"</hi>—he said he would give the card and ask for the information—I called a second time—some other persons were in the shop, one of whom I believe was Mezler—the clerk said "I gave the card to Mr. Mezler, and he said he would attend to it"—I said "Is Mr. Mezler here now?"—he said "No, he is not here"—I said "Mr. Mezler has not written to me, I will leave 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for stamps for Mr. Mezler to write"—I thought perhaps he had not written, from motives of economy—he said he would give the stamps to Mr. Mezler and ask him to write—I then said to the clerk "Stern says he has had dealings with your firm, is that the case?"—he said "Yes"—I said "He is rather pressing about this order, and do you think I can safely execute it?"—he said "I should say so, we have had considerable dealings with him"—Mr. Mezler did not reply to my letter—I called at Jado and Levy's place, 4, Catherine Court, Seething Lane, and saw a clerk—I showed him the order, and said that I had been referred to their firm, and that I wished to see Mr. Levy or Mr. Jado in reference to it—he said neither of them was in, but that if I left the name and the amount of the order he would mention the matter to Jado and Levy, and they would write to me—he asked me the exact amount of the order—he said it was important he should know that—I said "Does it make any difference whether it is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "Yes, because they might be good for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so you had better be very exact in mentioning the exact amount"—I subsequently received this letter: "4, Catherine Court, Tower Hill, London, E.C., October 3, 1877. To Mr. Shackle<lb></lb>ton Hallett. Dear Sir—Messrs. D. Stern and Co., of 26, Finsbury Place, we know as respectable and trustworthy, and consider them safe for the amount named. Yours truly, Jado and Levy." After receiving that, Rock called, and I mentioned to him that I had received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100031"></xptr>
               <p>no reply from Mezler, but that I had received a satisfactory reply from Jado and Levy—he said "Mezler and Co. are, doubtless, jealous of Stern and Co., because Stern and Co. are a young firm in the same business as Mezler and Co.; they touch lithographs and Mezler and Co. deal also in lithographs, and they are doubtless anxious that you should do business with them"—I said "That may be so," and that I would consider the matter further—I subsequently received this letter: "D. Stern and Co., 26, Finsbury Place North, London, E.C. October 5, 1877. Mr. Shackleton Hallett. Dear Sir,—Please inform us by return when our order will be executed, as we are waiting for the pictures to pack with others for shipping, and oblige, yours respectfully, D. Stern and Co". There is also a receipt on this by Mr. Rock, which was written some little time afterwards—in consequence of this letter I called at Finsbury Place North, and saw Stern, who was seated at a centre table, near the window—there was a clerk, whom I now believe to be Roberts, who was counting some lithographs or chromo-lithographs—I said to Stern "I have called with reference to this order of yours; I told you that I car only understand a sale for cash"—he said "Yes, but my order is a cash order; you are not acquainted with these matters; if you were, you would know that houses doing a large business are in the habit of making payments on certain fixed days in every month, and on those days only. Our pay day is on the 15th, and a payment on that day is what we call prompt"—I said "Well, that may possibly be so; a fortnight may not make much difference"—I said again to him "Where are these goods going to?" he said "They will be shipped at once to the Cape of Good Hope, and there is a vessel waiting in the docks, and I am, therefore, anxious for their immediate delivery"—I said "I have had a satisfactory reference from Jado and Levy, but Mezler and Co. have not given me any written answer to my inquiries; the clerk there says that you have done business with them. Mr. Rock says the reason why Mezler has not answered, possibly, may be jealousy of you, as you both deal in litho<lb></lb>graphs and," I said, pointing to the clerk at the window, who was counting the lithographs, "I see you deal in these things"—he said "Yes," and he produced a number of receipted bills from Mezler, showing payments made by himself to Mezler to a considerable amount—this seemed to confirm his statement, and I said "You shall have the goods; I have been engaged in purchasing the copyrights, and have at present taken no warehouse. I have not commenced any business; they are on the premises of the vendors to myself, in Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, waiting my order. If you send there to-morrow I will have them delivered to you." On October 8th I attended at Serle Street, and I found outside the door of the warehouse the prisoner Sandman in a light spring cart, and another man, J. Roberts, whom I had previously seen in Stern's place of business, counting the lithographs—Sandman at that time had light whiskers under his chin—lie subsequently dyed them with some lead dye—it was something that changed the colour, and it was obviously by artificial means—he was dressed as a countryman—they were waiting at the door, and I said "I suppose you are Mr. Stern's carman?"—Sandman said "Yes, sir"—I said to Roberts "One of you will have to come in and take these engravings out of the warehouse"—Roberts came into the warehouse and delivered to me this order.

               <p>Mr. Hallett. Dear Sir,—Please deliver to bearer 4,000 pictures, and oblige, yours truly, D. Stern and Co.") I then delivered to him 2,000 copies of "The Sanctuary," and 2,000 copies of "The Challenge"—they were packed in 16 brown-paper parcels of 250 each, as they came from the printer's—I produce this receipt written on my ordinary paper. (<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for the engravings, and was signed by J. Roberts</hi>.) As they were leaving, I said to Roberts, in the presence of Sandman, "I suppose you will take these to Mr. Stern's office?"—he laughed, and said "No, they must be packed at the office before they can be sent to the ship"—I do not remember his mentioning the name of the packers—they then left—subsequently I received a second order. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "D. Stern and Co. 26, Finsbury Place North, London, E.C. October 10, 1877. Mr. Hallett. Dear Sir,—We have sold to a customer of ours 500 copies of 'The Sanctuary,' and 500 copies of 'The Challenge,' at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less 5 per cent, for cash, to be delivered at once. Please inform us at once whether you have these pictures in stock, and when you can deliver them. Your early attention will oblige yours truly, D. Stern and Co. P.S. This order to be paid with first amount, on the 10th instant.") I called at Stern's office—I had in contemplation at the time the purchase of the copyrights of "The Huguenots" and "Black Brunswicker," and I said to Stern "I am thinking of taking these plates, and also other plates of Landseer's stock, but I am not quite decided about the purchase of them. Do you think there would be a market for these at the Cape of Good Hope?"—he entered into a discussion on the relative merits of the pictures, and he advised me to purchase one of them—he then said that he would be calling himself the next day for the other copies of "The Sanctuary" and "The Challenge"—I said "Where will they go?"—he said "They also are going to the Cape of Good Hope"—on the morning of October 11th, I saw him outside the warehouse, in Serle Street, by himself—he then had whiskers, which have been shaved off, I may say—his appearance was very different then—he appeared a much more respectable person—he was well dressed, clean shirt and collar; in fact, he appeared like a very respectable person indeed—he received 500 copies of "The Challenge" and 500 of "The Sanctuary"—I think there was some difficulty as to the packages—they were not all the same number, so he asked for 50 more copies of each—they received 550 copies of each—the receipt had been made out for 500 each, and the "50" has been added, and Stern then initialled this alteration. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Received from Mr. Shackleton Hallett 550 copies of 'The Sanctuary' and 550 copies of 'The Challenge,' at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per copy, less 5 per cent, for cash.") Stern said there was a cab to take them to the shipper's, and I then left him at the place—on the 15th instant I called at the office of Stern—the house<lb></lb>keeper was standing outside, and Stern was not there—a number of people were calling, asking for their money or their goods, neither of which could be found—I have seen a considerable number of prints which were found at Leicester, and recognised them as some of those I sold to Stern—they bear the marks which Stern put on them—I have also had shown to me samples of "The Sanctuary" and "The Challenge" taken from a large case at King's Cross, which I recognise as portions of the packages of 250 each, delivered on the 8th October to Sandman—I believed that Stern was carrying on a genuine business as a shipping agent, and that those goods were to be consigned to the merchants at the Cape of Good Hope, or I should not have parted with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. Mr. Spannier was the chief agent in bringing Stern and myself together, and he introduced Rock—he had the chief commission on the sale of the pictures, and Rock a second com<lb></lb>mission—Spannier is a German Jew—an old <hi rend="italic">employee</hi> of mine recommended. me to him—he is not my clerk—if he described himself as" clerk to Mr. Shackleton Hallett, of No. 1, Hare Court, Temple," that would be untrue—he explained that at the Mansion House—Rock's statements had not much influence with me—I saw a letter from a clergyman in Shropshire which led me not to pay much attention to his statements—I had con<lb></lb>fidence in neither—I relied on my intention to receive only cash, and, secondly, on references—I was to a certain extent induced to part with my goods by the statements made by Rock, because they were confirmed by the statements made by Stern—I made up my mind to part with them when Stern showed me the receipts on the 7th October—Roberts did not call on me at the Temple—Spannier was not with me the day the goods were delivered—he used to come in frequently, and on one occasion Stern was there when he came—Spannier may have been there the day the goods were delivered—Roberts came, I think, on the first occasion with Stern—an appointment was made to meet for the purpose of giving up the goods—my impression is that must have been late in the day—it was made at Stern's office, and the goods were to be taken from Serle Street, where I was to meet Roberts—I have no recollection of any con<lb></lb>versation with them at my chambers that day—that receipt was signed by Roberts in Serle Street, in the house—Roberts went in by himself, and Sandman remained in the cart, which was the only time I had seen Sandman—I had come from one of the courts in Lincoln's Inn—the door of the place was not open at first, and people were waiting for it to open—Roberts seemed to have the appearance of a respectable clerk—I knew I had seen him at Stern's or at my chambers—I did not hear Spannier examined at the Mansion House—Spannier is no longer in my service—he was called for the prosecution—if he says that Sandman called at Hare Court on the 8th October it is not true, nor that Sandman signed that paper and gave the receipt in the name of Roberts—Sandman's dye on his beard is fading from the ends now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Stern.</hi> I think you called with your clerk and Oberdorfer—I know the latter from his description—he was a dark<lb></lb>haired young-looking man—it was when you showed me the receipts that I made up my mind to let you have the pictures—I called for the purpose of putting some questions to you—you were very anxious for me to take bills, and I said "I cannot take bills"—then your letter came saying you would pay cash on the 15th—I did not say I would take bills or cash—I have no recollection of meeting Roberts at Hare Court except in your company—I saw the carman (Sandman) and Roberts at Serle Street—Sandman helped put the goods in the cart—you said you wanted the second lot of 1,000 pictures for the Cape of Good Hope—I think I met you in Serle Street at three o'clock p.m.—there was a difference in one package, and I think it made 1,100—when I called at your office on the 15th the landlady told me that a number of persons had been calling for their money—she would not let me into the house—she said there were so many persons coming down that it blocked the doorway—if Spannier</p>

I am a commission-agent, and live at 4, New North Street, Bloomsbury Square—I know Rock as much as Mr. Hallett knows him, through another man who sent him to me in connection with buying some pictures I had to sell for Mr. Hallett—I forget his name, it was in Long Acre—I was engaged by Mr. Hallett to sell the pictures on commission—after they had been obtained I went down to Leicester with Sergeant Lythel, and on the 28th October I went to Sandman's premises, 29, New Bond Street—we had taken lodgings opposite the house first of all—we went to Sandman's warehouse on Sunday, the 28th October, and I was present when search was made, and when 250 of the lithographs "The Challenge" were found there—subsequently another 700 were found upstairs—Sandman said in Lythel's presence something about buying them of Stern, and said he paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them, or something of that, and I said it was not half the amount they were sold for, and a great many things were said that I cannot call to mind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Stern.</hi> I said at the Mansion House that I saw you three or four times—I saw you twice at your own office—I asked to see Mr. Stern and you were pointed out to me—I did not go up to you or speak to you—on one occasion I opened the door and asked if Mr. Stern was in and was told "No" by a rather dark person with a moustache—at Mr. Hallett's chambers I understood from the boy in the hall that you were in Mr. Hallett's large room, and you were the person I wanted to see, and I took particular care to know all that went on, and I told Mr. Hallett not to let the pictures go, but he did, much against my wish—I</p>

               <p>knew you were a lot of swindlers—I begged of him to let me get them back for him, and I traced them myself—Mr. Hallett and I made inquiries about you at Judo and Levy's, and I told Mr. Hallett he would not get his money—they wrote a reply—I was to have 2 1/2 per cent, on the sale of the pictures—when I went down to Leicester I represented myself as manag<lb></lb>ing the sale of the pictures—I represented my master as being one of the prosecutors—it is not true that I said I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and settle it.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100036"></xptr>
               <p>the Leicester officer then read the warrant to him, and explained the meaning of it—we then proceeded to search—in the shop I found a paper parcel containing lithographic prints, which I afterwards counted, and found it contained 250 prints exactly similar to those produced of "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary"—we then proceeded to the first floor front room, and on the table in the room I found a large quantity more of the prints, which I afterwards counted, and there were about 700 of them, making together about 950—I then said to Sandman "These are part of a lot of goods which have been obtained by fraud, and they have been identified by this person," meaning Spannier—he said "I am a general dealer, and bought them in the ordinary way of my trade"—I said "Then you can tell me from whom you bought them, and I have no doubt you have some receipts"—he said he bought them of a man named Stern in the City Road, London—I may say that Finsbury Place is a con<lb></lb>tinuation of the City Road—he said he never kept any receipts—I then saw a parcel in the back parlour which I took up, and asked him what it contained—he made no answer, and I proceeded to open it, and I found it contained a quantity of shirt-fronts, 45 dozen, as I afterwards counted—I said to the prisoner "I have no doubt this is part of a lot of goods that have been obtained by fraud, I shall take possession of them"—we then conveyed him and the goods to the Leicester police-station—I think I said the goods had been obtained by Jado and Levy—I did not then say from whom they had been obtained—he was examined before the bench of Magistrates on Monday, and remanded till Wednesday, and in the meantime I obtained a warrant from the Mansion House for his removal to London—while at Leicester, on the 29th, I called on Mr. Carnall, of the Haymarket, Leicester, and had a conversation with him, the result of which was that he gave me up nine gross of ivory combs—he previously went to the Leicester police-station, and saw the prisoner, and said he was the person he bought them of, and the prisoner said he bought them of Jado and Levy, of London—I said to the prisoner "I have heard what this gentleman says—I shall get the combs from him, and no doubt they are part of a lot of goods obtained from a house in London"—he made no answer, and I removed him to London on Wed<lb></lb>nesday—the prints have been identified by Mr. Hallett as well as Spannier, and the shirt-fronts by Schweizer, Mr. Cornet's clerk, and the combs by Mr. Smith, of Carter and Co., as part of the goods they had sold to Jado and Levy, and to Stern in the case of the prints—on the evening of the 8th November from information I received I went to Pres<lb></lb>ton, and got information respecting the movements of Levy and Stern, and in consequence of that I wont on to Glasgow, where I arrived on Monday morning, the 12th—I went to Steele's Hotel, Queen Street, but was unfortunately too late for the men—when coining out of the hotel I saw a railway van drive up—I had knowledge of a case being on its road to the north, which I heard of at Russell's, of Preston, and also what it contained—the case was marked D. S., 97 or 98—after it was delivered I took possession of it—it weighed 8 cwt.—on opening it I found it full of lithographic prints of "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary"—the address on the case was "E. Smith," or "A. Smith, Steele's Hotel, Queen Street, Glasgow"—I returned to London on the 16th, and went to Edin<lb></lb>burgh on the 23rd at about 12.30—on Saturday the 24th November I saw Stern in Princes Street—I was in company with an officer, and I said to the</p>

               <p>we lived with a friend in Birmingham—before that we were at New<lb></lb>castle—my father trades in different things—at Newcastle ho dealt in pianos—I don't recollect where he was in 1869 or 1870—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber Redcar—I know Middlesboro'—we lived there—I don't know that he has ever gone under any other name—I don't know whose writing this is—the name is Simmonds—I don't think this paper is in the same hand<lb></lb>writing—I don't know that it is my father's—all I know of his hand<lb></lb>writing is his name, and our address, which I taught him—the acceptances on these three bills are in my father's handwriting—I don't know whose the fourth is—I have no idea what we left Middlesboro for, ask my father—I am not sure that people came to him for money for goods supplied—there was something at Middlesboro or Newcastle about an offer of composition, as ho had lost some money through not getting paid for some goods—people might have come and inquired after him—we left Middlesboro about seven or eight years ago—perhaps we remained at Newcastle for four or five years—I expect father sold the pianos at New<lb></lb>castle—we had a store-room—it was a large store-room at Leicester—I recollect some pianos coming from Brinsmead—my father would not allow me to keep books, as ho said he could not read English, and it was un<lb></lb>necessary—I think the words on that document, "National Provincial Bank of England, London," are in the handwriting of a brother of mine—it is signed by my father—I do not recollect this bill coming—I had nothing to do with them—I don't know how soon after receiving the pianos we left Newcastle—I think this signature across this bill, dated 1870, addressed to Sandman, general dealer, Stockton-on-Tees, is mine, and not my father's—we never lived at Stockton—it looks too much like a gentleman's writing for mine—I cannot swear to it—my father's step<lb></lb>brother, named Sandman, lives at Bowden Street, near Newcastle-on-Type—the signature on the bill addressed Newcastle-on-Tyne does look like my father's writing—he lived at Ashfield Terrace, Newcastle—I don't think it is my father's writing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Grain stated that a number of other cases had come to the know<lb></lb>ledge of Serjeant Lythel, and that no doubt Sandman had been pursuing a course of fraud, at all events since 1869.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Lythel stated that since he had had the matter in hand he had received a largo number of letters from different parts of London and the country complaining of the writers having been defrauded not only by the prisoners, but other people acting in concert with Jado and Levy.</p>

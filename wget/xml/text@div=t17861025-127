               <p>Court. That is not the present question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How soon after did you see Flint? - Flint served me with bread and water, and nobody else; and one day, when he brought it, he called me into the hemp-shop, where the bad people pick hemp; they had done work; it was their dinner time; I cannot tell the day; I believe it was the middle of the week; and he pushed me down between the bulks, and put his hand before my mouth because I should not halloo; and when he had done what he wanted, he threatened to flog me if I told the Governor or any body.</p>
               <p>Court. But what did he do child? - He put his private parts into my body; I was afraid, and did not tell any body; I continued there a fortnight after; but he never let me out after, only to wash the cell; I saw nobody else; my master came about two days after; I told him, I was well, because I was afraid of being licked; Flint staid with him all the time; when I came out of Bridewell, my master put me to his journey woman, Mrs. Stunnell, in King-street, Golden-square; I did not tell her the first day, but she saw my shift, and took me to task.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular on your shift? - Yes; I had clean linen only once while I was in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Had you any clean linen from the time that Flint used you so? - No, Sir; she took me to task about it, because I was restless, and I only told her of the Captain, because I was ashamed to tell of two men; but I told my mistress of Flint one day; I really think it was my mistress; it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250222"></xptr> month after I came to Mrs. Stunnell, and I went home to my mistress's; I told her in about a fortnight after I went home; she asked me, whether any body had lain with me besides the Captain; then I told her about Flint.</p>
               <p>Had nobody else lain with you? - No, Sir, indeed.</p>
               <p>How near was this hemp room to the place where the people were? - It is a good way off; there was nobody else in the room but me and Flint.</p>
               <p>Was there any body within hearing? - I do not know; Flint never staid with me at any other time; I saw the apprentice boys out; I never saw the Governor where I was; no woman came to me; the Matron never came to me but once, then she gave me a bit of bread and meat.</p>
               <p>Did Flint take any pains to persuade you? - No, Sir, never a word; I struggled, but I could not have the power to move or draw my breath; he was down with me about five minutes; I told him of what the Captain had done to me; it was three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Prisoner's Counsel. Was not you committed as a loose, idle, disorderly person? - I do not know I was more idle than the rest; I had ran away three times.</p>
               <p>Where did you go on Whitsun Tuesday? - I went into the Park by myself; I walked about the streets all night without victuals or lodging; I have been twice in Bridewell for running away.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this story to any body till you was again carried to the Justice? - I told it to my mistress a fortnight before; my master came to Bridewell to bring me clean linen; I changed it and carried out my soul shift to my mistress; she looked at it, and put it in a great tub of water; it was all stained.</p>
               <p>Was it bloody? - I do not know whether it was blood; it was white stuff.</p>
               <p>Was that the shift you had on when the Captain lay with you? - It was, and when Flint lay with me; I swear positively, that no man ever lay with me before the Captain.</p>
               <p>Did not you change your things before you went to Stunnell? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any disorder on you? - I was not quite well; I always had such a pain.</p>
               <p>Had you no complaint, no running of any sort? - Yes, Sir, I had indeed; I told Mrs. Stunnel that the Captain had lain with me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never lay with any body in the necessary in the Bridewell? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know an apprentice named

            , or Hastings? - Yes, I remember Hastings; I had no talk with them, only they might say, how do you do Polly.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell these boys that you would behave well for one day to get your clothes, and then you would go upon the town? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell Richards, that Houghton had laid with you? - No.</p>
               <p>If you had called out and made a noise, might not the boys have heard you? - Yes, Sir, they might, but he put his hands before my mouth, that I could not call out.</p>
               <p>When he had done what he pleased, what become of you? - He locked me up in my call; it was not my locking up time; I sometimes spoke to the boys through the grates.</p>
               <p>Did you never see Mr. Fenwick, the governor, after that time? - I could almost swear it.</p>
               <p>Did not you see him very often after? - No, Sir. I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>You told Mrs. Stunnel every thing you have told us about the Captain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her you resisted? - Yes.</p>

               <p>No complaint was made to the Justice before you went home to your mistress? - No, I continued at home a month after I told her.</p>
               <p>You was carried then to the Justice for doing some more bad work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master wanted to get rid of you? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This girl stept with me a month after she came out; and she told me the Captain had lain with her by force; she did not say what Captain; she was restless of nights, and could not sleep; and afterwards viewed herself much in the glass; I thought she had been with a man, she seemed rather bold; I then told her mistress; I did not examine her linen; she came to me with quite clean linen.</p>
               <p>Court. Did that restlessness continue for any time? - No, only when she first came to me for the first three nights; she did not seem restless afterwards; she boarded with me.</p>
               <p>Had she plenty of meat and drink? - Yes, they were very good to her.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the sudden change of her diet might make her restless? - I did not think so, she used to clasp me in, her arms, and squeeze me very close a night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you take this to be restlessness proceeding from illness, or from lewdness? - I thought it proceeded from lewdness.</p>
               <p>Is it true that you observed the first or second night any appearance on her linen? - I saw nothing, it was my mistress; she was a whole month with me, and never mentioned the name of Flint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did she appear to be a loose vicious girl? - No otherwise than lazy and playing about, and gave her mind to low company.</p>
               <p>Mrs. MATTHESIAS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the mistress of this girl; she was with me two years; her character has always been a loose, idle girl; I never saw any thing vicious in her; when she came home from Bridewell, I shifted her, and by her linen, I found she had had connections with a man; I did not tax her with it; I sent her to Mrs. Stunnell; she had been taken up four times; twice forgiven, and twice committed for running away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sorry to ask you the question, you must forgive me; you spoke of appearances upon her linen, were they such appearances as if it had been the first time, or such as would attend an ordinary connection? - There were no marks of that kind at all; it was marks of being concerned with a man.</p>
               <p>Not at all as if it had been the first time? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>I conclude from your opinion of this girl, that she is a very bad girl? - Sir, she is all that; she never opened her lips to me, or I should have seen into it; she run away again the last time, and we took her to Litchfield-street to get rid of her, and then she told this story; I never heard a word of it before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came you not to tax her when you discovered it? - Because she was quite a bad girl, and I thought myself quite above her.</p>
               <p>Do you a mean vicious one? - No, Sir, I cannot say she was vicious as to men, while she was in our house; but we have no men but what are honest; I thought, let other people find her out as I had done.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I believe your are satisfied.</p>

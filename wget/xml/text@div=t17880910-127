               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. How long has the prisoner used your master's house? - A good while, three times a week, whole days, always two.</p>
               <p>He was very intimate in the family, and went where he pleased? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master and he used very often to play the rogue as they call it in the country? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not your master take a bottle of cyder of his by way of joke? - Yes, it was a pot of cyder.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it but he took these buckles in a sort of joke? Did not they use to be in the habit of playing the rogue with one another? - They did.</p>
               <p>How many indictments have you been a witness for before the grand jury this week? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Your master has a good deal of these sort of things on his hands, has not he? - Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>How many indictments has he had thrown out this week? - I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My lord, when we first took him he swore he had not them; he blasted his eyes and limbs, and told this boy he would do for him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

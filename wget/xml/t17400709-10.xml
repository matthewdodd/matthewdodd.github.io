             . I lodged in William Bird's House almost two Years. On Sunday Morning, the 21st or 22d of June, when the Accident happened, the Prisoner's Prentice Girl came up and called me between 3 and 4 in the Morning. When I came down Stairs, I found her lying dead upon the Floor, and he lay by her. Then I called the Prisoner's Sister Barker, who lodged a little higher up the Road, at the Dog and Duck. When we came down to the House again, he staggered himself up, and went up Stairs, in a staggering Manner. I found her dead in the Shop, upon the Floor, and he lying by her. After he had staggered up Stairs, he laid himself on the Bed. About 12 o'Clock, a Woman (whom I never saw before or since as I know of) came up and asked him how the Accident happened? His Answer was,- it was unlucky. I, and another Woman, stripped the deceas'd, and all the Marks I saw upon her, were 2 Blows,- black Marks, one on one Shoulder, and one on another; and a little Pinch on her upper Lip. The black Marks were just on the Top of her Shoulders. They lived together pretty well, except some Times, when he had a little Liquor in his Head: then he would swear at her, but I never saw him strike her in my Life. He has a Child by her which is now between 23 and 24 Years of Age.</p>

            . I was employed as a Surgeon, to open the deceased's Head; and I found a small Wound upon the very top of the Head, which I suspected was the Occasion of her Death I took off the hairy Scalp, and underneath the Scalp, upon the Skull, I found 2 small Fractures, about the Length of half an Inch each, which did not pene trate farther than the first Table. Then I opened the Skull, and under those Fractures, between the Dura Mate and the Pia Mater, I found a large quantity of extravasated Blood, which I imagine was the cause of her Death. The Prisoner had stabbed himself, as soon as he found his Wife was dead, and the Sword had penetrated 6 or 7 Inches into his Body, his Sword was bloody above 5 Inches. Upon finding the Wound to be a Puncture, I opened it above 6 or 7 Inches; and during the Time I attended to dress him, Mr Wilson asked him how the Accident happened? He said he gave the deceas'd an unhappy blow, with his Right-Hand, for being a Left-handed Man, he was afraid if he struck her with his Left-Hand, he should have done her a Mischief. With that Blow he said the deceas'd reeled from one side of the Room to the other, and fell against a Sand-Binn; for they kept a Chandler's Shop, and had a Birm in the Shop to put Sand in. He said she reeled and fell with her Head against the Sand-Binn. She had one Bruise upon her Shoulder, but I don't remember she had any other Marks about her. The Prisoner always seemed in a distracted condition, every Time I went to dress him; which I took to proceed from his Concern for the loss of his Wife: for he always said when I went to him, that she was the best Wife that ever lived with any Man, and that he would give all that ever he had had in the World, if she could be restored to him again. Nor would he suffer her to be taken out of the Room, tho' she smelt strong, till the Coroner had sat upon the Body. I saw him about 8 o'Clock in the Morning after the Accident, and we could not imagine how he gave himself the Wound: upon which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174007090017"></xptr> he desired us to let him see his Sword, and he would shew us (he said) how he did it; but we kept it from him, and were obliged to keep People about him, for fear he should do himself a Mischief. I can't believe that the Wound on the Head of the Deceased was given by a Blow with the Fist,'tis more likely it was done by the Fall: The Wound corresponded with the Mark on the Shoulder, and I apprehend it must have been done with the Fall, and could not possibly be done by his striking her.</p>

            . I am the Deceased's Sister. About 4 o'Clock in the Morning I was called to her House; and when I came, she lay dead upon the Floor: My Brother had stabb'd hi mself, and lay upon the Ground by her, side by side. I know they liv'd as lovingly together as any two People could do. They were married the same Month that King George the First was crown'd in, and have had a matter of 10 or 12 Children born and christen'd, besides Miscarriages. They always lived very lovingly together, except sometimes. He was passionate, and she was as passionate as he. The best in the World may have Words sometimes. I live within 4 Doors of them, and never saw him strike her in my Life. I have heard him threaten her, but if she went out of Doors, he never offered to follow her. I was always with them from the time I got up,(if it was 5 in the Morning)'till Night when I went to Bed.- I was always there, but never see him strike her. I can say, he is as honest a Man as ever the Ground carried, and is far from being quarrelsome.</p>
               <p>Jury. The Surgeon says there were 2 small Fractures, half an inch long; we desire he may be asked again, Whether he believes they came by the Fall against the Binn?</p>
               <p>Mr Lewis. Yes, I believe they did; for they were within a quarter of an inch of one another. They were so near, and so small, that they did not make an Inch in all, with the Distance between them. There were 2 Fractures in the Skull, and but one Wound on the hairy Scalp.</p>

            . I have known him 20 Years. He is a very humane, good-natur'd, quiet Man, and not given to quarrel. I have had him several times upon Guard with me, where he has had frequent Opportunities to shew his Temper, and I always found him a quiet, peaceable Man .</p>
               <p>Capt. Carey. I have the Honour to be in the Regiment with this Gentleman. I have known the Prisoner 15 Years, and have had some Opportunity to observe his Temper. For a Friend of mine being ill, he had a Mind to have this Man to attend him, and he was with me (on that Account) Nine Months, Day and Night: every other Day, he begg'd leave to go home and see his old Woman, as he called her, and he constantly went every other Day to see her, and came back in an Hour and an half; during which Time he gave her his Pay, and liv'd himself, on what I allowed him. He is a quiet , peaceable Man, and a good Man, else I would not have entrusted him with a sick Man, and one who was a Person of Quality.</p>

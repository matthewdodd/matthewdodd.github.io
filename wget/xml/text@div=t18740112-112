                  </hi>. I live at 12, Colonnade Mews, Russell Square—I became acquainted with the prisoner about two years ago—he said that he had a wife, but she was a very bad woman, and was living in adultery with another man, and it was nearly two years since he had seen her—he afterwards told me that he had heard that she was dead—I told him to find out, and he did so—I was married to him on the 2nd June, at the parish church of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and when I had lived with him six months something came to my knowledge, but I continued to live with him afterwards—I have not instituted these proceedings—I find no fault with him, he was a kind, good husband.</p>

On 30th December the prisoner's wife gave him into my custody in the Colonnade, Russell Square—she went with us to the station—I told him he was charged with bigamy, he said that what he had to say he would keep—his wife said he left her four years ago—I went to St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and compared this certificate of the prisoner's marriage with Letitia Gorman with the original, it is dated 2nd June, 1873.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that his wife left him to live with Cotton; that he had taken her back several times upon her promise of amendment, and that she had handed over to Cotton money which he had borrowed for his of his employers, and went to live with him again. That afterwards, finding she was robbing her lodgings, he gave information against her, upon which she said "I will have my revenge upon you if it is ten years to come." That he received a letter last December twelve months, signed Henry Cotton, stating she was dead, and that her last words were "How I have wronged my poor husband" after which he married Letitia Gorman; that the letter had been taken out of his pocket, but that a witness who he had read it to was present.</hi>

Cotton," addressed "William Sanders," and stated that his wife had died—I don't remember that it gave the date she died, but it said her last words were that she was sorry for having wronged her husband—to the best of my belief, it was written from Ryde, Isle of Wight.</p>

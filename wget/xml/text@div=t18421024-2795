                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live at No. 89, Strand. I only have the lower part of the house—the owner does not live in the house. On the 17th of October, about three o'clock in the day, I left my front shop—I heard a pane of glass break, ran out, and found the prisoner outside against the broken window with two gold watches in his hand—I col<lb></lb>lared him, took him into the shop, and took the watches from him, he said, "I have got another in my pocket," and gave it me—I sent for a police-man, and gave him in charge—they are my property, and are worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

On the 17th of October, I was in an omnibus stopping opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner lift up his arm, and dash his clenched fist through the window—he took something out of the window, and put it into his right-hand jacket pocket—in about a minute the prosecutor ran out, and seized him—he might have got away if he had chosen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pastrycook, and live in Monmouth-street—I have known the prisoner for the last six years. On the night before he was taken I was in his company at the Nag's Head, at the corner of James-street and Hart-street—he had been taking something to drink—there were a lot of young men there <hi rend="italic">larking,</hi> spirting beer over one another—after which the prisoner went to sleep with his head on the table—at the time the house was to be closed, the potman laid hold of his arm, and awoke him—as they had been spirting beer over him before, he took up a quart pot, and threw the contents over the potman—the potman took the pot away—the prisoner staggered towards him, and fell across the table—the potman thought he was going to strike him, lifted up his arm, swung round the pot, which caught the prisoner in the head, and wounded him—I cut off his hair, and put a plaster on, which he has on now—the wound was about an inch and a half long, and I could see the skull—no medical man was called—the surgeons' houses were all shut up—it was after twelve o'clock—I saw him again the next morning at the Nag's Head—he was going to take out a warrant against the potman—I persuaded him not to do so, but to settle it between themselves—they had some beer and three or four quarterns of gin together, and then half a pint of gin—the prisoner went away, and came back again after dinner, sat down, and had a share of a pint of beer—he laid his head on his hands, and I said, "<hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> don't lay your head down in that way, it will do you no good"—I aroused him up, and his eyes were staring—all of a minute he said, "Good bye, <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> shake hands with me"—I said, "What for? I have never offended you that I know of"—this was about three o'clock—he went out, and must have committed this offence in less than five minutes afterwards—he was not sober when he went out his eyes were ready to start out of his head—I though he was going home.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow, and am a dealer in marine-stores. On the 8th of February these strikes were bought into my shop, by my servant, Mary Tilley, but not in my presence; they were thrown among a quantity of others; Mr. Musto picked out these seven from them - I cannot say they are the same as were bought that day; my servant was before the Magistrate, but is not here; I never bought any of the prisoner myself, nor was I present when he sold any - he called at my shop about a month ago, and asked the price of different things, which I bought; he said he was out of work, and was going to collect strikes and other things, and would I buy them; he said he knew where there were some, which he could get; I asked where he lived - I did not ask where he was to get them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to James Aldous, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in London-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 30th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, this happened—the prisoner had been to the shop, about a week previous, to purchase a lancet, which could not be found—he came several times, and we always missed articles when he was gone—on the 30th of May, I was called into the shop—I found the prisoner and his companion in the shop—I looked round the counter, and missed a flute—I asked the lad in the shop if he had seen it—he said, "No"—I asked the prisoner what he wanted—he said a pair of drawing<lb></lb>compasses—seeing his coat project, I asked if he had seen the flute—he said he had seen it when he was in the shop before, but not that day—I asked him to open his coat, and he opened his coat and waistcoat together—I laid hold of him, and part of the flute fell down from between his coat and waistcoat—he scuffled, and his companion escaped—this is the flute—the prisoner rushed by me, and I stopped him at the door.</p>

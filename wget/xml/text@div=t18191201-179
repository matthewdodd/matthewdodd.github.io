            . I am porter to Messrs. Willan and Co., who are carriers. On the 9th of June I stopped at No. 9, King-street with my cart, to deliver five trusses at Mr. Cash's. There was a truss of blue cloth on the copse, which had been brought to town by the waggon - it was near two large trusses and could not be easily got out. I was getting a large truss into Mr. Cash's, and as I had got it on my knee, I turned round, and saw the prisoner pulling the truss out of the cart. I laid hold of him directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Was the street clear - A. Yes. The prisoner was dressed like a dandy. The truss was worth 15 l.</p>

            . I keep the Castle, public-house, in King-street, nearly opposite Cash's; I saw the cart stop there, and saw two men lurking about it - one was in the path and the other in the road.</p>

            Was either of them the prisoner - A. I cannot exactly say, One of them was pushing this truss up with his hands - he was in front of the cart; the other stood in the middle of the road. I saw him push it twice; every time the waggoner came out they withdrew, and got into a doorway to conceal themselves. The waggoner went in again; the shortest was pulling the truss. The waggoner came out, seized him, and threw him into the passage. The prisoner is one of the two I saw before - I ran across directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was several doors off - A. About five doors - it was about seven o'clock in the evening. There was no puppy in the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was my carman. On the 13th of Nov. I had 51lbs. weight of rope in my shop—it was brought to my warehouse about half-past five o'clock—I missed it—on Saturday night I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner if he knew anything about it—he said he did not—I said "There were two men watching you"—he said he did not take it—this is my rope—it was hid in the open yard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not put it there then; I did hide it next mor<lb></lb>ing; the old woman who works in the warehouse asked me to lay it aside till master was there to-morrow, to see it weighed; I never intended to steal it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the old woman the prisoner speaks of—on the night of the 13th Nov. the rope was brought into my master's warehouse to be sold—the prisoner weighed it, and I carried the weight to my mistress—when I came back the prisoner took it out of the scale—I said, "George, you lay the rope down there; don't cut it open; don't touch it till Mrs. Jones sees it to-morrow;" he said, "Yes, I will," and threw it down—I then left it, and had nothing more to do with it—the prisoner was left in the warehouse, and when I went home at seven o'clock at night the bundle was still there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am in the employ of Mr. Jones—on the evening of the 13th Mrs. Minton weighed the rope, and told the prisoner to lay it on one side till Mrs. Jones saw it—I missed it soon after seven o'clock that night—I inquired of the prisoner if he knew anything about it—he said he had thrown it down into the cellar along with other rope. I went into the cellar and looked for it, and can swear it was not there—I told my master so—I found it concealed on a heap of rubbish on the premises.</p>

I was present when the rope was found on a heap of rubbish—it was very dark at the time—I cannot say whether it was concealed—as the prisoner left the warehouse he said, "I am sorry for it," and turning found to his master said, "I beg pardon."</p>

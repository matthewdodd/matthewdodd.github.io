                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Charles Shaw, of No. 11, Terrace, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. The prisoner Mary had been in my service for two years, about ten years ago—Caroline Was ten years in my service, and was so in Oct.—I know her family—on the 20th of Oct. Miss Cathcart was expected in town, and I found a box of plate of hers, which was under our bed open, and the plate gone, and asked Caroline for the duplicates—I said she had done very wrong, and insisted on having the duplicates—she brought them to me—I looked at them, and, finding several were run out, I gave her</p>

               <p>the money to redeem them, that the plate should not be lost—I think there were seventeen duplicates, and, besides them, three in paper—among them was one for a silver coffee-pot—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by Morton</hi>)—this is it—I really cannot remember whether this relates to Miss Catheart's coffee-pot or mine, but I believe it is my own, pawned for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I spoke to Caroline on the 20th of Oct., she would not say anything, nor look me in the face—I was very angry with her—she said that was all there was, and there was not a single thing in the house of mine or Mr. Shaw's pledged—(I gave these duplicates to Mr. Shaw at night when he came home)—I told her it was all done, and Mr. Shaw must know, and the consequences must take their course—when Mr. Shaw came home I told him.</p>

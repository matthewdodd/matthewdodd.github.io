                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son and I was in Mr. Coate's employment—this is an invoice for some goods supplied to Messrs. Barclay &amp; Co. by Mr. Coate on 12th November, 1872—signed the receipt and received the money, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid over to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe manufacturer, of No. 26, Slater-street, Spitalfields. On "Wednesday night, 7th Feb., I Was returning home, and when I was within two yards of my own door two men suddenly sprang on me behind, pulled my head back, and put something over my mouth and nose—they tried to choke me, by putting their hands on my throat and pulling me back—they then put their knees against the small of my loins, put one hand over my mouth, and another over my throat, and tried to get me down—I was too strong for them, and loosened myself a little—I then saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way—he ran across to me, and said to the man that was holding me, "Shove your thumb into his throat, you b——"—the prisoner then laid hold of my throat in front and pressed his thumbs into my windpipe, took my gold watch and chain out of my left hand waistcoat pocket; and then the men behind and the prisoner let me go at the same time, and they all ran away—I followed the prisoner the length of the street, but he got off—the other men took an opposite direction—I could not follow the prisoner any farther, because he hurt me so in the throat—I could not halloo, I only ran after him—I am sure he is the man who took my watch; I have seen him many times about the neighbourhood—I gave information to the police, and a description of the prisoner—I could see him by the gas light—he came in front of me—the gas light was within seven feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had not known the soldier before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till Monday evening—he slept there three nights; Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and on Thursday, at 4 o'clock, he left my house to go to his barracks, at Woolwich—he did not sleep there on the Sunday—I have known the prisoner six or seven years—he has lodged with me four years, as near as I can tell—I am licensed for thirteen beds—there were six beds in the room occupied by the soldier and the prisoner—they were all six occupied on the Wednesday night; it is the one pair room—some of the persons sleeping there were strangers and some not—one was James Shillingsworth, John Brown, Russell, and the prisoner; I do not know the names of the other two—it was at 4 o'clock, on Thursday afternoon, that the soldier left to go to his barracks—I remember that the prisoner slept there on Wednesday, the 7th, by its being the night before the soldier went, and he came to spend an hour or two with the prisoner, before he went to join his regiment—they took supper together, and went to bed at 9 o'clook—the soldier came on Monday, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon; he was not there at all on Sunday—I saw him and the prisoner in company together all the day on the Tuesday and Wednesday; it was on the Wednesday evening that they spent a few hours together—they were in each other's company for the three days the soldier was there—they became acquainted by being in the place together, and taking their meals together—I have no reason for saying that the prisoner slept there on the Wednesday night, except that he was accustomed to sleep there—I gave him a candle at the foot of the stairs—I did that every nights-Russell, Adams, and Brown went up stairs together—there were no other persons in the other beds at that time—they were the only persons there at that hour—I have kept a lodging house eleven years—I never had any complaints made against me; none whatever—no officer or any gentleman can come forward to say so—I have never had any complaints made as to the character of the persons who lodge at my house—the prisoner and the soldier had coffee for their break. fast, and tea in the afternoon, and I cooked them a beef steak for their supper at 7 o'clock—they had a pot of ale with their supper—I did not take any part of it—there is no one else here to-day who slept in the room—Shillingsworth and Brown are not here; they are still lodging with me—I do not know where they are—my attention was not drawn to this evening</p>

               <p>in particular, until I heard the prisoner was taken—I went to go before the Magistrate, but I was not allowed to go in—I went to Worship-street; the prisoner sent for me to go there, when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by not being allowed to go in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not called in—I told the policeman that I was there waiting, and I was not called in—I sent word that I was there to go in if I was wanted—I told the policeman that I was there to say what time the prisoner came to his bed—I told him I was there for the purpose of giving evidence, but I was not called in—I am sure I said that—I told the policeman that I was there for the purpose of giving evidence on behalf of the prisoner—I said I came to say the time the prisoner went to his bed, and I was not called in—I do not say I was refused admittance to the police office—I was not called, and I was outside—I did not go in, only into the little waiting room where the witnesses stop—I did not go into the public Court—I did not try to go in—I do not know what prevented me from going in—nothing prevented me; I was in the waiting room, to be called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not go in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—Russell was not there—the police frequently come to my house of a night to ask if any one is there, and that same night the policeman came and asked me for two persons, and I told them they were not there—there have been no complaints made to my knowledge—my sister-in-law, at Brighton, keeps a private house—she goes out charing—her husband and my husband were brothers—her husband is not living, nor is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been nine years keeping this house; have you had a licence all that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not all the time; I have had the licence since the common lodging-houses have been licensed—the police have visited my house at all hours of the day and night, but I was never summoned, nor ever had any complaint—there were six beds in the room where the prisoner and the soldier slept—they were all occupied—one other person went up to bed with the prisoner and the soldier—the others did not come in till o'clock in the morning, that is Shillingsworth and the other—I am positive about the day of the week that the soldier came to my house first—I do not know what day the prisoner was apprehended—I was sent for on the Friday morning—a young woman came to me, who saw the prisoner going along with the policeman—that was about o'clock in the morning—I went to the police court—I am certain that the soldier went away at o'clock on the Thursday—I am quite sure that it was on the night before that the soldier and the prisoner had supper together—they had supped together on other nights—I do not recollect what they had for supper on each night, because I only cooked their supper on the Wednesday night—they might have had cheese for supper, but I did not take that notice except the time I cooked their supper—this was the only night I cooked for them—I swear that I went to the police office to state the time the prisoner went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did he go to bed on the Tuesday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; near about o'clock, that is the time I close my house—he went to bed on Tuesday night about o'clock, between and o'clock—he was not in on Thursday night—I cannot say exactly what time he went to bed on Monday night, but he was in before I closed the house—I took notice of the Wednesday night on account of his being in bed with the soldier, Russell, who said he felt himself very unwell, and wished to go to bed—it was then o'clock, and the prisoner went up with him—Brown went out to his father's this morning, to go to his work, before I came away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260021"></xptr>
               <p>—he worked as a cabinet maker, at No. 3, Crown-court, Spitalfields—he has lodged at my house these four years—he knows the prisoner very well—they slept in separate beds—I am sure it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon when the soldier left my house; it was not between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—I am sure he did not sleep at my house on the Sunday.</p>

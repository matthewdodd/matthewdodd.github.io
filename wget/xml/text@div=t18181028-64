            . I am a grocer, and live in Wardour-street. On a Saturday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought tea and sugar, which came to 2s. 9d. She gave the last witness a 1l., note, which he handed to me. I asked her name and address, she said Jones, No.5, Compton-street. After I had marked it on the note, I said to her, Jones, No.5, Compton-street, she made answer, "close by here." I then told her I did not like the appearance of the note, and she must wait until I sent to No. 5, Compton-street, to see if she lived there. I directed a young man in the shop to go there, she heard it and said she would go herself. I told her she must wait until the young man returned, to know if the address was correct; she said no, she would go herself; I told her she must stay. She immediately ran out of the shop. I called out "Stop thief!" and went to the shop-door. She was running away. The watchman brought her back with a man (looking at a note). This is the note; it has the name and address on it, with my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When you told her it was a bad note, did not she say that her husband gave it her, and she was sorry for it - A. She said she was sorry it was a bad note; but she did not say it was given to her by her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say that her husband, who was at the door, gave it to her - A.No, she did not. My street - door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time she left the shop until she was brought back - A. Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. A man was taken up with her - A. Yes, and kept in custody till within a few days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say anything about her husband, before she ran away - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEAKER. I am a watchman. I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" on the 29th of August, as I was coming up Princes-street, towards Wardour-street. I saw a man crying out "Stop thief!-Stop her!" I saw the prisoner and a man running before the rest. I pursued and took the prisoner about the middle of Compton-street - the man immediately knocked me down; I still kept hold of her, and gave the man in charge of another watchman. We took them both to the prosecutor; he said the prisoner was the woman, and gave her in charge. I took her and the man to the watch-house, when they got there, the man said she was his wife. When he was being searched, he said his name was Jones, and she also said her name was Jones. Next day I took them before the magistrate; as we went along the man said, in her hearing, that he gave her the note, and be believed that she never had one penny but what he gave her. He told the magistrate, in her hearing, that her name was Farmillo, and she gave the same name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. They were running close together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first saw them, what distance were they from the prosecutor's house - A.About thirty or forty yards. They were running from the prosecutor's house. The man gave his name as Jones, at first; he was kept in custody for knocking me down. They spoke as man and wife.</p>
               <p>CHARLES VANDEIAN. I live at No. 5, Old Compton-street, Soho, on the 29th of August, it is near Wardour-street. The prisoner did not live at my house; I do not know her.</p>
               <p>RICHARD FILKINS. On the 29th of August I lived at No. 5, Little Compton-street, Soho, near Wardour-street. The prisoner did not lodge at my house; I do not know her.</p>
               <p>MARY PENNER. On the 29th of August I lived at No.5, New Compton-street. The prisoner never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am a bank note inspector-(looking at the note.) It is forged in all its parts, in paper, plate, ink, and signature. It is signed "A.Consett," but it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read. See Indiciment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shopman said it was 7s. tea; it was 8s. black tea. My husband gave me the note, and told me the name and direction that I was to put on it, which I did. He was standing at the shop-door, and told me to go in and buy the tea and sugar. I obeyed him, as by law and duty I am bound to do. I believe his handwriting is on the note.</p>

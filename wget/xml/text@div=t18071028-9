               <p>Q. Is your dwelling house on the premises. - A. Yes; I occupy it alone. The front of the house opens into the street, and the back of the house opens into the brewery yard; the yard is enclosed three parts out of four by a wall, and the fourth part by four dwelling houses, one of which I occupy; there is a wall and a small yard to each house, independent of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall between your house and the yard. - A. None; my house opens into the brewery yard, and the store house is in the yard. The prisoner Pollard was my <rs id="t18071028-9-deflabel41" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

On Monday the 21st of September, a few minutes before twelve o'clock at night, the drayman Jones rung the bell; I was watching; I had placed myself near the mill wheel, underneath the stage; I heard the bell ring, Pollard went and opened the gate, he did not know I was there; Jones came in, they went on the stage together; I went through my own dwelling house into the street, I rang the bell and Pollard let me in; I asked him some questions about the brewery, as if I had just come home. I desired him to give me a light and I went into my own dwelling house; he said good night, but said nothing of Jones being there.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones had no business there then. - A.None whatever. I went through a small yard which joins the brewhouse yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your house. - A. Yes; I got over the wall, and got into the brewery.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to do that I understood your back door opened into the brewery. - A. It does, but Pollard would have heard me if I had come out at that door; I had got over another part, and went to my old place underneath the stage. I heard Pollard say, we are safe, he is gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pollard's voice. - A. I did; they were on the stage direct above me; they both came down the steps of the stage together, Pollard and Jones did; it was dark, but we had a lamp burning on the stage, two or three yards off, where they came from; Pollard had a lanthorn in his hand, they both went towards the storehouse, and Pollard gave 
               <persName id="t18071028-9-person124">Jones</persName>
             the light out of the lanthorn; I could see nothing but that till I went to the store house door, I there saw Jones in the storehouse, he had a candle with him; I saw Pollard standing four or five yards from me; I said what do you do here; before I collared him I saw Jones through the folding doors of the store house; in the middle it does not meet; he was drawing beer from a cask in that store house. The moment I collared Pollard Jones put the light out; I said Jones you may come out, I know you, it is vain to make any resistance. He got out underneath the tiles, they had moved a lath.</p>
               <p>Q. When that lath was removed you do not know. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this place. - A. It is perhaps five feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the door. - A. It was locked; I had the key; that was the door I looked through.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the moving of that lath make room for a person to come through. - A. Yes, it is a sloping place. I desired them to come along with me into the brewery yard, I desired them to call Thomas, my servant, that lived on the premises; my servant got up and called two watchmen. Pollard was taken to the watchhouse; Jones in the act of going through a small door in the gate got away from the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Jones taken. - A. The same night. When I went to the watchhouse there was an officer of Hatton Garden, he went back with me to the brew-house, with a constable: I gave him the keys of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280008"></xptr>store house to examine the premises; I went in with him; they had bored a hole in the head of one of the casks; before that when I looked through the crivice of the door, I saw the beer running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was running into. - A. I did not. The beer was all run out of the ask or nearly. That cask with others were put in about six weeks before as full casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any vessel to receive the beer. - A. There was a two quart pot three parts full of beer; it was standing near to the cask, and the candle laying by it on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any vessel for carrying away the beer but the two quart pot. - A. No, but there were about five or six barrels of beer deficient in the store house, within about five or six weeks; that had been bored in a similar way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who that was done by you cannot say. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had Jones done his work that night. - A. At six o'clock; he had no more business there till six the next morning.</p>

I went back along with the police officer to Mr. Bennet's, we saw the place where they took the beer, and the place where they broke in the store cellar.

            . I am an officer. I know nothing more than apprehending Jones in his lodgings, and seeing the beer that had run on the floor.</p>
               <p>Pollard's Defence. My lord, between eleven and twelve o'clock my fellow servant, Jones, rung at the bell at the gate. I opened the wicket, he came in; he told me he was too late for his lodgings, he wished to sleep in the stable, or hay loft, which I could not think of refusing him, on principles of humanity. We had been brewing that day, consequently there remained a little fire under the copper; I took a little of this fire out in a shovel, put it down on the bricks in the stokehole, put down the gridiron, and broiled me a rasher of bacon for my supper, and was drinking some table beer with it. I went, after letting Jones in into the stoke hole, and he followed me, and we thought of drinking a draft of ale; we went down to the store house, as Mr. Bennet has related, and he went in to draw a little ale in the common drinking pot; he entered this hole, which to my knowledge he never broke; I had noticed it for more than nine months; I had been more than ten months in the house at the time; I had never entered but once myself, when fatigued in working over the stoke hole, as I did not think it an eligible way; Mr. Bennet came in, the consequence was, he gave charge of us; as to the barrels of beer I know nothing of, nor had I any concerns in the place but once, which I have mentioned; other servants were in the house. I do not mean to impeach any. I am not partial to ale, consequently I did not look after it.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. It was late at night, and I had been drinking with a fellow servant. On my going home to my lodgings, I found they were gone to bed, I did not like to call them up; I came back and rang at the bell, the watchman let me in. I intended to lay in the stable, as I had done once or twice before, when I had been locked out, not thinking this would happen; I was very much in liquor; I got in at the hole which was there before; I got a little beer in the two quart pot, on purpose to drink.</p>

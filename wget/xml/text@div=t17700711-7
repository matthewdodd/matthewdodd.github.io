The prisoners came into my master's shop, and asked to see some clear lawns of about 5 s. a yard. I opened a bundle, and the three first pieces that came to hand I laid upon the compter before me; this piece was one of them. Upon these three pieces I opened six other pieces; they fixed upon one of the last pieces, at 3 s. per yard. They said they only wanted half a quarter of a yard. Their asking for so small a quantity made me suspect them.

             had a long cloak on, and I observed afterwards that she kept her hands under her cloak, and made no use of them. Immediately after they were gone I examined the goods on the compter, and I missed a piece of linen. I went in search of them, and met them near Newgate; I brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110010"></xptr> them both back; there was nothing upon the ground when they came into the shop. I asked my master if he had found the piece; he said, No; immediately the piece of linen was found upon Mr. Hughes's foot; I am sure it was not there when we came in. When I laid it upon the compter, it was folded up at length; but when I took it from the ground, it was doubled up short. I imagine from the manner in which they stood, that it was dropped by Salmon.</p>
               <p>Hughes. I was in the shop at the time the girls were brought back. Mr. Cawdell challenged them with stealing a piece of lawn; immediately it was dropped upon my shoe. I looked down and saw it upon my shoe; it is a thing of very light weight, I did not feel it.</p>
               <p>Salmon's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met this young woman, and asked her to go with me to buy a bit of lawn. I bought half a quarter of a yard. We went and had a pint of beer with a woman we met. I met the gentleman; he said I must go back to the shop. When we came back, he asked the gentleman if he had found the lawn; he said, No; and bid us go about our business.</p>

               <p>She asked me to go with her; when we came away we met an acquaintance; we went and drank a pint of beer together; the gentleman came to us, and told us to go back again to the shop; there were twenty pieces of cloth on the compter at the time.</p>

            . On the 19th of October, I went with the prosecutor and his wife, to Oakley's, in Monmouth-court, where we found the vice. The same day I went to No. 21, St. Andrew's-street, and found the prisoner concealed behind his bed; they would not open the door, but we broke it open. I found another man in the room - he did not charge that man with it.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker, and lodge with Oakley. On Monday, the 18th of October, I bought the vice of the prisoner for 5 s., and sold it for 6 s. I have known him twelve months; he is a tinman - another man was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy it - A. In the prisoner's room, No. 21, St. Andrew's-street - I put the money on the table - the other man took part of it up and looked at it. I do not know who took the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was brought into my room by a man who asked me to buy it; I sent for Price, who bought it, and the man took the 5 s. up. At night they told me it was stolen, and I had better find the man, which I did, and took him to my room, but the officer took me, and let him go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Kingsland-road. The prisoner was in my employ about fourteen months—he had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was his duty to attend the warehouse, and throw pledges down the spout—in the course of business the low prized duplicates, those pledges that had gone out during the day, are to be crossed off as delivered, in the book—that did not apply to high pledges, only those under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put a certain sum in the till in the morning, and all the money that I had was kept on the right-hand side, and what is expended, and all the cash received, and the tickets, on the other side—on the morning of the 6th of Dec., I cast up two of the columns of this book—I had found them to amount to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the evening before, and that morning they amounted to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were alterations in the column, in the prisoner's writing, and they made it appear right—I told my young man to fetch the pledges down, and see if I was cor<lb></lb>rect—I found I was, and that these three 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been inserted—I sent the groom for the policeman—at that time the prisoner was coming down stairs, and I stopped him—he said he wanted to go into the yard—I said he should not till he was searched by the policeman, for I was quite satisfied he had property of mine about him he then waited in my presence—I would not at him go out of the room—the policeman came, and searched him, but found nothing material—he then took him to the station—I went with him—he was then searched more particularly they took off his drawers, and found s✗ double duplicates on him amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two sovereigns—the effect of detaining these duplicates would be to prevent further inquiry about these pledges—we found in his box a diamond pin, some Excise<lb></lb>tickets for saddle-horses, one very neat cigar-case, and two common ones—he said he found the Excise-tickets, and the pin he had given him by his cousin—I did not hear him say anything about the duplicates and the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

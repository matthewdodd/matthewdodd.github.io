I live at 40, Ann Street, Mile End—I am a cabinet maker, in the employ of John Price, at 1, Singleton Street—the prisoner also worked there—on 7th December I was in the workshop about 9.30 in the evening—I saw him with a piece of lighted wood in his hand, which he placed deliberately behind a box which we use for colours—there were some shavings behind the box—I took no notice of it at the time—I called to a shopmate named O'Neil, and said "I shall leave off'—I walked down the shop to O'Neil's bench, and stood a little to see if the smoke would come up—Green went and smothered it with some sawdust or trod on it—I then left the shop with O'Neil, leaving the prisonor and a man named Gammon there—we merely went down stairs—we did not go away—I should think we remained down stairs five or ten minutes, and then we went round to the back of the premises to see if we could see anything further—I went up stairs by the back entrance, and looked through a hole in the door, leaving O'Neil down stairs—I saw smoke coming up in another place, but close to where the lighted wood had been laid—Green was standing at the further end of the shop—I saw him pick something up from the bench, put it under his arm, and walk out—as he shifted from the bench I lost sight of him, but I heard the door shut and locked, and he went down stairs and turned the gas off at the metre in the yard—I called O'Neil up, and we entered the shop together—as we went in where we saw the smoke it burst into a flame, from the draught of the door or something—I left O'Neil in the shop and went and fetched Mr. Dowsett, who was close by—when we came back the shavings were partly burnt out—there were shavings from the fire-place where the little heap was burning, and a train of shavings ran from there to two or three benches in the shop—we put the fire out And went away—the piece of wood which I saw him take from the fire had evidently been trodden on—it was broken, but I think two or three pieces were still alight when I left with O'Neil, leaving the prisoner and Gammon there—Gammon left before the prisoner—the train of shavings which I after<lb></lb>wards saw is not always in the shop—that communicated to two or three different benches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 20, Great Charles Street, City Road—I have worked for Mr. Price seven years—on this Friday I left the workshop about 9.15—I then noticed shavings between my bench and the prisoner's, which are next to one another, and the young master's is next—Yetton afterwards called me in to look at some shavings—I should imagine that those shavings which were alight were what were swept back from the fire-place—the other shavings were in the same condition as when I left—I saw no train whatever.</p>

I had some cherries, strawberries, and oranges in a silk handkerchief. The gardener had given me them. I was met by a female; she said I had a nice bundle. I kept on, and I felt the the bundle jirk out of my hand. I turned sharp round to seize the bundle, and these men made up to me; Briant struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see when you turned round who took your bundle - A. Yes. I saw the woman had it; I made my way after the woman that had got my bundle, and after I had almost overtook her Briant gave me another blow. I put my hand out to take the woman; he gave me another blow. I collared him; then Hildrith came to trip me up; then after that I found that one of them had got hold of my neck. I called out for help; a watchman came up. When the watchman came up Hildrith was in company still.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 9th I was in Broad-street; I heard the row; I heard a man call watch. I went up. I said, what is the matter with you. He gave me charge of Briant: he made no charge against any body else. Hildrith was close to Briant and Champney. He said, watchman, let that man go, he has done nothing. Hildrith followed to the watchhouse of his own accord.</p>

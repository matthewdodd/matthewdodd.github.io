I do not know his Christian name, the room was being painted, and my box containing the articles stated in the indictment, was in the garret, they are worth 6 l. 8 s. and much more. I saw the box locked safe, about four o'clock that afternoon, and about ten at night it was gone. I lived there two months. I found the prisoner at Guildhall, with the trunk, next day - he is a stranger. There are other lodgers in the house.</p>

            . I lodge with Mr. Mann on the second floor of Egerton's house. On the 9th of July I saw the prisoner carrying this box down the garret stairs; I asked who he was, he gave no answer; I asked what he wanted and what he was going to do with the box, he made no answer - I sent a little boy down for assistance, he then tried to escape down stairs. I laid hold of him and held him, and gave him in charge of Masters. Egerton lives in the house. It was Wards box.</p>

About a quarter before nine I was coming up, and saw the prisoner sitting on the garret stairs, with his arm on Ward's box, I have lived there six months, I never saw him before. Hallam sent me for assistance, he was secured in about a quarter of an hour, Ward was not at home, I saw Masters take him; he said a young woman who he met in the street said she was distressed for rent, and she would give him 6 d. to go up and fetch it for her - he did not say where the woman was - no young woman lived there but Ward.</p>

            . I am a constable and live in Temple-lane. About nine at night I was fetched and took the prisoner, charged with stealing this box. I know Egerton, and am sure his Christian name is Thomas - I collect rates of him; his house is in the precinct of Whitefriars. The prisoner pretended to be drunk, but I believe it was pretence, he did not smell at all of liquor.</p>

She went up with me, and showed me the box; I put it on my shoulder, and it fell off - I did not touch it again. I told them I was hired by a woman, but they would not go to look for her.</p>

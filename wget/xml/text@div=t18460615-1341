               <p>received an invoice at some malt, which arrived by the train for Trueman and Hanbury, brewers, Brick-lane—200 quarters arrived—there are two sacks to a quarter—I saw it in trucks previous to being delivered into Trueman's vans—it arrived about three o'clock in the morning—the name of Trueman was on the sacks, in red paint—the prisoner was employed by me on the rail way—it was his duty to assist in carrying the sacks to the vans, with other parties—when it was delivered from the trucks there was a sack short, 199 instead of 200—I received information about twelve o'clock, and said to the prisoner, "How came you to take the malt and barley away?"—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing about it—I gave him into custody—I have seen some malt produced, and compared it with that consigned to Trueman, and believe it to be the same—the sack had been changed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter, in the service of the Eastern Counties Rail<lb></lb>way. On Saturday morning I was assisting in unloading this malt, and saw the prisoner take a sack off the platform, and take it away instead of putting it into Trueman and Co.'s wagon, which was about half loaded—he turned up in an opposite direction towards Bethnal-green-road—when he got to John-street he turned to the right—I saw him with another sack three quarters of an hour after—I followed him, and he went to Mr. Reed's yard, in Graoby-street.</p>

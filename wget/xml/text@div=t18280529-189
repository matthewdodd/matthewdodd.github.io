               <p>EDWARD JOSEPH WELD. On the 10th of May, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Drury-lane Theatre, and just as I entered the Arcade, Regent-street, I missed my handkerchief, which I had safe when I was going to the Theatre; I remarked to a friend that I had lost it; I was going on, when the officer came, and told me he had seen it taken - he went and took the two prisoners; the handkerchief has not been found - I had not seen the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not seen the handkerchief for some hours? A. No: it was a yellow silk one, and had my initials on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in company in Coventry-street; I followed them, and saw them make several attempts at this gentleman's pocket, both there and up Titchhourne-street; and when they got under the Quadrant, I saw Mulford take the handkerchief from the pocket, while Smith was close to him; I went and told the gentleman, who gave me his address: I then went up to the prisoners, who were in company, following another gentleman - I spoke to a gentleman, and said, "I want your assistance;" I then rushed forward, and took them - there were a great many people, as the Theatre was just over; I found one handkerchief on Smith, and another round his leg; he said his leg had a wound in it; I found one handkerchief round Mulford's neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance were you? A. Just across the road, opposite them; I spoke to the gentleman before I seized them - I cannot say how many persons I have prosecuted; Phillips saw it also - I lodge with him- he keeps a china-shop in Great Queen-street; he is not an officer; I cannot say how many cases he has prosecuted- he seldom asks for his expences; I do not recollect whether I prosecuted a man named Banks last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person named Banks was not discharged by proclamation last Session? A. No, not to my recollection- I took no money from a person of that name, nor from his relatives, not to prosecute; I took no money from anybody not to prosecute - I defy you to prove it; I do not recollect the name at any time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you bound over to prosecute any person last Session, who was discharged by proclamation? A. I did not; I will not swear it, but I believe I had but one case last Session which was thrown out - that was a foreigner, and I was not called before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not send Phillips after the gentleman? A. He wishes to decline anything till he comes here.</p>

            . I was coming through Coventry-street with Whittingham - he said "There are two chaps over the way," they followed this gentleman along Tichbourne-street into <placeName id="t18280529-189-crimeloc1055">Regent-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you go out with Whittingham? A. For the purpose of detecting offenders - I go out now and then with him; I crossed the road with him; I did not call Mr. Weld, I did not want to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been here with Whittingham? A. When he cannot do without me I come - the Magistrate generally sends for me; I never passed as an officer, nor carry a staff; I swear I did not take a staff out that night -Whittingham told me not to go after them, as we could take them both when we had assistance; I believe I had my expences once last Session - I do not think I have been in above two or three cases with Whittingham; I do not think I had my expences in above two or three cases - I have prosecuted many a score of persons without having my expences, but not with Whittingham - I will not swear I have not prosecuted in forty cases - when I get my expences I generally give them to the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not prosecuted a dozen cases in conjunction with Whittingham? A. Yes, I think I can safely swear that - I was here last Session; I was robbed myself, and Whittingham was the officer - I was here once or twice the Session before last; Whittingham was the officer in them - I think I first came here with him six months ago - I only go out for amusement, I do not remember the name of Banks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What property was lost the last time Whittingham was a witness? A. A servant of mine concealed my goods about him, I had my expences for that; I have been here often, I watch thieves - I have not had my expences nine times out of ten.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MULFORD. When Phillips came up he put a staff over our heads and seized me by the throat - I never saw the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WHITTINGHAM. Q. Upon your oath has not Phillips, when in your company, carried a staff, and acted as a constable? A. When I see him with me I sometimes give him my staff to hold; I have at times given him my staff; he had not one that night.</p>

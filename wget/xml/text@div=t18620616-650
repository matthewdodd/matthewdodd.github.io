I am one of the detectives of the City of London—in consequence of information, on 12th May, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, in company with Leonard, Foulger, and Brett, I took the prisoner into custody on London-bridge—I had seen him leave the London-bridge station, and followed him to Adelaide-place—I told him we were officers, and that we took him into custody for forging Russian rouble notes, in connexion with Reichberg, Josephson, and others, who have been tried for this offence—he said, "Me; I know nothing about it"—we put him into a cab—Brett took this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from underneath his coat—it is addressed "M. Berny; to be left till called for"—I asked him what the parcel con<lb></lb>tained—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "A man gave it me at the railway"—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he made no answer—he said, "I know Reichberg and Josephson; I have done some work for Reichberg"—we took him to the station, and at the station I opened, the parcel, and found it to contain seven engraved copper and zinc plates and fifty-three forged Russian rouble notes—he gave me his address, 7, Kent-street, Hackney-road—I went there and found this bag containing a quantity of engravers and other tools, some pieces of zinc similar to the plates produced, and a seal and wax in the drawer of a looking or dressing-glass—those plates have not en<lb></lb>gravings upon them—on the 14th of the same month I went with Brett to Woolwich, to the Arsenal railway station, and received from the station-master there the parcel which I now produce, directed to Mr. Wilkinson.</p>

Berny; to be left till called for"—I told him it was not sufficient to give any exterior marks, or even telling the number, without the ticket itself was produced, and that it would be necessary for him to inform me the contents of the parcel—he replied, "It merely contains plates and engravings, as I am an engraver"—I told him we should have to open the parcel before we could give it him—he then said, "I will not take the parcel now; I will call this evening"—he did not call that evening; I did not see him again until the 12th—he then came again and applied for the parcel—I said to him, "You are the gentle<lb></lb>man that called on Friday, stating that you had lost the ticket"—he said, "Yes, I am; I wish to take the parcel"—he then handed me this letter written by Mr. Dyne (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 12th May, 1862, addressed to Mr. M.

Q.</hi> Do you know he was in America? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> have reason to believe he was—I did not apprehend him in 1856—I was present at his trial—he only had four months—I gave evidence on that occasion—I did not then say that I did not know anything previously against him—I do not know that he went to America again—I have reason to believe that he did not—I know, from what I have been told, that he was at Bath; not of my own knowledge—he has not been tried since then—I have a warrant in my pocket now, for his apprehension, for an offence committed at Bath—I knew him when he was tried—I have known him seven or eight years.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. He went out, leaving me at home. I went out at half-past ten o'clock, leaving no person at home, and the watch hanging over the mantle-piece. I locked the door-it opens into the sitting-room-there is only one window in it-and put the key into my pocket; I left the window-sash down-it would require great force to open it. When I returned, in about three quarters of an hour, I immediately missed the watch. There are three other houses in our court, all uninhabited. The door was as I had left it, and the window apparently in the same state. There were the prints of four sooty fingers on the window-cill, and on a bason which stood on the window-ledge, there was the mark of a sooty finger and thumb, and a footmark on a box which stood under the window.

            . I live next door to Swan-court. On the 23d of September, I saw two sweeps go up the court - I never saw them before. I knew Mrs. Payne was out. I was looking out of my window. They stood at the top of the court sometime - They went up the court, and returned in about ten minutes; their faces-were blacked. I saw the prisoners at the Office-their faces were clean then. I am certain the prisoners are the men. I was not above half a yard from them while they stood on the step of the court. I did not see them come out with any thing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURKINSHAW. I am servant to Messrs. Martin and Co., pawnbrokers, High-street, Borough. On the 23d of September, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, Wilson, pledged a watch with me for 18s. - he was dressed as a sweep; I never saw him before. I am sure he is the man. He asked 1l., for it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290007"></xptr>pulled it out of his fob - He gave the name of Turvey, Great East-street, Lambeth - I wrote the ticket. I do not know who gave him the 18s. - I was standing by. I do not take in pledges.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Take care what you are about. Do you mean to state, on your oath, that you stood by, and saw the money given to him, but you do not know by whom - A. I do not know. There is a person who takes in the pledges. I did not hear any person ask him any questions about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it you are so sure that he is the man, and cannot tell who gave him the money - A. I cannot tell. I was examined before the magistrate on the Monday.</p>

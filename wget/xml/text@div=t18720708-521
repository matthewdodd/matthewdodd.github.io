               <p>towards him since he ill-treated me—I did say that I would hunt him down—I wished to part friends with him, and he refused to shake hands with me, and that annoyed me—this piece of a letter is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "George Langston. You refused to shake hands with me this morning, if you had done so you would have saved yourself, but now the next act of mine will be to seek out Anna Shergood, and together we will hunt you down. I ought to say Mrs. Anna Langston, ought I not? I do not mind this half so much as if I were your legal wife; believe me I shall not break my heart. I wonder what Mrs. Pearce will say when I tell her that I am not your wife; it will be quite a romance for her, will it not, dear? I can't resist the pleasure of telling—")—that is quite correct, but I wrote more than that—this other piece of a letter is also mine—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: Mrs. Langston I have sent the only thing belonging to George that I have in my possession. I rather expect the old darling is losing his memory, or else he would recollect that he took them out of the drawer and put them in his box. I saw Lucy on Sunday, and was overjoyed to find that George had quite for<lb></lb>given me, but unfortunately his forgiveness comes too late; he should have forgiven me when I ate humble pie to ask him. Had you come the other day I would have spared him, now he must take his chance as well as me, for I have still to suffer for it, and in a way that ought to make George forgive if nothing else would, &amp;c.")—I also wrote this post-card—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "If Mrs. Williams wishes to save her son a little, she can do so by seeing Jane Williams at Aldersgate Station on Sunday, at 6 o'clock in the evening, and if you are not there I shall prosecute him to the extent of the law, and it is not all out yet Save him for your own sake, if not for his. Come alone, and I shall not say a word.")—that was a very good joke.</p>

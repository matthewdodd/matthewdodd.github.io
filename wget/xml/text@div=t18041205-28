I worked last in Whitechapel at the white lead mills, which made me very ill; I was obliged to go to my parish; I had been out but three days from my parish, I was coming along this street, and a man asked me if I wanted a job; I was out of employment; I said, yes; he told me he had a copper up Castle-court, and he would go and get me a knot; he shewed it me; it is against a dead wall, said he, I suppose about four or five yards opposite the door; Mr. Holmes was standing at the door at the same time; I took it up in my arm, thinking the man was coming up with the knot, and carried it down; directly Mr. Holmes came up, and took hold of me; the man ran away.</p>

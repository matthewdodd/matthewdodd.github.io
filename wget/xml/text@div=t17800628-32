One asked me first what it was o'clock. I said I thought it was near twelve o'clock. They both came to me; one took hold of my right shoulder, the other held a bayonet to my breast, and said, your money! I said I was a poor man, and had no more money than what I got that day in the country by playing on the harpsichord. I said I had got half a guinea. They then asked for my watch. I said I had none. Then they demanded the half guinea. I told them I had changed it into silver, and that I had but about ten shillings left; they again demanded the half guinea, thinking still that I had the half guinea in gold. I said I had changed it. They pulled my breechees quite down and searched for the half guinea. Then they took away my handkerchief and gave me a wound on my forehead with a bayonet. I asked for something to buy me a pot of beer upon the road upon which they struck me again with the bayonet, and said, if I made any noise they would run me through the body. It was

             I think who struck me; however they gave me a shilling. One had his hand in one pocket, and the other in the other; they bid me go, and make no noise, or they would kill me. I came to St. George's-Row. I informed a coachman who was there, how I had been used. The coachman told me that he would take me up upon his coach, and carry me to London. In coming along we met two soldiers; I told them I had been robbed and ill-used; but I did not speak good English, and therefore they did not much mind what I said. I desired the coachman to tell them which he did. The soldiers said they would go in search of the men if I would go along with them, upon which I got down. We met the men and took them. I said immediately upon seeing them, these are the men who robbed me. They were searched afterwards, but not till the next morning; at that time there was only half a crown that I saw taken from them. The half crown was no part of my money, for that was all in shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>From Gray. Whether you did not say at the guard-house that you did not know us?</p>
               <p>Rotherker. I was asked about it, and there was a mistake; they misunderstood me, for I never said I did not know them; but when they asked me about it I said, God forbid that I should take away a man's life for the world, if I did not know him; from thence I believe they understood that I said I did not know them. But I am positive I did know them. It was not above a quarter of an hour from the time I was robbed to the time I saw them in the guard-room. We met the guards as I was on the coach-box, in Oxford road. I went back with the guards, and they were taken at the turnpike and carried to the guard-house.</p>

               <p>I belong to the second troop of horse-guards; we were patrolling about twelve o'clock or ten minutes after; we met the prosecutor between Portman-street and Orchard-street, he was on a coach box; he spoke first but we took no notice of him; then the coachman spoke and told us the prosecutor had been robbed somewhere about Bayswater, between that and the turnpike, and had been used ill. I took notice of the man at that time, the blood was running down the side of his face. He said, he had been robbed by two soldiers, and that they had cut him with their bayonets; upon which I told him if he would go back with us we would seek for the men who had robbed him. He went back with us as far as the turnpike. and within a few yards of the turnpike, I saw the two prisoners come from under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280082"></xptr> wall. I left the prosecutor at the gate. I told the prisoners I would cut them down if they made any resistance for I had been informed they had robbed a man; my comrade and I dismounted; one of the prisoners had a naked bayonet in his; the prosecutor immediately said, You be the men. Upon which the prisoners said, Would you take such a blackguard's word, we shall be punished for what he has said; and he said something about a hundred or two hundred lashes. I told them it was our duty, if we did not do it we should be liable to be tried by a court-martial; we took them immediately to the guard-house. I saw fresh blood upon both the prisoners; one of the men that was by tried it and found it was; it was on the coat, on the hand, and on the belt of the bayonet, both the men had bayonets drawn; but I took particular notice only of the man that I took; I am sure he had one drawn. They belong to the 18th regiment; and they were in camp at that time in Hyde-park. I felt down the prisoners a little when I first took them, but did not search them. They were searched the next day, but I believe no money was taken from them; one of them pulled out a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence; they had had frequent opportunities of going out and had gone out to the necessary, after they were in custody.</p>

We desired the prosecutor to turn back with us; he went with us all the way. We found the prisoners twenty or thirty yards beyond the turnpike. I heard the prisoner say, they hoped we would not take that rascal's word before their's; for they said, they should be whipped if we did. We said, it was our duty to take them; we took them to the Guardroom. The prosecutor said, He would swear to them. I did not stay long in the Guardroom; but I saw blood on them, it was on the hand and the cuff of the coat; I took particular notice of one of them; the money was taken out of their pockets the next morning, but I cannot say whether it was taken out by any body else, or whether they themselves delivered the money.</p>

I said he must be a rascal to say we were the two men which robbed him, for we were just come over the wall. These two men said it was their duty to take us to the guardhouse. I said you know the case as well as I do, I have left the camp and was going over the wall after a woman, as many poor fellows do to be sure.

The other prisoner joined us in winter quarters; he has behaved like any other soldier.

I went into the rear of the Queen's Regiment, which is just by the rails which go to St. George's Row, that was about eleven o'clock. We stopt there along with a girl till I heard the clock strike twelve, then the sentry were called out to the relief. We were afraid of the piquet round coming upon us. I wanted to get home to my tent. They said they would get to town to a bawdy-house they knew, and wanted me to get over the wall with them. I said I would not. They went immediately to go over the wall; I came home to my tent, left the piquet-guard should take me up. I was there when the muster was called over, that was between nine and ten o'clock, I believe.</p>

I desired him to come to his own regiment for fear he should be taken up by the picket rounds, because if they find any man out of their own lines, they take them to the guard-house. In two minutes after we parted with them, and they went over the wall. The prisoner's nose bled upon his belt.

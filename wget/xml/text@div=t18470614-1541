                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the service of the contractor for the Southwark and Vauxball Water Company. On Saturday afternoon, the 15th of May, between three and four o'clock, I saw a van coming along Bowyer-lane with a nine inch branch and a five inch outlet, iron water pipes, in it—I told the driver there was not room to go by—I was shooting a load of rub<lb></lb>bish—I saw the van coming, and took my horse's head, and I noticed these pipes in the van—Haines was sitting behind the van—as soon as he saw me he put his hand before his eyes—I had known him by our working at the same farm—there were four persons in the van—I did not take notice of the others—the van was coming form Camberwell New-road—I knew there had been a quantity of water pipes lying in that road—I did not go to where that pipe had been—I gave information to Dooley—the pipes I saw in the van were of the same description as those I saw lying in the Camberwell New-road—I am pretty well sure Cockling was the man driving the van.</p>

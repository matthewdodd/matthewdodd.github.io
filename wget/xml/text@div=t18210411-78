On the 19th of March, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to buy ribbons - I did not hear her ask for them. I observed her speaking to a young man; she was about leaving the shop, I heard her say she would not buy the ribbons unless he would agree to take them back again after they were cut off, if not approved of. I suspected her, and perceived a piece of ribbon concealed in the palm of her hand; she saw that I saw it, and immediately threw it down - I seized her arm, she was very much agitated, and drew another piece from her pocket. I afterwards found another piece near her. She begged pardon, and requested we would not send for any body. She was taken into custody. The pieces of ribbon she took from her pocket were worth 5 s. 9 d.</p>

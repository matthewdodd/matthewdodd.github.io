                  </hi>. I am a last maker, and live in Gloucester-build<lb></lb>ings, Whitecross-street. On 25th Dec., at half past 12 o'clock, I was crossing Holborn to Snow-hill—the prisoner came up to me, and laid hold of my arm—she asked me where I was going, I made her no answer, but attempted to get away, and two other women came and seized me by each of my arms and held me, while the prisoner thrust her hand in my right hand trowsers pocket, where I had a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a half crown, and two shillings—after that, they all three went away up Snow-hill—I missed my money directly they had gone three or four steps—I cried out, "You have robbed me"—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after her, and in so doing I received a blow from each of the other women, one on each side of my head, with their fists—the blows made me reel for the moment, but I kept on running after the prisoner, and cried out, "Police! police!" and the prisoner ran into the policeman's arms at the corner of Fox and Knott-court—I had been drinking, but I was not drunk, I knew what I was doing—I did not give the woman anything—I had nothing to say to her, nor did I see her till she came up—when she spoke to me I tried to get away, and the other two came and laid hold me.</p>

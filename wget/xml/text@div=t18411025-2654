                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Henry Drake, a surveyor. I was employed on Saturday night, the 9th of October, to fetch three bottles of wine from Stock bridge-terrace, Vauxhall—I was to take it down to Mr. Drake on Sunday morning—I had one bottle in each coat-pocket, and one in my hand—I was between Orchard-street and Portland-street—the prisoner came up to me, and pulled the bottle of wine out of my hand—he could not get it by pulling, and then he wrenched it out, and ran off—I called "Stop thief" and "Police"—the policeman went after him, and he was taken—I saw the broken bottle.</p>

I heard the alarm, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running in Portman-street—he ran to Portman-mews—I followed, but at the farther end of the mews I lost sight of him—in about two minutes I saw him in custody of another constable—I returned to the prosecutor in the mews, and said, "Is this the man?"—he said, "Yes"—I was present when the broken bottle was taken up by the other constable, and he had run on that side of the mews—it smelt very strong of sherry wine.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th April I took this number of the publication called the <hi rend="italic">Day</hi> down to Mr. Nosworthy—I saw him, showed it to him, and referred to the article called, "Well Served, or the Biter Bitten," and said, "You are the printer of this?"—he said, "Yes, I am," and referred to the imprint at the bottom—Mr. Greening then asked if Mr. Scott was in—Nosworthy said no, that he was out of town, and either would not be back that day, or for a few days, I am not sure which—Scott just then came in—I then called upon him to give up the name of the author—he said he must take time to consider; on which I said, "Mr. Nosworthy, will you give up the name of the author?" and he said, "No, I will not; "and I said, "Then you, as printer, must take the consequences"—I pointed out the date to him.</p>

Mr. Winch brought me a sample of saffron; as soon as I saw it, I knew it to be ours. I fetched a sample of ours, and compared them together, and they were as much alike as possible. Mr. Winch told me there were three or four pounds of musk and other things offered him. I went next morning to his house in the Hay-market; he was to get the man to bring the goods.

I went on Saturday morning to see the man that had offered them for sale; he was waiting for me. I examined the goods. I said, I shall buy them, and make very few words with you, after I have looked at them. I asked Smith, who offered them to sale, whether the goods were in time, (meaning, whether the duty was paid.) He took me up as short as could be, and said, Yes, they are of my own entry; he knew me very well. I took up the cake saffron, which was manufactured here, and not imported in that state in which it was, and said, Is that in time too? he said, Yes. I said, Do you know me? He said, he knew me very well. I said, I shall stop you and the goods; he then acknowledged that he had the goods of

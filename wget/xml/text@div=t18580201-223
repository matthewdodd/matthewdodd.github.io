From information I received, I watched the prosecutor's premises some few days, and on Monday, 18th Jan., about 2 o'clock, saw a waggon being loaded at their warehouse—I saw it leave; Paine drove it, he alone was in charge—I followed it; it went down Thames Street, as far as the Hour Glass public house, where Paine got down to obey a call of nature, got on again, and drove to the Steel Yard; he then got down again, and did something to the back of the waggon, as if he was fastening the tarpaulin; he then went to the front of the waggon, and Myland came from the front of the waggon, looked round, disappeared for about a minute, and returned with a cask of butter on his shoulder, and went into Mortimer's shop, No. 155, Thames Street—Steel Yard is about sixty or seventy yards from opposite Mortimer's shop—I went up Bush Lane, remained a few minutes, and when I came down, the waggon was gone—I looked into Mortimer's shop, but saw no one there—I communicated with one of the partners of the firm, Mr. White, who came back with me to Mortimer's shop—hewent in, came out again, and in consequence of what he said I went in with him, and he pointed out a cask of butter with a basket of herrings on it; before it was an empty cask with a piece of bacon on it—Mr. White said, "That cask of butter is my property"—I asked Mortimer if that was his name; he said, "Yes"—I told him that I was a detective police officer, and asked him how he accounted for the possession of that butter; he said, "A young man left it a short time ago, and is going to call for it in two or three</p>

I had been watching the prose<lb></lb>cutor's premises, for six weeks prior to the robbery—on 12th Jan., at 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in their warehouse, and saw Myland leave with other porters; they crossed the street, went into the Coal Exchange tavern, remained there a short time, came out, and went down St. Mary-at-Hill, and along Thames Street—Myland and another separated from the others at the steps leading on to London Bridge, and proceeded along Thames Street again to Calvert's tap house at the corner; they there waited half a minute, or perhaps a little more, and Mortimer came over to them out of his shop, and all three went into the public house—the other was a porter in the employment of the firm, named Glyde, I believe—they came out again, and Myland and Mortimer proceeded into Mortimer's shop, and the other porter followed after—they remained there ten or fifteen minutes, and then came out and went home—I took Paine on 18th Jan., between 4 and 5 o'clock, took him to the station, and searched him—afterwards, as I took him along Cannon Street to Bow Lane Station, I said, "How long has Myland been in the employ of your master?" he said, "About nine months"—I said, "Did you know him before he came to work there?" he said, "Yes, I knew him when he was a carman"—he afterwards said, "Well, it serves me right; I ought to have known better"—I afterwards went to Myland's house and took pos<lb></lb>session of certain things, which I have here.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live in Rotherfield-street, about twenty yards from Mr. Dixon's house. On the 13th of January, in consequence of information from Mr. Colson, I proceeded to Mr. Dixon's house, I found the gate open, and the door partly open as well; I went into the passage - the back parlour door was open, the side board door was open, and things strewed about - it was twelve o'clock. I looked all over the house, and found all the rooms open; I gave charge of the house to a person until Mr. Dixon arrived. About half-past eleven o'clock that morning, I had gone to the adjoining house, and heard a noise in Dixon's house, but did not suspect a robbery was going on; I heard a great noise in the house, and heard stepping, and noticed a great many people walking backwards and forwards before the house.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps a horse, and does any thing he can get to do - he is employed by a builder. On the 13th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was right opposite Mr. Dixon's door, sweeping a crossing, and saw three men standing about twenty yards from Mr. Dixon's house; I saw Short go up to the gate, and tap with his umbrella - he did not find any body come; I am sure he is the man - he walked up the street, and did not take any notice, then Godfrey went to the gate and just touched it; he put his hand towards the key-hole, and the gate went open; it is a low iron gate - Short had a long brown coat on, with pockets at the side; it seemed to fit him very well - I saw him go and put his hand to the key-hole of the door; the door went open, and he went in - he left the door rather ajar; Short was walking up and down the street - I did not see the third man at this time; I was on the right-hand side of the way, opposite Mr. Dixon's house - I looked at him; I am sure Godfrey is the man who went into the house - I stopped there till Mr. Colson came out; I saw Godfrey come out, and he had a red and white handkerchief up to his face, as if he was crying: he and Short went on together towards Hoxton - he left the street door and garden gate open; Colson spoke to me - I recollect Mr. Smith coming up; I attended at the Police-office on the Tuesday afterwards - I went to Dartford, in Kent, with the men afterwards; they took me there in a horse and cart - I should know them again if they had the same dresses on; I slept at Dartford that night, in a barn - the two men slept in the barn with me; that was on the Sunday, a week after the robbery - I was there three nights, and slept always in the barn; I left Dartford on Thursday morning - I was not at all pleased at being taken and kept there; the two men had gone out, and I took the opportunity of coming away, and walked home - I came to Islington, and went to my father's house - he lives in Shepperton cottages, in a house which is partly finished; I did not know where the men were going to take me to; Godfrey had a blue coat on - the third man had a long brown coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to Dartford against your will? A. Yes; I never left my father's house before without his knowledge; Collier, the Policeman, gave me half a pint of beer at the first examination, that was all - I was quite sober; I never told any body that I had ale and rum given to me - I did not tell my father so, nor that the Policeman told me to swear to the men; my father was about twenty yards off when I saw the men - I was at the Painted Red-lion, Islington, where a gentleman gave me half a pint of beer with the Policeman; I went to several public houses to look for the men - I went to a public-house by the church; Brown, the beadle, gave me about a spoonful of beer there - I had nothing else; I am thirteen years old - I did not tell my father the Policeman told me, if I was asked the meaning of an oath, to say I should go to bell when I died; I do not know that I told him so, I forget - it was true, if I told him so, I think I did tell him; I remember it now - I never said the Policeman told me to say I was thirteen years old, nor to be sure to swear to the men - the Policeman only said, "Are these the men," I said Yes; I told my father the Policeman told me to mind to state they were the men, not that they desired me to swear to them - I was never charged with stealing; the Policeman did not tell me to say I should go to bell if I told a lie - I do not know why I told my father so; it was an untruth.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you described the men to the officer? A. Yes; I shall be thirteen years old in March.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at Hatton-garden? A.

             and his boy; all three went into the cottage - I saw them come out all together; I gave Collier information about the men, and went about with him for the purpose of finding them; I was not present when they were taken - I went to the King's Head, looked into the tap-room, came out and told him the men were in the room, the very men I had seen go into the house; I did not see the prisoners, when they were taken, not till they were at Hatton-garden, but never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? A. I never saw their faces till they were at Hatton-garden - I know the faces of the men I saw go into the house, and could swear to them at this moment, if I saw them: they were all dressed like gentlemen - I never knew where the prisoners lived; I never gave the officers information where to find them - I never said they were the men; I swear that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You looked in at the King's Head? A. Yes; there were twenty or thirty persons there, two in flannel jackets sat by the side of one another - I never saw the prisoners there; the persons I had seen were there - there is a back door to the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were the two men who really had been to the prosecutor's, acquaintances of yours? A. Not at all; I only knew them by sight.</p>

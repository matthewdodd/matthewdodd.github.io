            . I am the wife of Francis Pratt. I was in the back room, about half-past eight o'clock-there was a knock at the door, I opened it-the prisoner stood about a yard off. I asked him if he knocked at my door? he said, No. I shut it, and heard nothing more till about nine o'clock, I then heard a piece of glass fall, and called my husband down. I had seen the window at eight o'clock-every thing was safe then; there was no glass broken before my husband went out. We missed five pair and an odd shoe (all new) from the window, close by where the glass was broken; they were under it. There was room enough for a person to put his hand in and reach them out.</p>

            . I went with my master, and overtook the prisoner with the shoes in his apron. I saw him throw them down, I picked them up, and put them on the table in a public-house, in care of my master, while I went to get an officer. I returned in five minutes, and found them again. Two pair are of my manufacturing.</p>

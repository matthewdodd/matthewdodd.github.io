On the 15th of October the prisoner came and asked for 1d. worth of bread and cheese, and then asked for 2d. worth - he said he was in a great hurry, and gave me a half-crown- I said I had not change for more than a shilling, and gave the half-crown to Yeoman to get change; while she was gone the prisoner wasin a great hurry, and asked me for the shilling which I had in my hand; he said he had a friend waiting, he would take the shilling, and call in a quarter of an hour for the rest of the change; I gave him the shilling, and he went away - Yeoman came in directly, and returned me the half-crown; I went round to Burton's winevaults, which is about two hundred yards off, and found him drinking there - I showed him the half-crown, and told him it was bad; he asked me to walk out with him - he took it in his hand, looked at it, and said it might be his or not; I asked him for my shilling - he took it out of his pocket, and I took it out of his hand; I told him to pay me for the bread and cheese, or I would apprehend him - he said he could not do that, for he had no money; I got hold of his hand, and took the half-crown out of it; the tried to get away - I followed him towards Giltspur-street, and stopped him in Bartholomew-close; I gave the officer the same half-crown - as nothing was found on him, my husband thought it best to discharge him.</p>
               <p>MARY YEOMAN. I was charing at Burridge's, and she gave me the half-crown; I could not get it changed, and returned it to her.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS GITTINS. I am a street-keeper, and was present when the prisoner was stopped; Burridge gave me the half-crown, which I marked, and now produce - I found nothing on him, and let him go.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ROBERTS. I keep the Queen's Head public-house, Whitecross-street. On the 11th of November the prisoner came in with another man and a female, and called for a quartern of gin, which came to 4d.; the prisoner gave me a crown-piece - they began to drink the gin, but I discovered the crown was bad, and would not allow them to finish it; I told them it was bad - they began to abuse me, and said it was not bad, and that they were in the habit of taking more money than me - I sent for an officer, and they were secured; they had said they had no more money, but the officer found halfpence enough among them to pay for the gin - I kept the crown-piece, marked it, and delivered it to Howard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take it out of your pocket? A. No, it never went out of my hand.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOWARD. I took the prisoner in charge, and received this crown-piece from Roberts; I found no money on the prisoner, but 1l. 0s. 6 1/2d. in good money on the other man.</p>

               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. This crown-piece is counterfeit, and the half-crown also.</p>

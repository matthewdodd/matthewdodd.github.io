            . I live in Queen-street, and am a dealer in earthenware. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 19th of September, I met the prisoner and another person on Snow-street - he was attempting to pick a gentleman's pocket. I followed him to <placeName id="t18251027-201-crimeloc1164">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I have to state, for the information of your Lordship, that the prosecutor makes a practice of trepanning young men, for the purpose of getting the expenses of the Court; he has no less than five or six young lads in custody these Sessions, and has no owners to a part of the property. I am innocent of the felony; the prosecutor was five or six minutes previous to his coming up to me, and, consequently, must have lost sight of me; even had I been the person he was in pursuit of.</p>

               <p>ROBERT FAIRBURN. I met the prisoner at the top of Bond-street on the 21st of December, between nine and ten in the evening; she wished me to go with her and give her something to drink. I went to her lodgings in <placeName id="t18080113-73-crimeloc447">John-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18080113-73-crimeloc447" type="placeName" value="John-street"></interp>

I did not at the present moment make any resistance by taking it from her, she told me she took it to look at; I then remained in the room without taking particular notice what she had done with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. I was perfectly sober. While I was looking at a picture that was in a corner of the room, Cannon came into the room; I afterwards asked for my watch; Werrelley denied having seen it, nor had she taken it; I then said if she would not deliver it up to me I would call the watch; I asked Cannon if she had not got it from her, she denied having it. I went down stairs and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Werrelley's Defence. He gave me the watch into my hand, he did not give me any money; I put it in a proper place; as I was in the habits of bringing different company home. The gentleman asked me for the watch several times; I did not return it him, as he had not gave me any money; I put the watch by until such time as he should please to call to give me some money. At the watchhouse I sent this woman to give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How was this, is it true that you gave her no money. - A. I gave her a shilling to get something to drink, and I gave her a shilling besides.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence. She did not like to be in the watchhouse; she told me to go home and get the watch.</p>
               <p>BOTH, <rs id="t18080113-73-verdict448" type="verdictDescription">

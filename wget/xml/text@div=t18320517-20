(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>London, 12th of March, 1830, No, 47, Lower Thomes Street.</p>
               <p>To Mr. COHU, Guernsey. - Dear Sir, I still wait the return of the 50l. bill; I have not heard from Thomas and Son - I intended to have sent you to-day a statement of account, by which you would have seen how we stand, but I have left so little time I have not time to write; I have been a good deal mortifield by a call from Mr. Hall's clerk, by a letter from you - the anxiety under which it seems to have been written, they could not fail to understand - the emotion I felt at the time I endeavoured to conceal; confide your interest to me, you will never be betrayed. [Then followed an account of goods.] I am in advance now: these heavy bills cause me great uneasiness - I have been obliged to take Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person427">Freeman</persName>
            's acceptance for his supplies, which I enclose you; this young man is sole owner of the Edward, 150 tons - of course there can be no doubt; it is also to be proved by the Custom-house register - he is a particularly honorable young man, and the bill is unquestionable, but not being payable at a banker's, I could not well discount it here; it is at three months' date; for the pipe of wine I took of him I am to allow him 40l. - I shall ship it for you, per Mary- you had better draw on me for the amount, and remit the proceeds to me: get the enclosed bill on Freeman cashed, and remit the proceeds, to enable me to meet the bills coming due.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In what business was the prisoner your agent? A. For the sale of biscuit and flour; he allowed me to draw on him, and I have done it repeatedly - he was not my agent for the purpose of getting bills discounted; I was at Guernsey in December, 1829, and March, 1830 - (thirteen letters and documents were here handed to the witness, who deposed that those marked A to G inclusive, and one marked with a (*) were written by his authority, by a person in his employ, and those marked H to O were his own hand-writing.) I have known Mr. Freeman since I came to England, but not before; I do not know his handwriting - I came to England the beginning of February this year; the prisoner has frequently accepted bills for me - I believe he has accepted some accommodation bills but am not positive, for we did not balance accounts till the 28th of June, 1830, and I did not know how we stood.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you received acceptances from him in blank, and filled them up at your own discretion? A. Yes, once, I believe, and it was only one bill, I believe; I do not think I have had more than one blank acceptance - it accommodated me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170035"></xptr>Q. Did you fill up one of those blank acceptances for 500l.? A.Perhaps I might, but not more than one, to the best of my recollection; I cannot recollect the amount- I acknowledge to have filled up blanks; I cannot tell whether it was one or more. I am a native of Gnernsey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say "blanks?" A. I do not understand English well - I may have filled up more than one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. To what amount may you have had transactions with the prisoner? A. About 1400l. -I recollect filling up one blank, and think that was the latter end of 1829; I cannot tell to what amount I had then had dealings with him - he continued to be my agent till I received this bill; he received no more goods from me after that, but he had goods in hand for sale - he had written to say he could not get my price for them - I was in London in June, 1830, and we settled accounts - (looking at an account) this is in Chalmers' hand-writing; this was made out after I had received the bill of exchange - I discounted the bill he sent to me, it was in Mr. Hutchinson's hands - he did not discount it for me; I took it up before this account was made out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the settlement of accounts, by which it appears the prisoner owed you 60l., was made after you had taken up this bill? A. Yes - I arrested the prisoner for debt on the 29th of February last; I arrested him as the drawer of the bill of 131l. 18s. - I had seen Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person428">Freeman</persName>
             then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before that talked to Chalmers of your intention to arrest Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person429">Freeman</persName>
            ? A. I had not seen Chalmers, to the best of my recollection - not before I arrested him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you applied to him concerning giving evidence against Freeman, the acceptor of the bill? A. I had by letter; I must have known in January that Captain Freeman was in England.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you applied to the prisoner to be a witness on Freeman's bill? A. Not to be a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on this business? A. Not at all; I wrote her two notes after I arrested the prisoner - I was waiting in the public-house in Mansel-street, close to where Mrs. Chalmers lived; I also wrote to Mr. Vie on the subject; I called on him on the day I made the deposition at the Mansion-house about this forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did Chalmers arrest you? A. Yes, for 50l. and upwards - I brought forward the charge of forgery before he arrested me; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person430">Freeman</persName>
             had made a charge - I appeared at the Mansion-house, and preferred a charge of forgery against him on the 2nd of March; I was there more than once - I cannot recollect when I signed my deposition; this is my deposition (looking at it) - it is dated the 22nd of March; I think I was arrested at the prisoner's suit on the 6th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Both actions are still going on? A.Nothing has been done since; here is a memorandum in my own handwriting - it is an abstract of the correspondence; this pencil memorandum is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is it true, as you have written here, that you arrested Chalmers on the 29th of February? A. The 26th of February, I believe; I was arrested on the 6th of March - when I stated my intention to appear at the Mansion-house the prisoner said he would surrender himself, and did so, and I stated the case; that was after he had arrested me - he appeared at the Mansion-house, and the Lord Mayor allowed bail.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The Lord Mayor committed him, I believe, on the charge of forgery? A. Yes - he afterwards got bail before one of the Judges; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person431">Freeman</persName>
             had not returned from abroad at the time I settled accounts with the prisoner, and I had no means of knowing whether the acceptance was genuine or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let us have this clear - had the prisoner arrested you before you took him to the Mansion-house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said he did? A. Yes, sir, yes; I appeared at the Mansion-house on the 2nd of March - the prisoner was not there then; I was arrested on the 6th of March; I made no deposition on the 2nd of March, but on the 22nd he appeared at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Sixteen days before you made your deposition against him, he arrested you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WHITEMAN FREEMAN. I am captain and owner of the Edward Lombe. About the middle of February, 1830, the prisoner supplied me with biscuits - he supplied me as a principal; I knew nothing about the agency - I left on the 10th of March; (looking at the bill) this acceptance is not my hand-writing, nor did I authorize any body to sign it for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You purchased biscuits? A.Biscuits and flour, to the amount of 111l., I think; we had a written agreement, which my attorney has - this is the agreement on one side of this paper (looking at it), and the other is the bill; I was going to the Swan River - the agreement is my writing, but it is signed by Chalmers; I paid for all the provisions, except 24l., which was left unpaid when I sailed - I paid other tradesmen part of their bills, and they were willing to wait for the remainder till my return; I wanted money to trade with - the prisoner took a pipe of wine at 50l. in part payment, as the agreement states; that was my inducement to purchase of him; I believe he tasted the wine before he signed the agreement - I gave him the choice of four or five pipes, which were in the London-docks, in bond; he stated which he would take, and I gave him an order, to transfer it to him - he never complained to me of its not being worth half the money; he wanted me to take something off, as he could not sell it for what he agreed to give for it - (looking at a letter, dated the 9th of March) this is my writing; I have offered the 24l. to the prisoner, but he would not accept it - that was after he was in Newgate; the solicitor said it was proper, and requested me to go with him to Newgate, which I did; Mr. Cohu did not threaten to arrest me - a man, named Field, came and threatened to arrest me; I suppose he was Cohu's servant - he now fills the situation the prisoner formerly did; I did not see the bill in Field's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear Field never presented the bill to you, and you requested proceedings might not he taken against you? A. I did not request any thing of the kind - Field threatened to arrest me; I said, "You may do as you please, I will never pay a bill I have nothing to do with" - I had seen the bill before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you promised to remit the prisoner your balance from the Cape of Good Hope? A. I do not remember -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170036"></xptr>it is eighteen months ago; I may have written him to that effect - when I got to sea I pasted all my bills and papers together; I never saw the prisoner after I left London -I was in London or at Gravesend on the 1st of March, 1830.</p>
               <p>Q. When applied to for payment of the bill, was not your observation, "I thought all my bills were paid?" A. I do not remember making that observation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any knowledge, when you went out on the 10th of March, 1830, of any bill on you drawn by Chalmers for 131l. 18s.? A. I had not; I had given no such bill - it is not my hand-writing; I know two gentlemen named Alexander Lewis and William Way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Lord Mayor once or twice? A. Twice; three weeks, perhaps, elapsed between the first and second time - I signed a deposition the first time that I went; this is my deposition; it is dated the 22nd of March - I do not remember signing any other; I read a paper the first time, and signed it; it was merely to state that was not my signature - the prisoner was present the second time that I was before the Lord Mayor, not the first; all I swore the first time was, that it was not my signature - I do not think the prisoner was there the first time, I am not sure; I do not know whether he attended voluntarily before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at it again; do you mean to say it is not in any respect like his writing? A. It is like it in some few respects, but in material parts it varies very much - the W and h are not joined; the t is not turned at the bottom, as he does; the formation of the W varies very much from his; he always turns his t's at the bottom, which I have seen - the name Freeman is very unlike his all the way through - the letter F is in some little respect like his, but the reeman is not at all- (looking at the letter marked 1.) this signature is in all respects like Captain

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the t in this letter turned as Captain Freeman generally turns his letters? A. Yes; it is not turned at all in the bill - I have seen him write a great many times.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the General Post-office, London. This letter has been put into the London Post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Can you tell whether it was put in at the head office, or at any other? A. This was put in at the chief office - it was a paid letter put in after seven o'clock; at the chief office, I can tell that - (Bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, I feel so oppressed with my present situation I cannot collect my thoughts to address you properly. This proceeding is sanctioned by law it is quite clear, but whether it be a speculation on the feelings of a warm hearted female, to procure the payment of a certain sum, or a just prosecution to satisfy offended laws, it will be for you to say when you hear certain documents and letters read to you - I shall not say a single word of reproach to the prosecutor; his letters will show what his proceedings have been. I supplied Captain Freeman with biscuits and flour about this time two years; there was an express agreement that he should pay me cash; the goods were sold at a very low cash price; he requested me to take a pipe of wine in part payment - I held out to him that I would, acting as agent for a person at Guernsey - I sold the goods at the price I did, on condition that I should receive cash; I told him clearly that my correspondent was a very needy man, and was drawing on me at very short dates, and nothing but cash would answer our purpose, but if it would accommodate him, I would take one pipe of wine; the goods were delivered on these terms; he pressed very much to have them on board, saying his passengers were harrassing him with having no provisions on board - I sent them; and in the mean time had no opportunity of seeing the wine - I had orders to taste it, but at the time there was a very severe snow storm - I applied to several brokers to taste the wine, but they said in that weather they could give no opinion of it; and when I did taste it, the best pipe the broker represented not worth 35l. - I stated this to Mr. Freeman, who said I could have my choice, and that the pipe No. 4 was certainly the best, but I found that the highest value it was stated at was 35l. - I got an order for the transfer, and found somebody had got it transferred to them, and were to have paid cash for it; I found what was left was not worth half the money; in the mean time I endeavoured to get money from him, as drafts were coming due on me every day; on one occasion I got 12l. 10s. out of him, that is all I ever got before he left London - he then said, "I have a great many small debts to pay, I know you will take no proceedings against me till I get to Plymouth - I have a good many passengers to take in there, and will remit you the money from Plymouth, and charge the wine at a fair price;" I agreed to take no proceedings- he sailed: week after week passed, and I heard nothing from him; I began to fear he would sail, as I had been served by captains before - I then looked at the account in a very different light, as it was to have been paid in cash down; I drew out in my mind what the account was between us, by the time he might return to this country from the Swan River, and for the enormous risk of the debt I added a fair per centage; it is usual in the East India trade to charge about 30 percent. - I made this addition, deducted what I had received, and setting the pipe of wine as a collateral security, I drew out a bill, which, in my own mind, is nothing more than an accommodation bill;" I drew for 130l. which I sent down to Plymouth, with a few hurried lines, saying, if he had not sent the money for the goods, to send the bill back accepted, as I wanted money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170037"></xptr>I addressed it, according to the best of my recollection, to Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person436">Freeman</persName>
            , at Plymouth; the bill came back to me in a few days accepted; as I understood by him, enclosed in an envelope, merely saying, "Enclosed you have the bill," with nothing but initials to it; I shall be able to prove the receipt of that letter, most luckily for me - I may call it the salvation of me; I can bring a person who saw me take the bill out of the letter, and the observation I made at the time - the prosecutor's evidence shows I did not endeavour to use the bill, as I remitted it to him; he immediately got it discounted for the purpose of remitting me a banker's bill for the amount, and did I apply that to my own purposes? No, in no shape whatever - he had at that time bills running on me for about 600l. more than the almost goods I had in my possession - they did not exceed 150l. and there were acceptances of mine out to about 800l. - he had clearly overdrawn me 600l.; two bills came due about the third week in March, which were endorsed to his brother for his accommodation - these he was particularly anxious about; they amounted to 146l. - the amount he remitted me for Freeman's bill I applied to the purpose of those bills, so that in no shape whatever did I derive any benefit from it. If it is attempted to be shown that subsequently I might have endeavoured to take advantage of this, I can prove I could have contemplated no such thing, for there were bills coming due about the end of March - so far from my wishing to inveigle him to send me more goods, he not having sent me money to take up bills, I returned them back to him; it will be seen by my letters, that I advised him to send goods to other persons and not to me at all. Wheatley and Chapman held his bills to the amount of 100l., and I wrote to him to send them goods to satisfy them - I wished to have no more of his goods in my possession; it will be seen by the correspondence that after that bill was due he continued drawing and begging me to accept, and he would be sure to send goods, which he completely failed to do - one point I wish to refer to is, that a person named Field has been an active agent in this business; Cohu became acquainted with him in his journey from Guernsey - he had been requested to look out for Freeman's arrival; now Field did call, and I expected him here as a witness on their part; Field did call at Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person437">Freeman</persName>
            's lodging, and said he called respecting this bill, stating the name, the sum, and what it was for; Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person438">Freeman</persName>
             then said he thought he had paid that bill, or some such observation, but he would see to it, and desired no proceedings might be taken in the meantime - Field says he called about ten days afterwards, and though he knew in whose hands the bill was, he had made no endeavour to see it, but said he should like to see the bill - he asked Field to go to the house where it was; they went as far as Bishopsgate church - Freeman then said, "I have an appointment, call at my lodgings in half an hour, and I will go with you," and when he called he had gone away in the meantime - on seeing Field he said,"I have seen the bill; do you know where Chalmers is?" Field said, "Yes, he is on the continent" - he said, "Do you know any thing of the transaction between us?" Field said No, and then Freeman said it was not his hand-writing; how the signature became attached to the bill I do not know - I will prove how it came into my possession; it is certainly strange that Mr. Freeman should let ten days go by without endeavouring to see the bill; it is not the character of seamen generally - one would have supposed, while he was sailing across the line, he had time to recollect what obligations he had to meet, and it is singular he should pretend to go with the man about the bill, and get rid of him in the manner he did -Again, Mr. Cohu, when he came to London, instead of calling on me in a gentlemanly kind of manner, he sent Field to state he would take proceedings - I appointed with Field that we should meet next day, the account should be arranged, and I would render him any assistance I could in recovering the amount due to him by Freeman; as to hostile proceedings against me I defied him in every way - I was ready to meet him like a man of honour; instead of keeping the appointment, at eight o'clock next morning I had the pleasure of receiving a sheriff's officer, with a writ; our appointment was at eleven - this object appeared to me to be that the arrest should take place in presence of my wife, (who, it was well known, was within five days of child-bearing,) and to obtain the money through her friends, or he could have arrested me just as well at the Angel, at Islington, where we were to have met - while I was waiting for bail Cohu and Field called at the lockup-house, and stated to the officer that they had the copy of an affidavit, which Captain 
               <persName id="t18320517-20-person439">Freeman</persName>
             was about to swear at the Mansion-house that day; their object, I presume, was that while my mind was irritated I might pay the bill- my father-in-law being out of town it was two days before I got bail; Cohu, well-knowing the condition of my wife, went there with Field to endeavour to gain entrance into her chamber, but was prevented by the nurse; he went to a public-house next door, and wrote two notes to convey to her mind that I was there on a charge of forgery - the object was to get her to write to her father to pay the bill; being foiled he wrote himself, but got no satisfaction - after I got out I called at Cohu's lodgings, having looked into the accounts, for I was so harrassed with his business that I declare for two years I did not know how affairs stood between us, whether I owed him money or he me - he had drawn on me to the extent of nearly 4000l. in one year, and the utmost amount of goods sold was not above 1100l. - his letter will show he was to allow me a per centage for all bills drawn previous to sending goods; I found I had omitted to charge the commission altogether, which, with payments made, instead of my owing him money, I found a balance considerably in my favour; I have shown the account to several intelligent people, who are satisfied that money is due to me; I called, and told him there was a balance of 50l. due to me, and that on condition of his giving me satisfaction for bonds I had given at the Custom-house for shipping his goods, I would immediately give him his accounts, and strike a balance; but with respect to the charge of forgery I would go to the Mansion-house and wait from twelve till two o'clock, if he chose to come forward - I did so, and three days after that, I arrested him - at least a fortnight after that the charge of forgery was again brought forward; I heard of their intention, called at the Mansion-house, and told Mr. Cope I was ready to meet any charge they had - I called again, and stated the same thing; they said the party had applied, but they had no warrant, and did not like to take a person without; they very soon appeared, the charge was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170038"></xptr>gone into; I was afterwards bailed by Lord Tenterden, and surrendered here last Saturday: I have now given as distinct an account as I can of the transaction - I will now make a few observations on the character of the parties; there is such a thing in law, I believe, as presumptive evidence; the presumption in this case in certainly all the other way - it is quite clear I had no inducement to send him a forged bill - the whole nature of the transaction falsifies it completely; he was always on the obliged side; if you find me guilty, you must have arrived at the conclusion that I committed this act for the purpose of injuring myself, without benefit: when my father-in-law came to bail me, he in the most delicate manner said, "If you have any difficulty in showing how you received the bill, let me take it up at once, and have no more about it;" but I felt I was innocent of the charge, and would brave it - the prosecutor is a man I have done more for than any man in the world.</p>

               <p>The following letters and documents, as referred to in the evidence, were then read.</p>
               <p>(I.) Plymouth, March 9, 1830.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - It is with the greatest regret that I am compelled to inform you that in consequence of three cabin and one steerage passenger, who had engaged a passage (from this place to Swan River in my ship), having broken their engagements, I have been disappointed in receiving near 200l., and am therefore not able to fulfil my engagement with you; I will remit the balance of your account from the Cape, with six months interest, and will take off 5l. from the price agreed for the wine; I hope you will give me the credit of wishing to do what I promised; if you know any one connected with any one here, you can refer to Mr. Pearce, my agent here, for the truth of what I have stated relative to the passengers. Hoping you will not think ill of me for this unforseen circumstance, and promising that on a future voyage, I shall make a point of returning your civility. I am, Dear Sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The agreement referred to contained particulars of the biscuits and floor to be supplied, making a total of 100l. 2s., at the foot of which was the following memorandum, "The above to he paid for as follows: by pipe of Madeira wine 50l., the remainder to be paid in cash on delivery.

Sir, I have received news of the cargo of corn that I have ordered from Dantzic; by the next post, I shall have the invoice; in consequence, I propose to draw on you, according to my proposal some time ago to you, with your kind grant, though advising me to be cautious, which I am most certainly; so that I shall not value on you for more than about 500l. sterling, payable at about two or near three months, when the corn comes down; so that if you have not received goods from me, to meet these bills, let me know, that we may so arrange it as to meet those bills in due time. Sir, if the bills you receive from purchasers would not be due in time to meet the necessary bills, if you have them discounted, I have no objection to give you full satisfaction for that - so that you may rest assured of finding me a faithful friend.

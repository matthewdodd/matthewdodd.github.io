                  </hi> (Policeman 117 E). I was employed to watch the post office at 26, Oxford Street, from the Friday preceding the 11th September—I was watching on the 11th September, at about half-past five in the morning, and saw the prisoner picking up straws—he then went to the post office, turned his back to the aperture of the receiving-box, looked up and down the street for half a minute, and then turned towards the slit in a stooping position, when I immediately saw smoke arise as if from matches—I saw something white in his hand, and saw him place it in the box—I quietly crossed the street—he ran away as soon as he saw me—I followed him 300 yards, and caught him at Regent Circus—I charged him with at<lb></lb>tempting to set fire to the post office—he said, "Not me"—he had some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170044"></xptr>
               <p>straws in his left hand at the time—I took him to the station and found these two stones and some paper and straw on him—I then went to the post office, and found in the box these six matches, three burnt and three not burnt, this paper, and I should guess over twenty letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Cooper, who keeps a chemist's shop and post office at 26, Oxford Street—for six or eight mornings prior to 11th September I found straws, firewood, matches, shavings chips, and paper in the letter-box, and on two occasions matches—I was not there on the 11th September, but I afterwards found a mark as if a match had been lighted—there were letters in the box on each occasion—nothing could be put in from the inside, as the box was locked—we had large quantities of turpentine, spirits of wine, and perfumes near the box, and if the window had caught fire it would have been blown out—there was only half an inch of deal between the letters and the spirits of wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the gaol of Newgate, and have seen the prisoner there daily—my opinion is that he is not of sound mind—he has been in the habit for some time past of picking up straws, orange peel, stones, and other things in the street, in which he believed he saw the image of his father, who is dead, and that by placing them in the letter-box he communicated with his father and exercised some influence over his friends—I derived that from my conversation with him—he picked up a few things in the gaol, in which he said he saw the image of his father, and said that he was more bound by that than by human law—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a certificate from a lunatic asylum where he was confined as a dangerous lunatic in 1864.</p>

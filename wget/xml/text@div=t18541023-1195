                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Westcott, a chandler, in Cross-street, Old Kent-road. On 16th Oct. the prisoner came, about half past 9 o'clock in the evening, for a halfpennyworth of tobacco—I served him; he gave me a sixpence—I tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—the prisoner asked for his change; I told him it was a bad sixpence—he put his hand out for it, and he had a halfpenny to give me in his hand—I told him I should not give him the bad sixpence, I should keep it—he went out, and I went out and followed him to another shop—I waited out<lb></lb>side, and heard him ask for a halfpennyworth of apples—the man said he had got none—he then asked for a halfpennyworth of sherbet; he then saw me looking through the window, land ran out—I seized him, and took him by the collar into the shop—he began to cry, and threw down a handful of sixpences—I took them up, and gave them to a stranger in the shop—I went for a policeman—I saw the stranger give some sixpences to the police<lb></lb>man, in my presence—the bad sixpence that the prisoner passed to me I gave to the officer—it was not above five minutes from the tune he left my shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop, in the Old Kent-road. On 16th Oct. the prisoner came and asked for a halfpennyworth of apples—I had not any, and he asked for a halfpenny worth of sherbet—as I was going to serve him, Mrs. Westcott came in, and said the prisoner had got bad money; and he dropped the money out of his left hand, where some wood was lying—Mrs. Westcott took up the same money that dropped from his hand, and placed it in a man's hand who was standing by the right of me, while I had got the prisoner by the collar—I saw the man's hand after he had got the money, and I can swear he never took his hand off the counter till the policeman came, and he gave the policeman what he had in his hand.</p>

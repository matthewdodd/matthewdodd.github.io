                  </hi>. I keep the Green Bell public-house, Billingsgate, About half-past five o'clock the prisoner came into the house with some others, and asked for some coffee, which I served them with—I saw some<lb></lb>thing going on which I thought was not right—I asked them to come out of the house—after the prisoner got up, one of these pots fell from his coat—I collared him, and we found three more pots up in the corner where he was sitting—two of them were flattened, which were mine—they were not flattened before—the one which fell from his coat was flattened, and an<lb></lb>other which was in a bag behind him—three more were claimed by Mr. Bruce—there were two more persons, who, I believe, came in with him.</p>

                  </hi>. These three pots are mine—they could not get to Partridge's house without being stolen—the prisoner and two others were together at my house at four o'clock that morning, and the prisoner was carrying a bag like that produced.</p>

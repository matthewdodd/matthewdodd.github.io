When we had got to the four-mile stone, we were met by three men, about half after six in the evening, about a quarter of a mile from the four-mile stone. The prisoner took hold of the horse by the reins, and stopped him; they desired my husband to stop, and called him a bloody b - gg - n, and told him to stop, or they would blow his brains out. The other came up with a pistol to the cart, and called my husband a bloody b - gg - n again, and insisted on his money; and my husband said, Gentlemen, have mercy on me; do not hurt me; do not take my life. I have but a little money; I am a poor man; but what little I have I will give you. He gave them what money he had, which was about three or four shillings, I will not be positive; and the man with the pistol came up again, and said, d - mn him, he has got more; he told him he had not; then he said he would blow his brains out. I sat in the body of the cart, and saw nothing but the pistol; I cannot say who that man was. The prisoner, Carty, let go the reins of the horse and he and another came up, and they knocked my husband off the shafts: he got up again, and they knocked him down again. His son being asleep at the tail of the cart, covered over, with the noise he awoke; he jumped up, and asked what all that noise was; and he went to jump out at the tail of the cart, and his smock-frock catched upon something; and the two men came up to the tail of the cart, and he had a tussel with them; and my son seeing a gentleman coming on horse-back, he called for assistance, and there came up two gentlemen immediately to assist; upon their coming up, I got out of the cart, and went to my husband, but which way I got out, I cannot be sure; he asked for a handkerchief as plain as I could understand him. He was laying in the road, and I gave him one to wipe his face. I stood by the side of my husband, and held the horses, while the gentlemen assisted my son. My son never let Carty go out of his hands. Then they secured Carty, and the others jumped over the hedge, and run away. Carty never was out of my sight, till he was secured. We took my husband home in the cart to Enfield.</p>

I left the prisoner in custody of Mr. Franklin and young Williams, and got on my horse, and rode after the other: after going as far as I thought he could have got, I came back again: he had gone another way; on my coming back, he had been troublesome to Franklin and Williams; I took the reins of the horse, and tied him, and bound his hands. I searched him, and found on him 1 s. and one penny in money; I then sent for a lanthorn to see for the weapons, and while that was coming, I put old Williams in the cart the cart went off, and I saw no more of them that night. I cannot swear to the man.</p>

               <p>I am a farmer's-man. I met the prisoner and his partner, about a quarter after six, twice on the Edgware road. It was about a quarter after six the first time; the other men bid me good night twice, and the prisoner asked me what it was o'clock; I told him a quarter after six; he said he knew it as well as me; I went home, and went out again to meet my son; and I heard a cry, as I thought, from a woman and a man; and I went down, and I found Mr. Williams being on the ground bleeding. I found Mr. Franklin had the man in custody; the son and I helped to put Williams in the cart, with violence; I asked me severil questions; and I could not get a word out of his mouth. I went to the place on the Sunday morning early, to look for some instruments, and found this knife in the ditch, where the scuffle was, stuck in the rushes with some trifling blood on the point of it.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon at Hendon. I was called in to this poor man on Saturday night, the 3d of this month, between the hours of eight and nine. I found him sitting by the fire, his wife supporting him; he had received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140029"></xptr>a wound upon the cheek, just below what anatomists called the zygomatic process, which forms part of the cheek-bone. He was not then quite insensible; he wanted very much to be put to bed, making use of the term, Let me go to bed by all means. I understood he had lost a large quantity of blood, and I apprehended the situation I had found him in, might proceed from that loss of blood, and the extreme coldness of the weather, and the place he was in.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean his apparent weakness and lowness? - Yes, Sir; the weather was very cold, and the place where he was dreadfully cold; I was told the wound had been inflicted by a sharp instrument, of which it had the appearance; I dressed the wound, and desired him to be put to bed, and kept warm; I then left him for that night. I was prevented from seeing him so early the next morning as I wished, by being called to examine the head of the prisoner. I went to him at twelve o'clock; when I came there, I was given to understand he had been in a state of insensibility for the greatest part of the night, and found him nearly in a similar state; a tumour had formed considerably above the wound, which, on pressing, seemed to give pain, and occasioned him to raise his hand to the part; from this circumstance, and the symptoms which accompanied, I judged the scull or brain, or perhaps both had sustained an injury. I thought perhaps an operation might be necessary; but the place where he was not being convenient, I went to Mr. Bond, who ordered the governors of the work-house to fit up the best room for him, and to send a cart for him, and a bed and bedding. I purposed visiting him again as soon as he was removed to the work-house; I waited some time, expecting information that he was arrived at the work-house, but not hearing any thing, I went down to the place between seven and eight, where I had first found him; on my going there, I found his friends averse to his being moved; I found the symptoms much increased; judging it necessary, I made a longituninal incision, to come at the state of the case as near as I could, on the tumour; from this I learned that the skull was perforated: I learned sufficiently to make me pretty sure that was the case. I informed the friends there appeared but one thing, and that afforded but little hope, and that I would go down and consult Mr. Bond on the matter, and return again; Mr. Bond and myself agreed it would be right to have a consultation; and in consequence, a messenger on horseback was dispatched to Mr. Goodwin, an eminent surgeon of Hampstead, requesting his advice and assistance; he declined coming on account of the hour of the night, and thinking it an improper time to undertake any business of that kind; but being rather of a different opinion, and thinking no time should be lost, I formed the resolution of going down, and if I thought it necessary, on inspecting the scalp, to trepan the man. I returned again between ten an eleven, and found the man considerably worse, and I found the friends in general unanimous that it should not be done, as I offered them but little reason to suppose it would be effectual; I represented to them, that in the state he was, die he must; but suggested it to be necessary to trepan him, though I could afford them but little reason to suppose it would be of service; the consequence was, that when they declined it, I left the man without performing the operation. I saw him on the following morning; he was then moved down to a better appartment, and had a comfortable bed; he was considerably worse, and had all the appearance of a dying man. I did not see him again till after his decease; he died that night at eleven o'clock. After he was dead, I removed the scalp, and made some perforations near the part where the injury had been received.</p>
               <p>What did you find? - I found the wound of the skull connected with the external wound of the face; the instrument had passed through the arch formed by the zygomatic hypothesis, or process, and entered the skull about three inches above, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140030"></xptr>an oblique direction, about two inches and a half from the external wound; it had passed under the arch of bones called the rise of the cheek, and entered the skull about one inch posterior to the orbit. I had penetrated the skull, and found the texture of the brain considerably broke; a large cavity was formed; there was a large effusion of blood, so that I could cover my fingers almost without any impediment.</p>
               <p>Do you or not think that that wound was the occasion of his death? - It evidently was.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On this Saturday, this Ryan and Ephernon came to my house, of which I gave information to Mr. Bond, and he gave me his honour he would get me a free pardon; they asked me if I was going into the country to day, I said I should go to get a few oranges; and I got to the value of about half-a-crown's worth; Ephernon asked me if I would wish to go on such an affair with them at that present time. What, to rob? Yes. I answered I would not, while I could earn a shilling or eighteen-pence a day by lemons and oranges, and that I thought it better than to go on that line. Ephernon said he did not care, they would both go themselves. He went and told Ephernon I was not to go with him; in about half an hour they both came to my room; with that, my Lord, they both wished me a good morning, and went off, and told me where they were going to; they knew the walk I used to take with these lemons and oranges; and they met me about five o'clock; with that Ryan seemed to be forward in liquor, and they both began to quarrel and fight; with that they rescued the basket away from me, which contained about sixpenny worth of the oranges which I had not sold; I stood still for a little time, and asked them for them again, and they made answer that I should not have them, and should not go home till they pleased. Ephernon made answer, and said, d - n my eyes, if I offered to go out of his sight, without his leave, he would blow my brains out; I said why? he made answer, that I should perform in the action which he was determined to do; I told him, that if he was to shoot me through the body, I would not go with them that night on the actions they meant; with that we parted; this was about half a mile from the place where the fact was committed. I followed them, and thought to have returned home on the Hamstead road; with that, I heard a hue and cry: I came up, guessing and imagining in my own mind they were doing something amiss. The first thing I observed was, a horse and cart across the king's highway before me: there was no room on the foot way for the snow; I thought to get past the horse, and my hands came to the reins of the horse, and this young man jumped out of the cart, and catched me round the body; Ryan went behind the cart, and laid in the snow, and Ephernon went round the hedge; then there were some gentlemen farmers came up, and gave me several blows, and knocked me down nine or ten times. I neither robbed nor committed the murder. I expect nothing, as I find, but death; and I have to say to the hour of my death, I neither intended to rob or murder.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge summed up the evidence, and added -</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is proper I should tell you, that in point of law, if several men go out together upon an illegal purpose, meaning to commit a robbery, and determine to oppose all resistance that may be offered to them in the prosecution of the attempt, if one man kills another, the man that was present, though he is not the hand that gave the blow, he is equally guilty; therefore, if the wound was given by the other man who was in his company, and you are satisfied they both went out on one illegal purpose, he is equally guilty.</p>
               <p>The Jury immediately gave a verdict,</p>

            , you have been convicted of a crime of the greatest magnitude of any that is known in the law. The crime of wilful murder, an offence which not only the laws of this country, but of every civilized society, have judged it indispensibly necessary to punish with death. Your case affords a melancholy instance how naturally the commission of one crime leads on to another; for though there is reason to hope that you did not go out with a deliberate purpose to take away the lives of your fellow-creatures, yet that guilt was the natural cause of the unlawful purpose for which you associated with others; and the life of an innocent subject has fallen a sacrifice to your crimes. It therefore becomes necessary for the safety of society, and to deter others from offending in the like, that your sufferings should hold forth an example to those who cannot be restrained from the commission of crimes by any laws, human or divine. Happy will it be for you, if a sincere repentance of your guilt should obtain for you, that mercy hereafter, which the law must unavoidably deny you here. It is necessary that persons guilty like you should suffer; and it remains only for me to discharge my duty, in pronouncing upon you, the awful sentence of the law; which is, That you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution; there, on Monday next, to be hanged by the neck until you are dead; and your body afterwards to be dissected and anatomized pursuant to the statute; and the Lord have mercy on your sinful soul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I beg the benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Court. The law denies it you, and the justice of the country must be satisfied.</p>

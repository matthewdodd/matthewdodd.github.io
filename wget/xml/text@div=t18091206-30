On the 30th of November, between eight and nine in the evening, from information, I went to the prisoner, he was in the manufactory; he had a file in his hand; I insisted upon him shewing me what he wanted with that file, and why he went away from his business. I took a small lamp in my hand and went down stairs with him; the door of the room where he worked was locked; I then perceived his jacket pockets looked bulky, I looked into them and found them full of brass; I collared him and brought him into the manufactory, and took upwards of eleven pounds of brass from him. The prisoner said it was the first time that ever he was guilty of any thing of the sort; I delivered the brass to Mr. Penton's-clerk and took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

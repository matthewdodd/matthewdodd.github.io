                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Prall, linen-draper, Tottenham-court-road. On the 5th of February the prisoner came there—I watched her, and saw her folding her cloak over—I went to ano<lb></lb>ther part of the window, and saw a dress under her cloak—I told a young man—he came and asked where that dress was—she rose up from her chair, went to where some dresses were, and began to turn them over—I looked at her feet, and the dress dropped down which I had previously seen under her arm—I cannot say it did not fall from the counter—she stooped, but before she could hardly stoop, she cried out, "Here it is"—I said, "Yes it is, because you dropped it"—I had seen it under her arm—she was then in a different part of the shop, about a yard from where she had been.</p>

I was in the shop, and served the prisoner with a dress which came to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then went to another part of the shop to get some calico—I put the dress behind the counter—Collier kept pointing to her arm—I could not understand him—I went round to him—he then told me something, and I made inquiry for the dark chintz dress—the prisoner said, "Very likely it is under these dresses on the counter," but it was not—it was the very one which had hung on the line in the window—Collier then went into the middle of the shop, and the prisoner</p>

               <p>cried out, "Here it is on the floor," and picked it up—I stooped, and saw her with the very same dress which I had taken off the line—it could not have dropped from the counter—she said she did not take it—her chair might be about a yard from where she stooped and said, "Here it is."</p>

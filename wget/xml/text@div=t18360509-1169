                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames police, and am super-intendant of the police at the London Docks. On the 27th of March, I was at the watch-house (which is sixty or seventy yards inside the gate) at six o'clock in the evening—that is the time the watchman came off duty—the prisoner was employed as a watchman to protect the property on the quays—he came down to the watch-house-door to report to me that all was right; he was then going out, but in consequence of what I saw, I asked him what he had got in his hat—he said nothing but his pocket-handkerchief—his bat was on his head—he took it off and gave it to me—I found two pieces of silk bandana handkerchiefs under his pocket-handkerchief in his hat—I said I must search him, which I did, and found four more pieces round his body between his waistcoat and shirt—these are the six pieces—I asked how he came by them—he said a man came to him while he was on his station, that he thought was a custom-house-officer, as he had their uniform buttons and asked him to take them out for him—I asked him if he knew the man—he said he did not—I sent him with two officer that he might point out the man—their names are John Clements and George Dix—they are not here—they brought the six pieces back—I asked him where he was to meet the man—he said at the gate—he said he could not find the man—but he had told me that before.</p>

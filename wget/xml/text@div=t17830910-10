               <p>How many were there delivered at that time? - I think seventy four, we had one hundred and forty three in all, men and women; on the 29th of August at ten in morning, they made what they called a rush, and secured me and the Captain, and the men.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner among the number? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100020"></xptr> He was, and the first that went into the cabbin, and stole the Captain's buckles out of his shoes.</p>

               <p>What did they do then? - They hoisted both boats out, and as many as could, got into them.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner of the number? - Yes, he was one of the number, he knocked down two or three of the other prisoners to get into the boat.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you repossessed the boats? - The boats did not return till about twelve o'clock, we told them what danger we were in, and they let the sailors up about half past three; they were many of them drunk, and went down below, and we drove the others down, and secured them there: the next morning we fell in with the Perseverance frigate, which conveyed us into Portsmouth.</p>

               <p>Bradbury. He was the first that came on board, took the officer's hanger, and flourished it over the Captain's head.</p>
               <p>Court. How did this begin? - They demanded to have their irons off, the Captain said, he could not take them, they said, they would take them off themselves; the Captain said, he would fire on them, they said, fire away and be damned, and they took them off themselves with as much case as if they had not any on.</p>
               <p>How many did you trust on deck? - Sometimes three messes, containing six in a mess, they were in irons.</p>

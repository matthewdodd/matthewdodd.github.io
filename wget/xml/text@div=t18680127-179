                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Oriana</hi>, now lying in St. Katherine's Dock—we arrived there last Friday—on the 12th instant I was officer of the watch—at four o'clock in the morning I struck the bell, and a Frenchman who was on board called the watch—William Dorey, the deceased, was then at the wheel—he was relieved—I heard him call the prisoner, and say, "Go on deck, you b——"—the prisoner said he would go on deck when he was ready—Dorey replied, "Go on deck, you b——son of a b——"—the prisoner gave Dorey a shove; with that Dorey stripped off his oilskin and his monkey jacket, and made a breach towards the prisoner, made a rush at him, and seized him by the throat—I did not hear any more—I heard the prisoner struggle—Dorey was strangling him with his hands round his throat—I then heard a rush of blood against the "paulbit," which is the thing the windlass runs round—I did not see it, because there was no light in the forecastle, only the light of the "bogey"—I heard Dorey say to me, <hi rend="italic">"Ned</hi>, I am stabbed"—I jumped up from the seat, and went towards them, and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand—I took it out of his hand, and ran aft to tell the captain—Dorey had no knife in his hand at the time—he had not one belonging to him—he only lived fifteen minutes after this—he was stabbed on the left side, by the groin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman belonging to the shop <hi rend="italic">Oriana</hi>—I was on board on the 12th January—about four o'clock that morning there was a dispute between Dorey and the prisoner—it was a very short quarrel—I prevented Dorey from rushing on the prisoner, and took him by the neck, but Dorey seized the prisoner by the neck, and held him there, and at that moment it was he gave the blow—I can't say whether he had the knife in his hand when I approached Dorey to prevent him fighting—I saw it the instant he gave the blow—he struck the deceased in the groin—I saw the last witness take the knife from the prisoner's hand—after the blow was struck I heard Dorey say, "He has a knife; he has a knife"—he fell perhaps in three or four minutes afterwards—I had been on board with Dorey and the prisoner a month—I never heard any quarrelling with them before, they seemed always on good terms—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—the prisoner seemed to regret it very much, and did everything he could to help stop the blood.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 27th of February, about half-past seven o'clock, I was at the Swan-wharf—I saw both the prisoners loading the cart on Tennant's-wharf—after they had done that, White drove it off—I cannot tell whether it was empty before, as I was not there at the commencement—something attracted my attention—after it was driven away White left it, and went into a public-house—I pot my hand under the dung, and there were two bags—I went and found the policeman—he came up with me—he thrust his hand into the sack, and took out a handful and looked at it—he went into the public-house, and White came out with him,</p>

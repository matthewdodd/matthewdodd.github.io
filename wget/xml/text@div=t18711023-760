                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Playhouse Yard—about 12.15 on the morning of the 26th, I was at the Leopard, in Seward Street, Goswell Road, with a brother of Powell's (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>)—Powell threw some tobacco pipes at his brother, and I asked him the meaning of it—he said "I will do for you"—I said "Not while I am here; while he is with me I will protect him"—he said "I will do for you—I said "Not me, for I will not quarrel with you"—he struck at me, and the landlord said "I will have no fighting here; you had better go outside"—I went outside, to avoid a quarrel, and the two Powells and the prisoner came out, and fell on top of me—Powell made a blow at me, and the prisoner pulled out a knife, opened it with his teeth, and said "I will <hi rend="italic">chiv</hi> you"—while I was sparring with him I felt a prick in my back, and said "I am stabbed"—the prisoner was the closest person to me, and he had a knife—he was stopped—they used him roughly—the other three got away—I went to the station—my trowsers and shirt were stabbed through, and I was bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not try to return the blow inside the house, but when he hit me outside, I hit him back—there was no ill-feeling between me and Powell, but there was between the two brothers Powell—I said to one of them, "Your brother wants to be friends with you"—he said "No, I will do for him"—this is not the first time I have mentioned that—I will swear I did not provoke him to fight—I am not fond of fighting—I have fought in the prize-ring; but it is eight years since I struck a blow at anybody—I cannot swear that the blow was not given by Elizabeth Powell.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in Keate-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of Jan. I hired the prisoner as my servant—she came into my service about nine o'clock, that evening—I trusted her to mind my place—I went to bed about nine o'clock, leaving her in care of the place—about two o'clock next morning I was awoke by the dog barking—I got up and found the street-door open, the prisoner was gone—and a cloak, a pair of shoes, two gowns, two sheets, and a blanket were missing—on the even<lb></lb>ing of the same day a policeman came to the house—in consequence of what he said I went to the station and identified the articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is wrong altogether; I was in his service five or six months ago; he took me home that night. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have known what it is to stand at that bar myself, and have been as lenient to the prisoner as if she had been my own child—I have no doubt you are aware what I was here for—they think they have a right to rob me—I was never a thief in my life—I feel for the prisoner, but she has robbed my sister four Sessions ago.</p>

I saw the last witness serve the prisoner, and put a half crown in the till—the prisoner left—I took the half crown out, tried it, and it was bad—there was no other half crown there—I went after the prisoner, and found him at Mr. Goring's; collared him, brought him back to my house, and asked him to give up the good change he had received for the bad half crown, and likewise to pay for the gin—he said he was not aware it was bad—he paid for the gin, and I gave him in charge, with the half crown.</p>

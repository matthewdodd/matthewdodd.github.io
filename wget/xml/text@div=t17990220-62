               <p>Q.What did he mean by that, when he said fleece him? - A.

               <p>Q. You were nearer to the office than your house is? - A. No, my house was not half the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you thought of going to a Justice to swear the robbery against this man? - A. I do not know; it might be the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Two or three days? - A. No, it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. And the Justice sent you all about your business? - A. No, he did not; the Justice said, you had better go and make it up; he said, do you want to make a hundred pounds, or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you live in Whitechapel parish - is it not at Saltpeter-bank where you and the gang live? - A. No; I live at No. 69, Rosemary-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Vauxhall Water Works Company. The prisoner was in their employ—the room in which he worked is divided from my room, in which I kept my money, by a door—I was out of my room on the 13th of November, from five to ten minutes, and in the evening of that day I missed some money—when I left my office that day, the prisoner was in the outer office, and when I re<lb></lb>turned he told me that no one had gone into my office—(no one could have gone in without his seeing them)—in consequence of something I heard afterwards, I called the prisoner to me—I asked him whether the statement made by his uncle was correct, as to his taking certain money from me—he said it was so.</p>

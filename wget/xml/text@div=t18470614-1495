               <p>On the 16th of June, about ten minutes past nine o'clock in the evening, I went into the shop of my son James William Benson, a silver<lb></lb>smith and jeweler, on Cornhill—I saw the prisoner sitting in a chair at the counter—my son was behind the counter, showing him some watches—the prisoner said he should not have the chain that night, but would come back to-morrow evening—I sat in the chair next him—he had watches in his hand several times—he rose, said, "I shall take this," took a watch in his left hand, and ran out of the shop on to the pavement of the Royal Exchange—I called, "Stop thief!"—my son caught him—I called the young man out of the shop to assist his master, as I was afraid to leave—he went out—as we were bring<lb></lb>ing the prisoner across the road the watch fell, or was thrown from him—my son picked it up, gave it to me, and I gave it to the policeman—this pro<lb></lb>duced is it—the prisoner was given in charge—he said, "You Have found no watch on me"—it had been dropped then.</p>

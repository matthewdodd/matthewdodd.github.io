                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Oxford-street. Duncan was in my service—Neaves is her sister—on 16th Aug., in consequence of information, I sent for an officer—I went with him down to the kitchen—I found Duncan, and asked her to give the keys to the officer, she did so—we went to her room—we opened one of her boxes with the keys she gave us—we found there two pairs of gloves and two wash-leathers of mine, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had another servant, a little girl, who I should think slept in the same room—we then unlocked a closet in the same room with one of the keys, and found this large basket of tea sewn up in this cloth—it contains about seven pounds, this other basket, containing about three pounds of tea, and this canister, similar to ours, containing about two pounds and a half; these two pots of jam, and this bottle of pickle, were in the same closet; this barley-sugar, groats, two packets of starch, tin cases, and a ball of string—they are all mine—we opened another closet on the landing with another key which was on the bunch, and found in it this cash-box, and in it was this key, which will open the warehouse door, and give access to the property—this cash-box is not mine—I then went with the officer to the Commercial-road, which is about four miles and a half from my house—we there found Neaves—while we were there, a Parcel Delivery cart came up, and I saw the man take a parcel from it, and take it to Neaves' house—after the man left I went in—I saw the parcel, and the direction on it—Neaves was asked whether she knew the direction—she said it was her sister's; she knew her sister's writing—I saw it opened at the station, it contained these six bars of soap, weighing about sixteen or seventeen pounds, and worth about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we searched the house—we found some tea, and this pillow-case, which is mine—it is marked, "William Harvey," who was at one time in partnership with me—this blanket was found there—it is marked with a "W," and is similar to what we have at home—these cups are mine—they were taken from Neaves at the station by the searcher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Hobbs, who keeps the Golden Lion, Gravel-lane. On 6th Feb., about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our house—I think he had had a little to drink before he came—he sat down in the parlour, talked very much, and abused every one in the room—he used very abusive language—there were two or three respectable men's wives in the room, and it was not fit he should be allowed to remain—he went out about a quarter to 9 o'clock, and returned in twenty minutes or half an hour—I had spoken to my master before he went out, and in consequence of what my master said, I prevented the prisoner coming into the parlour again—there was a scuffle between us—I felt my hand cut, and called out that the prisoner had a knife—I bled very much—the leader of my forefinger was cut, and also my wrist—I had no use in my finger—I went to a surgeon, and he dressed it—I did not see that the prisoner had any knife—it happened in a box at the side of the room—he was trying to force his way through me into the parlour.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he use violent or abusive language? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Abusive—he had had no provocation to use it—the women never spoke to him—when he came back no policeman came with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 3, Duke-street, Stamford-street, Lambeth. I was at Mr. Hobbs's on 6th Feb.—I went into the taproom at about half-past 7 o'clock—about 9 o'clock I heard a noise in front of the bar, went out, and saw the scuffle between Williams and the prisoner in a side box—Williams was trying to get the prisoner out, and the prisoner</p>

               <p>had got hold of him, trying to get in—I heard Williams say, "You shan't go in," and he called out directly," He has got a knife"—the prisoner was pulled off Williams, and I saw the blade of a small pocket knife in his right hand—Mr. Hobbs called me to fetch a constable, and told Williams to go to the doctor—there was no policeman present—I went with Williams to the doctor, and saw the doctor dress a wound on his knuckle, and one round the wrist—his hand was covered with blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What caused you to be in the passage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the taproom, and came out to see what the noise was—they were then scuffling—I saw the blade of a knife in the prisoner's hand, about two inches and a half or three inches long—I saw it for about two minutes—I have worked for Mr. Hobbs, the landlord, and Mr. Mayer, at the ginger-bleaching, taking it from the rough state and making it white.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in Gravel-lane—I searched him at the station, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trowsers pocket—there were marks of wet blood on it—the prisoner's right hand had a good deal of blood on it—he was very drunk—at the station the prosecutor had his right hand bound up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I dressed the prosecutor's hand on this night—I found one incised wound on the wrist, and another across the knuckles—the extensor tendon of the fore finger was cut; he will only recover the partial use of it; there is partial loss of power in the finger—the wrist is now perfectly well—a knife of this kind would be sufficient to make such wounds—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does the tendon lie over the knuckle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a slight incision would cut it, but there must be some force attached to it—the tendon lies very superficially—a very deep cut cannot be made on the back of the hand—he has been under my care almost to the present time; I dressed his hand two days ago—any cut on the tendon requires considerable time to heal—the cut on his wrist was very simple—I do not know that it is absolutely necessary for him to have his arm in a bandage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it useful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not absolutely necessary—although the tendon lies near the surface, a certain degree of force is necessary to sever it. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>)</p>

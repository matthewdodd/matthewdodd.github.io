               <p>I am a widow; I let lodgings; I let a lodging to the prisoner, about eight weeks before they robbed me, but I am not certain to the eight weeks; I let the lodgings to the woman, and he came and approved of them; they were to give me two shillings a week furnished; I missed a sheet, a saucepan, and a blanket; I went into the room for the saucepan, and they told me it was in the house; I believe this was Monday, the last day in March, and then I looked to the bed, and I missed a sheet, and a blanket, and I gave them warning, (There was a pair lost when they left me) and she told me it did not suit to quit my lodgings for a fortnight; they only paid one week, and the night she said she should quit, I went up, and I found the key laid over the door, and I took it, and went into the room, and I missed all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see them again after this? - I saw him again on the Wednesday following, the 24th of April and then he went with me to the office in Worship-street; I told him he must go to give an account of the things; I had a man with me, and he told us where she was, and she was brought and searched; I see her searched, and there was a duplicate of a sheet found on her, which sheet I went to the pawnbroker's to see, and I found it to be my property; the pawnbroker is here.</p>

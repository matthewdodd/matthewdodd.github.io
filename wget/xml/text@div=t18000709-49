               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find out Smith and Wilson? - A. Yes, but I could not; I found a name very near it, Williams, or some such name.(The bill read.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. The person that gave you this note, you had never seen before the 17th of May? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him to endorse the note, I take it for granted? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.But in point of fact he did not endorse it? - A. No, he said he could not write; and he made his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he could not read also? - A. I do not recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him again as you suppose, till last Saturday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes might he be with you on the 17th of May? - A. He came about two or three o'clock, and staid till near seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you, respecting either the drawers or acceptors? - A. No.</p>

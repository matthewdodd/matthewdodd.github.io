                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Mr. William Manoah Chambers, and his partner. On 17th June the prisoner came to the window at half-past seven in the morning—we had some sherry in the cellar—I went up stairs, came down again. and missed six or seven bottles of it—the prisoner was then in front of the house—I asked him if he had taken any of the wine—he said, "No"—there was another person with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was spoken to about this wine—I saw the prisoner, who was cleaning the windows, come down about half-past eight o'clock, and go across the warehouse into the cellar with a basket—I followed him towards a bin where the wine was, and was putting it on the bin—I said, "Don't put it there; put it on this cask"—he took eight bottles out of the basket, one by one, and put them on the cask, then went up again and began to clean the windows—a policeman came, and we marked the bottles with ink—Mr. Chambers afterwards sent them away, as the wine was sold.</p>

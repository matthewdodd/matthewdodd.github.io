             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Powdich: On the 23d, in the morning, the prisoners came in, and made choice of a gown; after they had cut it off, they had not sufficient money to pay for it; they left one shilling on it, and said they would call for it on Saturday; they came in on the same day, in the after part, and they wished, they said, to have another cut off from the same print, which I cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pay for it? - A. No, they had it put by in the same way, and was to call for it on Saturday; they likewise came in again on Friday, the next day, with a third person, and made choice of another gown for the third person; during the time I was serving the third person, I observed one of the prisoners stoop down, under pretence of tying up her stockings; I perceived her making a great bustle in tying up her stockings, which excited my notice; when she arose up, she took both her hands, pretending to draw up her petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was that? - 
               <persName id="t18040912-42-person518">A. Catharine Drew</persName>
            ; I perceived the sides of her waist to have increased very much, nearly double to what it was before, which induced me to go round the counter immediately; her eyes were fixed on me; her sides decreased, and I picked up that piece from beneath her petticoats, near the counter; I accused her of having taken it, and she denied it; I took her by the arm, and desired her to go out immediately; the other young man that was behind the counter desired me to observe the other (Carney). I saw the boy pull a piece of print from under her arm; I took them both to the door, I saw a constable in the street, and gave charge of them immediately; the third person had a gown cut off, pretending a marriage was to take place, and they wished to appear like sisters.</p>

               <p>Drew's defence. I went into this shop; I asked them to shew me a bit of muslin for caps; he asked three shillings and sixpence, which I thought too much; he asked me if I wanted any cotton, I told him I did not; he came along the shop, and made a prisoner of me; I turned round to get my muslin, and he pushed me out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Carney's defence. I went into the shop to pay two shillings off my gown; there were several women in the shop that were buying of prints; he stood upon the counter chucking the cottons down, and this piece fell down; I laid hold of the cotton to put it upon the counter; with that he came round, and kicked me out of the shop.</p>

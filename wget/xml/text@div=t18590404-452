My husband keeps the Crown and Anchor beer-shop, Old Kent-road—on Thursday evening, 26th February, between seven and eight o'clock, Cole and Wilson came in—Wilson asked for a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a florin—I bit it, and said, "This is a bad one"—Cole said that Wilson got it from his master with another, which Wilson laid down, and that that was good—I told him I thought not, and it appeared to me as if he was in the habit of passing bad money—Cole said that he saw Wilson's master give it to him at the Wandsworth railway station with the other—I put it behind me on the shelf, and gave change for the good one—I afterwards gave it to Mr. Skelton in the parlour while they were drinking the beer—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

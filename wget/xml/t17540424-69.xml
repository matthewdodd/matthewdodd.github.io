            . I get my living by washing and scowering, and live next yard to the prisoner. Having been at a day's work on the 1st of April, when I came home at night between seven and eight o'clock I found the deceased in a publick house over-against the yard where she lived; she was a little in liquor, but not a great deal. She eat a bit of beef with me, and we drank a pot of beer; she then went home and went up stairs to sleep. Her husband coming in about an hour afterwards, asked for her, I told him she was gone to lie down, and he said he supposed she had knocked out her link (meaning she was drunk.)</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. Why do you imagine he meant so? Did you ever hear him use that term before?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, I have often heard him say so.</p>
               <p>She goes on and says,</p>
               <p>I would have gone up and awaked her for him, and he would not let me. I bid him not go and play the devil above.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, he was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by playing the devil?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I meant to strike her, because I have often known him to strike her, and was afraid he should. He went up to her, and was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but not longer. When he came down he asked if I was gone; upon my inquiring what was the matter, he said he believed he should be hanged as his fellow servant was that day, and wished I would go up to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was his fellow servant?</p>

            , who was hang'd that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for that?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. He said he had cut his wife on the head, and he believed she would bleed to death. I went up stairs to her and found her sitting on the side of the bed bleeding sadly. The blood came from a wound on the right side of the head. I then took a tea cup and went down to the publick house where her husband was, asking for some gin to wash the blood from her head. When I washed it off I had some loaf-sugar, some of which I went to put into the wound to stop the bleeding; but the gash was so large, and the blood gushed out so, that I could not do it. Upon my asking her how he did it, she said he had beat her with a broomstick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she name her husband's name?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, she did not mention his name; she only told me that he had struck her with a broomstick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that wound was given by that blow?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, Sir; she told me he had knocked her down with it. I went down to him again to the alehouse, and told him he must get somebody to stop the blood, for I could not; he said he could not fetch a surgeon, for he had no money, and then he went up to her himself. I went over to Mr. Bristow's the apothecary, and brought over Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bristow's nephew, who is a surgeon. The prisoner was with her when he came in; he searched the wound, and said it was very tedious, if not dangerous; he ordered me to wrap up her head and get her to the hospital. The prisoner then went and borrowed a shilling, and we got a coach. I went with her to the hospital, and left her in

               <p>Q. When was this conversation?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. On the Saturday se'nnight before she died.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. Yes, he did for me to take the bloody things out to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you come to me the next day and say my wife wanted support, that she wanted money?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Tuesday, the second of April.</p>

               <p>Brockhouse. I did go to him and told him she desired him to send her some money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she want it for?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I don't know what she wanted it for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave that woman (meaning Brockhouse) sixpence to carry to her, and she never carried it.</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I left it upon the things by the side of his wife, and said I would speak to the sister to let her have half a pint of beer when she would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell his wife that you brought it?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I did, and never went home till I had carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you take a hat out of my room?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Twould be very hard for her to accuse herself of robbing your room. This is not a proper question to ask her, because it would charge herself with a felony, which is a thing not to be done. Ask her any question concerning the murder; but this is not a fair question.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did you ever tell any body that if it lay in your power you would hang me?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, I never said any such thing, but that I would speak the truth as much as I knew.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came home from my labour and enquired for my wife, my neighbour told me she was at the Coach and Horses; I went there, and Brockhouse told me she was gone up stairs; I went up; she was there asleep: I awaked her as well as I could: she got up; there was never a candle a light; but there was a fire, and she felt about the chimney-piece for a match to light the candle: I put my hand in my pocket and found a piece of paper, and was going to light it: I pushed her with my elbow and she fell against a cullender; she got up again and lighted the candle. I found her bleed prodigiously; I then called up the first witness and sent for Mr. Roberts; he said it would be a charge for me, and that I had better send her to the hospital at once: I went and borrowed a shilling of a neighbour and sent for a coach to carry her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brockhouse. Did he come down to you, or you go up to him?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. He came down to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever a stick in his hand?</p>
               <p>Brockhouse. No, I saw none.</p>

But three nights before this happened, when I came home the woman of the house, where she was that night, told me, she tumbled off from a bench and lay for dead a quarter of an hour; and she told me she wondered she never died in her liquor; another time I went to go up stairs, she sate upon the stairs very much in liquor; I persuaded her to go up, she did not, but fell down stairs and there she lay all night.</p>

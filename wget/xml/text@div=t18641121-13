On 4th August, I was in a little room behind my shop—I saw the prisoner come in, and heard the crown ring—I doubted its being good, walked forward directly, and asked the prisoner where she got it—she said she did not know—I said that I should give her in charge—she became exceedingly violent and saucy, pushed me on one side, and rushed out of the shop—I caught her in a blind alley close by—I gave the crown to the policeman.</p>

On 19th September, at a little after 8 in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop and asked for one pound of sixpenny pieces, and she gave me a florin—I had no change, and sent my servant to get it at Mr. Burroughs, who keeps the Corner Pin—the barman afterwards brought the florin back, and I broke it in two—the prisoner had then gone—I put the pieces in my pocket, and afterwards locked them up—next night, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came again for a pound of pieces; she gave me a</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Stratton—on 19th September I saw the prisoner give her a florin, which I took to the Corner Pin and gave to Weaver the barman, who gave me the full change, and I left the florin with him—I was in the shop when he brought it back, and my mistress broke it in the detector—next night, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop; I recognised her, and my mistress said something about her—the man served her, and she gave my mistress a bad florin—I tried to keep the prisoner, but she was very violent and I could not hold her—she got away, and I followed her and told a policeman, who went after her, but lost sight of her.</p>

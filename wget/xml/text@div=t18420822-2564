                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in High-street, Islington. On the 26th of July I was coming from the Surrey Zoological-gardens—after I had left a short time, there was a rush, and some one said, "You have lost your handkerchief"—I missed it, and Church, who was on the ground, was pointed out to me by Radcliffe—I went to the station, and my handkerchief was produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I was standing outside the Zoolo<lb></lb>gical-gardens—there were a great many people, and Radcliffe said there were three thieves going down—I then saw the prisoners following a gen<lb></lb>tleman, and Church took the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket—Bentliff was behind Church, and he held the tails of his own coat up—I laid hold of Church, with the handkerchief in his hand, and we both fell down—I called to the gentleman that he had been robbed—I lost sight of Bentliff then, but I am sure be was with Church, and had the tails of his own coat up.</p>

I had been standing outside the gardens about three quarters of an hour—the company began to come out about half-past nine—I had been at work that day for my brother, in Nevill's-court—he is a printer's joiner—I was a policeman about six years, and discharged about eight months ago—I decline to say what I was discharged for—I never was here but once while I was a policeman, but I was a patrol before the police came on, and I attended here then a great many times—since I was in the police I have been here once, about a boy who stole a pin out of somebody's handker<lb></lb>chief—Radcliffe is an officer belonging to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty—I met him that night by the Elephant and Castle—I had known him for some time—I had a job of work to go to next day—I was not look<lb></lb>ing out for a job.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Animals' Friend Society. I was at the Zoological Gardens and noticed the two prisoners and another person—I spoke to Baker—I noticed Church following the gentleman, and the other two persons covering him, holding up his coat tails—I saw Church put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, but I could not see what he took out—Baker took hold of Church, and I took Bentliff, but seeing Baker and Church fall, I went to them.</p>

               <p>Brown came into my shop between 7 and 8 o'clock—another man, not scanes, came in after him, and after the other man was in scanes came in—that was not a minute after Brown had come in—Brown asked for two of the best cigars—I showed him two at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece—he said they were not the right sort, but he at last took two—he offered me in payment a half-sovereign—he put it on the cigar-case—I asked him if he had any smaller change; he said, "No"—I asked a friend of mine to give me change, or lend me sixpence, and I gave him change—scanes bad come in while I was showing Brown the cigars—when I had given Brown the change he went away; and as he turned to leave the shop scanes asked for half-an-ounce of tobacco—I served him, and he gave good money—I discovered that the half-sovereign was bad before scanes had left the shop, but after Brown had left—the other man asked for two cigars while I was serving Brown, and he was waiting to be served; and Brown said, "Serve that gentleman first;" and I did so, and he left the shop—I won't be sure that that was after Brown had laid down the half-sovereign, but he had had the cigars—I saw a person of the name of Sparrow; I showed him the half-sovereign, but I did not lose sight of it.</p>

I am a dyer—I live within five doors of Mrs. Wilcox—on 29th October I saw the prisoners, about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening—they were both together, and a third person was with them—I saw them walk up and down between my shop and Mrs. Wilcox's, and they were in deep conversation by Mrs. Wilcox's window for two or three minutes—I kept my eye on them, and I saw Brown go into the shop, and immediately afterwards scanes went in—I knew them by sight quite well—Brown went in first, and scanes next, not a minute afterwards—soon after-wards Brown came out; he ran past my shop as hard as he could run round the corner—I saw scanes come out next—I don't know whether the other man came out or not—when scanes came out he went in the same direction that Brown went.</p>

It is a thing of daily occurrence to go in a shop and put money on a glass case; and really bad money is so common you can hardly tell it.

I had four sovereigns in a small trunk on the first floor room, where he slept alone; it was locked, and I had the key. On the 4th of September he went out, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning. I had locked the sovereigns in the trunk at half past eight the night before; he was not at home then; the handkerchief was in another trunk, not locked, and belonged to a seaman, who had left it in my charge. I went into the room a few minutes after he was gone, unlocked the trunk, and missed the sovereigns; he had paid me a sovereign at nine o'clock that morning for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100025"></xptr>rent; he came home to dinner; I set his dinner before him, then fetched Judge. I took my handkerchief from his pocket, and said it was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you any other lodgers at that time - A. Yes; two, they are at home now. I washed for them all, they slept in the room above him. I do not know that I ever gave him a wrong handkerchief by mistake; I do not know whether they borrow linen of each other; anybody in the house could get into the room. When I took the handkerchief from him, one end of it hung out of his pocket. Nobody could give it him by mistake.</p>

            . I know the prisoner by sight. On the 4th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw him, and asked him to lend me 2 s.; he said he had nothing but a sovereign, and could not get change, but if I met him in the evening he would give it me. I saw him take four sovereigns out of his waistcoat pocket, and put them into another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are an unfortunate girl I believe - A. No; I am married, my husband has been away two years. I do not walk the streets; Lucas is not a friend of mine, her husband went to sea on the day this happened.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Lucas fetched me, and pointing to the prisoner, who was sitting down; she said</p>
               <p>"This is the man who robbed me." She made a snatch at his pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief; I took it from her; she said it was marked T. L.; I said it was so. I found 12 s. on him, and a new farthing; he said the handkerchief was among his things.</p>
               <p>MRS. LUCAS. My husband went to sea that afternoon; I told him, but he could not stop to enquire about the robbery, as the ship was going that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did your husband leave the house - A. About half-past twelve o'clock; I never washed any handkerchiefs of this pattern for the prisoner; he went out about nine o'clock to get shaved, and returned.</p>

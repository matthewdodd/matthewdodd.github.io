                  </hi>. I live at Little Missenden, Bucks. The prisoner Newell was a labourer in my service—I know nothing of Britnell—On Sun<lb></lb>day night, the 29th of March, my house was broken open, and this property was stolen among the rest—I received information and went to Uxbridge, and got there on Monday evening between nine and ten o'clock—I gave directions to Murray, the constable, and on Tuesday morning they let me know that they had taken the men and property—my place is about fifteen miles from Uxbridge—I went on Wednesday morning, and found the prisoners and property, which I knew to be mine; it had been in my house between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday night, and was missing before three o'clock on Monday morning—a pane of glass had been taken out of my window, they put their hand in, opened the window, and took the things.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is high constable of Uxbridge. He sent me in quest of the prisoners—I went into the Sun public-house, and found Newell there, and this pair of shoes on his feet—I asked where his companion was—he said he had no companion—I told him it was of no use to say that, for I knew he had—he then said he was at Wheeler's beer-shop—I went there, but Darrill had taken Britnell—Mr. Wheeler told me that Britnell had sold him a pair of shoes; his wife and a woman there, a shawl apiece: and a man who worked for him, a smock frock.</p>

On Monday morning, the 30th, the two prisoners came together about ten minutes before seven o'clock—they appeared to have been travelling, and said they wanted a pot of beer—they said they had been travelling all night to work in the brick field; they had seen the foreman and got an order, and they were going to work directly—they brought the property which is here produced.</p>

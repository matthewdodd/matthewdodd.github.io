The prisoner carried my boxes to Peckham about six months ago. On the 7th of February I sent him to fetch a chest and a box from there, and to bring them to Tash-court - he did not come, but next day Brown fetched me to the office, where I found the prisoner, with the chest broken open; it had contained the articles stated in the indictment - I missed several of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 8th of February the prisoner came into the Lebeck's Head, public-house, Shadwell, and had something to drink. I was in the bar; he took me for the landlord, and asked me for a lodging. He seemed rather intoxicated, and had a chest with him. I asked him where he came from? he said from the Sussex frigate. I told him there was no such ship, and asked him where he brought the chest from? he said from Gravesend, and was very tired. It did not look like a seaman's chest, which arose my suspicion. I looked at his hands, and said he was no sailor. I went to examine the chest, he wished me not to do it, and said it was his daughter's, and he was moving it from her place of service. I secured him - he struggled, and threw two duplicates from his left hand, which were picked up and given to me. He cried, and said he was very sorry, he had done wrong, and that he was sent by a young woman in Tash-court to fetch a chest and box from Peckham, and that he took it to Deptford, broke it open, and pledged some of the things. I fetched the prosecutrix, she claimed the things, and missed several. He said he had left the second box at Greenwich, after it was broken to pieces - I went and found it there.</p>

            . I keep the Two Butchers, a public house in Hog-lane. On the 14th of May the prisoner and another man came to my house; they asked for a private room; they were shewn into a back parlour; they had some beef steaks for supper; the other man asked for a bed for his friend, meaning the prisoner; he went to bed. They both dined at my house next day; after dinner the prisoner asked me if I had cash in the house, if I could give him twenty guineas upon a 50 l. bank note; I told him I believed I could not, but that I would go and ask my brother; my brother said he had not so much: the other man came to me, and asked me if I had spoke to my brother; he said it was a good note, and I need not be afraid of it; he said before that, that if I had not cash a 10 l. bank note would do; I got thirteen guineas; when I went in I was rather doubtful; I told them I would send it to my baker's and get it changed; the prisoner said he did not chuse to have it changed, because it would do to send into the country in a letter to pay his creditors; I said I hope you do not intend to trick me, I have a large family; the prisoner said it is a good bank note, before I would injure you I would cut my right hand off; I gave him thirteen guineas; he held the note up, and said, see, it is a good Bank note, and gave it me; I said I did not understand it, but I hoped they were no ways going to defraud me; they said they should be back at nine o'clock; they ordered a supper and said they would give me the money when they came to supper. I went into the kitchen; a gentleman there said the note was not a good one; I went and shewed it to my butcher; he said don't be afraid I will give you cash for it; his wife said you are no judge, I will take it to the grocer's; she took it to the grocer's, and he said it was not good. (The note is shewn to her.) This is the note; I can swear to it by the marks at each corner; I took particular notice of it before I gave it out of my own hands; they never came to the house again. The prisoner was taken up the Thursday following. (The note was read, and corresponded literall, with the note set forth in the indictment.)</p>

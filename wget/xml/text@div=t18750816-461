                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper of King.

                  </hi>. I live in Godfrey Street, West Ham—I ordered of the prisoner two lots of calico, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. yards each, which I received, and have got the bill at home—I did not buy a print dress of the prisoner, nor did he deliver one, nor did I pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are other people in the house—Mr. Logan has been paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the print, but there was stuff delivered as well; I did not see it paid, Mrs. Brooks, who had it, is paying Mr. Logan now.</p>

It is not a print dress by the day-book, the entry there is 6 yards of Holland, and 1 yard of diaper to Mrs. James, which is altered to "Mrs. Brooks"—there is no entry of a print dress to Mrs. Brooks he has not accounted to me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received, but he has for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on the Holland; I have not charged Mrs. Brooks, with a print dress, nor has the prisoner paid me for one; she is not paying me for it now, that is for some Holland, that may be a false entry of his.</p>

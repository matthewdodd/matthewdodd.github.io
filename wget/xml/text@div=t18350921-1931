                  </hi>. I am foreman at Mr. Bryan's livery-stables, in Oxford-street. On the night of the 8th of September, a little before eight o'clock, I was standing down the egateway, and saw two men at our gate—one of them stooped, as if to put something on the groung—the other one went towards Mr. Castle's shop window, who keeps a hosier's shop—he then returned to the other one who was waiting at the gate—the other stooped down, as if to pick this thing up again, and both went to<lb></lb>ward's the shop window again—It is about ten yards from where I stood,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210011"></xptr>
               <p>and on the same side of the street—I walked up the gateway, opened the gate, and saw them both go from the shop window across the road—I saw them both close to the window—I opened the gate and saw them cross the street—I looked at the window, and saw a red silk purse hanging out of a hale which had been cut in the glass at the corner of a square—I went to the shop door and called out "Thieves!"—I kept my eye on the men and followed them—I saw the prisoner drop a piece of silk handkerchiefs—I never lost sight of him—I took him up and secured him, and gave him in custody of a policeman—I had observed the hole out in the glass before I alarmed the shopkeeper.</p>

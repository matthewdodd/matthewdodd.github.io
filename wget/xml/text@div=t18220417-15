On the 6th or 7th of November; I bought this mare, it was in my stable there; I saw it safe at six o'clock on the night of the 6th of March; I cannot say whether the door was locked. The patrol called me up about a quarter-past four o'clock next morning, and informed me my gates were open - I missed my mare, and traced her out of the yard to a lane leading to Kingston; a patrol and I immediately went towards Kingston; and the patrol overtook the prisoner within an hour after, on the mare's back, going towards Wimbledon Common. When I came up, I found him with the prisoner and the mare - it was mine, but it appears to have been stolen before I had her; I bought her of one Hall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How far from your house was it found - A. About a mile and a half. I had not secured the gate myself. I think I have seen the prisoner once at my house - I am a publican.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the stable within your yard - A. Yes. The yard gates were locked at night, and the lock found broken off.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I went with the prosecutor - I waited at the King's Arms, public-house, and met the prisoner coming up on the mare. Mullins came up in five minutes. I presented a pistol at the prisoner, and told him to stop, for he had stolen the mare; he said, There he was, and there was the mare. When I brought him to Teddington, he acknowledged taking the mare out of the stable by himself. The prosecutor claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did he acknowledge it - A. He said he broke the stable open, and took her himself. She has been returned to the Reverend

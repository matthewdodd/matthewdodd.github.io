            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner and asked her if she had pawned the gown; she said Yes, but did not say where; I found by the prosecutor that it was at Mr. Creed's, in Gray's-inn-lane; I took the prisoner there and they identified her; she was very much intoxicated, and I think she did not do it willingly.</p>

               <p>MARY HARIGAN re-examined. Q. How came you to know where to find the gown? A. I went from one shop to another; I met a woman with a load on her head, who asked if I had lost a gown; I said Yes; she said, "Go to the top of Gray's-inn-lane, to a little shop, and you will find it."</p>

On the evening of the 23d of December, I was standing in the shop, about a quarter past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner come up and look round as if waiting for somebody in the shop; he went away, then returned, and took a piece of carpet which stood about three yards inside the shop, and ran across the road with it - I am sure it was him. I informed Mr. Cross, who was in the shop - we pursued; I lost sight of him as I turned the corner, and found my master had hold of him; the carpet was then on the ground - I brought it back, it was the same which he took, and is worth 3 l. I gave it to the constable.</p>

            . I was in the shop. In consequence of what Calf said, I ran out; I caught sight of the prisoner turning the corner - he was running gently, in a direction from my house, carrying the carpet; he turned the corner. I did not see him put it down, but followed close, and saw him standing about a yard from it, and collared him; I had made no alarm. I took him back - he tried to get from us. It is worth 18 d. per yard; there are forty-five yards. The shop is part of the dwelling-house; we both live there.</p>

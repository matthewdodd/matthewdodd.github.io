                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the firm of Fer<lb></lb>gusson &amp; Foster—I saw the prisoner when he came up on each occasion—I was present at the arrangement made with him—it was as Mr. Fergusson has told us—he was to travel for six months in the Birmingham district, and to receive a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was to have no expenses in that district—we never received any claim for or suggestion about expenses until the writ came—on two occasions he was required to travel in the Man-Chester district, and he sent in a claim for those expenses, which was paid—we had occasion to write to him complaining of some omissions—on 24th December, we wrote: "We herewith hand you list of accounts, which you have received and not advised us of"—before we wrote that letter we had communicated with some of our customers—he did not subsequently to that letter send us a remittance for those accounts—we had not then discovered Dawes, of Birmingham, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor Bennett, of Stockpool, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor that he had not paid sufficient on the account of Thomas, of Wolverhampton—the prisoner sent us this letter of 27th December, containing this list—"Dawes, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," is mentioned in that—I do not see Thomas, of Wol-verhampton—the sum received is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as we have not received the further sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making up the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find Bennett, of Stockpool, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have never received any advice from him that that sum has been paid—he did not come to our office to settle up after our letter of 24th December; neither did he pay any money after that date—I was not aware from him that he had 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of ours in hand—I did not know lie was keeping a book which I saw just now.</p>

Thomas, Wolverhampton, in his letter to us this morning, informs us that he paid Mr. Dunkley on 25th November. He only advised us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. This will make the debt 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more.

               <p>in January, advising us of the receipt of that—to the best of my belief, I bare not seen such a letter—I was examined at the Mansion House—I believe Mr. Fergusson admitted there that the prisoner had given an account of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that there was a similar amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Andrews about the same time—I knew of this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Bennett some time after we dismissed Dunkley, I cannot fix the date—I did not require the prisoner to make a declaration as to the accuracy of his account—I am not aware of any communication with the Guarantee Society in reference to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I observe my friend is checking you by a little book; did the prisoner ever account to you from that book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I know nothing at all about it—the Guarantee Society is for insuring the inegrity of travellers—we communicated with the secretary—the policy was sent to the prisoner—we insisted on the prisoner sending it to us, and we got it about the end of December—we wrote many times for it, and could never get it delivered—after pushing the prisoner for the balance due to us, he set Up a counter claim; that was shortly before the writ—the jeer was travelling for another firm, in teas—they did not pay the expenses—he never claimed of us any expenses for the Birmingham journey.</p>

The prisoner was placed under my care in December, 1833, for about six weeks—the greater part of that time he was in a state of total aberration of mind—I went down on a Sunday by order <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Sir George Tothill, about the 29th of December, and found Mr. Kelly in bed—his father was to introduce me to him—he would not make any observation at all, nor open his eyes, but laid in bed quite in a torpid state—he remained so for several days—I with a great deal of persuasion aroused him as well as I was capable—during that time he took but very little food, and would not open his eyes or speak to any body—three or four days afterwards, by persuasion and a little manceu<lb></lb>vering, be got up and took a little breakfast—we walked round the garden together—he took hold of my arm, but never spoke to roe, and bad his eyes closed the whole time, we walked for I suppose half an hour—Mr. Day came and spoke to him, but he would not speak to him—we walked up to the bed-room, and he went to bed, and was in the same state, kneeling down to prayers and so <hi rend="italic">on</hi>—in a few days he rather roused—I persuaded him to come down and play at billiards, and he did, but played in a very incoherent manner—some ladies were coming by the window at the tine; he made a thrust at the window, and if I had not stopped him the cue would have gone through the window at them—they were persons for whom he ought to have entertained affection—he would sometimes flourish the cue over my head, but would look at me, pat me on the shoulder, and say he would not hurt me—he was in the habit of looking up in the skies—I could not un<lb></lb>derstand what he meant, but at last found he meant that God's eye was looking on us both, and that we were as one person—he showed a decided antipathy to his father, whose conduct was always particularly kind to him—he had a cap and snuff-box, and threw them on the fire—it is often the case that insane persons are sometimes mischievous, and sometimes melancholy—at times he was very dirty in bis person—the cleanest people become dirty when insane—I remember his calling for the angel Gabriel, and ask<lb></lb>ing for the keys of Heaven—I have not the slightest doubt of his insanity—the least excitement would produce it.</p>

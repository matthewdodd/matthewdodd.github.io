About a quarter before six o'clock, on the evening of the 9th of August, I was called to Pocoek's Fields, Islington—I found a great mob, and two men fighting—I took one of them into custody—the prisoner came and caught hold of me, and with the assistance of the mob got him from me—I pursued the man, and the prisoner came in front of me, and threw me down—I took him into custody, and was taking him to the station—he called to the mob not to let him go—they threw me down, dragged me into the field, and gave me se<lb></lb>veral blows—I got my truncheon out—the prisoner drew a knife, and cut</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and keep the Horseshoe and Magpie public-house, Middle-row, Holborn. The prisoner came into my service on the 17th of Aug., as maid of all work—I missed a great quantity of things, and on the 7th of Sept. I called in a policeman, and went with his and the prisoner into her room—he found in her box some petticoats, stockings, stays, and a number of things, which I had missed from my drawers—he went into a room close by the prisoner's bed-room—I was not present, but I saw him bring a great many articles from that room—the things altogether were worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

About four weeks ago I went up to examine the party wall—I looked into the cupboard, and there was a bundle in it—I did not open it—I did not use the cupboard—I was present part of the time the search was made—I did not see the policeman look into the cupboard—my young mistress, in his presence, pulled out these shawls, dress, and other things—I knew nothing of them—I did not put them there—the prisoner was there—she and I were the only servants in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a willow-square manufacturer, and live in Leonard-street, Shoreditch—I have known the prisoner nine months—he has been my errand-boy—I had reason to suspect, him, by finding my till unlocked one Monday, and on Tuesday last, the 16th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, my wife marked twenty-eight penny pieces, fourteen on each side—I saw them marked—I took them from her, and put them into the till—I locked the till, and put the key in my pocket—the prisoner did not sleep in the house—he was gone, home them—he came as six o'clock the next morning—the till was in the shop—I missed my money about seven o'clock—when he had been there about an hour—he had been in the shop alone—I found, the till open, and missed the eleven pence—I said nothing about it, but told him to light the fire, which he went about—I then got a policeman, who searched him in my presence, and found the eleven pence which I had lest, and which were marked—there were four pence more found on him, which were not mine—I did not find any key that would open the till.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 10, Mary-lb-Bonne lane; I am a salesman: On the 15th of December last the prisoner came to my shop with a pair of pistols, and offered them for sale; I asked him if they were his own, he said, yes, he had had them five years, and as he was out of place now, he would sell them; I asked him the price, and he said 12s. I told him I would give him 8s. he said he would take 9s. I told him I would give no more than 8s. he said I should have them, and I gave him a seven shilling piece and a shilling; I asked him against they were his own, and he said, yes, they were, I told him not to deceive me, he said then that is betwixt me and you; he was going out of doors and I called him back again; he came in, and I desired him, to lay down my money and take his pistols again, for I did not think they were his property; he said I bought them, and I should keep them; he refused to give up the money; he took up the pistols, and was going away with the money and the pistols; I told him if he did not put down the money I would send for a constable; I then sent for a constable and gave charge of him. (Produces them.)</p>

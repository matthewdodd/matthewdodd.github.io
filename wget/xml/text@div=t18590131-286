                  </hi>. I was an officer's-servant in the Marines when this occurred—on the 7th January I met the prisoner in King-street, Wool-wich—I did not know him before—there was another man with him—the prisoner said he had got some articles of wearing apparel which he had bought in China, that he belonged to a merchant-ship, that he had just come ashore—that he and his companion had been drinking, and were short of money, and he would make me a present of half-a-dozen pounds of tobacco if I would assist him off with some of the things—I said I thought I knew a party that would take the things if they were what he represented—we went to the Fox public-house in New Town, Deptford, where the shawls were opened, and likewise some dresses—he said that the shawls were worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that they were China crape shawls, and that he had bought them in China—he agreed to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to my house and got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he agreed to take, and was to call in the evening for the other pound—I took the things—a female acquaintance of my wife's had been speaking of buying such things, and I thought, if they were what was represented, she would have them—I believed them to be China crape shawls—I would not have bought them if I had not believed that.</p>

                  </hi> I am a ship-caulker, at Limehouse. On 6th Dec., I was caulking a ship at Bilingsgate—I saw William Thompson, Shay, and Williams go through the market together—I followed them—a gentleman was standing, with a basket in his hand, leaning on a place—Shay took hold of the gentleman's pocket, and William Thompson put his hand in and took out a silk handkerchief—they were all along side of each other—they then went to another part of the market, to Thomas Thompson, and sold him two handkerchiefs; he gave them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and William Thompson gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then said to Shay, "Have you got any more?"—he answered, "Yes, another one," and pulled out a white one with blue spots on it—another man, working in the market, bought it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I spoke to a constable, who took Thomas Thompson; and another constable took the other three.</p>

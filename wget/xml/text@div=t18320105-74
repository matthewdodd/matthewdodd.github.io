            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of December, I saw the prisoner in Broker's-alley, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, with a ham under his right arm; I followed him down Castle-street - he turned into a baker's shop, at the corner of Brownlow-street, and asked the way to Lincoln's Inn-fields. - I said,"I will show you;" I asked where he got that ham from- he said "I brought it from Tottenham-court-road, and I am going to Mr. Dickinson's" - I said, "I think you stole it;" and he then said, "I did take it, but for God's sake, keep it, and don't say any thing about it;" I took the ham home, and on the 26th, some person broke into my house, and stole it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you positively swear you saw me in the shop? A. Yes, you came in, and jumped up at the ham between ten and eleven o'clock; you had a jacket on like that, and I knew you by your size.</p>

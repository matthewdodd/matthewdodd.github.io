                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Lewellyn, of Gros<lb></lb>venor-row, Pimlico. On Thurday evening, 2nd Nov., I went to a public-house in Grosvenor-row—I had some gin and some beer with the prisoner—we then went to another public-house, and had some gin-and-water—I had a bundle on my lap with two gowns, a petticoat, a shawl, and a new pair of boots in it, which were all my property—my husband afterwards came in.</p>

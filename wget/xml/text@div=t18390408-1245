                  </hi>. I live in Exeter-street, Sloane-street. The prisoner Henry Strickland was in my employ as a painter—the officer said he had taken his wife up—I went to the station-house, and then to No. 40, Ca<lb></lb>dogan-place, where Henry Strickland was at work—he said he had given his wife some paint to paint a room and a door—I had not seen his wife before that day—I believe this paint is mine—I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>with a basket containing three pots and some paint—she said she brought it from No. 46, Cadogan-place, where her husband, was at work, and was going to take it to another job—I took her to the station-house, and went to the prosecutor—I went with him to Cadogan-place, where Henry Strickland was at work—he said given his wife a little green paint to paint a door—when we got to the station-house the prosecutor was sur<lb></lb>prised to see so much paint, and of a different colour to the green—he then said he got it to paint his room, and he took the whole of it and gave it to his wife—I believe she is his wife—I saw the certificate of their marriage.</p>

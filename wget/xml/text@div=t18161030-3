            . I was taken up on suspicion of having forged bank notes in my possession. I was taken up twice, The last time on the 23rd of September. I believe I was discharged. After that, I was employed under the solicitor for the Bank of England, to detect the prisoner at the bar. I was employed by Mr. Westwood to detect as many as I knew. I met the prisoner at the bar, in company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300008"></xptr>with other persons, on the 15th of September. I met her at the sign of the George public house, near Whitechapel church.</p>
               <p>Q. do you happen to know whether that person had been taken up - A. I certainly knew that he had been taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. had you any conversation with her on that day about forged notes - A. I believe I had.</p>
               <p>Q. what was it - A. I am not certain; it was not particular. I did not make any appointment with her she made an appointment with me; she told me if she heard any news she would call on me on the Thursday; if not, on the Friday morning. She did not come. I did not see her afterwards until a person with whom I then lived gave me some information; and in consequence of a message that was left for me, I met her again on the twenty second of September, that was on a Sunday; I believe, at the Pewter Platter in White Lion street, Nortonfalgate, that was on Sunday the twenty second.</p>
               <p>Q. was any appointment then made to meet on the following day - A. yes; I was to meet her at nine o'clock the next evening the twenty third; she told me that we were to meet at the Three Tunns; I told her I did not know the Three Tuns she described the way to me; she said if you come up to the top of the street by the Jews chappel, and turn to your right hand, the first public house you come to is the Three Tunns she described to me the place where we were to meet; that was the place I was to meet her at</p>
               <p>Q. what were you to meet for - A. I had told her on the twenty second, that I wanted twenty; she answerd that I was to tell her exactly how many I wanted, and she would not bring any more with her than I could take. I told her that I could not be-sure I could take more or not; but I would engage to take twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you talked of taking twenty, what were you speaking of - A. I was meaning forged notes; we were two well acpuainted with that commodity to mistake each other; we generally talked of them as the thing, or screens, or queer thing. The Three Tunns was the place that I went to, but I found that the house that was the first was on my right, and I went on to White Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate the appointment you had made to any one - A. Yes, to Mr. Christmas, and the peace officers. In consequence of that, I was searched on the Monday, the 23rd, by Mr. John Foy, first, and I believe Mr.

            , afterwards; I had nothing more about me than a few halfpence; two shillings were given me by Mr. Christmas to spend and seven genuine one pound Bank of England notes and three pound in silver, making to the amount of ten pound together; the price I was to give was ten pound for them, that money would purchase twenty. Then I went to the Seven stars in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the person who had attended the search go with you - A. Yes; Jefferies went part of the way in company with me; when we got near the place, he drew a little behind, and let me go in first the other followed me I believe at a distance. When I went into the house, I called for a pint of beer; the prisoner came in afterwards; it might be within half an hour, or a little more; she asked me how I did; I said the same to her. Then she made an apology for making the mistake in saying it was the Three Tuns, as she afterwards found out it was the Seven Stars; after that, she asked me to walk a little way; I said most certainly, and we came out to the door; she stopped at the door half a minute, or near, I dare say; there was nothing passed there in particular. We walked from there up Brick-lane; there was no other in company with us two. We walked to the corner of Old Montague-street; in our walk there, we made an appointment to meet on Thursday; the 23rd was a Monday. When we got to the corner of Old Montague-street, we made a stop, but for what, I can't say, it was for nothing in particular. We then went down <placeName id="t18161030-3-crimeloc15">Old Montague-street</placeName>

When we stopped, she said, is the thing all ready; I said yes; I then gave her seven one-pound Bank of England notes; this was in the street near the Cock and Key. I gave her the notes, and three pounds in silver, the same which I received from Mr. Foy. When she received the money, she said, you devil, why did you not wrap the silver up in the notes; I believe the most part of the silver was in tokens; I then gave her the silver, and she said, she would not be a minute before she returned; she went away; she was not longer than five minutes away, before she returned. When she came back, she gave me the roll of paper, and said, on Thursday night remember. I then put the bundle, or roll, which I suspected to be forged notes into my pocket. She was then going to bid me good night, and I called her then by her name, Mrs. Lawrence; that was the name by which I knew her; I said, won't you go and have something to drink before we part. We went into a public-house, the sign of the Cock and Key; we staid there no longer than while the landlord served us two glasses of gin; I paid for them, and received the change out of a shilling. We did not go above a dozen steps, before we were apprehended; it was before we had got out of the court where the Cock and Key is situated. I made a sign to the officers, to shew them that the dealing had taken place; I dare say I gave them words. Then we were apprehended, both I and the prisoner; that was the third time I was apprehended; I was only apprehended once on a real charge against myself. The officers took me and the prisoner into a house; Christmas and Jefferies took the prisoners; Jefferies also put his arm into my arm, and I made no resistance. They then took us to a house; the prisoner called out murder and robbery, and for assistance when she was apprehended. We were then taken to No. 8, King's Arms Court, kept by a person named Wilson. When we got into the house, Mr. Christmas searched the prisoner. Jefferies also searched her; they did not find anything particular on her; they found some shillings I believe. Mr. Christmas and Jefferies were standing by when I was searched; a roll of paper was found on me, Mr. Christmas took charge of them; he took it out of my pocket, that was the same I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300009"></xptr>received from the prisoner most certainly. Mr. Christmas asked me where I got them from? I said from the prisoner; that was in her presence; I don't know that she made any observation upon it. I belive she was asked what she was doing with me.</p>

They then went into Broker's-row, opposite the Crown and Cushion London-wall, I followed them, they still continued in company together, and conversing together, and they were conversing together more than ten minutes. I still continued to watch and observe them. They were together half an hour, or better; during the whole of that time, they appeared to be intimate and familiar together. Previous to the 23rd of September, I saw Charles; he made a communication to me. In consequence of that, Charles was searched; I saw him searched, it was at his lodgings;

             gave him seven one-pound notes and three pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was that given him - A. To purchase twenty forged one-pound notes. We then proceeded to the house where the appointment had been made, the Seven Stars, in Brick-lane; the witness Charles and Jefferies went together; I followed, and the two Foys with me. Charles and Jefferies went in there; I waited close at the door, and the two Foys were near to the place where I was. I waited there for about a quarter of an hour, or rather more, when the prisoner came in company with two men to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. This was after nine o'clock at night. I looked into the public-house; but I could not observe the parties. The man who went in with the prisoner came out in a few minutes afterwards; he came out, and came down Brick-lane. About ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner and Charles came out together; they just stopped at the door, and then went in; Jefferies came out immediately after them. The prisoner and Charles passed me. I heard the prisoner say to Charles, no, my dear, indeed I have not heard of him. They crossed the road, and went on. I was on the opposite side to them all the way. That street won't admit of more than two carriages abreast. They went to Old Montague-street, and Jefferies was following me close behind. They stopped there about a minute, and then went along Old Montague-street; Jefferies and I followed them; we were within three or four yards of them all the way through that street. and they stopped nearly opposite to the Cock and Key public-house, just beyond. The prisoner then left Charles, and went into King's Arms-court, just opposite. I went up to Charles, and spoke to him. I went a short distance, and she came back after a minute or so. Then they crossed over, and went into the Cock and Key; I saw them talking together in the passage of that house. They then came out, and were about parting; I then went over to Charles, and asked him if he had made a purchase, and he said yes. Then the prisoner was endeavouring to get away, when I went up to her; she was going away; she did not apprehend anything at that time as I know of. I went up to her, and took her into custody; I laid hold of her hand; Jefferys at the same time laid hold of Charles. The prisoner called out thieves! and murder! I did not treat her with any violence, only by holding her hand; she called that out several times, and several persons in the court opened their doors; and the prisoner said these men want to rob and murder me. I made a request of one of the persons, and in short, we want into No. 8, Mr. Wilson's, and the prisoner was searched there, and on her were found, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and a small key. I asked her her name, but she refused to give her name; Charles at the same time was present; Jefferies at the same time had hold of him; she refused giving any name or saying where she lived. I then searched Charles; I found in his left hand small clothes pocket twenty one-pound forged notes, they were rolled up in a roll; they were not tied, but were rolled tight up, and there was just a small bit of thread twisted round them I then asked the prisoner her name, a second time; she said her name was Woodman. I also asked her where she lived, and she said, she would not say, as it might disgrace her family. Upon finding these notes on Charles, I asked him where he got them; he said, from that person, pointing to the prisoner. I asked him for what purpose. She denied all knowledge of him; she said she never saw him before; she said she did not know who he was, nor what he was. I asked him for what purpose he had them from her; he said, he bought them from her, and gave her ten pounds for them; in fact, he said, I gave ten pounds for them to that person; she made no reply.</p>

Now I would ask you from the time at which you saw Charles at his lodgings, was there a possibility of his receiving the notes from any other person than the prisoner - A. No, he was not out of my sight, only while he was in the Seven Stars.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of their coming out, until the woman was apprehended, was there any possibility of his receiving them from any one else - A. No. I marked those notes that I took from Charles; I marked them that evening. I look at them; they are all forged, in the paper, and in the hand-writing; and they are forged in every respect; they import to be the signatures of the different persons who are signing clerks; but they are not the hand-writing of those persons; they are all of one stamp.</p>

After he came out again, I followed him to the corner of Old Montague-street; during the time I watched them, he could not have had any communication with any other person except the prisoner. I was not present when they were apprehended; I lost them for a short time, but got to them again in Whitechapel-road, and the prisoner was then in custody. I searched the prisoner; I told the prisoner she was charged with having sold forged notes. I asked her her name; she said her name was Woodman. So I asked her who the man was she had been drinking with, and she said he was a man she had known about twelve months, and had occasionally called to see her. I asked her whether she met him by appointment or accident that evening, and she said by accident. I asked her how long it was since she had seen him before that evening; and she said some weeks, more than a month. I had seen them in company together on the 18th, in Moorfields. I asked her where she lived, and she would not tell. I had seen her on the 15th and 18th in company with Charles. I had furnished him with ten pounds, seven pounds in notes and three pounds in silver.</p>

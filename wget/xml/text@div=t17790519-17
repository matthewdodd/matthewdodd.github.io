I saw the prisoner hide five bottles of wine in the coal-hole of my master's house. I saw him carry them from the pantry to the coal-hole, in a secret manner. I have twice heard the prisoner confess he took the wine out of Mr. Baldero's cellar. I found a pint of Madeira and a bottle of Frontiniac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190019"></xptr> in a box of the prisoner's, containing some linen; the wine was under the linen.

               <p>I am a constable. On Friday morning I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I went between eight and nine in the morning; the prisoner was then in bed. I was desired by the other servants to search the prisoner's things; I did and found two bottles of wine under his linen in the box, and one under the bedclothes; I found five bottles of wine in the coal-hole. Mr. Baldero asked him how he came by the wine, he confessed that he took the key out of the parlour, and opened the cellar, and took out the wine. One of the bottles was not full. He fell on his knees and asked his master's pardon. Mrs. Baldero charged him with having the key of the locker in the back parlour in which the key of the cellar was kept; the prisoner denied it; I searched him and found the key upon him.</p>

               <p>I keep the Bedford Arms in Charlotte-street, near Mr. Baldero's, in Bedford-square. On Thursday the prisoner brought a basket with three bottles in it to my house, and desired me to take care of them till I saw him; I do not know what was in the bottles. I never saw him afterwards, till I saw him here</p>
               <p>JOHN BALDERO Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was charged with taking the wine, he went down on his knees and begged I would forgive him. He confessed that he took a small key that belonged to the locker off the side board, out of which locker he took the key of the wine vaults, and went down and got the wine out of the wine vaults. This confession related to the five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether this confession came freely from the prisoner, or was obtained by promises? - There were no promises whatsoever; I charged him with being ungrateful, I had been a friend to him in a particular manner; he went down on his knees and desired me to forgive him; I desired him to get up off his knees, I said I should certainly prosecute him, and I went into another room.</p>
               <p>Is there any marks on the bottle? - I cannot say that there is.</p>
               <p>Whether you apprehend him to have been guilty of taking all the wine at one time, or that it was taken on different days? - Different days I believe.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have often sent for wine; I have bought wine several times of Mr. Walden; I could not get a glass of wine in the house, I had always the key of the locker; the night before Mr. Baldero went to Bath my master's son delivered me out five bottles; my mistress charged me with drinking the wine; I said I could tell her when they were opened time and place; she took the key of the locker from me.</p>

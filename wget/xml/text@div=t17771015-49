               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Neither: I walked to this house: I was attended and guarded by both arms by the girls; the prisoner is one of them; I made an agreement to be concerned with the other girl, not the prisoner; she did not choose to be concerned with me without I pulled my breeches off; I pulled my breeches off while I was lying on the bed with the girl I had agreed with; the prisoner gathered up my breeches, put the candle out, and ran off with them; I saw her take them up, and saw the breeches in her hand; I seized on the girl I was concerned with, and called for a constable; I got somebody to assist me, and went to a public house; whilst I was at the public house, a little boy brought me my breeches; they then began pushing me about; I put my breeches on directly; every farthing of the money was gone which was in my pocket; when I pulled them off, before I was concerned with the girl, I gave the prisoner two pence or two pence halfpenny to get some gin and a candle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Little Russell-street, Bloomsbury. I have known the prisoner a few years, and have occasion<lb></lb>ally employed him to go on errands for me—he owed me a debt—I partly paid him money for errands, and partly wrote it off against the debt—I have occasionally sent him with money to a person named Geary—the prisoner came to me on the 6th of November, and asked me if I had any money to send to Geary—I entrusted him with six sovereigns, eighteen shillings, and three halfpence—he knew where to take it—he went off with the money, and spent it.</p>

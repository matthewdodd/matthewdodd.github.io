                  </hi>. I am a clergyman living at Parsonage House, Rye Lane, Peckham—on Monday, 13 th May, I went to bed about 11 P.m.—the house was all safe—I heard a noise about 1 o'clock—I roused my wife and family—my son and I went down and found the nursery window open and the shutter down—a carpet, five chairs, and three Bibles were missing—the prisoner was outside—I asked him to give me a hand in with the chairs—he did so—I afterwards saw this jacket at the police-court—it is my property—I asked the prisoner what business he had there—he gave several confused and broken answers.</p>

                  </hi>. I went down stairs before my father and saw the window broken and the sash reversed—I went on to the slope—I saw the prisoner, and the chairs, a carpet, and three Bibles—I said "Whatever are you here for?"—he said "Oh, I was told to take charge of these chairs"—the things were all in the house the previous night—I said to the prisoner "Will you help me in with these, please"—he said "I will, most willingly," and he did so—I kept him in conversation till a policeman came, and gave him into custody.</p>

I went to a beershop in Rye Lane to fetch my apron and putty-knife, which I had left there a day or two before, and on going home at 12 o'clock at night I met a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who said."Give us a hand with one or two things down here." I had had a drop too much and I went with him. He says "Here's the things."I stood by the things a little while, when the policeman came up and took me. The gentleman asked me if I would hand the things in, and I helped him in directly. That is all I know about it.<hi rend="smallCaps">

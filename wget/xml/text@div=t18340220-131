            . I am a porter - on passing through Duke-street, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner step to Williams's door, and take the merino from a pile - some of the pieces fell on the pavement - I said to him, "Great is the fall," being in the habit of joking with the prosecutor's men - he made no reply; but picked them up, put them under his arm, and went off- I am quite sure he is the person - the goods were standing in the shop - I followed the prisoner, and stopped him in Seymour-mews - the policeman took him in charge - he said, "Let me go, if you please."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your business? A. I am porter to Mr. Hawkins, of Edward-street - the prisoner was the man I apprehended - I did not find any merino about him - I cannot say how far I took him from the shop - I do not remember two gentlemen attending before the magistrate, and saying he was not the man, but a taller man- I will not swear it did not pass - I am sure he is the man who knocked down the things - I have not said I could not swear to him - I never lost sight of him - I was on the same side of the way - I never said I was on the other, to my knowledge - it was a rainy evening - I have been to the prisoner's mother since he has been in gaol.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far were you from the prisoner? A. When he took the things from the shop, I was as close to him as I am to those goods, and saw him take them from the pile.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went to the prisoner's mother, did you not say, "Say nothing to the policeman, and I will do it?" A. Not to my knowledge - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200083"></xptr>know a person named Storr - I did not tell Storr that the prisoner was not the man, and I could not swear to him, as it was a very dark night - I never said it, to my knowledge - I do not recollect that I did.</p>

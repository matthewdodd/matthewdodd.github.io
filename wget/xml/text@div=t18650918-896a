                  </hi>. I live at the works of the General Steam Navi<lb></lb>gation Company in the Stowage Deptford—on 15th May, 1864, on going into the ore garden, I saw that it had been upset and traced the marks of a large pipe as if it had rested on the ground—in consequence of that I examined the factory which adjoins the garden and found that three copper pipes were missing—they weighed about 600lbs. and they were worth about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen them there on the Saturday before—I traced the marks to a field next to the garden and there lost them—the prisoner had worked in the factory some time previous—he would know all about the premises—on the Monday after this I saw the same pipes in the possession of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Hayles-street, Deptford, and am a labourer—one Monday in May 1864 about half-past 5 or quarter to 6, the prisoner came to my father's house and engaged his horse and ran—I went with him into Copperas-lane Deptford—the prisoner told me to back the van round to the posts—I did so and he went along with another man and fetched out a pipe put it in the van and went back and fetched another—there were three pipes altogether—when they were all in the van the prisoner told me to drive up as far as the Half-way House in the Kent-road—I drove towards there as directed—before we got to the Half-way House the police stopped the ran and took the pipes in it.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday the 16th May last year I went into the premises of the General Steam Navigation Company—I examined the garden and found several footmarks and saw that something had passed over the fence and on the ground at the other side of the fence there was the impression of a large flange—I traced the marks across the adjoining field over another fence into a lane—a cart could pass down that lane—it is 200 or 300 yards from Copperas-lane—there were prints of two small wheels as if a barrow had been drawn up to the fence—I followed the track of those wheels into the neighbourhood of Pope's-buildings—on Monday morning about 3 o'olock I and two other constables secreted ourselves in a garden at the bottom of Copperas—lane—about half-past 3, I saw the prisoner come out of No. 13 and he marched about two or three times close to where I was—two other men joined him and they went to and from there until about half-past 5 or quarter to 6—I then lost sight of the prisoner—he then came down Copperas-lane with a van—Woolford was with him—the van was bucked up to the end of a narrow street against some posts—the tail board was taken down and the prisoner went away with one man and the other stood and watched—shortly afterwards they returned with one of the pipes and put it into the van they went again and brought out the three and the van started off—I ran after the three men—the prisoner ran into a house in Griffin-street about 150 yards off and I tost him—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody, about a fortight or three weeks ago—I have been looking for him since the robbery several times—I saw what was in the van—the pipes were after<lb></lb>wards shown to Mr. Beard more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of James Piper, a butcher, of Brentford and Isleworth—on 13th March, about one in the day, a man came in and asked for change for a half-crown—I gave it to him in silver and he left—after that another man came in for a biscuit, and paid me with two half<lb></lb>pence—the prisoner afterwards came in and asked me for two biscuits—he gave me a half-sovereign, and I went into the parlour for change—one of the other men followed me from the street into the parlour—that was the man for whom I had changed the half-crown—he said, "He <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> want any change now"—I had got the change ready then—he followed me back into the shop and said a second time, "He does not want change"—I put the half-sovereign on the counter, and the prisoner said, "I want change, "and put the half-sovereign again into my hand with the head uppermost—another customer then came in, and I gave the prisoner 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and fourpence in copper—the prisoner and the man for whom I had changed the half-crown went out together—I then turned the half-sovereign over, and saw on the other side the Prince of Wales' feathers—I ran after the prisoner and saw him running away with the other man—I took the coin to my uncle, Thomas Piper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long after the first man came in, did the second come in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Directly, and the prisoner came in two or three minutes—we have not a good deal of custom at that time of day—the half-sovereign was on the table in the parlour while I was getting the change, which was not a minute hardly. I brought it back because the man told me the prisoner did not want change—if he had not done so, I should have left it in the parlour—I put it down near me on the counter, and the prisoner took it up as it lay and put it into my hand after I had given him the change—I found out that it was bad not a moment after he had gone—they had got quite 100 yards away, and were walking away together.</p>

               <p>she pointed out, "I want you"—he said "What for?"—I said, "Have not you been into a baker's shop over the bridge?"—he said, "And what of that"—I took him in custody, and he resisted, but not much—I said, "It is for passing a bad half-sovereign"—he said he had never heard of such a thing—the other man tried to resist, but I took him the back way to my house—a man I gave him in custody to said, "Do not strike the poor man, "so he let go of the other and he walked round to the front door—I detained the prisoner three-quarters of an hour in my parlour before I could got a policeman, and the other man came and said, "What has the poor man been at"—the prisoner wanted to know what I detained him for—he put bis hand in his pocket and said to the other, "I tell you what it is, that coin that I took yesterday I put in my pocket, and must have given it by mistake"—he said that he should not stop—I said he should not go, and gave him in charge—the Magistrate let the other man go.</p>

This is a medal made of metal—it is the same diameter as a half-sovereign, and has the Queen's head on the obverse similar to that on a half-sovereign, but the legend is entirely different, it is, "Victoria, Queen of Great Britain, "at full length, instead of "Victoria, Dei gratia"—the colour is somewhat similar.

The <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> considered that a counterfeit Napoleon was a medal, whereas a genuine one would be a "coin of less value than a sovereign; "it was a separate misdemeanor to utter a medal, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

The <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> could not withdraw the case from the Jury, and considered that the word "figure" meant effigy as well as general resemblance, and that the figure must be such as to deceive a person of ordinary observation.</p>

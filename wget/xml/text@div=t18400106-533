                  </hi>I am the prosecutor's son. I was at home on the 19th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening—Hill had been out—he came into the bake-house again, and soon after Wright came in with a basket for his baked potatoes—I was in the flour-loft over the bake-house, and saw through an opening in the floor, Wright go to the oven door—he then turned round to Hill with a bag, and they went to the flour trough—I could not then see the full person of them both, but I saw the hand of one of them lift up the lid of the trough—I could not swear that they were filling the bag, but they did fill it—I saw the trough lid let down, and Wright brought the flour in the bag in the basket right under ray eyes again—he covered the bag over with the potato flannel and walked away—neither the bag nor the basket were my father's—I am sure Hill was in the bake-house, and they both went to the trough which was in the bake-house—Wright went out with the basket, and I waited in the loft till Hill went out—my brother then ran for a constable—I went with the constable, who found the bag of flour in Wright's house—he was out at the time—his wife denied it at first, but it was found in the bed-room, I believe, but I did not go up stairs—this is the bag—it contains flour—I know the sort of flour my father had, but not to swear to it—I believe this to be the bag, but I cannot swear to it, and I believe this flour in it to be the quality of flour my father had—it is the best household flour.</p>

Is it best or seconds? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>., Best—my father had none but best in the trough—I went from the bake-house to the loft—I left no one in the bake-house—the hole in the floor, through which I saw this, was about an inch wide, and about the length of my fingers—I saw both the prisoners distinctly, but when they got to the trough I saw only the hand of one of them, as the opening would not admit of my seeing their persons there—I first saw Wright with the bag in his hand, which was rolled up and empty—when I saw it full it was closed—I did not see what was in it, but I am sure there was flour in it, because there was nothing in the trough but flour—he put the bag in the basket, which was a hand-basket, which he carried on his arm—I should have thought there was about a peck of flour in it, which would be worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>I am a constable of Ilford. I went with the prosecutor's son to Wright's house, which is a small cottage—we got there between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—Wright was not at home—I asked his wife if she would allow me to search the house—she said, "Yes"—I went to the cupboard, and found a small quantity of flour—I had Hill with me, and I said to him, "What sort of a bag was it boy? "—he said, "A pillow-case"—Mrs. Wright said directly, if Mr. Gattey would not hurt them, she would produce the flour—she went up stairs—I followed her, and she gave me this flour in this pillow-case.</p>

Thir<lb></lb>teen years—I have been here a great many times—I did not get my ex<lb></lb>penses once, because I did not produce the property, which was some large pieces of timber—I had them at my house, and part of them is there still—the parties might have had it if they had come for it—the timber was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were two pieces, about six feet long—I did not bring them, as it was nine miles off—that was the only occasion on which my expenses were refused—I am a pork-butcher by trade, but have been a</p>

               <p>constable many years, and have lost my trade through doing my duty—I have not said I had got another job, and I was very glad—when Hill said it was in a pillow-case Thomas Clarke Gattey was present, and two of his brothers—he did not look at the flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Shaw, of Stanhope terrace, St. Pancras, and have been so three months—on 17th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came—I knew him by his living in the same house as my mother, and had seen him frequently, but only once to speak to him—he knocked at the door and said, "Put on your bonnet, and come with me directly"—I looked at him, and he said, "Don't you know me?"—I said, "Yes," and went and told my mistress—she said, "What do you want with my servant?"—he said, "Aye?"—she said, "What do you want with my servant?""—he went away, and we saw no more of him then—I fastened up the doors that night from 10 to half-past, and went to bed—the area door has wood at the bottom and glass at the top, but the glass had been broken the week before, and a person could put a hand in, and unbolt it—I found it unbolted at 1 o'clock—I heard a noise by the breakage of the kitchen window—the prisoner threw one of his boots through it, which I found in the kitchen—I do not know whether he is quite right in his mind.</p>

            . I am clerk to Thomas Groves. The prisoner was in his service; on the 18th of February I gave him 10s., with a written order to get some nails - I told him to bring a bill of them; he returned with this bill, which amounts to 8s. 8d. - he brought me 1s. 4d; I told him one item was much overcharged; and on Wednesday morning, as he was going by the shop, I desired him to call and get it corrected - Mr. Adams sent the bill back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you sent him? A. To Messrs. Adams and Morris; I think I mentioned the mistake to him on the 18th - he staid with us till Thursday morning, when he was taken.</p>

            . I am shopman to Morris and Adams. On the 18th of February the prisoner came with an order; I sent the goods with this bill - it amounted to 6s. 8d., but since it left our shop a figure of 2s. has been added to an item of 11d., and the 6s. at the bottom is altered to 8s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you enter it in your book? A. Yes, it is 6s. 8d. there - I looked at the entry yesterday; I am certain of it without referring to the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the bill now in the state the prisoner brought it to you? A. It is.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When he returned did he not tell you he had made a mistake? A. He gave the bill to Mr. Adams, and said it was a mistake; Mr. Adams called me and said it was a mistake of mine - I said it was not; the prisoner wished me to write a note, and give him the bill back, but I would not and kept it, saying there was a gross imposition some where.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your deposition copied three time? A. The clerk made so many mistakes, the Magistrate said he would have them copied again, or they could not be read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure the alterations in the bill are not your making? A. I am.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring his innocence.</p>

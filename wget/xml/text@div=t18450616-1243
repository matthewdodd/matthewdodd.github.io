                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Ingatestone-batt, under Lord Petre. I was in town on Wednesday, the 11th of June—I was coming from Cromer-house, Chelsea, towards the Eastern Counties Railway—I wanted to get down by the mail-train in the evening—on my way I fell in with the prisoner—I asked him the nearest way, because I was afraid I should be too late for the train—he said he was going the best part of the way, and he would show me the way—on the way we called in at two public-houses, and had two pints of ale—when I got to the railway I found I was too late for the train—we then went and had another pint of ale—I was about to leave, when the prisoner asked what o'clock it was—as soon as I drew my watch from my pocket, he snatched it from me, and ran away up Sun-street—I pursued, crying, "Stop thief I"—when I came up the prisoner was in custody, and a lad said, "Here, sir, is your watch"—it was secured round my neck by a strongish ribbon—it broke in two as he snatched the watch—it gave way at the first jerk—it required form to break it—I gave the watch to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never saw the man; my landlord and landlady can prove I was at work at the time he swears I was drinking with him; my land<lb></lb>lord sent me out with some boots; I saw a mob running, calling, "Stop thief!" I ran with them, and was taken. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not drunk—I do not know the signs of the public-houses we went into, or whereabouts I fell in with the prisoner—I should think we came nearly a mile together—I do not know London very well—I did not notice the time exactly.</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" about half-past ten o'clock on the night in question—I saw the prisoner running, and several boys and men following—I stopped him—Adams gave him in charge, and said he was robbed of a watch—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—the prosecutor was unacquainted with London, but showed me where he was robbed, which was about a minute and a half's walk from where I stopped the prisoner, but some dis<lb></lb>tance from the Eastern Counties Railway—the prisoner said he was employed by Mr. Hoppe, of Bishopsgate-street, which we find is not correct—the prosecutor was sober I am confident—a young man in the</p>

               <p>crowd said he had picked the watch up, and that he saw the prisoner throw it down—he gave the watch to Mr. Adams—I desired him tocome to the station, but he did not.</p>

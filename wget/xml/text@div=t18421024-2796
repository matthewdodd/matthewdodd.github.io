I have retired from business, and live in Barnsbury-square, Islington-the prisoners were both in ray service, Harriet for about five months, and Mary for eleven months—I am in the habit of regularly balancing my cash. On the 28th of July, on my return from Rams<lb></lb>eate, I received a sum of money at the Bank, principally in new sovereigns of the present reign—On the 20th of September I balanced my cash, and was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficient, after allowing for all expenses that I was aware of—I keep a regular petty cash account of all my expenses—I kept my money locked up in a deed box in my bed-room—I generally kept the key in my pocket—I had marked some money—there were a good many notes and sovereigns in the deed-box—I have not traced any marked money to Harriet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Bedford-row, Lower Barnsbury-street, Islington—I get my living by my needle. The prisoner Harriet brought a box to my house, and asked me if I would take charge of it for a few weeks till she left her place, for that her sister Mary would not allow it to continue under the bed, but as fast as she put it under, her sister kicked it out again—I said she might put it down in our kitchen, there was plenty of room—I allowed her to leave it, and it remained there till Thatcher, the officer, called about it—it was not opened in my presence—before the officer came for it, I went to Mr. Walton's house, saw Harriet, and told her I was very sorry to hear what had happened—I told her I had heard that Mary was charged with some offence, and asked if it was true—she said it was true—I said, "You remember you brought a box of yours to my house"—she directly said, "Not mine, it was Marys"—I said, "Why, Harriet, you brought it to me as your box"—she said, No, it is Mary's"—I said, "Well, I should wish you to fetch it away"—I said my landlord had been to me, and said he wished me to seek out for another house, and I told her after hearing what I had I was not very easy at the box re<lb></lb>maining at my house, there might be something in it that there should not be, I hoped there was not, but I could not tell—she said I need not be afraid, she could not fetch it away, for they were not allowed to come outside the gate, and asked if I could send it anywhere—I said I could not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. After Mary was charged, Harriet of her own accord came to me, and said that she felt very uneasy about a box that her sister Mary wished her to take one evening when she went out to fetch beer, to Mrs. Ratnett, with Mary's love, and that she wished her to let it remain there till she (Harriet) left her place, which she was going to do after Michaelmas—I told her she had better have stated that to the inspector or to Mr. Walton—the inspector soon after called—I told him, rang the bell, Harriet came up, and stated the same to him—I cannot identify the gin or wine or the bottles—I can speak to these two towels by a mark.</p>

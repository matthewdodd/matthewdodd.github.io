The prisoner's father had been in my employ four years and a quarter - I had in my office, among other things, a great many books of a bankrupt's estate; I missed some of them - the officer called on me in a few days, and produced two books, which were part of what I had lost; I then made further search, and found some books at Mr. Durbin's, Mr. Catchpole's and Mr. Atkinson's - they were all my property except one, which I have a doubt about; whether they were all taken at one time I cannot tell - the prisoner used to come to his father in an evening; my books had been kept in a separate room.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Rosemary-lane. I know the prisoner - he often came to my shop with books to sell; the officer came and took twenty-one books away, which I had bought of the prisoner - I never bought two at one time; I gave him 3d. or 3 1/2d. a lb. for them according to what they were; I asked how he came by them - he said they were his father's perquisites; he gave me his father's address, and said he was clerk to a solicitor of Bankrupts. I did not go to enquire, as a neighbour's boy came by at the time, and said he went to school with him; I bought some of them, and my shopman or wife bought some others; some of them are twenty-five, and some thirty years old.</p>

I gave the prisoner a lodging till he could get a situation - He used to help me sometimes; having missed some money, I got Mr. French to mark some in my presence, on the 1st of April, about ten o'clock in the morning; I went to the till at one o'clock and missed five pieces of the marked money - I had marked 30s. I went up to the prisoner's drawers, and found a 3s. piece in his purse, that was market; I am sure it was one that had been marked that day. I sent for Mayhew, the officer, and told the prisoner I was determined to find out who it was that had robbed me; the officer searched him in my presence, and found 1l. 12s., in silver, upon him-among which there was a 3s. token, a 1s. 6d. token, a half-crown, and 2s. that were marked with my mark. All the money in the till was marked; the prisoner had nothing to do with the till. I went up to his drawers with the officer, and found 2l. in notes, and 1l., in silver, among which was a 3s. piece belonging to me; he said it was his own. He begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I did not know it was necessary to bring French; there were two lodgers in the house besides the prisoner. I lost 18s. out of 30s., and found 12s. upon the prisoner, which were mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of April, about two o'clock, I took charge of the prisoner. Bates told him he suspected him; he said he was surprised. I found 1l. 12s., in silver, in his breeches pocket; he said it was his own. Bates picked out a 3s. token, a 1s.6d. token, a half-crown and 2s., which were all marked in the same way - He said it was his own. We found 1l., in silver, in a purse up stairs-Mr. Bates claimed a 3s., token; French was present, and told the prisoner it was the money he had marked; he fell down and begged forgiveness; when he was before the magistrate, he said all the money was his but that which was marked, and that was the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This was not taken down in writing, the clerk said it was not necessary for French to attend here.</p>

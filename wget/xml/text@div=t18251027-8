            . I am shopman to Mr. Aldus, pawnbroker, Berwick-street, Soho. On Friday, the 7th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and brought this time-piece to pawn for 1 l. - I never saw him before; I asked whose it was; he said his own, and he had given 2 l. 10 s. for it: I asked what he had done with the glass shade which should cover it; he said a looking-glass had fallen down and broken, and had also broken the shade. I lent him 1 l. on it, but after he was gone, on examination, I ascertained that it was worth 5 l. to us. He came the next week for 15 s. more on it; I questioned him again - he said he had given 3 l. 10 s for it: I said you differ now in your story; he said he had made a mistake before, that it was 3 l. 10 s., and it had cost 16 l. I went out at the private door and gave him in charge of Gook: he gave me the name of John Tool, No. 44, Newport-street.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took him in charge on the 14th, at Aldus's shop, took him to the watch-house, and on searching him, found the duplicate of a time-piece, pawned on the 7th. He at first denied having taken it, but afterwards said he had done it from distress.</p>

I was engaged to work at this house for two days; one of the labourers set me on; about half-past five o'clock I was very ill - six o'clock being the time to leave work, I left, and as I was going home I met a young man: he asked me to pawn some things for him; I said yes, if they were got honestly. I had been in his company, and won 3 l. of him at skittles, and said I would take them of him for that - he gave me the time-piece and two large table spoons.</p>

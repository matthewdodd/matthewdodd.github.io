                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 348). On 7th January I was called by the prosecutors to go to Prince's-dock, Rotherhithe—I was in plain clothes—I saw Graham's waggon in the road, in front of the dock, soon after 5 o'clock—it had been there all day, loading with sheething metal—Percival, Jelf, and three or four others were loading it—Preece was on the waggon; and the prisoner was in the dock-yard where they beat the metal up—I took Sullivan in custody first—I then came back and saw the waggon standing at a public-house—I saw a man I cannot identify, run through a court with some metal under his arm—I then saw Jelf take some, and then the prisoner took an armful—Sullivan pleaded guilty, and the others were tried</p>

               <p>and convicted (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 342)—the waggon was, I think, at the Angel public-house—that is in Paradise-street, half a mile from the dock, not on the direct road, but out of the way—the man I cannot identify turned up a court leading into Clark's orchard, where a man named McGregor lived—he was in conversation with the other man—when Jelf came back I saw the prisoner partly in and partly out of the wicket gate to McGrego's premises—I caught hold of him—he had this metal under his arm—I pulled him back, and the metal fell part in the yard and part out—we scuffled together and were up and down two or three times—we got across the street into a narrow court and at last he got away—I could not follow him as fast as he went—I had seen him take the metal from the tail of the waggon—he was taken in custody last Tuesday.</p>

I am one of the house of Vivian and Sons, 13, Upper Thames-street—on 7th January we were stripping the ship <hi rend="italic">Gwalior</hi>, which we had sheathed in 1848, and were about to re-sheath her—I have seen this metal—it is marked "V. and S," it was worth 7 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound at this time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Vivian—Percival was in our employ on 7th January—he had charge of a set of men to go down to the Prince's-dock and strip the <hi rend="italic">Gwalior</hi>—the prisoner had worked for us about two months—I saw the metal two sessions ago.</p>

Q.</hi> Was he working under Percival? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Percival was foreman of the job, and the others were under him—copper stripped from other vessels would be of the same description as this—we have sheathed many others—I have known the prisoner two months, and have no reason to doubt his honesty.</p>

I went there between six and seven o'clock. I had had some beer, but was not quite drunk. I believe I had a pot of porter there. I had a sovereign and some silver in my pocket; I was sober enough to know that; I had been with a woman before, but I was sober and solid then. I had been in company with women during the day. I do not know whether they were women of the town. I had some beer with them, on my way from Chelsea. After I got to the George and Ball, I went to sleep - there were several other men and women in the box with me. I awoke in half an hour, and missed all my money - the button was broken off my breeches pocket. I do not know that I went to the George and Ball with another woman. There was a black woman came with us from Chelsea - she might have gone into the public-house. I do not know who took the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Smith's-gardens, City-road, and am a constable of the Regent's-canal. On the morning of the 20th of March, I was on duty at No. 27 wharf—I saw the prisoner with the prosecutor Allen, who is captain of a boat called the <hi rend="italic">Noah's Ark</hi>, which was on the basin—Allen was drunk, and the prisoner appeared to have been drinking a little—I saw them both on board the captain's boat, and I saw the prisoner shut the cabin-door, by pull<lb></lb>ing the slide—I considered he had gone to bed—about half-past two I was on the same wharf, and heard footsteps—I saw the prisoner with a bundle—I asked what he had got in that bundle—he said, "A piece of beef "—I asked how he came by it—he said, "The captain gave it me"—I took him to the boat—the captain was asleep on the side bed, and the cabin in a confused state—I told the prisoner I should take him to the station, and he ran away—I called, "Stop thief," and he was stopped by a policeman—I found on him three half-crowns, one shilling, two sixpences, one penny, five halfpence, this ring, and a tobacco-box—I asked what he had got, he said 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when I found this, he said it was his own money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I thought about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he gave it me when he was tipsy; I did not look at it; I kept him up till I could bring him on board, and then he gave me this bit of beef, and began to grumble at me; I came out and laid on a barge for about an hour, and then I got up and walked about. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> When I went down into the cabin I saw the captain lying on the side bed, and the cross-bed turned up; I found a dish of salt beef; the drawers and cupboards were open; the captain was so drunk I could not awake him.</p>

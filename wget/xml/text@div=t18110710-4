On the 22d of June I lost the handkerchiefs out of the shop, they are things that I deal in. I had seen them within the shop about half an hour before I lost them, they were hanging in the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them - A. About twenty minutes before ten, in the evening, my wife and servant were in the shop, I was in the kitchen; I heard the breaking of a window, I ran up stairs directly; I observed both my wife and servant out side of the door, and as I passed the window I observed it broken, and my servant said the window was broken and some handkerchiefs were stolen out of the window; I saw the broken glass in the street. I pursed, but I did not see the prisoner untill he was stopped; he was taken to the watchhouse, I returned home to see what I had lost. I found I had lost two silk handkerchiefs. I took my servant Adamson to the watchhouse; she identified the prisoner. The handkerchiefs have never been found.</p>
               <p>HARRIOT ADAMSON. I live servant with Mr. Kerr. I was in the shop talking to my mistress when the window was broken, the candles were lighted, it was not quite dark when I heard the glass break; I ran out of door and saw the prisoner draw the handkerchiefs out of the broken square; I cannot say how many, nor what he did with them; I called out to my mistress, the man ran away, and I ran after him; he had the handkerchief in his right hand, behind him; I could not see what he did with the handkerchiefs; I called stop thief; he ran down Chandois Street, and I went home; in about half an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner in the watchhouse, he is the same man that I saw drawing the handkerchiefs out of the window, they were silk handkerchiefs.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner - A. It was a man; I cannot swear to the prisoner. The man was coming from Chandois Street; he went back to Mr. Kerr's shop, he dashed his fist through the glass and pulled the handkerchiefs out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that - A. Yes, and heard the glass break.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not know the man - A. No, he had the handkerchiefs in his right hand, and he bound them round his left hand as he went up the street. He ran down Chandois Street into the Strand. I did not see him taken.</p>

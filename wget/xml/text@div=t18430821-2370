                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Ealing. On Sunday night, the 16th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner in Brent<lb></lb>ford, just by the market-house—she said she wanted to speak to me, and im<lb></lb>mediately put her hand into my pocket—I had a shilling there not a minute before—I caught hold of her, and asked her for it again—she said, "You should not give it to me, and want it again"—five or six more girls came up, and a young man—I walked up the street with her, and the young man said if I did not let her go he would upset me, and they went into a public-house.</p>

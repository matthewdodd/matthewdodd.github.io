               <p>Q. Do you know the short one?</p>
               <p>Osmund. I believe Caliagan is he.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the dress or the face of the third man?</p>
               <p>Osmund. I believe he was one of the parties; he stood with his back to me, and, two or three times, turned about, then I saw his face, and I do believe he is the man; I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend it was he that took your money, or the other man?</p>

               <p>Osmund. I saw them this day fortnight: the moment I saw them I knew Jackson; I saw them before they struck the candle out: I was afraid they would cut my husband down, as I knew he carried but little money about him: I pleaded with them that they would not cut him down; I said I had ten children.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak then with certainty as to Jackson and Suttle?</p>
               <p>Osmund. Upon my oath they are the men; I verily believe the other is one of the men.</p>

               <p>Osmund. When I turned round and said I had a great family, and was pleading with them, the man that stood with his back to me said, D - n your blood you b - h, turn round and give them your money.</p>

               <p>Osmund. I did not remember any thing particular that night in his voice; as to Jackson, he has a particular voice; the moment I heard his voice before the justice I knew it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Artillery—on the 27th of December last I went in the barrack room No. 65 at Woolwich—the prisoner, myself, Baldwin, and Dewdney were there—the prisoner was sitting by the fire—words occurred—the prisoner took a sword from a shelf, drew it from its scabbard, and stabbed me twice, once in the right breast, and once in the left—Dewdney left the room previous to the sword being drawn, but came back—I was conveyed to the hospital—I did not draw my sword.</p>

I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery—I was in the barrack room at Woolwich on the 27th of December, about 6.30—I saw Maher, Murphy, and a civilian named Baldwin there—I left the room but returned—when I returned gunner Maher had a sword in his hand trying to stab Murphy—I tried to take the sword from Maher—before I could do so he stabbed Murphy, and then stabbed me in the neck in the breast, and under the left arm—Murphy left the room, and I asked the prisoner to put the sword nor see any one use one except Maher.</p>

I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery—on the 27th of December last, about 6.30, I was passing the barrack-room; I heard a noise, and opened the door—I saw the prisoner with a sword—he stabbed Murphy once, and, making a second attempt—I went for assistance—when I came back the disturbance was at an end.</p>

I am a surgeon at Woolwich—on the 27th December I was called in to see Murphy and Dewdney, about 7.15 p.m.—Murphy had an incised wound in the neck; and another incised wound in the side of the month on the left cheek—they were serious at one time, but not the next morning—there were no after symptoms of crysipelas, or anything of that kind—Dewdney had three wounds, one in the neck at the top of the breast bone, another in the chest, and a third on the shoulders—Murphy I detained in the hospital, Dewdney I sent out the same night about an hour afterwads—his wounds were not dangerous.</p>

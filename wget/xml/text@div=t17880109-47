               <p>When did you go on board this ship? - The 10th of November, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who commanded the vessel? - Captain Barnard; the defendant was the mate of that ship.</p>
               <p>Was there any custom-house officer on board her at the time you went? - There were two on board on the 28th of December, 1787; I was on board the Mermaid; there were things that were sent away; and three casks and two jars, which the custom-house officers delivered into wherries, and I found that they should not be sent away in that; I delivered these thirteen casks and two jarrs of pickles, as I supposed they might be; I said to the custom-house officer, have you an order to deliver them? they said they had, but they had no business with it; then they told me they was to have ten shillings, and they gave me three shillings; and one of the sailors on board the Mary gave me an information; the prisoner was standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090083"></xptr>on the deck, and he said, what a d - n'd rascal you must be to do such a thing for such a small quantity as this; so as you have been served on board this ship; at first I said it is not I; he said, damn you, I know it is; I said, suppose I did, what then? I was on the quarter deck; says he, I wish I had you some where else; says he, this should not be all; I will have a d - n'd blow up for this, if I am hanged for it; says he, damn your eyes, get off the quarter deck; says I, I shall not go off for you; that was the last word he spoke at that time; I was walking on the deck till evening; and sitting on the main deck I heard a knocking in the cabin, I walked towards that way, and the knocking ceased before I came to the cabouse; I staid some little time, it might be ten minutes; I heard somebody coming up, that was the prisoner, and some other man; the prisoner had something under his arm; he came out of the cabin, the other man up'd with a large piece of wood, what they call a handspike; and before I came to him, he up'd with it in his hand; the man that was with Mr. Mackey.</p>
               <p>How near was he to Mackey when he aimed this blow? - Mr. Mackey was not so far as you are from the other man; they both came out of the cabin; he aimed the blow at me, and I dodged to avoid the blow, and the man threw the instrument at me, and knocked me down, and hit me in the small of my back; I never spoke to Mr. Mackey from that time in the afternoon, till the evening, not a syllable; I made up to him before the man aimed the blow, about two steps from the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>Are you positive whether you did or did not utter a syllable to him of any sort? - I did not, I never spoke.</p>
               <p>How long do you think it was between the time that this handspike was thrown at you, and the time of the conversation with Mackey? - Some hours had clapsed.</p>
               <p>What immediately followed when you was laid on the deck in that way? - Mackey and the other man came and kicked me when I was knocked down on the deck; Mr. Mackey, and the other man both kicked me several times about my body and in my face, but I cannot say that Mackey kicked me in the face; they both kicked me in the body, one on one side, and one on the other; no other of the ships crew kicked me; I said, for God's sake do not use me ill; Mackey said, d - n his eyes, kick him; and I received two kicks after that.</p>
               <p>Did he strike you after that? - I received two kicks, but I do not know whether he kicked me or the other man.</p>
               <p>Was you rendered insensible? - No, but I do not know which of the men it was; they were close to me; as soon as they went away from me, I might lay there a minute or two, then I went into the lighter, and I called sculler seven or eight times, a boat came along; the gentleman is here now, and he came and took me to St. Catherine's; his name is Stephens; I said, I shall be obliged to you if you will put your boat close, for I am so beat I do not know how to get into it; there was blood on me to be perceived; I had given them no provocation, by language, or any other means, nor any one soul on board the ship; no man can say I gave them a miss word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington, prisoner's counsel. How long have you been an officer of excise? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been an officer before? - Never; I went on board this vessel, the 10th of December, when she came into the port of London; a day or two after, I was on board constantly every day.</p>
               <p>You do not like rum? - Yes, I like a little now and then.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any on board the ship? - I found a cag; I did not know who it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Was not there a few words between you and Mr. Mackey about some rum of his that you made free with? - Never; I never had.</p>
               <p>Aye, or no; had you? - I never had a miss word with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090084"></xptr>What time of the day of this 28th of December did you come on board? - I have been there every day since the 10th.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you went on shore after being beat? - I do not think it was quite eight.</p>
               <p>How many men were on board this ship? - There were two or three, I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the boatswain? - Yes; Mr. White, I believe.</p>
               <p>Then you do not quite recollect his name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the boatswain in the course of that evening? - I did see him go on shore about half past six that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any time after that evening on board? - I did.</p>
               <p>What time? - It might be about half past twelve when he came on board the ship again.</p>
               <p>What part of the ship was you in then? - I sat on the cabouse.</p>
               <p>Was it in the cabouse that you saw the boatswain? - The boatswain came on board and asked me what I sat there for; the cabouse is the place where they make the fire; it is a thing built upon the deck; it is before the cabin.</p>
               <p>You always told this story in the same sort of way? - I said to him, I had been ill-used by the mate of the ship; he never asked me any more questions.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the boatswain that Mr. Mackey had knocked you down on the front of the face with a large piece of wood? - I did not.</p>
               <p>That you mean to swear? - I do.</p>
               <p>I am told it was a very light evening? - It was very dark; there was no moon at all.</p>
               <p>Being no moon at all; do you recollect who the other person was? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you know who was on board the ship besides Mackey? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body come on board? - I saw a mate of another ship come on board in the evening some time before; I did not see any more than one person come on board that evening; I know the mate of the Washington by person, but not his name.</p>
               <p>Was he in the cabin this evening? - I do not know whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to state now correctly how many men were on board the ship at this time? - I cannot say; there are about four belonging to the ship.</p>
               <p>After being beat, you called out loudly for scullers? - I did, as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>I look upon it they might have heard you from the next ship? - They might; for the next ship was close; every man on board the Mary might have heard me; I never went before Justice Staples; the Justice came to me.</p>
               <p>Did you give the same account to him then, that you have given us to-night? - I did, concerning Mr. Mackey's illusing me.</p>
               <p>Here is your information, and there is not a word of what passed between Mr. Mackey and you? - There is every word, if the gentleman speaks the truth.</p>
               <p>You went off before eight from the ship? - It was before eight; a little boy brought me back that used to attend the ship; he is a waterman's boy; I went back for fear our officers should come, and I should not be in the ship; the shore is not a stone's throw; I came back about nine; I cannot tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your duty on board at this time? - I was an excise officer on board of her, on an ullage of rum; I was on board for that, my duty was to see that nothing was carried out of the ship.</p>
               <p>What were you doing at the time that these two men attacked you? - I was sitting on the deck; it was past seven, I think; and I heard a knocking in the cabin; when they came up, I was sitting still on the main-deck; I saw Mr. Mackey had something under his arm, and I made up to him to see what he had under his arm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The boatswain, I understand, was the person to whom you spoke, after you had received this usage? - I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090085"></xptr>not say three words to him; I said, I had been ill-used by Mr. Mackey.</p>
               <p>The Justice attended you? - He did; I think I gave him the same account as I have given here, pretty nearly.</p>

               <p>When you came on board, what part of the ship did you go to? - I sat in the stern of the ship, an hour and half, and then in the cabouse.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, did not you recommend it to the prisoner at the bar, to bring all his smuggled goods on board the Washington? - I did not upon my oath; I said, if you had brought these things, and put them on board the Washington before, they would have been all safe; I intended that the officers should hear me.</p>
               <p>How many evenings had you spent with your friend Mr. Mackey, when he was on board the Mary, in the port of London? - Several.</p>
               <p>How came you to go out of your ship before the captain came on board that night? - Because there were three of us.</p>
               <p>If this man had been beat by any body, and had cried out, you must have heard it? - I must have heard it; I do not believe he was beat upon my word, there was no complaint that I heard till the next morning; I did not see him since, till now.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Peter about all the time? - He is not here; I believe he is gone in the country; I have not seen him since that night he came on board to take his leave; he was going into the West-country.</p>
               <p>How long have you been from America? - About four or five months.</p>
               <p>And never been in any of the Courts of Justice in America in your life? - Never; nor no other Court till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am not prepared to prove you was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Runnington. That is very indecently insinuated.</p>
               <p>You never was in custody there? - No, never was sworn in any Court.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was boatswain on the 28th of December; I know Dungate and Mackey.</p>
               <p>What time did you come on board on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090087"></xptr>the 28th? - About half after twelve at night; when I came on board, I heard somebody in the cabouse; I asked, who was there? and he said, it was me; I said, who is me? the officer, says he; says I, what is the meaning of your staying here at night? says he, why, I have been ill-used; says I, who ill-used you? says he, your mate has knocked, me down with a billet of wood; he told me positively so; he said he hit him in the face; I did not see him till the morning; I said, if he would not go to bed, I would; he said, he would not go to bed; he would stay there till morning.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL KNOWLYS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a seaman on board the Mary; I know Dungate the officer; I saw him on board the 28th of December, I remember that day perfectly well; but in the evening after it was dusk, I did not see him; I was on board the next ship; I went on board between five and six, and came back between six and seven.</p>
               <p>From that time till you went to bed, did you see Dungate there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any disturbance on board the ship? - No; I think I must have heard if any body had been crying out; I did not see Dungate till the next morning; at the time the boatswain came on board, he sung out, who has been killing the officer? he told me, that somebody had been knocking him in the face, or head, with a billet of wood; the next morning I saw him going up the stage as I lay in my hammock; I only saw his backside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now when the boatswain came on board he sung out, who has been killing the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the man was not hurt at all except knocking his own head against the mainmast? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>He did not mention that Mackey had kicked him while he was down; now upon your oath, did not the boatswain tell you that the officer had said to him, that Mackey had kicked him; - He did not mention Mackey's name, I am sure; but he said that somebody had knocked him on the head with a billet of wood; I was getting a little grog on board the Hermione.</p>
               <p>You was a little groggish, I suppose? - No, I was not; I could not get enough, or I suppose I should; I turned into my birth as soon as I came on board; I could not get enough to sleep sound.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mackey on board that night? - I heard him, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any knocking in the cabin? - No, there was no knocking, I was on board the whole time of the seizure.</p>
               <p>Who brought about that seizure; did you ever hear Mackey say who gave the information? - He said that one of the people who had left us, had informed the exciseman, he thought.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I do not recollect when.</p>
               <p>Was it before this officer was knocked about so? - Yes, it was that afternoon.</p>
               <p>You was not in company with the mate of course? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was not asleep you know, for you heard what passed in the cabin; I heard them some time.</p>
               <p>If any body had cried out you should have heard them? - I think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester replied.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were there not some custom-house officers on board at the time? - They were on shore.</p>
               <p>To Dungate. Did they leave you on board alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned with a verdict,</p>
               <p>

I took the prisoners from Hoxton to Smithfield, in company with Woodley—on the road Tiney said that he knew nothing about it, he met Strath in the Mile End Road, at a coffee stall, and asked him to take a ride with him—on the way to Guildhall Police Court, next day Strath called me to him and said, "I will tell you about it; I was* in Red Cross Street, and a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> come up to me and said that a gentleman left it for him to mind, and he was gone so long that he could not stop, and asked me to take charge of it—I took charge of it and thought I would have a ride in it."</p>

I called for a cup of coffee; this young fellow was there, and this man who keeps the coffee stall asked me if I would mind going for a ride; I said to Strath, "Can I?" he said, "Yes, if you like." I went for a ride with him. Going along the road he told me he had been to the Rye House, and he said the pony and chaise belonged to him.

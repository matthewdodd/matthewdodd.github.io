            . I am a surgeon, residing in Ravenrow, Spitalfields. On the 4th of February, I opened the body of the deceased, I found a turgidness in his stomach arising from inflammation. I cannot say what was the cause of his death. I found no external marks of violence whatever. There was no appearance of bruises being the cause of his death. If I had opened the body, without knowing that there had been violence, I should not have suspected external violence to have been the cause.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, residing in Bishopsgate-street. I was called to the deceased, about a quarter of an hour after he died. I examined him externally; there were no bruises. I could not form any opinion as to the cause of his death. I saw the body again on the 4th, after it had been opened, there was an appearance of inflammation in his stomach; it was not considerable, in my judgment it was not sufficient to cause his death. I had attended him two years before this, for an inflammation of his stomach, he soon recovered from that.</p>

I took up my umbrella, and struck him immediately - another man was close behind me - I collared him, and called Watch! five or six times, but none came; the man whom I collared said he was not the man, and he would go to the watch-house with me; and the other man said he would go too. They both went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them snatched your watch - A. I believe the prisoner, but at the time I could not tell which, he is one of the two, and one of those who went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You indicted both parties - A. I did; there was not the slightest resistance; the prisoner is the man I struck, he accompanied me voluntarily; several people were passing, as the Theatre was breaking up - there was a blazing gas lamp close by. I do not speak to him with certainty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of the two and the one you struck - A.He is, my Lord. I struck him as the man taking my watch.</p>
               <p>MRS. WERGMAN. I was with my husband, and saw the prisoner snatch his watch; I have not the least hesitation about it. After he snatched it Mr. Wergman forced himself from me another man came up immediately, put himself close to him, and he seized him - they went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Several people were passing - A. Yes; the prisoner surrendered voluntarily; I saw his face, and saw him do it. I saw him approach, and the other man standing ready to receive it. I was observing to my husband to take care, as I saw him approach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was behind them all the time, with a stick in my hand, coming from the Theatre. When I was charged with it I did not make the least resistance.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the night of the 9th of February? - A.About two o'clock, as near as I can recollect, I had occasion to get out of bed; when I looked at the window, I saw a great smother come out of the back part of the house, at the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Smoke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What house? - A.Hillingworth's house; I thought it was fire; I threw up the window, and then I saw the flame come out; upon which I called, fire! as loud as I could holla; after calling about ten minutes, the neighbours asked me where it was; after I had given the alarm, I came down stairs, and alarmed my brother, and then I went into the court, where I saw this woman walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see her? - A.When I first threw up the window, I saw the prisoner walking in the yard, and putting her hands up against the shutters, and putting them to.</p>
               <p>Q. The same window where the smother and smoke came out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed? - A. She had a kind of bed-gown on; with that I went into the court, to the front of the house, and saw her in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe her dress more particularly? - A. She was dressed, as she usually was, as I had seen her some days before; I went round into the court, and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say any thing to you, nor you to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her putting the shutters to, had she given an alarm? - A. No, none at all; I called, fire! as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hear you? - A. I don't know; I suppose she must.</p>
               <p>Q. How high were you? - A.Two-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the yard from you? - A.There were two yards from me, about two hundred yards, as far as that window (the window of the Sessions-House.)</p>
               <p>Q. By what light did you distinguish her? - A. It was moon-light, and snow upon the houses; it was very light; I thought at first it was day-light, and that I had slept too long.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her shutting the shutters, was that before you saw the flame? - A.As she shut them, the flame came towards her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are a pencil-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The room you saw the fire out of was the two-pair-of-stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was two o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The smoke came out of the back parlour?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You being two story high, at two o'clock in the morning, speaking to nobody, saw a woman in a bed-gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her shutting the shutters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the means of seeing her was the moonlight from a two-pair-of-stairs window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that she appeared to be dressed as usual, having a bed-gown on, or loosely thrown on? - A. She had a bed-gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear she was completely dressed; that the bed-gown was put on in the regular way? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Your attention was drawn to the fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, under the alarm your mind was in, positively to swear this was the woman, and dressed in that particular way? - A. Yes, I will take upon me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had she called out, fire! or given any alarm? - A. Not in my hearing; I believe I was the first that gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you give the alarm in the bed-room window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you got round to the court? - A.About twenty minutes; I had my clothes to put on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You observed a woman shutting the shutters, might it not be to prevent the air from getting in, and encrease the flames? - A. I apprehend it was to prevent the fire being discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. The flames, if not prevented by shutting the shutters, would have burnt any body standing so near? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. The flames were rushing out? - A. The smoke and flame were coming out, and she went to shut the shutters.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You have no doubt that the prisoner is the person you first saw? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Murray went down first; there was a great smother, you could not see your hand; he called out, thieves and fire! when I came down, the bottom step was all on a blaze; I went up for my children, and brought them down; then I went up again, and knocked at the doors, to see if there was any body alive; I made a great noise; then I came down again, and saw my landlady; she was dressed as usual; I saw her a little way from the back-door of the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard Murray make an alarm? - A. Yes, that made me jump out of bed, and come down; I abused her very much, because I thought it very cruel to be walking about in the yard, and making no alarm, when my children and me were in so much danger; she made no answer, to my knowledge; the front door was closed, when I put my hand to it, I could not open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say any thing about the brewers before this time? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the front door kept open or shut, latterly, of a night? - A. It was generally shut about eleven o'clock; they would open it to any body that knocked. About three or four days after he was arrested, I heard her say, she would go to an attorney, and enter an action against Mr. Dickinson, and have her revenge of him, for the man he had sent there, had broken two locks, and taken the key of the two-pair-of-stairs with him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a fireman of the British Fire-office; I was one of the first that got to this house; when I first came there it was a little after two o'clock in the morning, on the 9th of January, I went into the house, and went into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q.You found the door open? - A. Yes; I went into the back room, where the fire was burning all round it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any fire in the grate? - A. I did not observe any in the grate at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the grate? - A. Yes; I went and put the Parish engine to work, and got the fire under as quick as we could; it burnt through the back parlour into the one-pair-of-stairs back room; after that, when we had got the fire under, we went up stairs, and did the rest with buckets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the stairs? - A. Yes; the stairs go out of the tap-room into a beer-cellar, all on the ground-floor; the stair-case that comes over the cellar stairs were all on fire underneath them; that is the stairs that go up to the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the stairs was burnt? - A. It had burnt right through the second stair.</p>

               <p>Q.Whether the fire in the room could have caught from the stairs, or the fire on the stairs from the room? - A.There could not be any communication from the one to the other, there is large brick wall between the stairs and the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any fire made its way through the brick wall? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q.It remained entire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any joist burnt? - A. It had burnt through the joist into the room over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice whether there was a good deal of furniture in the house? - A. I did not take much notice, there appeared to be very little in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman there? - A. Yes, in the court, after the fire was over; I had no conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. It seems the parlour was on fire before the room above it? - A. I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It had not burnt from the room to the parlour? - A. No; I suppose from the parlour to the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.There was a brick wall between the two fires? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible the fire could get through that wall? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Could it be accidentally set on fire? - A. I have every reason to think it could not.</p>

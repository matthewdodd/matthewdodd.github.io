               <p>Q. Where was your regiment? - A. In Horsham Barracks: On the 20th of last month I was going on a furlough; I got in here about nine o'clock at night; I was going down to Gloucestershire, and I came to two or three public-houses by Portpool-lane, I could get no lodging; and as I was walking down the street, I met with the prisoner Jones; I asked her if she could give me any intelligence where I could get a lodging; she told me she could, if I would pay for it; I told her I did not care what I paid, so as I could get a clean bed; she brought me immediately to Mrs. Count's, in Portpool-lane; they took me into a parlour, where there was a very decent bed, and asked me if I wanted a woman to bed with me; I answered, no, I was going down to see my wife, and they walked out of the room both of them, I shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it? - A. No, I believe there was no lock to it, I am not sure.</p>

            Were you sober? - A. I bad drank but two glasses of liquor after I left Leatherhead, that is eighteen miles; when I waked in the morning, between five and six, I met with Jones lying on my bed with her clothes on; I immediately got up, and searched for my money; I had put it in my stocking in a purse, when I went to bed, and threw it under the bed carelessly; I missed my money, and saw the purse lying at the foot of the bed; there was a twenty shilling note in the purse, and that was left.</p>
               <p>Q. What was gone out of the purse? - A. Two guineas and a half, and two or three shillings, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they seen you pull off your stockings? - A. I fancy they must have been watching me, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not in the room when you undressed? - A. No, they were not; I, immediately after I got up, went and fetched an officer, and had them taken up; I took them before a Magistrate, they were both in liquor, he ordered them to prison till the morrow for further examination; the officer found some money that I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge who keeps the house? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden. On Thursday, the 21st of November, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he was robbed in a house in Portpool-lane, and that he had left Jones in custody of the landlord of the house while he came down; when I went there, a man who looked like a coal-heaver, said, Jones was gone to market along with his wife to buy some pigs' heads; I waited about an hour, and then I went and found them apparently both very much in liquor; I searched them both, but could find nothing on them; I brought them to the Magistrate, and they were examined; upon that examination it came out, that they had been having purl and gin at a public-house in Portpool-lane, where they changed a half-guinea: the next day I received the half-guinea from Mary Simpson.(Produces it).</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same half-guinea that I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. By the date of it, and particular marks upon the head side; besides, there are two black spots; I had had it in my pocket a month, and been turned away with it I suppose a hundred times.</p>

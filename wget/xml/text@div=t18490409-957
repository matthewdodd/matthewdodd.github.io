                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. The prisoner came into my service on 21st Dec—she had lived with me before—she said she should want some money in advance in about a month—on Thursday evening, 8th March, I left my shop—my mother and the prisoner were there—I was absent about five minutes—when I returned I saw the prisoner at the till, either locking or unlocking it—the key of the till was kept hanging up on the opposite side of the bar—it was left there when I went out of the shop—I said, "What are you doing with the till?"—she said, "Do you think I am robbing you?"—I said, "I think you are"—I saw her go from the till, and she was hanging up the key—I did not say any more to her that evening, but on the Saturday morning I made application to Teakle, the officer—he came to my house, searched the prisoner's box, and found in it eleven packages of copper money, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some tea—here are two pence and one halfpenny, which I identified when the officer untied them, which I know—she had never asked me to advance her money—I gave her in charge, and the officer took possession of the money.</p>

On 10th March I was sent for to Mr. Clay's—I told the prisoner I belonged to the police, and before she said anything I was bound to caution her—I then asked if she would permit me to search her boxes—she said, "Why do you want to search? I am no thief"—we then went up stairs, and before she opened the boxes I asked if she had got any money—she said, "Yes"—I asked how much—she said, about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she had had it from her brother, in Mile-end-road—I opened her box, and found all these packages of copper in the state I now produce them, and three shillings—these are the penny-pieces and halfpenny which Mr. Clay claimed—I took the prisoner to the station—in going along I asked if she wished her brother in Mile-end-road to know of her situation—she said, yes, and no one else—she then said, "I will tell you what made me take it; the last servant that was here had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and I had only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that induced me to take it. <hi rend="smallCaps">

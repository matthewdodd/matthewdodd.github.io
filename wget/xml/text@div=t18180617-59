While I was talking to her I took my watch out to see the time-she had a candle. I returned my watch to my pocket and left her. Soon after, she ran after me, took me by the coat, and said I should have the lot. She kept moving her other hand by my body. I did not feel my watch go, but missed it as soon as I left her. I returned to where she had stood, and found her gone. I got the watchman, overtook her in Stewart's-rents, going into her house, and asked her for my watch. She said "I have not go it-search me." The watchman said, "It is unless searching, you have dinged it." I gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live in Drury-lane. On Monday, the 23rd of October, the prisoner came to my house and asked the price of the articles named in the indictment, and an<lb></lb>other—he then stated that if certain quantities were packed up and sent with him to High-street, Marylebone, the money should be returned—this chrome yellow and the Prussian blue and vermilion, 'were sent with him by our young man, about eleven o'clock—the young man returned soon after, and brought neither money nor colours—he said the man had eluded him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to the prosecutor. I recollect the prisoner coming on the 23rd of October, and these articles being packed up—the prisoner requested Mr. Durien to send them, and he would send back the money—I went with these articles to High-street, Marylebone—I carried part of them, and he carried part of them, and when we came to a certain public-house he requested me to give him one of my parcels—he then had three—he went and returned in two minutes, and stated that the person he expected to see there was gone to another house in Oxford-street—I had one parcel there which I took home again, and that he said was to go to another house in Oxford-street—I asked whether we had not better leave that, as it was heavy—he said, "Never mind"—as we were going on he came to a house in Carnaby-street, and wished me not to appear as with him, as the gentleman would very likely come out of the</p>

            . I am daughter to the last witness. Just as I came from work my mother bid me to go in the washhouse for some things that were there, and on my hearing the water run I opened the yard door and saw the prisoner, she bid me let her out; I said to her, you have got the pipe, she said, I have not; I caught hold of her by the gown, followed her into the passage, and called out father; I called my father the second time, then she laid the pipe down, she tried to get away from me, but I held her gown, and by the time she got to the street door my father came and took her. She had broken the pipe off.</p>

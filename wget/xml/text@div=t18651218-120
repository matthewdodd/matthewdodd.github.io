                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Dowdell, of 3, Vine-place, Old-street-road—on 20th November, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I locked up the house, and fastened the windows of the room in which I slept—that is the ground-floor, next to the street—I did not fasten the shutters—I saw this quilt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a blanket there then—they are my husband's property—there are two blankets and a counterpane here; the sheet is gone—about half-past 11, I heard my son come home—he sleeps in the same room, in a separate bed—he went to sleep, and about three hours afterwards he awoke me—I struck a light, and found that the window was wide open, and the blanket and counterpane were gone—I raised an alarm, went out with a neighbour, and saw three policemen, and afterwards saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

About half-past 3 on the morning of 20th November, I was on duty in the Curtain-road—I saw the female prisoner secreting herself behind a packing-case in Mills'-court—she popped round the corner and looked to see if any person was coming, and she then came out into the court and squatted down—she then got up, and came across the road by where I was standing—I asked her what she was doing there—she said she was doing something for herself—I said it would be better for her to go home, and she then passed on—thinking that all was not right, I went across the road, and looked in the packing-case where I had seen her, and found these two blankets and a counterpane, quite warm, in the packing-case—I watched and saw the female prisoner come back in company with Jones; they went to the packing-case, and were in the act of taking the property away when I pounced upon them—I had left it there—Jones shammed drunkenness—I kept them there till I got assistance, and then took them to the station—I found this knife on Jones—the prosecutor's house is not quite a quarter of a mile from there; about three or four minutes' walk.</p>

             (police-constable N 85). I was on duty about one o'clock that morning, I heard some persons coming under a wall - I went up and saw three or four men who had a bag loaded with something; I followed them across the field; they dropped the bag; I follwed the last, who I believe was the prisoner knowles - he went on to a gate and got over it, and got among some trees; I then lost sight of them - I went back and secured this bag; these four rabbits I caught, there were others but they got away - I thought Game was one of the men, and we went and took him the same morning; his boots were very wet, there were nails in the soles of them, and two nails are out of the toe of one of them - they exactly correspond with the marks I saw in the clay.</p>

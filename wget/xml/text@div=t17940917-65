               <p>I am a servant. I was at the house of the prosecutor, he had been out for a pot of porter a few minutes before I missed the things out of the passage; I know the things to be the prosecutor's; and I saw him with the things under his arm, in Wells's-mews; this was near nine. I am not the servant of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the house of the prosecutor? - I cannot exactly say, but I think about half a dozen or nine doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him? - No, he passed me, and dropped the clothes at the end of the Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think he dropped them? - He dropped them because he knew he stole them.</p>

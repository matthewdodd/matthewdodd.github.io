                  </hi>. I am a fish vendor, of 22, Wellington Street, Bermondsey—on the morning of August 1st; I was with my stall outside the Fleece public-house—I sent my boy home with some of the covers of my stall, he returned and told me something—I went across, and the boy called out" That's him, father"—I saw a man running, and ran after him with two constables—he went into a house, and the door was shut—the constables got in and brought out the prisoner—I went home, and missed the lid of a vegetable dish, which was found on the tiles of the next house—the prisoner is very much altered, but he is the same man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My stall is about half as far again from my house as across this Court, and half as far again from the house where the prisoner was taken—I saw his back and his face too—I was 20 yards from him when</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness—on 1st August, between 12 and 1 a.m., I went home and saw the prisoner standing outside the gate of our house—he asked me where I lived, I said "Here"—he said "All right, George"—I then took the covers in and came out leaving the key in the door—I was away about two minutes, and when I came back the door was locked and the key gone—I went over to my mother who came back with mo, we found the door wide open and the prisoner inside the room with a coat in his hand, which he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> on the floor and ran out—I told my father, who ran after him—the prisoner is the man I am sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "I cannot swear to his face because ho had been running, he was puffing and panting very much"—I went with the police to the room where the prisoner was, he was in bed and undressed—I said that I could not swear to him—I saw Anna Collins called as a witness before the Magistrate, and heard her say that she was in the room when I came up with the policeman.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was 10 yards from the door when the man went in, I will not swear that it was not 15—it is a six-roomed house—it is not unusual for a doors in that street to be open on a moonlight night.</p>

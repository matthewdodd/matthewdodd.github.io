Two years - we heard he was a married man; I, and my mother went and enquired, and the next day his wife came, and said she was his landlady for ten years; she knew he had been married, but did not know that he was married now; I had a great many presents, and some cash, but all in a proper way - my mother washed for a Mr. Ward for seventeen years.</p>

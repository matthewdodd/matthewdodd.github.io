                  </hi>. I live in Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 24th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, I went into a public-house in Stepney, kept by Joseph Downey, with two friends, to take refreshment—I did not know the prisoner before this—I had some gin and water—the prisoner supplied the liquor, he was the ser<lb></lb>vant—I ordered three sixpenny worths of gin and water—it is customary to pay for it when delivered, and I put down 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "My boy, it must be a mistake, there cannot be six penny worth in each glass"—he said, "Yes, there is, it is what I have paid for at the bar," and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three glasses—my friends took two more glasses afterwards, and I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—on coming down stairs I inquired of the person at the bar what she charged for it—she said, "Four pence a glass"—I told her what I had paid—a policeman was sent for, who took the prisoner in charge.</p>

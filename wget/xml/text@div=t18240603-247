               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door. On the 5th of May I went to that shop, and saw the defendant there; I asked him for the book called</p>
               <p>"Paine's Age of Reason" - he was standing at the counter; he turned round, took it off a pile of books, and gave it to me. I put my name on it; here is the book (producing it) he gave me. I wrote my name on it before I parted possession of it. I paid him 4 s. for it, and asked if he would take off anything if I took half-a-dozen of each - I had bought another book as well - he said he would take of 25 per cent.</p>
               <p>The libellous matter set out in the indictment was here read from the work.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his Defence, read an exceeding long one, consisting of a most profane and appalling attack upon the grand doctrines and precepts of Christianity, which of course are highly improper for publication.</p>

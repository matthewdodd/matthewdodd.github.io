            . I am near eleven years old. My father keeps the house. The prisoner was a patrole in St. Martin's-lane. One night nearly a month ago, the prisoner's daughter came to my father's for me, and took me to her father; he asked me what trade my father was, I said a currier; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is it all your father's place," I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Mr. Geldard keeps his goods in my father's house;" he said</p>
               <p>"You often have a great deal of leather," I said</p>
               <p>"Yes sometimes, but the leather which comes in is Mr. Geldard's;" he said</p>
               <p>"There are pieces come off the leather," I said</p>
               <p>"Yes there are often pieces come off;" he then said</p>
               <p>"Could you get some," I said</p>
               <p>"No they are not mine, I dare not touch them;" he said</p>
               <p>"Can't you get me some, don't you have some given you," I said Yes; he told me to bring some of them up - I took him what my father had given me; they were parings not worth above 2 d., and one night about three weeks ago he came to our place, and rang at the bell, I let him in, and he came to my father's room, on the same floor as Geldard's; he said,</p>
               <p>"What a nice comfortable little room you have got," and then began pinching some leather about in my father's shop - he said,</p>
               <p>"Whose is this," I said,</p>
               <p>"Geldard's" he said,</p>
               <p>"Can't I have it," I said,</p>
               <p>"No;" he said he must; I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Huggett, it will be sure to be found out, if you take it;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I will be answerable for it, if it is;" he then wrapped it up in some green baize - he took more than a dozen pieces. I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better not take them, they will be missed," he said,</p>

               <p>"You little stupied fellow, why don't you hold your tongue;" he then took them, and saw some more pieces hanging up, I said,</p>
               <p>"You must not have them," he wrapped them up, and threw them into the gutter, between the two houses, and said he would come for them to-morrow; he went away directly with the cordovan leather.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell of this - A. I did not tell of it - it was found out a week after. He kept telling me not to tell, and if it was found out, he would settle it. My father had me in the watch-house for a night.</p>

I live at 3, Windsor Street, Bishopsgate Street, and am a hawker—on 27th January, I was in a public-house in White's Row—I had been drinking a good bit—I left the public-house about 11.30—the prisoner and another man followed me—two men put me against a wall and held me by my shoulder, and the prisoner opened my coat and took out my bag of money, containing between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my watch and chain—I noticed one of the men in the public-house—the other two I cannot speak to because it was dark; there were four men altogether—I had seen the prisoner in the public house—I recognise him particularly because he was standing in front of me, and he opened my coat and robbed me, and knocked me in the chest when I tried to halloa—I know I had my money safe in the bag when I paid for my beer—as soon as they took my money they all ran away and I called "Police!"</p>

I am a caster—on the night of 27th January I saw the prosecutor in White's Row—I saw the prisoner and three more men there, standing up against the public-house window, speaking to one another; one of them was telling the prisoner to go away, another called out "Don't let him go, there is a good chance here, a man has got some money upon him, over 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it was the prisoner said that—two of the men got hold of the prosecutor, and one was walking up the side of the pavement, looking out for a policeman or anyone that came—the prisoner unbuttoned his coat and took the money out while the other two held him—they pushed him out—the prisoner hit him in the chest as he was robbing him—I saw them run away—the prisoner dropped his hat as he ran; he did not stop to pick it up; when I came from the police-station the same night, about 1 o'clock, I picked the hat up and gave it to the policeman; that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

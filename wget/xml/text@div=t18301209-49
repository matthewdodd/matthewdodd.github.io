               <p>SIR, - This step you will most likely say nothing can excuse; I readily grant you credit for the observation, but it is not my wish to excuse it - I am driven to such extremities that I should not desire a greater boon of the Almighty than to be suddenly called from this earthly hell to the inflammatory one; I should then have the satisfaction of seeing all share alike - nor should I have the mortification of seeing those, infinitely my inferiors, doing better than myself, nor would they, in that situation, be likely to spurn me, or treat me with contempt.</p>

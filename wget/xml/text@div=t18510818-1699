                  </hi>. I am a boot-closer, and live at Pan ton-street, Haymarket About 1 o'clock on Saturday night, 2nd Aug., I went to St. James's Park—I then had three half-crowns in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket—I met Knowles in a few minutes—she put her arms round my waist and held me tight for a minute or two—I pushed her away, felt my pocket directly, and my money was gone—I accused her of picking my pocket—Miller then passed and asked what was the matter—she was not near enough to have taken the money—they walked away together—I pursued and gave them into custody—they were taken to the station and searched by a female—Miller said several times that she had only a shilling and a few halfpence in her pocket—the prisoners came back with the female searcher, who produced three half-crowns, a shil<lb></lb>ling, and some halfpence, saying she had found them on Miller—Miller then said to Knowles, "You must have put it there, for I know nothing of it"—Knowles said, "It is no use telling such lies as that"—the searcher is not here.</p>

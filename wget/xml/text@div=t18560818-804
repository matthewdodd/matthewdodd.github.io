                  </hi>. I am a boot manufacturer, in Whitechapel-road. On 21st July; about 1 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked the price of a pair of boots that he saw in the window—after some bargaining. he eventually agreed to buy a pair for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid for them by what</p>

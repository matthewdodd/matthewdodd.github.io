               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you recollect that I wore the ring for six months in your presence after I got it from you? - A. No, you did not - I did not give it to you, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to his mother's grave, in a vault, with him, when I had it on my finger. Witness. That was previous - he went to the vault, but not with the ring - it was before he had it.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 17, Craven-street, Soho - I was in company with Burke when he met the prisoner - he asked him what he had done with his ring - he said he had been into the country, and had been robbed of his clothes and the ring likewise; and if he would not take him before the magistrate, he would make the ring good.</p>

               <p>F. J. BURKE re-examined. The ring was of more value than 5l. - it was a gift from my sister - it could not have been bought for that; for the ruby was worth more than that - my father is a licensed victualler; and my sister lived with him - I had worn it eight or nine months - I am certain I never gave or lent it to him, except to show it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the ring himself - I wore it six months in his presence, and was robbed of it with my clothes and all at Birmingham four years ago - the prosecutor cannot take a righteous oath respecting the conversation passing between us so many years ago - the ruby was all cracked to pieces - it was not worth one shilling and eightpence.</p>

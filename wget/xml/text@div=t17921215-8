               <p>Q. Had he put the initials of his name for this order in question? - He had.</p>

Do you see any body that is present who was at your banking-house on the 9th of October last? - The prisoner at the bar came in, and asked, Whether Murrell's dividend was paid there? I answered, yes. He immediately walked out; and, in the course of an hour, or an hour and an half, he returned with the draft which I now produce (the draft produced, and deposed to by Mr. Parnell, as the draft which he signed and filled up by Vernon).</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did you pay him? - In cash and bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner at the bar is the person you paid the 9th of October. - I am certain.</p>

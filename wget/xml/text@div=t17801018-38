Barnsley took me up two pair of stairs with her, and she showed me two pair of shoes so bad I would not have picked up such in the street. She locked the door and locked me in, and locked Hartman out.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the room? - No; then she threw a coat over my face; she laid hold of my throat with one hand, and put the other hand in my pocket. I had at that time in my pocket half a guinea, 15 s. in silver, and a crown-piece. I put my hand down to my pocket to prevent her taking it out. I found she had left in my pocket the half-guinea and two shillings, and had taken out the crown-piece. She then shoved me out at the door of the room. I found Hartman at the door upon the staircase. I saw Barnsley give the other prisoner the thirteen shillings as soon as she opened the door. I cried murder; then Barnsley pushed me, and knocked me down; the other girl Hartman did not beat me, she only took the money of Barnsley. A neighbour came up, hearing the cry of murder; then Hartman said, Good man do not make a noise, I will find some of the money, and she gave me a crown-piece, a half crown. and a shilling.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brockholes came to me and said murder was cried out at No. 11, in Fleet-lane. I went there directly. I went up stairs, and saw the prisoners , a young man, and the jew; I asked them for what reason they cried murder; the jew said he had been robbed; I asked him what he had lost; he said he had lost half a guinea, a crown-piece, and some silver; he said they had given him again the crown-piece, an half-crown, and a shilling, and that there were nine shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180039"></xptr> and sixpence missing. I locked the door and searched both the prisoners. I found a few halfpence in Barnsley's pocket; the other had some apples in her pocket. I did not find any money upon them. I searched the young man, and found nothing in his pocket but a knife.</p>
               <p>Why was not the young man taken up? - The prosecutor only charged the two women. I asked him if he would have the young man taken up; he said no; he came up into the room upon my cry of murder. Barnsley threatened to cut his bloody liver out; she said she would if I had not been there.</p>

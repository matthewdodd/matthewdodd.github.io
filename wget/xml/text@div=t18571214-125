                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at No. 47, Park Street, Dorset Square. In Oct. last I lived at No. 11, Adam Street East, Marylebone at the house of Mr. Gilmore—the prisoner and I both lived in one room there—on 29th Oct. I had to go into the infirmary, and was there three weeks—I came out on 19th Nov.—I went back to my lodging—I asked the prisoner if there had been any letters there—she gave me one which was opened, and said it had come that morning—I asked if there had been any money in it—she said, "No"—I expected some—I wrote home to my friends, and received an answer on the 24th—I afterward, on the same day, asked the prisoner for the remainder of the tickets of my clothes—she gave them to me—I then asked her for the letter and the money order that was in it—I told her that I had had a letter stating that it had been sent and received—she bounced up and went into a passion, and brought forward four bills, and said that I owed her that money—I do not know what they amounted to—she afterwards gave them to the policeman—her father was in the room at that time—he is rather deaf—he asked what was the matter, and I repeated it to him, and while I was repeating it she jumped up, took a knife out of the table drawer and said she would stab me and be the death of me, if she was hanged for it, and with that I went out of the room as quickly as I could—she stated before that that she had received the money order and kept it for the debt, and then she brought up these bills—I did not owe her any money—I made inquiries at the post office in Old Cavendish Street—the signature to this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I never authorised the prisoner or anybody to sign my name and receive the money—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner on Friday, the 20th, the day after I came out of the infirmary; I told her I was so badly off I did not know what I should do, I had not a penny to get anything, and she gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "Don't show it to my father."</p>

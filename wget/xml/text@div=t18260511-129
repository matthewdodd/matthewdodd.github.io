            . I am the prosecutor's landlady. I went into the room between twelve and one o'clock on Wednesday last - the prisoner was in bed, and had all his clothes on but his coat; the prosecutor was in the room, and screwed down his box; I afterwards received information from my daughter - I looked through the key hole, and saw the box open, and the articles gone. I asked the prisoner what he had done with them - I looked, and he had got them under his arm in bed.</p>

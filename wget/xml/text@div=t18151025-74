I had an order for half a load of hay, half a load of straw, two sacks of oats, and a sack of bran, to be delivered at Capt. Ridges's stables, in Princes Mews; I told the prisoner to execute this order. Having a suspicion of him, I placed myself in a loft, over my granary, in a situation which I could observe every thing that he did. He came into the granery, and put up a sack of my very best oats I had, and put into the cart; then he came and filled up Capt. Ridges's two sacks, and put them also into the cart with the bran; and then he put the hay and straw over them, which effectually concealed them. I then followed the cart, at a distance, to the stables, and told the governess of the charity school the circumstances; and she let me go up to one of her windows, where I could observe the prisoner, and watch Capt. Ridges's groom; I saw the three sacks of oats taken in by Walsh; I then went down, and taxed Walsh with having three sacks of oats, instead of two, but he strongly denied it. I then went into the loft and there I found them. When I came home, I told the prisoner that I had discovered this, and several other things against him, and I would give him a day to make all right. He then went away, but never returned, and soon after was taken by

Mr. Wilks, at the Cock, in Aldersgate-street, said to me, What did you do with the box? I said, I burnt it; I never let any body know what I do with the things; Steers bought them of me, or I wish I may be cast for death, and not be reprieved. I assure you, the poor man does not know what he has lost, and that fool the evidence cannot tell him. I am guilty of what I am charged with, I assure you. I hope I shall have Lloyd and Steers in the plantation along with me.</p>

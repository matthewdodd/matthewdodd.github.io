                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and reside with my sister, Mrs. Cowling, at 3, Asylum-road, Old Kent-road. She is a widow, and is the tenant of the house—at the time this happened the prisoner had lived there about a fortnight as servant—on Saturday morning, 6th Dec. I awoke, and went to the prisoner's door about 7 o'clock—the door was ajar—she was not up—I called her; she answered me, "Yes, ma'am, I will get up"—I then went to my bedroom—it was a very cold morning, and was very dark—in a quarter of an hour or twenty-five minutes she came up to my bedroom, and said, "Ma'am, I wish you would come down to see the back parlour table-cover, there is something the matter with it" in a very strange way—I was then in bed—I said, "What can the matter be? has any one been in the house?"—I went down, and looked at the table-cover—it was a cotton plaid, and was not quite half burnt—the embers were warm and smelt very fresh—the table was warm, the tinder was warm—I took it up in my hand this is the table-cover (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I immediately went up to Mrs. Cowling's door, and awoke her—she accompanied me down stairs to see the cloth—in the prisoners presence Mrs. Cowling said, "You did it"—she said, "Me, ma'am! how could I?"—we then went up stairs to dress, and while we were dressing, the prisoner came again to me, and said, "Do, ma'am, come down, and look at the front parlour; it is in a dreadful state"—we had not seen the front parlour when we were down before; the folding doors were shut—I went to Mrs. Cowling, we both went down together, and the prisoner followed—we opened one folding door, and could not see for smoke, except that there was a fire under the piano—I saw the valens of the curtains broken in two, and in the fire, and the whole of the curtain in ashes, except one breadth—there bad been twenty-two yards in the curtain—it was more, woollen stuff—I saw all my music-books burnt, also the portfolios of loose music—all my music was burnt, except one thin bound book—I folded the rug in two or three pieces, and put it on the fire on the floor, under the piano<lb></lb>forte—I found these matches on the floor, and some in the middle of the floor in the front parlour—the carpet was burnt where the ashes of the curtain had fallen—Mrs. Cowling, myself, and a little girl between eight and nine yew old, were in the house—I found the house as I had left it the night before—the fire was in two places, perfectly distinct from each other—the front and back parlour windows are twenty-seven feet from each other—when the fire had subsided, I found one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the boards under the pianoforte was burnt—there was no hollow burnt in it, but it was all black, and the carpet was burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. On 6th Dec. I was called up by her, and went down into the back parlour, and saw the table-cover burnt across and all round to the edge of the table—I said to the</p>

               <p>prisoner, who was in the room, "You did it"—she said, "Me, ma'am! how could I do it?"—I went up to dress myself, and was summoned down again—I opened the folding-doors, and could not go into the room for smoke, it hurt my eyes—I made my way to the window, and opened it—I saw embers under the piano, and trod on them—the music-books were on fire—the curtains were all consumed—they would not blaze, but they smothered away—the prisoner began to clear them away with a great deal of unconcern—I saw the rod burned—I had seen the house safe the night before—the prisoner had opened the shutters that morning—I had not been in the front parlour the night before, nor had my sister—the prisoner seemed indifferent about it—she was neither alarmed nor confused—there was no fire lighted in either of the rooms—it was between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock—after break<lb></lb>fast I said to the prisoner, "You must go," or "You must leave me"—she said, "Very well"—she then made the beds, and went into her own room, and made her bed—I followed her, and opened her room door—she said, "Will you look over my things, ma'am?"—I said, "I am not particular about that, but you may count them into your box as I stand here"—I told her I was going to pay her wages, and took out my purse, but I thought I would not till I spoke to a neighbour—I said, "No, you will not go yet," and left her in her room, telling her to tie up her boxes, and bring them down into the hall—my sister went for a friend, who came, and said in the prisoner's presence, I should do wrong to dismiss her without having a policeman—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in charge—I had not said to her, or anybody in her presence, before the policeman came, that I was going to send her away without her wages, or that it was my intention to stop the amount of damage out of her wages—I never thought of such a thing—she is seventeen years old, her grandmother says.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You told me you would not pay me my wages, and I told you I would not go without. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You did not object to go unless your wages were paid—you were very willing to go—you did not say the warning was very short—the lady next door is not here—I sent for the landlord—he came to see his house—he is not here—I do not know what he told you, I was not in the room—the landlord was there before the constable came—my sister fetched him, not the postman; it was the postman who fetched the policeman—I saw you after the landlord had questioned you in the back parlour—I saw you when you went out of the house, and gave you some good advice—the landlord said, "Let me take her into the back parlour, and speak to her, and see if I can get the truth out of her"—he returned, and said he could do nothing with you—I did not say to you in the hall, "You have been taken away safe enough."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was called by some man in the street about half-past 10 o'clock—I examined the house—under the piano, in the front parlour, a quantity of music books had been laid on the carpet, and lighted—they had burnt the carpet—I swept the ashes away, and examined the boards—they were burnt, but not the eighth of an inch through—it was quite as much as that in the centre—there was a hollow—the corner of the sofa next to the piano was completely burnt—the curtain on the other side of the window was partly burnt, and the sofa was burnt a little in the centre—the table-cover in the back room was burnt all round, and one corner was burnt sixteen or eighteen inches on the table—the table appeared to me as if it had had a red-hot poker or iron laid on it, and the cover was burnt at that part—next day I examined the house again, and found the curtains in the back parlour had been burnt, and also the cheffonier, which was not near</p>

               <p>enough to the window to catch fire from the curtains—there was no con<lb></lb>nection between the two fires in the two rooms, nor between any two articles which were burned, unless it might have been between the sofa and the curtains—in my judgment, five distinct places had been set on fire in the two rooms.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and in consequence of information, I went on the 3rd of June to Mr. Fleming's, Fleet-market, and found eight knives, which I knew to be mine - I got an officer, and took the prisoner at his lodgings, at a court on Bennet's-hill, and asked him to give me the duplicate of the knives he had pawned; he denied all knowledge of the transaction - and while he was being searched he said if I would forgive him he would produce the duplicates; I said, No - on the way to the Compter he stopped and asked if I would look over it and let him go; I said, No - I have not found the duplicates; I had seen the knives about the 31st of May; he had nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not, when you gave me in charge, tell you I had received the knives from your son to pledge? A. I cannot recollect whether he did or not; he said so at the Mansion-house - I do not recollect his saying it in the room; my son was employed in my business, and is twenty-eight years old - I have not seen him since that day.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long has the prisoner been in your service? A. Nine months - he knew my son had no authority to give him the things.</p>

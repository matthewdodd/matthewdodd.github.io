                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Porlett, a baker, living in Mint-street, Southwark. About half-past ten o'clock at night on the 22nd of September, the prisoner came for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of bread—I served him—he gave me a bad shilling—I gave him the change, and then saw it was bad—I told him so—he said it was not a bad one—I told him it was—he contradicted me several times—he said he was not destitute of a shilling—he took up the change, and was going to put it into his pocket—I told him not to put my change into his pocket; I could not afford to give him good money for bad—he then gave me another shilling—I said that was bad—he said it was not; that I did not know good money from bad—I said, "Give me back my change?"—he would not—I told him to go, or I would charge him with the police—he said he would not; I might do as I thought proper—there was no policeman—I beckoned to a neighbour out of the window, and was going to send him, but some other person fetched the policeman.</p>

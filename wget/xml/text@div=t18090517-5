               <p>Q. Sometimes before the 31st of March did you miss any sheep - A. Yes; one sheep from the common; I missed it several days before I heard of it; I found it at the Red Lion, at Mr. Claridge's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when that was - A. No; I cannot say that I took particular account of it; they had got all the skins there when I found my skin; I saw it Hatton Garden, and I swore to the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying it was at Mr. Claridge's - A. It was there then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You do not know that.</p>
               <p>COURT. You saw it first at the police office in Hatton Garden - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me as near as you can what time that was - A. No, I did not set it down; I came up when the other gentleman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you usually mark your sheep - A. Of the near side with a pitch mark, W. M. both the letters were alike; you can make a W. M. with the brand this way or other; it was made on purpose because I should know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any skins so marked at Hatton-garden - A. Yes, and that I swore to it there, and there is a reddle mark from the neck down to the chine, and then crossed; that is marked with oker and oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the skin that you saw at Hatton-garden that mark with oker as well as 
               <persName id="t18090517-5-person140">W. M. </persName>
            - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheep that you lost a ewe or a wether - A. It was a pug lamb; a yearling ewe; to the best of my knowledge it was a ewe lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that at the time you saw this skin it was one of your sheep - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. No; I might have seen him on the common; I took no notice of him till I saw him at Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The initials of any man, W. M. would mark it the same way - A. No; there is no other name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170009"></xptr>on the common marked like that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, whether there were any marks at all upon this skin - A. Yes; when I saw it the marks were visible and distinct, the pitch marks and likewise the reddle and oil.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIRBY. I live nigh the seven mile stone on Finchley common; some time the first week in April the prisoner came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes; he is a servant to Mr. Grimaldi; he asked me if I knew any body that bought sheep skins; I told him I did; he said he had two or three to dispose of; I saw the person that did buy them. I never saw the skins till I saw them at Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Q.What was his name that purchased them - A. Goodall.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told Goodall - A. Yes; the next thing was, the constable came to my house and informed me that Goodall had bought six. It was on a Friday the first week in April that I told Goodall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the next Saturday the constable came to you - A No; I understood they were purchased on the Saturday; the constable came to me in the week after he was apprehended; I told the prisoner I would send a person to buy the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner - A. Not till I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. I told the same exactly as I told you, I believe.</p>

            . I am a breeches maker, a fellmonger, and a dealer in skins and wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Kirby mentioning to you that there was a man wanted to sell some skins - A. On the 2nd of April I was at the Red Lion at Finchley; Kirby was then there; he asked me if I bought skins, I told him I did; he then told me if I went to Mr. Grimaldi, his servant had got some to sell; I went on the 8th of April, I saw the prisoner in the garden, I asked him if he had got any skins to sell; he asked me if I belonged to the boy that collected skins; I told him no, I was sent there by the shoemaker that lived near the Green Man (that is Kirby); he then took me into Mr. Grimaldi's chaise-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Grimaldi's house on the common - A. Yes. He then set a ladder up, he went into a hayloft, and while he was in the loft I heard him say he had six skins; he began to throw them down out of his loft, and throwed them all down; I looked at them as he threw them down; he came down the ladder; I asked him if they did not keep a good many sheep here, seeing so many different sorts, some Welsh, some Southdown, and some Dorsets; he then said that his master bought many different lots of sheep; I asked him who took the skins off, they appeared to be taken off very indifferently, which I told him; he told me he took this skin off the day before yesterday; then I looked at a small lamb's skin, he told me it was a very small lamb and weak when it was lambed, he knocked it on the head, because it did not thrive, I then agreed with him for the skins for eight shillings altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the price of six skins - A. Yes, such as they were, they were only pieces, small lambs some of them, with the heads cut off, and many holes cut in many of them; one lamb skin, and the rest were sheep nearly full grown; some of them Welch small sheep, and others of the larger kind. When I had agreed for the skins I was putting them together to bring them away; he wished me to have a sack to put the skins in, saying that I could carry them better than without a sack; I told him that I never made a practice of carrying skins in a sack; he pressed upon me again to have a sack, and that I might leave it at any time at Mr. Kirby's; he gave me a sack, and I told him I would leave it at Mr. Grimaldi's; he wished me not to do that, he did not wish his master to see any thing about it. I then took the skins and carried them to the Red Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you put any of the skins in the bag did you perceive that any of them had marks - A. All the skins had marks, and all different, except two; they were nearly alike, they belonged to Decamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the letters of Decamp on them - A. I saw the reddle marks; some were marked with pitch marks; I did not look at them particular. I took the skins to the Red Lion and throwed them down in the yard; a shepherd came up of the name of Rose, I told him I had bought a lot of skins; he looked at them; the firsk skin that he looked at he said was Fitzwater's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You must not tell what he said in consequence of what passed between you and the shepherd - what did you do with the skins - A. After he looked them all over, I left the skins at a house just by, where I locked them up myself and carried the key back to a person of the name of Baldock; he was the person who lent me the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long did they remain there - A. A few hours; I sent Rose to Decamp and Fitzwater; they did not come while I was there, that was on Saturday; the next week I was taken ill; I did not arrive at Finchley till the Saturday following; then they had taken the skins and the man to Hatton-Garden. I saw them at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that the skins that you saw at Hatton-Garden, or any of them, were the skins that you bought of the prisoner - A. Yes, the whole of them; them six are those that I bought of the prisoner; I know them by the look of the skins, being bred and born to the business; if I look at a thing once or twice, I know them immediately for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Among those that you saw at Hatton-Garden, did you see this little lamb - A. Yes; it was not a little lamb, it was what they call a cuckoo lamb; they had all marks on them; it was the 17th that I went to Hatton-Garden, the Monday sen'night after I bought them. On Sunday the 16th I went to Finchley. Mr. Grimaldi sent down to the Red Lion that there was a discovery of some meat; the officer of Finchley went with me to Mr. Grimaldi; we went into the hayloft, we found a sack under some loose hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same loft from which the prisoner had thrown down the skins - A. No, it was another loft, I believe there was only a partition between, there was two doors, one went in one way and the other another way; both the lofts are over an out house of Grimaldi's; we there found a sack, and two legs, two shoulders, part of the scrag of a neck, and some part of a back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cut up as a butcher would cut up - A. No; the sheep appeared not to be chined down; they were not cut as a butcher would cut them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that part of the back was not cut like a saddle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170010"></xptr>of mutton - A. No, there was only a part of the back and a part of the aitchbone.</p>
               <p>Q. Either part, the bones and flesh you mean, I suppose - A. Yes. We then brought it down from his house; we went immediately to Mr. Bacon, of Colney Hatch, we asked him if he should bring the meat to Hatton-Garden, he said no, as the meat was in a bad state, which it really was; the next day, after the examination was over, Mr. Turton desired me to go to Finchley, and pick out the skin that I thought the meat belonged to; I picked it out; the skin was marked with a reddle mark. It belonged to Fitzwater.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Matthews at Hatton-Garden on Monday - A. Yes; I saw all the owners of the skins on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any of these owners pick out skins that they claimed - A. Yes; I saw Matthews pick out a skin that he claimed as his own. Matthews' was the lamb skin, that he owned; called the cuckoo lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Grimaldi any other servants but the prisoner - A. I saw nobody else there but the prisoner, when I bought the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether Mr. Grimaldi kept any sheep on the common, do you - A. I know no more than seeing two skins that Mr. Grimaldi claimed, one he was sure to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say you was bred and born to this business, and if you saw a skin once or twice, you should know it again for seven years - A. I was brought up a breeches maker, and fellmonger; I should know it again if it was not altered for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not gone by the name of Johnson - A. I have been called Johnson; I was victorious in the florist line; by some people I was called a Johnson; I was the first florist in the known land.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave eight shillings for these skins - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They had the wool on - A. Yes; they were a good deal disfigured, or they would be worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose at the time you bought them, you supposed they belonged to Mr. Grimaldi - A. I did; he told me his master had bought different lots of sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were no particular marks that led you to believe the boy came dishonestly by the sheep - A. At the time I thought it was odd he should have so many different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had suspected him, would you have bought them - A. I do not suppose I should, if I had known them to be stolen, I should never have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. This mutton you found up stairs - this was ten days after you bought the skins - A. No, eight days; I look upon it that the mutton had not been killed less than ten or twelve days.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROSE. I am a shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you know about Matthews' sheep - A. I was going to my labour, past the Red Lion at Finchley, on the 8th of April; the man who bought the skins called to me, asked me if I would have part of a pint of beer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank some beer with Goodall, did you - A. Yes; as we had drank the beer, he went and fetched me a skin, it was Fitzwater's skin, I knew it; then we went out; I looked at another, it had Decamp's mark very plain; I did not examine the others, till I let Fitzwater and Decamp know; afterwards I examined the others on the Sunday following, at the Red Lion at Finchley.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this second examination of the skins, did you know any of the marks on the other skins - A. I did not, till they came and owned them; Mr. Milne came to the Red Lion and owned his skin, and Mr. Matthews came to Hatton-Garden; he looked at the skins, he owned his own skin. The skins were left at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say the skins were left by Goodall at the Red Lion - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that the skins that you saw there, were the skins that were brought by Goodall - A. Yes; three I am certain of.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the others - A. No, I cannot pretend to say; three of the skins are very remarkable; they were all reddle marked but one; three of them were pitched marked, and reddle marked both Some were so bad I could not see.</p>
               <p>

            . I am headborough of Finchley. On Sunday, I think the 9th of April, Mr. Fitzwater ordered me to go up to Mr. Grimaldi's to take up a man; he asked him if he had sold the skins to this man, he said he did. I took him before Mr. Bacon. I, by the order of Mr. Bacon, locked him up for that night, and brought him to Hatton-Garden office the next day. I brought one skin only that day; I brought the rest on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was that - A. The 13th I fancy; we brought five more on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you get these skins from - A. We got four from the Red Lion; the other two we got from a small house below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what the marks were of the two that you took from the small house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what were the marks - A. I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took two skins from the small house, and four from your brother's at the Red Lion - A. Yes, at my brother's house the people saw these two skins, they knew them; Matthews was not at the Red Lion when I brought them, and they looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Hatton Garden when Matthews did look at them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were at Hatton-Garden, I suppose the six were all together, were they not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Goodale looking at them at Hatton Garden - A. He looked at them on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether Matthews picked out any one of these skins - A. I saw him pick out one, and claim it as his own. The skins were left at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I am a police officer of Hatton-Garden. I saw the skins at Hatton-Garden. I have had them ever since locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Goodall examine them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Matthews examine them - A. Yes; Matthews looked at his, and said it was his by the mark. This is the skin that Matthews claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthews. Look at that skin, can you swear to that skin - A. Yes, there is the reddle round there, and here is the W. M.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person on the common that marks in that way - A. No.</p>

            . What is the difference between your mark and Matthew's mark - A. Mine is a real W. M. that is two M's, one reversed; this is reddle, and mine is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark of a W. M. there - A. It appears to me a W. M. the same as Mr. Matthews marks his, not in the same way that I mark.</p>
               <p>JURY. We are not able to perceive the W. M. as described by Matthews - we would wish the shepherd to look at it, and to say if he could swear upon his oath that the W. M. is there.</p>
               <p>COURT to Rose. Look at that sheep skin, and say whether you can see satisfactorily the mark of 
               <persName id="t18090517-5-person144">W. M. </persName>
            - A. I could not take my oath to the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. to Milne. Can you see there any mark of a W. 
               <persName id="t18090517-5-person145">M. </persName>
            - A. I have no doubt but it is the same mark, but I cannot swear to it by this sky light; when I saw the skin at the Red Lion, the headborough called upon me and said it was mine; I examined the skin, I told the headborough that the skin belonged to Matthews; I saw the mark distinctly then, and I saw the mark distinctly before the magistrate; I cannot see the marks distinctly now; the skin; have been all over lime.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live at Lewisham. On the 26th of December, about five or six o'clock, I left my till safe in the shop, and went into the back parlour—my man-servant at the same time went out at the front door—I cannot say whether the till was in the shop at that precise moment, although I believe, at the time of the examination, I did recollect a circumstance which enabled me to say it was the case positively—a few minutes after leaving my shop I heard what I thought was the rattling of the scale against the desk—I went into the shop, but saw no<lb></lb>body there—I went to the street door, and looked round, but could not per<lb></lb>ceive any one—a customer came in in a few minutes, and I then missed my till—there had been about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in farthings, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in other copper money, and from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in it—the scale was directly over the till—I know the prisoner Morris by his coming to the shop for a person who was an occasional customer, and he says, and I believe it is correct, that I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that afternoon as a Christmas-box—I might have given him that from the till, or from my pocket—the till is a drawer with divi<lb></lb>sions—the farthings were by themselves, the other coppers by themselves, and the silver by itself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Lewisham<lb></lb>bridge. On the evening of the 26th of December, as I was going through the village, I saw the prisoner Dyson inside Mr. Shove's shop, leaning over the counter, and Morris looking in at the window—there was no<lb></lb>body else—I went on to Mr. Lindsay's, and on returning saw Dyson come outside with something under his arm—he called Morris by the name of George, and said, "Come on"—they walked together till they got into the road, and then went faster—I afterwards went to the Fox and Hounds, and saw both the prisoners down stairs in that house—Dyson asked me to fetch him a pot of ale, which I did, and he gave me twenty-four far<lb></lb>things to pay for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dyson.</hi> I did not give him any money to fetch ale—I had some ale, and he drank with me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He asked me to drink, but I did not—I told him I had some up stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What were you doing on this day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Going after some cheese for my mother—I have been in the service of Mr. Good<lb></lb>win, a builder, at Lewisham—I was not charged with stealing lead—three or four of us were at work, and there was some lead missing, but Mr. Good<lb></lb>win said he would employ me again—I have not been to him since—I left his service nearly a fortnight after the lead was missed—it was not as soon</p>

               <p>as he found it out—the lead had been on the top of the house—Mr. Good<lb></lb>win said nothing to me about it, only to the others—he never discharged me and told me it was for that—I will not swear he did not tell me so—he did not send me away on account of missing the lead—it was Mr. Bean, the plumber—he told Mr. Goodwin of it—he charged others be<lb></lb>sides me—I have never been in custody in my life—I was in the hands of Barham the officer once, a good bit ago—I cannot say what it was about—I cannot recollect whether I have been in the hands of any other officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Fox and Hounds beer-shop at Lewisham, about two hundred yards from Mr. Shove's shop. The prisoners came there, on the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock—I cannot say whether they came together, but they were in the room together—they had some ale—they paid for part, and other people in the room paid for part—Morris paid for his in halfpence and pence, and Dyson paid in far<lb></lb>things—Beviostock fetched one pot of ale from the bar, and paid me twenty-four farthings for it—Morris was in the tap-room at the time, but not within hearing.</p>

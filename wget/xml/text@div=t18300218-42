About a quarter-past twelve o'clock on the night of Wednesday, the 10th of February, the prisoner came in behind a woman; the woman asked me to cut her some ham and beef - the prisoner said, "If you cut it so fat I can't eat it;" the woman said,</p>
               <p>"It is not too fat for me;" the prisoner then said, "I can eat all that;" the woman said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I will have two ounces more" - the prisoner then took up a ham from my window, and ran away; I pursued him, but he turned down a dark turning, and I gave it up - I returned, and found my ham by the pavement; the woman was still there - she said she knew nothing of the man; I said, "That won't do for me"- the prisoner was taken in Whitechapel-road, the following evening; I had seen him about there before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES EVANS. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner, and have had the ham.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of what passed on the subject of the last indictment, I went to the prisoner's lodging, in Flagon-row, Deptford—I knew his lodgings from a list we keep of the married men's lodgings—I went with Green—the prisoner's wife was present—this iron chopper, marked with the broad arrow, was found behind the door, amongst some other rubbish, and this iron bolt, which is also marked with the broad arrow, was found in the cupboard—I found five biscuits marked with the Queen's mark—there were such biscuits in the yard—he had no right to them—in a drawer I found five packets of nails with the broad arrow—they appear to have been taken at different times, as they are done up in different parcels—here are five tubs' heads which appear to have belonged to the ship <hi rend="italic">Ganges</hi>—I also found a portion of canvas which has got the blue thread in it, which is the Government mark—these three pieces together form a yard of canvas—here are portions of three bread-bags, the pieces together form two bags—they have got the red mark of the broad arrow—they are such as are used in Her Majesty's dockyard—I then found this coil of rope, which I identify by the red yarn of worsted which runs through the whole, from end to end—before the Magistrate, the prisoner said he had the bread bags from Ireland with peas in them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are there not frequent auctions of old iron and stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, Yes, but certificates are given of them—the convicts were employed during last summer in conveying some manure out of the docks, but every precaution was employed to prevent any iron or other things going out with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 315.) I was with Feltham when these things were found in different parts of the house—these sacks and canvas were under the bed, and some of these things in a cupboard.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My brother and I were joint contractors for supplying ordnance stores at Charlemont in Ireland, of which town my father was chief magistrate; I came to England three years since, and went into business, in which I was unfortunate; the ordnance stores at Charlemont were all in my brother's possession, and he sent me a great many sacks over with hardware and other things; my landlord will prove he saw many bills of lading of these stores coming to me; I live within a few yards of those fields where the convicts laid this rubbish, and my children went out in my absence, and found these pieces of iron, which they brought home and washed, the master baker had such a deep regard for me, for my attendance at the Sunday-school, that he gave me three of these biscuits, and a doctor gave me the other.</p>

I know the prisoner's brother was contractor for supply<lb></lb>ing the military depot at Charlemont—I do not know whether the prisoner had the contract or not—I have seen the prisoner and him together—that is nearly ten years ago—those stores were free to the public to buy—any in<lb></lb>habitant might buy—the prisoner has been extensively engaged in mercantile trade in more than one or two businesses, in hardware, and other things.</p>

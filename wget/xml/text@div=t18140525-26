               <p>GEORGE EDWARDS. I am clerk to Mr. Maberly. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18140525-26-deflabel155" type="occupation">cutter of leather</rs>

From information of Mrs. Finch, the wife of a keeper of an eating-house, I went to her house; there I was shewn a basket belonging to the prisoner, containing some leather, which I have no doubt is Mr. Maberly's leather. When the prisoner left his employment in the evening, I gave him into the custody of the constable. He was taken to where the leather was. I asked him how he came by the leather; he denied knowing any thing about it; at last he said he had taken it by permission of his foreman. This leather is the property of

            . My husband keeps an eating-house, 216, Upper Thames-street. On the 7th of May, about six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought the basket to my house; he left it in the shop; at nine o'clock he took it up into the dining-room, and between four and five in the afternoon I saw it with leather in it concealed under the table in the dining-room. I informed Mr. Edwards of it. In the afternoon, Mr. Edwards came and brought the prisoner to my house. The prisoner acknowledged taking the leather from Mr. Maberly's warehouse; he afterwards said it was given him by the foreman.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody; I took him to Mrs. Finch's. The leather was produced before him. He first denied any knowledge of the leather; he afterwards acknowledged it was Mr. Maberley's property. He then said Mr. Jameson, the foreman, had given him leave to take it away. As I was taking him to the counter, he said he was sorry for accusing Mr. Jameson; he knew nothing of it. I went to his lodging in Shadwell-high-street; there I found a quantity of leather. It being out of the city, I have not produced it. I took the leather away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

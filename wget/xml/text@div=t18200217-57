On the 29th of January, at a few minutes before or after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop, and purchased a quarter of a hundred of herrings, which came to 2 s. 3 d., and tendered me a 1 l. note. I took it out of her hand, and on looking at it, I suspected it, by the face being so glossy. I asked her for her address? she said,</p>
               <p>"Jones, No. 25, White-street, back of St. George's church, Borough." I asked her where she got it from? she said from her husband, who was a coal-heaver, but she did not know who his master was. Her giving such an address, and her coming such a distance strengthened my suspicions, and I told her she could purchase herrings much cheaper nearer home; she said she wanted to get change to pay a person a few shillings. I told her to wait in the shop while I took it to a neighbour to ask if it was good. I left her with Mrs. Minto, and took it to a neighbour two doors off, and put it into his hand, but did not lose sight of it; he gave me back the same note, and returned with me - the prisoner was in the shop. I desired her to go into the parlour, then sent for Pike, the officer, who searched her, and found 1 s. 6 d. on her; I gave him the note, and he took it with her to the Compter. I went to the Compter directly after, and she there gave me her name as

            . I am a constable. On the 29th of January I was sent for, and found the prisoner at Minto's; they said she had uttered a forged note; Minto gave it to me, and said he suspected it. I did not like to take her into custody without being satisfied that it was forged, and took it to a person, who satisfied me that it was - it was not out of my sight. I kept it in my possession, wrapped in a piece of paper, until I delivered it to a young man at the Bank, who marked it in my presence; I saw him write my name on it. It is the same note I received from Minto.</p>

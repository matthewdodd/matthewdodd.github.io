On the 22nd of September, about two o'clock, the prisoner came in, with another man, and a female; they called for a glass of ale and a pint of porter, which came to 6d. - the prisoner offered half a crown in payment; I sounded it twice on the counter, thought it was good, and put it into the till - there was no other half-crown there; immediately after they were gone, I looked at it again, and thought it bad - I followed the prisoner down into Bridge-street, brought him back, and gave him into Perry's charge with the half-crown; I am sure I gave him the same half-crown.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Thompson, a stationer, of Cheapside. On the 5th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and bought a sheet of paper, which came to 1d.; he gave me a shilling - I gave him change, and put the shilling into the till; there were two other shillings there, but I put this on the half-crowns - I am certain the other two shillings were under the half-crowns; I had hardly shut the till before the officer came in, and asked to look at the shilling - I took it out directly; I found it on the half-crowns; I did not know there were any more shillings in the till - I turned the half-crowns over, and found two under them; the shilling he gave me could not have got under them - I marked it, and gave it to the officer; I am sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you rattle the silver about to find a sixpence? A. I gave him a sixpence, which I took from the half-crowns I had laid the shilling on - there was but one sixpence; I did not rattle the silver about - the sixpence was on the top of them; there were three or four half-crowns - they were in a small bowl in the till; I gave him the sixpence out, and then put the shilling into the bowl - the half-crowns entirely concealed the two shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not give him the shilling at all - he was not at the till. Witness. He threw it down, and I took it up - my master's nephew was in the shop; I cannot say whether he touched it - I am certain I took up the shilling the prisoner put down; I told him it was bad, and said, "You had better go, for I recollect you were here six weeks ago on the same errand;" he went out, saying he would return with the penny, but he did not.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of October, a little after six o'clock, I first saw the prisoner in company with a female, in Cheapside; the female stopped a few doors from Mr. Thompson's shop, and the prisoner went in - he came out in a short time; I then went in, and Hodson gave me a shilling, which I have kept ever since - he took it from a bowl on the top of some half-crowns; I asked if he had any more shillings - he said No, but then moved the half-crowns, and found two more under them; I am certain the shilling he gave me was on the top of the half-crowns: on the following evening, about the same hour, I saw him again, in company with the same female and a man, they stood a few doors off Mr. Driver's shop, while the prisoner went in; when he had been there a minute or so, I took hold of the female, forced her into the shop, and asked Laird what he had come for - he said a sheet of writing paper, and had given him a shilling; I said, "Look at it;" he did so, and said it was bad - he marked it, and gave it to me - I searched the prisoner, and found 1 1/2d. in his waistcoat pocket; I said, "What do you want with change?" he said he did not know he had the penny; I took hold of the woman - the other man ran away; I have kept the shilling ever since.</p>

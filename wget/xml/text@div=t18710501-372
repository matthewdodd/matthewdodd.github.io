                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 44, Queen Street, Brompton—on 18th April, at 1.30 in the morning, I was making my way home from the Royal Avenue, Chelsea; nearly opposite Keppel Street, I was attacked by three persons—they seized me by the throat, and threw me down, and rifled my right trowsers pocket, and took my watch and chain from my left hand waistcoat pocket—my coat was buttoned—they tore one button off in getting the coat open—I was very much hurt in my throat—I felt it for a week afterwards—I am better now, but my left thumb is still very bad—I lost three keys, a pocket knife, and about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—the prisoners are the two that were taken off of me—Ireland was taken off me, and the other ran away—I had not seen them before I was knocked down, they attacked me so suddenly—I halloaed out as soon as I could release their arms from my neck—a policeman came up directly—my forehead was injured—I had the skin knocked off—there is a slight soar now—that was in consequence of striking the ground—I could not tell who it was that knocked me down, but Ireland was on the top of me—I was a little the worse for drink.</p>

About 1.30 on this night I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" as I was at the bottom of Royal Avenue Terrace—I ran through a short square, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Ireland apparently rising from the top of him, and Whiting, when I got close to him—he jumped to his feet, and ran in an easterly direction—there was another man also who ran away in an opposite direc<lb></lb>tion, and escaped—I secured Ireland, and handed him over to a constable—I pursued the third man for a considerable distance, but lost sight of him, and I then returned to see that the other two did not escape—I produce a watch and chain, which was picked up by Stagg, in my presence, 5 yards or 6 yards from where the prosecutor lay, and in the same line, that Whiting ran—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor—he was able to walk</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 379). I heard a scuffle, and cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" on this night, in St. Leonard's Terrace—I ran up the centre of the road, and seeing Whiting running away I caught him in my arms, and ran him back to where the prosecutor was on the ground—I took charge of Ireland—the prosecutor got up, and said "I have lost my watch, chain, and money"—Connell pursued a third man, who escaped—he then came back—I heard something drop, and I asked Connell to turn his lamp on, which he did—we could not find anything there, but on going towards the station I found this watch and chain lying on the footway, 'near where I caught Whiting—Ireland then said it was Whiting who took the watch and chain, and it was him that dropped it—Whiting made no answer to that—I picked up a button, and a piece of watch<lb></lb>glass also—Ireland said that he had been drinking with the prosecutor in the "Latimer" Arms, Chelsea—the prosecutor said "I know nothing about you."</p>

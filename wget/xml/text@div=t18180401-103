            . I am the wife of the last witness. I went out about a quarter past eleven in the morning, and did not return till the next morning; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth above 10l., The officer found three caps, which I knew to be mine The house is situated in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GARTON. I am a police officer of Worship-street; I had been looking after the prisoner for six months on another charge. On the 25th of March, which was the day after the robbery, I took him in Chiswell-street, and took him to a public-house next door to the office; I found a piece of linen and four caps on him; I had not heard of this robbery; I asked him where he got them? he said, they belonged to his child. The prosecutor and his wife came in at that moment, and saw me take them out of his pocket; she claimed three of the caps and the linen; the prisoner refused to tell where he lived, but afterwards said he lived in the Borongh. I went to his wife's mother's house, but found nothing.</p>

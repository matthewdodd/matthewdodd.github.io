                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Mellish at the Steam flour Mills, Woolwich—about November last I entered into negotiations with the prisoner as to his becoming our traveller—before we entered into any definite arrangement he brought a proposal form from the Guarantee Society, which I filled up—he entered our service early in December—the first arrangement we made with him was that he was to obtain orders for flour from bakers, and if they were satisfactory we should execute them and pay him a com<lb></lb>mission of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack until the guarantee was properly executed, and we held the right of collecting the money until the guarantee was carried oat, and on no account was he to collect it; in fact, it was his on proposition that we should withhold the right of collecting the money untri the guarantee was perfect—he was to travel for us, and for us only—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150133"></xptr>
               <p>arrangement was mode in Mark Lane—he said in January last that he should be able to get the guarantee through in a few days, but as he had been in the Bankruptcy Court, and had not got his discharge, the Guarantee Society would not fulfil the guarantee until he had obtained his discharge, which would take place in a very short time—we then increased his commission from 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack to help him in his travelling expenses, and he was to receive 101. a year salary—up to that time he had collected no money, but afterwards he did collect money by special order—if any person's money was. ready, and it was not convenient for us to go for it, we gave him a special order in writing to collect it; the invoice of the goods was endorsed, "Please—pay our Mr. Urquhart, and oblige yours obediently"—after that he occa<lb></lb>sionally collected money under those circumstances, and it was his duty immediately to pay it into one of the branches of the London and County Bank, or meet me on market day, Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, and pay it to me, and failing to see me on the market he was to come down to the mill at Woolwich and pay it—the commission was paid on the execution of the order, whether the goods were paid for or not, in each case separately, by cheque at the end of the month, for the amount at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per sack—I saw the prisoner at Mark Lane Market on, I think, Wednesday, 18th June—he paid me some money which he had received, and said that he should get. some more by Saturday, and if he did not see me on Friday he would come down to the mill—he did not come, but on Saturday evening I received this. telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him on Monday, the 23rd, that I had received a telegram from him on Saturday saying that he had sent a cheque, but we had not received it—he said, "No, when I sent that telegram I thought I could get a cheque from my brother-in-law, but I have the money here in the bag"—he was carrying a small black bag—I said; "You, might as well give it to me"—he said, "I would rather come down to the mill, as I want to have my book made up, and I will be down there by 6 o'clock at the latest" (<hi rend="italic">The telegram stated</hi>: "Unable to see you to-day; posted cheque for 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as advised") I never received a cheque for that amount—we had the advice on the Saturday morning in a letter from him, enumerating, the accounts from persons paying—he did not come on the Monday night, in consequence of which I sent Mr. Jay up, who made a communication to me next morning, and about 2 on that day, Tuesday, the prisoner came down to the mill—I said, "Have you brought your account?—he said, "No, I have come away in a hurry, and I have not brought it, but I can tell you my deficiencies if you go over the ledger and show me the people's accounts"—it was a clerk's duty to keep the ledger—I got it and went over the accounts page by page, and he said, when we came to one account, "That account is right," and to another, "I have had that account," and the different moneys amounted to 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I particularly dwelt upon the account of John Weiss, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "Is this account unpaid?"—he said "Yes," and to another acconnt, Mr. Holden's, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said, "That is still owing"—I had seen him four or five times between the 10th and 24th June, but he had said nothing about Weiss's account—the interview lasted about an hour and a half, and I think he went away by the 5.30 train—on the 26th he came down to the mill with a cousin, whom he introduced as Mr. Webster, from the Audit Office of the London, and North-Western Railway, and said, "I have brought my cousin to see—if we cannot make some arrangement respecting this money"—the cousin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150134"></xptr>
               <p>then said, "It is a very bad job, and I should very much like to assist him in the matter"—I said, "In what way can you assist him?"—he said, "By becoming security for his future good behaviour"—I said."what is your position?"—he said." I am in the Audit Office if the London and North-western Railway, and am in a position to become security for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Before we enter into anything for the future we must settle the past; I cannot think of entering into any fresh arrangement till the acconunts are made up"—no arrangement was come to, and on the 26th I went to his house at Dalston with a constable, and said to him, "since you were at the mill on Wednesday I have found out that you have collected more money than you accounted for then, and that, notwithstanding your having had a letter and also a verbal warning as to collecting any more money, we have found out that you have collected further sums of money, and gave him in costody—the verbal notice was at the mill on Tuesday—I said, "Have you received a letter?"—he said "No"—I said, "you will receive it on going home now, and I will tell you the purport of it is to warn you not to take any more money, in whatever shape it may be offered to you, on our account; if you do, it will go hard with you"—I wrote the letter on monday night, the 23rd, while Mr. Jay was gone to the prisoner's house—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was posted on the 24th because it was too late to register it on the 23rd—when I gave him in custody he said, "Can we not settle the matter?"—I said "No"—he said, "Well, you know what you are doing"—I said, "Perfectly"—he said, "If you had waited for your money you would have had it, but if I get seven years now I don't care." or words to that effect—I gave this bill to the prisoner at the mill at the end of may. (<hi rend="italic">This was an invoice to a Mr. Weiss for</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">sacks of four</hi>, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on which was written, "Please pay to our Mr. Urquhart, and oblige yours truly, R. and M.</hi>") We had also given him a document to collect 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Holden, and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Draper—he never told me that he had got those amounts, and we did not find it out till we issued a circular, after he was in custody, and we have never had any of the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not heard that Mr. Mellish disapproves of this prosecution; he is here—on 24th June I came to the knowledge that there was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd over and above the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 24th June 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to the prisoner on the May account for commission—I drew up on that occasion this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without mentioning a word about the 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a written memorandum between us, but there is nothing in it about his being our traveller only or our clerk or servant in any way whatever—it is a memorandum of the terms upon which he was to work for us until the Gurantee Society entered into arrangements with him—the only alteration in his service was to be that if they agreed to become his security then he was to collect money—the simple fact is that he was to send us such orders as he liked from his connection, and we were to execute them, and by a subsequent arrangement he was to be paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was not for the purpose of paying the Guarantee Society—I can't tell you what he was going to do with it—I cannot say whether the I do not know what he was going to do with it—I cannot say whether the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra was to be paid him in consequence of the negotiations of the Guarantee Society—I swear the most decidedly—I know the Guarantee Society declined to enter into any arrangement with him unless I paid him a salary—I do not know whether the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to paid as a nominal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150135"></xptr>
               <p>salary for the purpose of satisfying the Guarantee Society and making him our clerk or servant—I know that they would not take him without he was ft servant, and that was the reason we gave it to him—it was to satisfy I the Guarantee Society—he has never received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was never I carried out, and he worked on the verbal understanding, and was only allowed to collect money in particular instances—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I are from the firm—some are in my writing, some in Mr. Jay's—I wrote to I him in February, "We send you invoices of flour as wanted; look up as much money as you can, we are hard up"—that was upon the invoices he received—he did not receive invoices for all the flour delivered to his order nor advices—this is Mr. Jay's writing to him: "Hunt the beggars up for the money;" also at the end of March, "Ton will please us by making an effort to get us a large amount this week; your special attention to the above will be esteemed"—he might get orders when and where he liked so that he did it in a proper business-like way—I cannot tell what my clerk may have written to him in a friendly manner—I did not authorise him to write this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner met me at Mark Lane three days a week, I can prove that by 50 witnesses, and he came to the mill every week; he never missed a week—I do not know that so far from collecting money and pressing customers for money, he has allowed accounts to stand over for the purpose of increasing our connection and keeping people in good humour—we had a letter from a Mr. Baker complaining that Urquhart did not call upon him for the money or he would have had it long before—this is a letter of my manager's; it states, "Mr. R. is under the impression that you do not call often enough for the money; if you cannot find time to do so we shall have to collect it ourselves"—he only brought us 50 or 60 customers, and there is commission due to him on those amounts, and we have been executing his orders both before and since he was taken in custody—his commission has been coming due to him day after day and week after week since we gave him in custody—some of our books are here—I have been through them—the total amount of his sales is not 9,769 sacks; I think about 7,000—I will swear that the commission he earned from December to his being given in custody, whether paid or unpaid, does not amount to 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is only about 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have calculated it accurately—I cannot say without the book what orders he sent in—he did not say that he could not go through the ledger with me because he had come away in a hurry and left his book behind—he begged of me to go through it, and I said "I shall not go through the accounts if you have not brought your book"—he said, "I can tell you how every account stands"—he gave me certain amounts, which I put down—I swear I put the 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, but not on that paper which you have or on any paper which I gave to him—that is the only paper I gave him—it only relates to the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swore at the police-court that he had taken Holden's and Draper's money, though he had had a registered letter from me telling him him not to do so—Holder swore at the police-court that the prisoner came in a cab on the morning of the 24th and collected his money, but Mrs. Draper did not swear that he came in a cab to her to my recollection—on the next day I promised in Mr. Webster's hearing to write to Mr. Urquhart on the Thursday, but I did not do so—it was to make an appointment to go round with Urquhart to his customers to find out the exact amount he had collected—I told Mr. Webster that Mr. Urquhart had better hunt up his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150136"></xptr>
               <p>friends, and that I did not care to supply his customers with any more flour until all the accounts were got in—I did not give as a reason that Mr. Urquhart could pay nothing out of his commission off the debt, and that I thought it would take all the pluck out of him—I said nothing about paying the debt off by the commission—it never became a debt at all—I never used such words—to the best of my belief commission was not men<lb></lb>tioned—I would not have accepted commission off the debt; there was no debt—I would not have accepted commission off the amount—I did not take 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission off the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in May, or credit him with it—we struck a balance "Less commission account"—if he had brought us 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we should have drawn a cheque—119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission would have made the amount up—this is not a debtor and creditor account at all—I did not say to Mr. Webster "You had better pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the debt, as although I do not wish to push your cousin, as that would do me no good and him a lot of harm, friendship is friendship, and money is money;" nor did I ask Webster to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the debt—I would not have taken it—I was determined to prosecute him—I swore at the police-court "I gave him in custody; if he had given me the money then I should have taken it:" but I should have prosecuted him too—I was anxious to dissolve partnership with Mr. Mellish two or three years ago, and I am anxious now—I do not know that he is anxious to take the prisoner into his service to travel for him, or that this prosecution is against his wishes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He sold about 7,000 sacks of flour, and about 5,000 were delivered, 4,000 of them between January and the time he was given in custody—there are about 1,500 to be delivered—out of the original orders about 1,500 or 2,000 sacks are cancelled—I paid him commission on flour sold and delivered—I have made up the account of the amounts he has received and not paid to us—the total is 353<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I can give you the amount of the bad debts of his customers—I made out the paper from the books, and these are the amounts he told me had collected in May for commission, and I would have given him a cheque for it if he had handed me the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he agreed to the amount due to him for commission to 31st May—he also earned about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission between 1st Juno and the 26th, when he was given in custody—assuming we delivered all the goods he sent orders for, and that they had been paid for, the extreme amount that could be due to him for commission, including May and June, would be about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., calculating everything in his favour, and doing his work for him—I have carefully gone through the books and taken out this abstract—he has never suggested at any interview that he was not a clerk or a servant, or that he had a right to deduct these moneys and take them himself—he frequently came to Mark Lane, and if he did not see me there he accounted to me at Woolwich, and he very frequently accompanied me to Woolwich—these letters are in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">One of these stated</hi>, "Holden's money is ready any time you like to send. As he knows none of this firm, he would prefer my being there when he pays, or if you send telegram authorising me to take the money, I will bring the cash to you at the market." <hi rend="italic">Another stated</hi>, "I will pay you in the market on Monday morning, if some one from the firm will call on him for his money. you had better write him to that effect." <hi rend="italic">Another stated</hi>, "Please write to George Brown to pay me in this instance; say nothing about paying into a bank.

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Rose and Mellish—on Monday evening, 23rd June, I received-orders to go to the prisoner's house at Dalston—I took with me this document, signed by the firm: "Sir,—We request you to pay Mr. Jay all moneys received or collected by you on our account, and request you will see us to-morrow"—I said, "I have come from the firm by the orders of Mr. Rose for the amount you have named in the telegram"—he said, "I have got the money, but I prefer bringing it down to the firm. will come down to-morrow"—I said, "It will make me appear small to go home without it, if you doubt my word, here is my authority," and produced the letter—he said, "I don't doubt you, but I prefer bringing it down"—I said, "I want the money; I have come purposely for it, and 1 shan't go home without it"—he afterwards said, "To tell the truth, old man, I have not got all the money"—I said, "You admit having taken it, if you have used some of it let us have what you have left"—he said, "I have not got any left, to make a long matter short, I spent some of the money, and betted the other away"—I went back to the office at 8.30 next morning.</p>

Am so thundering busy, have not had time to do your ledger, but you have the bills, so no matter"—those were the bills that I had written on—he could collect orders when and where he liked if we approved of the customers—we did not depend upon his con<lb></lb>nection entirely to increase our business, we were increasing it ourselves as well—Mr. Mellish used to travel, we had no other agent—on June 4,1879, I wrote, "Let me see if we cannot pull your connection up to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this month; you have done about 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for May, you might work it up another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I also wrote to him that if he occasionally ran down, he would soon have a connection second to none.</p>

Rose and Mellish, of the'Steam Flour Mills, Woolwich"—he said, "I own I received the money; Mr. Rose knows I did"—I said, "Have you got any of the money about you?"—he said, "I have not; if Mr. Rose had not taken these steps I should have made the money good, but now if I were to get sevon years I would not pay him one farthing"—I found this pocket book on him with this letter in it.

The 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put in to make him a servant, as unless of he was a servant the Society would not give the guarantee—I swear that it was not put in to satisfy the Society; that was not our idea; it was to make him a servant—he was to go into our agency at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack at first, and it was altered to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack after negotiations had been entered into with the Society—these words, "10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and "6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per sack commission," are Mr. Rose's writing—the Society would not accede to the arrangement' unless we paid him a salary, but we did not then pay him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack instead of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. because they would not grant the guarantee, the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack extra for his travelling expenses, which were rather heavy—the Society did not, to my knowledge, tell us that they would not guarantee him, nor do I know it from them—I heard from the prisoner that it was because he had failed in business, but that if he got his discharge they would give him the guarantee at once, and he said that he expected to get his discharge every day—I have no recollection of this form being returned to our firm in the first instance, because no salary was put down, nor did my partner and I discuss whether we should insert a nominal salary—it may have been returned, but I have no recollection of it being returned from the office.</p>

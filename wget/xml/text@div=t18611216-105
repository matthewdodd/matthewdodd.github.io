                  </hi>. I am a cigar-maker, of 22, Park-street, Tabernacle-square—on Saturday, 23d November last, I was with the deceased, William Sylvester, at the White Hart public-house, in Hooper-square, Whitechapel—we went into the parlour—the prisoner was there—the first thing that called my attention was the prisoner making use of bad language, and the deceased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160031"></xptr>
               <p>said he was surprised to hear such language from a man, especially in the parlour—after that they had a few words of talking, and the prisoner made a blow or shove with his elbow at the deceased—the deceased was then sitting on a seat in a corner close by the prisoner—after that the prisoner struck him in the face, a back-handed slap—I do not think he did anything when the prisoner shoved him with his elbow—he said something, but I cannot say what—he did not strike the prisoner—the back-handed blow was a heavy one, it drew blood—I saw his nose bleeding a trifle, not much—on receiving that blow Sylvester got up and tried to return it, but I do not know whether he did or not—the prisoner then commenced fighting with his fists—he struck him several times about the face, as it appeared to me—I should say five or six times—the deceased was then in a sitting posi<lb></lb>tion in the corner—the prisoner got up when he made the blows with his fist-**the deceased tried to get up, but the prisoner being so much heavier a man, forced him down again—the deceased was a smaller man than myself—about this time, James Sylvester, the deceased's brother, came into the room—he went to his brother's assistance—I believe he made a blow at the prisoner—I cannot say whether it took effect or not; they had a scuffle between the three—the landlord then came in and said he would have no fighting there, and he proceeded to push them out of the room—a few minutes afterwards I heard a scuffling at the bar, and I went to see what was the matter—I had remained in the parlour—I saw several persons round the bar, and the deceased lying on the floor—I believe the prisoner was one of the persons round him—I saw James Sylvester endeavouring to pull his brother up—I think I remarked, "Let the man get up; do not strike him when he is down," and then his brother carried him to the door—I followed him out of the door; he laid his brother down on the ground, and then told him to get up, and he replied, "I cannot; my leg is broken"—I afterwards helped to put him in a cab, and take him to the hospital—I saw that he was injured—he had been drinking a little, but knew perfectly well what he was about—the prisoner appeared to be in about the same state.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean by that, that they were both drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not drunk, they had been drinking a little—you could hardly term it worse for liquor—it was obvious they had been drink<lb></lb>ing—I should say it was the prisoner who first made use of the bad language—I had been there about three-quarters of an hour, I should say—I had been drinking very little indeed—I had about half a glass of gin in the house, and I do not think I had had three pints of beer the whole afternoon—the scuffle which resulted in the fall of the deceased was in the bar, not outside the house—I was not there when it commenced; it was all over when I came up—I should say about five minutes intervened between their leaving the parlour and my seeing the deceased on the ground—I do not know how he came on the ground—I did not see him struck when he was down—I merely used that expression in the flurry of the moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the deceased, and am a cigar<lb></lb>maker, living at 8, Black Don-yard, Whitechapel—he died on Wednesday, 27th November, at the London Hospital—I was at the White Hart on the 23d, attending a club in the upstair's room—I was about leaving the house with other members, when I heard that my brother was in the parlour, and I went to bid him good night—I found him sitting at the further corner, at the extreme end of the seat—the prisoner sat on his right hand, close to him—it was a small room, and very full—I saw the prisoner in the act of striking him in the face with his right hand as hard as he could—the blow produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160032"></xptr>
               <p>a bruise on his face, and his nose bled—those who knew my brother could see that he had been drinking something, though he was decidedly not drunk, or in any way incapable—I should say the prisoner, from his appearance, was more advanced in drink—I saw him deliberately strike my brothe again, and I crossed the room hurriedly, and got to him as soon as I could; but the room being full, it was occupied in the middle of it by persons sitting on chairs—I called to the prisoner as I got near him, and meant to stop his arm, for he was about striking a second time—I was about getting hold of his arm, and he threw it over my face, to keep me off, and I was in<lb></lb>stantly engaged in a scuffle with him—I pulled him out of the seat, turned him round, and got into it to screen my brother—he held on to me, and hugged me, and forced me down with my back on the settle, in the place he had sat in, and we were in that position when the landlord entered—he said he would not hare any noise there—he first pushed the prisoner out of the room—my brother did not want to go out; he was forced out by the landlord—he resisted with all his might—I followed them—I appealed to the landlord not to turn him out, as he might get ill-used—when we got to the bar the pri<lb></lb>soner stood in front of my brother, and a companion of his, of the name of Pierson—they were both calling on my brother to come out and fight—he said nothing—he remained at the bar alongside of me—the prisoner kept calling my brother names, and me also, and urging him to go out to fight—from Pierson's threatening me, I was forced to leave my brother, and as I did so my brother struck at the prisoner, and said, "Get away"—the prisoner was in front of him at the time, in a threatening attitude, demand<lb></lb>ing that he should come out to fight—there was great passion displayed when my brother struck him—he took hold of my brother by the collar, and hugged him close to him, turned him round from the bar, and they reeled or inclined towards a corner, about six feet from where my brother had been standing, and they fell into the corner, my brother downwards, and the prisoner on the top of him—I do not know whether he threw him, or how it was, but my brother went under him—he was a very slight man—I do not know that he laid bold of the prisoner; I could not see that—the prisoner is a very powerful man compared to my brother—I picked him up—I found that he did not attempt to use his legs, and as soon as I got him out of hearing of the others, he said his leg was broken—he had had no other fall as far as I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart public-house in Hooper-square, Whitechapel—on this night I saw a scuffle take place between the prisoner, the deceased, and the last witness, in the parlour—that was what I first observed—on seeing that, I caught hold of the deceased and pushed him out of the room, and said I did not want any fighting or any row in my establish<lb></lb>ment—I likewise pushed the prisoner out—there is a passage leading from the parlour to the bar, about thirty or forty feet long—I walked up to the bar and stood there for about a quarter of an hour-there were still very angry words on both sides; they were talking about fighting and what they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160033"></xptr>
               <p>would do—the prisoner said something about licking the deceased, or any<lb></lb>body else—another man stood between the prisoner and the deceased, and the deceased's brother stood behind him—all of a sadden the deceased rushed by the man that stood between him and the prisoner, and struck the prisoner in the face—a scuffle ensued, and they both fell on the floor in the bar—I believe each laid hold of the other—I can't say who laid hold first—I am sure I saw the deceased strike the prisoner in the face—I found after<lb></lb>wards he had struck him in the eye, and almost blinded him—I can't say who fell uppermost, but I believe it was the prisoner—the deceased's brother took him outside, and he said he could not stand, that his leg was broken—they appeared to have been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased very much the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say that he was; I think they were both alike—they were not what you would call drunk—this occurred about 11 o'clock—I only knew the prisoner as an occasional customer—I have not been there long.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there on Saturday night, 23d November—he had sustained a compound fracture of the right thigh bone—he died on the following Wednesday evening from the shook—he never recovered from the shook caused by the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he a man of bad habit of body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was rather; he was about thirty years of age—he was not labouring under any disease—I made a post-mortem examination, and found nothing else to account for death—mortification did not set in—he died from the shock to the nervous system—the local injury was progressing favourably—he had his senses all the time—I apprehended serious consequences from the first—he was taken suddenly worse on the day he died, and he died about 8 in the evening—I had seen him about an hour before, and again about three hours before that—I was called to him suddenly about an hour before his death—when I saw him three hours before I anticipated fatal results, he had sick<lb></lb>ness and was very faint—I examined all the viscera—I found tubercles of the lungs, not sufficient to account for death—they were not in a state of suppuration—I examined the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

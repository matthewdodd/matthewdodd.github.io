On the 29th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was at the end of the alley - Mrs. Smith stood there, talking to a woman; I passed them, and at the end of the alley the prisoner was sitting down on a step; Smith came up, and said to him, "Bad luck to you, you good for nothing rascal - you should have passed me civilly, and not have thrown down my basket and butter;" she put her hand to his breast; I do not know whether her fist was doubled; she shoved him or struck him; he made no reply, but jumped up and knocked her down, with his fist; the back of her head came against the pavement; I seized him, and called for an officer - he struck me, and was rescued - he is a coal-heaver.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 30th of May I was called to the deceased - she had a slight bruise over her left eye, and a severe one on the back of her head, which might have been caused by a fall; she died on the 6th of June. I opened her - there was a fracture on the skull, which caused her death - it might have happened by a fall on the pavement.</p>

The prisoner was not sitting down, but standing.</p>

I was coming down the court; the prisoner was taking a sack off the waggon; I went behind him - these people were coming up - Smith pushed him on the left, to make him pass on the right - he kept on the left, and brushed his sack or elbow against her basket, and down it fell; he went on, and when he returned she said,"You good for nothing rascal, how could you serve me so" - he up with his hand, and hit her on the left side of her face - she fell on her back. He was making fun of her with his mouth, and she slightly put her hand to him to keep him off.</p>

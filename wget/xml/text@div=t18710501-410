I am staff sergeant of pensioners at Woolwich—it is part of my duty to pay the reserve force for that district, when their money is due—the men who are entitled to their money have to appear before me in person to claim it—on Tuesday, 4th April, the prisoner presented himself at the Pension Office at Woolwich Dock Yard, and answered to the name of William Lock—I called the name of William Lock, and he stood forward and answered to it—I asked him if he was William Lock, and he replied "Yes, sir"—I told him there was an order to arrest him, and I handed him over to a policeman—when before the Magistrate he said he was not William Lock, that his name was John Thomas, and that he had been sent by a man with a black-eye to draw this money, and he was to get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had not been in the service—I had asked him what regiment he belonged to, and he said the 95th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old. I live with my father at Woolwich—he is a labourer. On 2nd Dec. the prisoner came to my father's house about a quarter before 5 o'clock—I had seen him before, two or three times a day, and he had been in my father's house for tobacco—he asked for a halfpenny worth of sweets—I served him—he then asked for some water—I took a tumbler off the mantel piece in the shop to get it—my father's watch was then hanging on a nail over it—I had to get the water from the kitchen—I left the prisoner in the shop—when I had got the water the prisoner came to the foot of the stairs—he drank part of the water—I threw the other part away and he left—I went into the shop and stayed there till my mother came home in about a quarter of an hour, when the watch was missed—from the time the prisoner left, no person came into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd Dec. I left my shop in charge of the last witness, and went out about 2 o'clock to go to my work—the watch was hanging on a nail over the mantel shelf—I returned a little before 5 o'clock—I found my daughter in the shop—the watch was then gone—I gave information to the police—I was present the next day when the prisoner was apprehended—I heard the constable charge him, in my shop, on sus<lb></lb>picion of stealing this watch the night before—the prisoner said he had never been in our room before in his life—I told him lie had been in before for tobacco and for matches to light his pipe—I recollect his coming for tobacco about three weeks before this took place—I knew him well—I had seen him every day for three weeks.</p>

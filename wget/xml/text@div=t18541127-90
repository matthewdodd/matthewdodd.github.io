                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the shipwright department of the Woolwich Steam Packet Company; I have care of the stores—I missed from the workshop a pair of scales; one copper, and one metal, on 4th Oct.—I had seen them safe on the 3rd—I also missed a quantity of rope—that was from the steam boat under repair—I missed the rope on 30th Oct.—this is the scale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was only the bottom taken away; the frame was left—the copper one I have not since seen—it has been broken up—I can speak to it positively—I have had it eight or nine years—there is a peculiar mark—when put together, the bits exactly fit the frame—this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to that I missed—I can swear to this piece being in my hand on 28th Oct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine store dealer, living at Woolwich. I know the prisoner, I bought this pewter scale of him on 5th Oct.; it was broken to pieces—I also bought some rope of him on 3rd Nov.—he told me, when he brought the plate, he was a sailor on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> brig, lying at Busby's-hole, from Sunderland; the rope, he said, he got by dredging, out of the river.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That was not the rope I sold him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> This is one piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I noticed this piece of rope having been cut off; I turned round to him and said, "If there is any thing wrong, depend upon it I shall not screen you," knowing, at the time, there was this case against him—that piece I can swear to, it did not go out of my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of information I received, I applied to the last witness, and this scale was given up to me then—that was on 5th Oct.—I afterwards received this rope from him—I went there and found it—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody—I found him at a lodging in Meeting-house-lane—I told him to consider himself in my custody, for stealing rope belonging to the Steam Boat Company, that he had sold to a marine store dealer in High-street—he said he had not sold any rope, and had not had any; but I took him to the shop, and he was immediately iden<lb></lb>tified as the person who sold it—then I told him he was further charged with stealing a metal scale from the workshop of the same Company, which he sold about a month previously; he said he never sold any, and never had any—I told him I must take him to the station, and I did so.</p>

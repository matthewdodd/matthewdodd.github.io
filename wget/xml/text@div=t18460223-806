On the 3rd Feb. about seven o'clock in the evening I was on duty at Kennington, and saw George Baynes it the corner of Park-street—I heard a whistle and gave him into custody, I then got through an empty house, No. 59, Park-street—I fell over a grate in the yard—I got over to the next house and found the prisoner coming out of the back door with this grate on his shoulder, which I produce—I asked what business he had there—he said, "None"—I asked what he was going to the with the grate, he threw it down and struck me on the wrist with a piece of iron—another officer came up—I secured the prisoner and took the grate to the station—I am sure he had it on his shoulder, and his hands were all over soot found fresh lime, such as a person would meet with in pulling away a grate—I found five other grates had been moved, ready to be taken away, and one tad been taken from Nos. 59, 60, and 61, Park-street.</p>

On Tuesday, 22d Dec, Robert Durrant came in about 4 o'clock, or a little after; he asked for half an ounce of tobacco, I served him, and he gave me a counterfeit shilling—I took up the shilling, bent it with my teeth, and threw it down, and he gave me another in exchange which was good—this is the counterfeit shilling.</p>

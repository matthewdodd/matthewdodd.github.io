                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secretary's Department, Custom-house, London—I saw the defendant on the 15th October—I had sent for him to apprise him of his established appointment which he had received—I then told him that he must produce evidence as to his age—I also gave him certain documents to fill up—after having got these documents from me he tendered a certificate of baptism—on looking at that I found that it merely went to the question of baptism—I apprised him that that would not be sufficient evidence as to his age; that he may have been any age at the time of his baptism—he then volunteered to write his age upon the certificate of baptism—I told him that he must not do that—I drew his attention to the printed statement at the bottom of the certificate, that it was a correct extract from the certificate of baptism—I told him that if he added anything it would get him into trouble—that certificate I gave him back again, as it was of no use to me—I told him that he must produce a further certificate as to his birth—he then left me—the following Saturday he attended again, and brought me the forms I had given him to fill up, and this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in proof of his birth—the date here is 19th January, 1843, which agreed with the statement which he made on the form—I observed to him that the date had been altered—I asked him if he had made the alteration—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he again denied it—I told him that it would be necessary that he should produce further evidence as to his age—I had issued some inquiries to him, and said that in the course of the inquiries which he would undergo he would have to attend at Somerset-house, and then he was to ask for a cer<lb></lb>tificate of the Registrar-General—one of the inquiries was to send him to the medical inspector—he went, but the medical inspector was not at home—he returned to me about 1 o'clock—that was the second attendance on Saturday—I told him that I would re-issue the inquiries on Monday—he again left me a third time on the Saturday; about a quarter to 4, he came to me, and said that he had seen his brother, and spoken to him with reference to his age, and that he supposed that he was under the age, the regulation age being from twenty to twenty-five—he further stated, but I cannot say positively whether it was in reference to a further question, or in continuation of his statement, that his certificate had been altered, he thought by his father—he appeared anxious to recover the document, but I was not at liberty to give it to him—I told him to attend on Monday—he did not attend, nor did he come on Tuesday—I then reported the circumstance to the Board—I saw no more of him with reference to this matter—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday he brought a certificate from the Registrar-General, a sort of further form, but that was simply attached to the papers, and no further proceed<lb></lb>ings took place between him and myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Customs—on 6th November I saw the defendant—his father was with him, and I said to him that, in consequence of information I had received, I understood that he had reported that his father had made an alteration in the certificate of birth—he said no, his father had sent it to him as he received it from the Registrar but had made the alteration—I told him it was a great pity, as I had no doubt the Board of Customs would have kept open his appointment until he was of age—he said he had seen a friend, who had advised him to make the alteration—he was extremely sorry for what he had done; he only wanted three months of being of the age of admission, and he was not aware that he had done anything that might turn out so bad, he had not only lost his appointment, but he had also lost his situation of extra man, where he had been employed some months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And had he given great satisfaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I have made inquiries—he was very steady, and attentive to his business,—I believe the Board would have kept open the appointment if he had waited—I don't know that when I told him that the appointment would be kept open, he said he was aware of it; but he said he was not aware of the nature of the alteration that he had made.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that, although the defendant had altered the figures in the certificate, and intended thereby to impose upon the person to whom it was shown, he had not done so with a fraudulent intent; he called attention to the words of</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">th sec.</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th Vic; the offence was not charged in the indictment simply as a forgery, but as a fraudulent alteration, and before the Jury could convict, they must be of opinion that he intended some fraud that he was to get something by; even if he had done the act with an intention to deceive, it had been held that the word "deceive" must be defined to mean an intent to defraud; he</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>) <hi rend="italic">would not say that a cer<lb></lb>tificate could not be altered in such a way as to defraud, as in the case of suc<lb></lb>cession to property, but contended that there was no intent to defraud in this instance.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that it need not be a pecuniary fraud in order to come under the statute; the point was a very plain one; the prisoner had stated that he altered the certificate because he thought he should lose his appointment; if he altered it to obtain the appointment, it was, beyond all question, fraudulently done: if there was a rule in a public office that appli<lb></lb>cants for appointments should be of a certain age, it was a very important matter that one person should not gain undue advantage over another by pre<lb></lb>senting a false certificate; it was very important, in a public point of view, that it should be understood that such an alteration was a fraud, or public offices would be flooded with false certificates. If this alteration was made by the prisoner in order to obtain an appointment which he could not otherwise obtain at that time, it was to all intents a fraud.</hi>

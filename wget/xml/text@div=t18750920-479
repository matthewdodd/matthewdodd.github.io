               <p>11th August, I sold the prisoner some hay bands, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I put it in my pocket and gave him the change—I had no other money, and had to borrow the change for him—a man spoke to me and I found the shilling was bad and gave it to a policeman who went with me to the mews where the prisoner was and gave him in charge—he said "For God's sake don't give me in charge; I am a ruined man; I have a wife and a large family; I have been led into this."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman in Eccleston Mews, five or six weeks previous to the prisoner being given in charge; he came to me to buy some hay bauds, it came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a florin—I said I had no change, but I will go down the Street and get it—he objected to that and I asked my wife for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave him, and about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards he left—the florin did not leave my hand; I took it to a public-house, and the barmaid said that it was bad—I took it back and threw it on the dunghill, because I felt ashamed that I was so <hi rend="italic">bested</hi>—the dusthole has been emptied about five times since that—I am quite certain that the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I picked him out from four others—the policeman did not take me aside and say something to me, when I was going into the yard to identify the prisoner—he did not go up to the prisoner and look him straight in the face; I swear that—he went into the yard where the prisoner was and left me round the corner; he then beckoned to me to go into the yard—there were four or five men there—I did not go up to another man, before I went up to the prisoner and look at him, and say "I think that is him"—I did not go up to another person before I picked out the prisoner—I went up with my hand up all along the line—I do not remember the policeman saying as my hand pointed to the prisoner "That is the man you wan't"—he did not point to him and say so; I swear that positively—he did not point out any of the five—I was walking with the policeman on, I think, Sunday, in Warwick Street—I was in his company five or ten minutes; we were talking about something which has nothing to do with this case—he did not tell me that, when the prisoner was being led to the cells—he said "You scoundrel for serving me like this, when the girl picked out another"—he never told me that the prisoner called him a scoundrel—I don't recollect seeing the policeman since that—he came and said that he would call on me, and he called on a Sunday—I saw him yesterday evening, when he came to tell me what time to come here this morning, but he was only at my house five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was out of Court when Stanton was examined—he was placed round a corner in the station yard while we were marshalling the pri<lb></lb>soners, he could not see us—I was present when Stanton handed the shilling to the inspector, I received it from him—the prisoner said at the station that he got the two sixpences from a greengrocer—the sergeant said nothing about investigating the matter that I heard.</p>

I am a cleaner at Westminster police-station and have been so for seven years—on 23rd August I was placed with the pri<lb></lb>soner and other men, Stanton then came in and picked out one man and then he said "That is not the man," and then he came and picked me out and said "That is the man"—the prisoner then fell out—Stanton after<lb></lb>wards said that I was not the man and then he picked out the prisoner—he had then rejected two—Carson was there, but I never heard him speak except to say "see if you can pick out the man"—I have no doubt about his picking out me and another man before he picked the prisoner out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not called before the Magistrate, I was in the neighbourhood of the court, I gave no information because I was not aware that it was important and "I forgot it, but when he came to speak about the man with the hay bands and the counterfeit shilling it came to my memory directly by my being picked out—the prisoner might have been two below me, we were in a row like soldiers—I was not told to stand among the men, but I generally do it—Stanton said "That is the man there," pointing out the one before me; afterwards he said "No, that is not the man," and came up farther and pointed to me. and said "That is him," and then he said "No, that is him," pointing to the prisoner—there were two rejected before he came to the prisoner; no communication passed between him and the constable—he looked at the faces of all before he made any selection—the conversation between me and Dutton was ten</p>

               <p>days or a fortnight ago—he said "I want to see you Mitchell about that case of the hay bands;" I had not then heard of the prisoner in connection with hay bands—I never had any conversation with the prisoner about it and had never seen him before and had no knowledge who he was—I knew what he was charged with, he had been a week remanded, it was giving a bad shilling for some hay bands and therefore I connected the prisoner with the shilling.</p>

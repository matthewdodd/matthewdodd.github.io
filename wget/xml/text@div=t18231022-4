A single man lodges on my second floor, and one in the attic - there is a private door; both the lodgers and myself have the key of it. On the 17th of September, I went out at the private door three times within an hour before the robbery; my lodger was at home, and might have left the door open. About eleven o'clock, I was going to the first floor, and met the prisoner on the stairs, between the first and ground floors - I said nothing to him, thinking he might have come down from the lodger; his looks excited my suspicion. I ran up, saw my first floor door open, looked in, and saw my bookcase broken open, and cash gone - I ran down, out at the passage door, and saw him running seven or eight doors down the street; I followed, and on recovering my surprise called Stop thief - he was stopped in Belton-street; I only lost sight of him for an instant, as he turned the corner; I was ten or twelve yards from him - I did not see anything thrown away. I collared him when I came up, and said he must go with me - a crowd collected, who were disposed to rescue him, but I held him fast. A man stepped up, and offered his assistance - he helped me to take him to Bow-street, and in the way I saw him throwing the money about the street; he also threw a silver watch down, which I knew to be mine; a man in the crowd picked it up; it was delivered to Cousins, at Bow-street. At the office ten sovereigns, three crowns, and other silver, amounting to 16 l. 19 s. in all, a gold ring, and two silver watches were produced, all of which are mine, and were safe half an hour before I met him on the stairs.</p>

I saw a watch, a gold ring, ten sovereigns, two half-crowns, three crowns, and 36 s. 6 d. found on him; the other watch was delivered to me by a stranger, and twenty-four more half-crowns, and 5 s. 6 d. were given to me, which he had thrown away. I found another key on him.

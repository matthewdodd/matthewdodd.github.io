               <p>on his shoulder—I asked him what he was carrying; he said, I think, "It is canvas"—I said, "Let me look;" I took it off his shoulder, and found that it was canvas—a sergeant, who was with me, took the prisoner—the sack was opened at the station, and found to contain this new canvas tent (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is quite new, and has the broad arrow on it in a number of places; it was in this bag, which has also the broad arrow on it, and the bag was in this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him whose sack it was, he said that it belonged to him, and that he found the things on the Common—he said that he lived at No. 7, Downes Terrace, Plumstead Road—I went there, and in the front room, under a bed, I found this tarpaulin, marked with the broad arrow—I also produce three blankets, which are all numbered.</p>

I was with Newell when the prisoner was stopped—I asked what he had, he said he believed canvas—on the road to the station, he said that he found it on Woolwich Common—he gave his address, Downes Terrace—I went there with Newell, searched the house, and found three blankets on the floor, under the bed, not forming part of the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant major of the third battalion military train, encamped on Woolwich Common. These blankets and tarpaulin are the property of the Queen—I stamped the blankets; they were kept in a shed adjoining the stables, about 200 yards from the huts, where the men sleep—this tent is worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., these blankets, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and this tarpaulin about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lieutenant and active adjutant of the third bat<lb></lb>tallion military train. The prisoner was formerly in the Royal Artillery, he was discharged about four years ago—I did not know him at Woolwich when he was in the artillery, but I knew him afterwards—the corps to which he belonged was at Woolwich; he was at Portsmouth some years, and I believe he was discharged at Woolwich previous to their going on foreign service—I have seen him on several occasions near the huts, which excited my suspicion; and on the Sunday previous to the 30th Oct., I paraded the men for Church, I went into the office, and a few minutes afterwards I went to the door and saw the prisoner standing between my office and the staff; in a few minutes he walked away with two privates in the direction of the stables, which are in connection with where the military stores are kept; he had a bag or bundle under his arm, and I remarked, what could he possibly be doing, going in that direction at that hour?</p>

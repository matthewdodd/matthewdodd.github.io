                  </hi>. I live at Skull, in the county of Cork, in Ireland. I was present on the 20th of Jan., 1835, when the prisoner was married in my mother's house at Skull, to my sister Martha Bennett, by John Barry, a Roman Catholic curate—the prisoner is a Roman Catholic—my sister and the prisoner lived together about four years—he left her in the City of Cork—the Roman Catholic clergy keep registers of marriages in their own dwelling-houses—the policeman has the certificate of the mar<lb></lb>riage—this is it—I compared it with the register in the police-constable's</p>

               <p>presence—it is correct—the prisoner was reputed to be a single man and my sister was single—I saw her yesterday fortnight—Ellen Bennett was present at the marriage—the prisoner was very kind to my sister, and very fond of her—it was his circumstances in life which caused him to leave her—he left to better his condition—we had two letters from him after he left Ireland—I never heard of his doing anything wrong before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired tradesman, and live at Greenwich. I was present at Greenwich Old Church, on the 30th of Nov., 1839—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then married to my daughter, Rebecca Tubman, according to the Protestant service—I have a certificate of the marriage, which I have examined with the parish register—it is correct—my daughter was twenty-three or twenty-four years old—the prisoner was described as a bachelor, as not having been married before—he lived with my daughter about three years—sometimes at Greenwich, and sometimes in London—I brought this prosecution forward—I first heard of it from a person who saw the prisoner going up in a railway carriage one day, and a person said to him, "How is your wife?"—he said he believed she was well, he had not seen her for two years—my daughter had 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 3 per Cento.—the prisoner drew it out very soon after they were married, and made a bad use of it—he has been away from her two years, and wrote occa<lb></lb>sionally, when he wanted assistance, that was all.</p>

I married the prisoner in Nov., 1839—we were to<lb></lb>gether about three years—we went to America, and returned again about two years ago—I then went to live with my father and mother again—the prisoner used to come to see me after we left America, till about a year and three months ago—we heard reports of his being married I suppose five years ago, but we had no proof of it.</p>

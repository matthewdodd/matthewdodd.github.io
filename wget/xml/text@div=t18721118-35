                  </hi>. I am a waiter at a restaurant in the Strand, and am a native of Hanover—on 9th August I was coming over in the boat from Ostend to Dover, and saw the prisoner and a young man named Herman Nagel on board—we got into conversation, and I came with them to London, and took them to Cline's Hotel, Finsbury Square—they said that they came from Hanover and were going to America—there was another German and his wife with us—we were living at Dover, and they asked me to come to London with them, and act as interpreter—we arrived at the hotel on Saturday, 10th August, and about 10.30 that day, May and myself, and the German and his wife, all went out together to make purchases—the young men brought no luggage with them, only a few books—May bought a six-chamber revolver in Oxford Street, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I do not know the name of the shop—we were all five present—he had said in passing other shops that he should buy one to <hi rend="italic">defence</hi> himself from pick<lb></lb>pockets—he also bought a tin box of cartridges—they both bought some portmanteaus and shirts, for which they spent, I suppose, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before they started that morning, May changed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in thaler notes—a thaler is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—next day, Sunday, I walked to Hyde Park and other places with them—on the Monday we went to the Crystal Palace, and in the evening to the Surrey Gardens, where there was shooting going on—they both shot, and I noticed that Nagel shot from his left shoulder and May from his right—we went from the Surrey Gardens to Cremorne, and got there about 9 o'clock—in the refreshment-room there we met three girls, who turned out to be Burgess, Gordon, and Curtis—the young men did not speak any English, and they asked me to make acquaintance with the girls—I found out that Burgess was a German, and May entered into conversation with her—we were, perhaps, half an hour at Cremorne, and on arrangement was made with Burgess that we should go next day to where they lived, 21, Langton Street, Chelsea—May made that arrangement; he had the address, I think; and next day, Tuesday, we all went there—they spent some money at Cremorne and the other places, but not so very much—we all remained at 21, Langton Street on Tuesday night—we found Burgess, Gordon, and Curtis there—they occupied separate rooms; Burgess occupied the ground floor, and May associated with her; Curtis occupied the first floor, over Burgess's room, and I took up with her; Gordon occupied the ground floor back, and Nagel took up with her—we all slept there that night, and the next day the young men brought their portmanteaus to that house—I was with them when they left the hotel—I did not see who paid the hotel bill; I did not—May usually carried the money—we all slept in the same house in the same way on Wednesday night—we went about together on Wednes<lb></lb>day, spending money and seeing sights, and about 2 o'clock on Thursday I went with them in a cab to Euston Square Station, with their baggage—they both said that they were going to America—the German and his wife</p>

               <p>were not with us then; we had lost sight of them—May gave me the money, and I took their tickets for them for Liverpool, and remained till the train started—I saw it carry them off—they paid for everything, and paid my expenses throughout, and their own—May usually carried the pistol—just as they were going away by the train, I said "I see you have money enough to reach America;" I saw that May had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "Oh, yes," said Paul May, "and if not I have got the pistol."</p>

I had not come from Germany, but from Belgium—I was there six months—I had been in England before, and was in the Union Club, at Bradford—these men were perfect strangers to me when I met them on board the steamer on Friday night till the following Thursday—I paid my fare by the steamboat, but paid nothing after I kept company with them—they gave me their names in Dover—Nagel usually carried the money—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Tuesday, 12th August, and May paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Thursday when they started for Liverpool—I mean to say that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all I had from them—I said before the Coroner that Nagel bought the pistol, but I was not sure—I gave my evidence last Friday to the Solicitor to the Treasury—I said before the Coroner that Nagel bought the pistol, and always kept it; I changed the names, I made a mistake—I, knew that the proceedings before the Coroner were on Nagel's body—I said before the Coroner "They had some 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English paper;" I meant that May had—May did not complain that I had taken some paper money from him, and also a 50-thaler piece—he did not say at any time that, in changing money, I had cheated him out of a 50-thaler piece—I did not change his money, he changed it—he never complained of my doing so—they had some cards printed at the Crystal Palace, with their names on them, but I did not know which was May and which was Nagel—I heard them call one another by their names, but I always thought May was Nagel—they called each other Herman Nagel and Paul May—I heard the names, but it was always in my mind that May was Nagel—that is the reason I give for saying before the Coroner that the other man bought the pistol.</p>

I am single, and am a German by birth—I have been in England about ten years—in August last I was living at 21, Langton Street—I was at Cremorne on Monday, 12th August, and there made the prisoner's acquaintance, and that of Nagel and Dircks—arrangements were made for them to come to Langton Street next day; and they came on the Tuesday, May went with me, Nagel with Gordon, and Dircks with Curtis—they all remained that night, and on the following day they brought their luggage—I saw May's portmanteau in the room, but did not see the con<lb></lb>tents of it—I did not see anything of a pistol that day—I do not remember when I first saw the pistol, but it was three or four days before the accident—they stayed there on Wednesday night, and left on the following day, Thursday—May told me that he was going to Liverpool on business, and that he would return on the Saturday morning, but he came on the Friday instead—he told me that he came from Berlin—I had not seen the pistol before the young men left on Thursday; I am quite sure of that—nothing had been said to me about the pistol—they went away, and I did not see Dircks afterwards—on the Friday May and Nagel returned—May said he had been to Liverpool; he did not say what for—he occupied my room as</p>

               <p>before, and Nagel went to Gordon's—on the next day, Saturday, May left his watch at a jeweller's in the Strand to be cleaned, I was with him—on the Monday they went out by themselves; they said they had been out on business—on the next day I missed their overcoats, and in the evening their railway shawls—I did not notice whether Nagel had his watch that day—he generally had his coat unbuttoned, but he then had it buttoned, I thought it strange, and asked him the time, and he said he did not know—I did not see him use his watch—they went out again on the Tuesday, the same as on Monday—May had a long chain which I missed on the Tuesday evening—he used to wear it—I first saw the pistol on the Sunday; they had it in their hands once or twice a day, loading it and unloading it—I first saw it in the sitting-room—it came out of May's portmanteau; it was loaded then I believe, and he unloaded it—Gordon and Nagel were there at the time—I told May to put it away—he said he did not want to put it away, and he kept loading and unloading it—I do not remember what he did with it, as he went into the other room for some time—I was in my room about half-an-hour or so, and then I heard some words in the other room, and went in and saw the pistol still in May's hand—I wanted him to put it away, and he would not do so—he was walking up and down the room, and at last he laid it on the armchair, and covered it over with his handkerchief, and I said to Gordon, that if she could, she had better take it away and hide it somewhere—I asked May to go into the other room with me, and while I was gone Gordon took the pistol up stairs to her own room—May returned from my room into the sitting-room, and when he missed it he was very much annoyed about it; he wanted me to give it to him, and I would not—he had a wet handkerchief in his hand and he hit Gordon in the face with it, but I do not think he did it inten<lb></lb>tionally—this was close upon 10 o'clock at night—Gordon and Curtis still occupied the second floor on Tuesday, and I the ground floor—when this took, place about the pistol Nagel said in May's presence that he had better go up stairs and leave them until the morning, and he went up stairs and Gordon too—May and I remained down stairs—on the following morning, Wednesday, May was very cross again, and said he would not eat his break<lb></lb>fast till he had the pistol—we used all four to breakfast together—I told Gordon she had better go and fetch it, and save any more words—she went up stairs, and I think Nagel went up too, and unloaded it—he came down and gave it to May, and at that time it was unloaded—when May got it, I believe he put it in his portmanteau, I don't exactly recollect—I saw a small box of fifty cartridges in May's possession, but I did not see him with any loose cartridges—May had a green or blue bag for the pistol—we all four breakfasted together on Wednesday, and May and Nagel went out together about 12 o'clock, and returned close upon 6 o'clock—I had been at home all the time—May returned in a Hansom cab about 1.30, as he had forgotten something—he went into the bedroom, and went out again—I did not see what he took with him—the cab was waiting for him—he was alone in the cab—they both returned about 6 o'clock, they were on very good terms—I went out about ten minutes afterwards, and went to Cremorne Gardens, leaving May, Nagel, and Gordon behind—I did' not notice whether Curtis was in the house when I went out—I was sent for to Cremorne close upon 10 o'clock, and returned at once to my lodgings; but I did not know what it was till I went into the room—I first went into my sitting-room; there were five or six people there, but I do not</p>

               <p>remember who they were—I was called up stairs, and went up into Gordon's room, and saw Nagel on the sofa; he appeared to be dead—May was in bed, I did not at that time see that he was wounded—I stayed in the room, and this letter was shortly afterwards brought to me by Mrs. Curtis and Ellen Gordon, with some pawntickets in it—I translated it to the police—a shell box was pointed out to me as the place where it was found—the letter was not there when I went to Cremorne, because I took a stud out of the box then—I had not seen May writing that day, but I have on other occasions—I have not seen enough of his writing to know it—I did not see the pistol that night—May remained in Gordon's room to be attended by a surgeon—next morning I asked him who wrote the letter—he said that he wrote it, and Nagel wrote on the the other side—he said nothing further about the letter at that time; but on the Saturday I told him he had put everybody to great inconvenience and trouble—he said "Why?"—I said "Because of the letter you left before"—he said "Why?"—I said "Because of the amount named," and that we did not see anything of the amount mentioned there; I was alluding to the 2,000 thalers—he said that they did not bring that money when they came to us, but they had been to two or three other places, travelling about, before they came—he did not say that they had been spending money—he said "Why did you show any one the letter?"—I said "I did not see the letter myself, it was in other hands than mine"—nothing further passed between us—when we went out together, May paid for the different things—he paid Nagel's and Dircks' expenses, as well as his own—presents were bought for me, and Gordon, and Curtis, which May paid for—May never told me why they left Germany, or what they were—he said they came from Berlin—the pawntickets were in the letter when it was shown to me.</p>

I attended on May, and sat up with him and nursed him the first night, and Mrs. Burgess also—I had first seen the pistol the night before on the easy<lb></lb>chair in the parlour; it was the same pistol which I saw up stairs, a revolver—Nagel was then sleeping on the sofa, and there was a quarrel between</p>

               <p>Mrs. Burgess and may—I don't know what it was about; it was in German, but she said that Paul had threatened to shoot her—while the quarrel was going on, the pistol was on the easy-chair in the parlour—Paul put it there; he brought it out of the bedroom he occupied with Burgess, put it on a chair, and covered it with an anti-macassar—he appeared in a temper, and had been walking about with it in his band—Mrs. Burgess made a commu<lb></lb>nication to me, and I took Paul into the bedroom, and took the pistol up stairs and put it in my cupboard—I left him down stairs with Mrs. Burgess—when I came down again he was in the parlour; he still appeared in a great temper; he slapped me on the head twice with a wet handkerchief, and upon that Mrs. Burgess told me something—May remained in the parlour, and nothing else passed that night—Nagel and I went up to bed, leaving May down there with Mrs. Burgess—I had the pistol in my room all night—in the morning I and Nagel went down to breakfast leaving the pistol up stairs—May said he would not eat any breakfast till the pistol was returned to him—I said that I would not return it to May, but I would return it to Nagel, and Nagel went up to my cupboard, unloaded it, took it down stairs, and returned it to Paul, who re-loaded it again sitting on the sofa, and I did not see it again until after the occurrence.</p>

I am single, and live at 19, Limestone Street, Chelsea—in August last I was living at 21, Langton Street—I occupied the drawing-room floor—I remember Dircks, the prisoner, and Nagle coming on the Tuesday—Dircks left on the Thursday, and did not come back—I saw nothing more of him—on Wednesday, 21st August, the prisoner and Nagle were in the house, but I did not see them at all that day—about 8 o'clock that evening I heard two reports and a noise over my head; it was not a fall, it was a stumbling noise, as if it was a person's two feet; it proceeded from Mrs. Gordon's room—I cannot tell what time elapsed between the two reports; it might have been two minutes, it might have been three; I could not say positively—the stumbling noise was after the two reports—I was so alarmed that I immediately ran down stairs and called to Ellen Gordon—the servant met me, and followed me up stairs to Gordon's room;</p>

               <p>the door was locked—I believe the servant broke it open, and I went in—Nagle lay on the sofa, shot through the breast; blood was flowing from his mouth and breast—his breast was naked—I did not notice his shirt—he did not speak—I left the room, and went down stairs—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing else—I only heard May moaning underneath the table, I did not see him—I went down stairs—I believe the medical man was in the house by that time—I did not return to Gordon's room for some time afterwards; about 12 o'clock—Nagle was then dead—I had not heard any quarrel between May and Nagle—I was with Gordon when she found this letter in a shell box.</p>

On 20th of August I was living as servant at 21, Langton Street—on that night I was in Mrs. Burgess's bedroom on the ground floor—I had been there all the evening, and late at night I was in the front parlour waiting on them—there are folding doors between the rooms; they were open—the front room is the sitting room and the back is the bed-room—Burgess was lying on the bed, Gordon and Nagle lay on the sofa, and May went to the bedside to Burgess and spoke to her—that was about 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening—it was rather late in the night when I heard the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—May was walking in and out from one room to the other, and from there to the hall door—Burgess was then sitting on the sofa—I heard some noise between May and Burgess—I did not understand what they were saying—Nagle was lying on the sofa, and never spoke—next day, the 21st, I waited on them at breakfast before they went out—I remember their coming back in the afternoon—they had some champagne and three bottles of lemonade—Burgess went out in a Hansom cab, and did not come back till she was fetched from Cremorne at 10 o'clock at night—about 8 o'clock Curtis came down stairs, and said something to me, and upon that I went up to Burgess's room, where Gordon was—in consequence of what passed we all three went up to Gordon's room at the top of the house—the door was locked—I pushed my elbow against it, and went in, door and all—I broke the hinges off—it was locked on the inside—Gordon first saw the deceased on the sofa, and said "Herman! Herman!" and then she went to May—the room was dark with smoke—May was sitting under<lb></lb>neath the table at the foot of the bed—I heard both of them groaning, but Nagle was the worst; he was almost dead; bleeding from the mouth—Gordon put a pillow under May's head—he was lying on his back, facing the left side, with the pistol close to his heart, close to his side—I am sure I saw the pistol lying there, and I told Gordon not to move it; it was close to his left side, close to where the wound was—I never before saw a pistol—it was in the same position when I saw it as when Gordon saw it—she moved it—I saw her move it—she took it in her hand, and I said "Don't touch it, don't touch it," and I left the room—I can't say where she moved it to—I went for a doctor, and a doctor came.</p>

On the night of 22nd August I was called to 21, Langton Street, about 8.40, and was directed to the top floor—I found in the room Ellen Gordon, the prisoner, and Nagle—no one else—Nagle was lying on the sofa, with his right hand extended towards the bed and his head resting on his right arm—his legs were drawn up slightly on the sofa—his body was altogether on the sofa, no portion of it touching the floor—blood was issuing from his mouth, and he was lying on his right side, facing me as I went into the room—his left arm was down by his side, his head towards the foot of the sofa, and his feet towards the head, towards the fireplace—he had his coat and waistcoat on—no necktie or collar—the coat and waistcoat were lying over the place where he had been wounded, but his shirt was unbuttoned—he was quite dead—I examined him, and found a wound as from a pistol shot in the left breast—that was the only wound I saw about him—the prisoner was lying with his head under a round table at the foot of the bed, his feet under Nagle's feet, under the sofa, nearly as far as the knees—he had got his trousers and shirt on—his shirt was open, unbuttoned from top to bottom, and a hole in the left breast of the shirt, as if from a pistol-shot—he had received a wound on the left breast corresponding with the hole on the shirt, and had the appearance of being in the exact spot as the other man's—there was no other wound found upon him—his coat and waistcoat were on the table, as if they had been taken off and carelessly thrown there at the foot of the bed—when I went in Gordon was attending upon him—his shirt was slightly scorched, and there was a hole through it about where the wound was, but it was not over the wound when I saw it—there was no smoke or mark of fire on Nagel's shirt—I did not see any corresponding hole in the shirt or any mark of fire—it appeared quite clean—the flesh appeared to be black round the orifice—I should think it was black from smoke—the appearance of burning and smoke was also on May's shirt—when I had been there a few minutes a medical man named Irving came in—he did what he could to May, and gave him some brandy and water—I saw the pistol, when I went into the room—this part of the butt of the pistol was close to the foot of the bed<lb></lb>stead, the muzzle pointing towards Nagel's right hand as he lay on the sofa, in that form—it was nearer to May than it was to Nagel—if his hand had been stretched out he could have touched the pistol, and barely touched it—I sent for Dr. Godrich, and he came about 9.20—I pointed out to him the exact spot where I picked up the pistol—I had removed it—it was in my hand then, and I described to him how it was lying—I did not know Irving before—I don't know where he is now—I have made every effort to find him—he was there that night about two hours—he was there when Dr. Godrich came—he described himself as a medical doctor belonging to the Royal College of Surgeons, but I have some reason to doubt that—I had an address that he was living at Somer's Town—I went there, and he was denied—I could not find him—after this White, the police-constable</p>

Before that day we had been to many places of amusement. On Tuesday we had been to the German Waiters' Club to look for a place as waiter, and we were told to come again about 6.30. On Wednesday night we had a bottle of champagne. After that my cousin went up stairs; I followed him five minutes after. We had cried over our unfortunate position for some time. We had tried, by every means in our power, to find a place, but in vain. We had no more money. Herman Nagel did not tell me of his intention</p>

               <p>to take his own life nor to shoot me. We were alone in the room crying, when he (Herman Nagel) fired upon me (May) and then upon himself. He had placed the pistol in such a manner as to cause him to die instantly. After he had shot me I had still enough <hi rend="italic">conscienceness</hi> left to see him place the pistol upon himself. I also heard the report of the pistol shot, but I was at that time lying on the ground.

               <p>coat and waistcoat had not been taken off—his shirt was loosened, and I should think that the shirt had been moved by the left hand whilst the wound had been made by the pistol with his right, because there was nothing intervening between—the chest was blackened precisely the same as May's shirt was, and there was no entrance of the ball through the shirt; the shirt was clean—I agree with Gill—the pistol would have laid in such a position as it would have fallen from Nagel's hand had he killed himself and thrown his right arm out—his right hand was extended, pointing over the passage between the bed and the window—his hand was extended right across the passage—he was lying on his back, and his head a little bent to his right shoulder, and his right hand extended in that way, and that was deluged in blood—he had evidently been dead about an hour, or perhaps not so long as that—the head was lying rather over the right shoulder—the arm was very nearly clear of the head—I could not ascertain the direction the ball had taken in Nagel's case unless I had examined the body—I did examine it afterwards—I then found the ball had taken a direction begin<lb></lb>ning on the left side of the chest high up on the third rib—it had not fractured the rib—it had made a round hole through the third rib, at the edge of the rib—the circle was not quite complete—the ball passed below the root of the lungs—it went through the front of the great aorta, which is a continuation of the heart itself—it went out at the back of the aorta, lower than where it entered, showing that it was still going downwards, and to the left; it then smashed the angle of the eighth rib, within about an inch or two of the spine, and was cut out at the loins, about half an inch from the surface—it went downwards, as though the pistol had been held in this direction—he must have shot himself—no one could have shot him—there is the bullet, showing the immense force with which it impinged upon the rib—it was flattened on one side—these conical bullets don't fly off at an angle like the round ones—you can see it is flattened on one side, where it hit the angle of the eighth rib—it weighs a quarter of an ounce—the bullet would be projected with the conical side forward—the eighth rib is a very thick one—I cannot say how this burr on the bullet would be occa<lb></lb>sioned, further than its meeting with great resistance there—it just passed over the heart, the same as I apprehend that May's passed under the heart; it was a course downwards, inwards, and backwards—I say that he must have shot himself—I formed that opinion from the direction of the bullet—unless May or any person had gone round to his right shoulder and shot down in the same manner as he would have shot himself, it is clear no one in front of him could ever shoot a bullet in that direction—nobody shooting at him point blank opposite could have inflicted that wound—it must have been done obliquely, and the pistol lay just where a man in his agony would have thrown it—I have no doubt that he shot himself—that is my conclusion—in coming to that conclusion I have taken into consideration the place where I found the pistol—I think the tremendous blow must have knocked the life out of him almost in a minute, and in the agony of the moment he would have thrown the pistol where it was—he might have been shot by a person standing above him on the bed, but that is an extreme possibility—he must have been on the sofa, because he could not have moved after the blow—he must have dropped, unless he was lying flat on the sofa—I say it is far more probable, seeing the position he was in, that he shot himself than that another person got into a very peculiar position so as to shoot him—I was not told that the pistol had been moved</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187211180045"></xptr>
               <p>until I heard it in evidence—I was not told so in the room, nor at the first inquest—quite irrespective of the position of the pistol, I should have precisely the same opinion—if it had been thrown half-way across the room it would have made no difference whatever—the bullet might have passed an inch above the aorta—it was not in the arch of the aorta, but in the descending portion—the aorta is the great artery of the body—it is a continuation of the heart itself; it pumps out and empties the body in a minute or two—May was lying quite senseless on the floor when I went in, and I believed, from looking at the wound, the heart must have been pierced; the pericardium—he was, in fact, dying—after getting some brandy down him, however, He revived, and we got him to the sofa—he was wounded about two inches and a half below the left nipple, and if he had been expiring instead of inspiring, I think the heart would have been wounded, it was so nice a point as that—the bullet is still in his body—I have no doubt it had gone in horizontally, but I could not tell—round balls are erratic, but these conical bullets are not, they will go through any<lb></lb>where—if the side of the bullet struck on the edge of the rib, it perhaps might be deflected—he had inflammation of the pericardium afterwards, as well as the diaphragm, and a large quantity of fluid in the chest, so that the heart was pushed down from the left side to the right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been forty-five years in practice, and have had considerable experience in that time—I have been perhaps for twenty years divisional surgeon to the police—in all cases of violence and wounds I am called in to attend police cases, and have had considerable experience in that branch of the profession—I was examined before the Coroner, and gave evidence there—when I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Nagel I did it for the purpose of satisfying myself as to who caused his death; that was one of the great matters—I asked the Coroner to allow me to examine him, as as to give an opinion of the direction of the ball—I could not give it without—it is from that examination that I give the decided opinion I have to-day—my impression at first certainly was that Nagel must have shot May and then himself—it is very likely that I expressed that opinion before the Coroner, it seemed to me the most probable—after a day or two I thought May in great danger, and directed an examination to be made of him by the Magistrate—I thought him in extreme danger—he was taken to the hospital as soon as thought him well enough to be removed, and was attended by the hospital surgeons—it was about a week before I had him been removed—I then gave up my charge, and had nothing more to de with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If I had found the pistol where the woman says it was found, on the left side of May, and close to him, I should still have the same impression that Nagel shot him, because that would have been just the position in which I should fancy in the agony, the spasmodic effort of getting rid of the pistol, it would have been thrown by Nagel, assuming it to have been used by him—I should have expected it to have been on the right side of May, if he had shot himself—I have beard that it was found close under his left side—I don't think that would alter my impression at all as to who shot first—I should still say that Nagel first shot May and then himself—I could not conceive anything more horrible than the wound the man had received and the shock to his system—if he had had a pistol in his hand shooting himself, the spasm of the arm would have thrown the pistol 3 or 4 feet further than I found it—the real position of the pistol would not signify—its position did operate partly on my mind from</p>

               <p>its being on the left side of May—I don't think he would have shot with his left hand—that was my conclusion, and it is unaltered—if May had shot himself, I should have expected the pistol to be on his right side—I did not say anything to May about his state, because he could not speak English—I told Mons. Albert that I thought him in extreme danger.</p>

I am an interpreter and live at 28, Great Marlboreugh Street—on 23rd August I was called to 21, Langton Street by the police to interpret for the prisoner—he was supposed by the doctors to be dying—I told the prisoner so—I said that the doctors had given a strong opinion about his very dangerous state—he made a statement on oath in German, which I translated—it was taken down by Inspector Gill in presence of the Magistrate—I read it over to the prisoner and he signed it—it is the statement that has been read—when I first went into the room the prisoner asked who all those gentlemen were; the doctor was there, the Magistrate, the Chancellor of the German Consulate, the policeman, and the inspector—I told him who they were—he said "Am I going to be punished then?"—that was all he said before his statement was taken—I made the translation that has been read of the letters produced by Inspector Gill, it is correct—there are two handwritings on the original letter—I have translated, by order of the prosecution, all the depositions from English into German for the prisoner—I was present at the police-station on 2nd November, when the prisoner was brought in—I told him he was charged with killing Nagel—he said "I did not do it—I find it very extraordinary that I should be accused of shooting my friend—I did not shoot him"—I was present on the 4th, and read over the warrant to him charging him with killing Nagel, and he said "I did not shoot him."</p>

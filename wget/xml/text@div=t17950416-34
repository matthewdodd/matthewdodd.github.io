               <p>Q. What do you know of the loss of any poultry at your house? - I know the loss of five hens and a cock, on the 21st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know of your own knowledge, whether they were safe the night before you missed them? - Certainly I saw them all the day till the afternoon between four and five o'clock, and they used to roost inside of a moot: I have a moot about my house, and we generally fetch them up inside there every night, and the next morning let them go where they like. I see them there that day: I was at work in the garden all the day. Between four and five they were walking along the road: at this time of year they will stray out a little from home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your whole number, or only a part of them? - Only a part of them; some of them were on the decline of sitting, and they staid at home more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them again from the time that you missed them? - Not till they were dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw them dead? - The same evening my daughter pulled them out of the ditch where these two men had broke their necks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take them out of the ditch? - I did not; but I see her draw them along the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners about there that day? - I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this ditch to where you lived? - Within near three hundred yards of my own house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160068"></xptr>Q. What became of the turkeys afterward? - I took two of them to the justice's where the men were convicted from, and the others we made use of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there the same number missing as found? - The five hens we found that evening, or the 21st, on the 22d, my man found the head of the turkey cock within about one hundred yards of our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to your house do you say the ditch was? - Not above four hundred or five hundred yards; they drove them till they drove them out of sight of the windows of my house, and then they broke their necks; I am sorry to say that my daughter saw them drive them, and she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoners first? - When they were taken, about an hour and half after in the same evening, or it may be not quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw them? - I see them at Mr. Mitchell's, in Tottenham Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in custody when you saw them? - They were; they were taken into custody by the people who pursued them into the road; I don't know that I exchanged three words with them; then we took them to Tottenham to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had these turkies? - We hatched them.</p>
               <p>Q. How old were they? - About nine or ten months old, I believe there might be one older among them; the cock turkey was two years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the head of the cock turkey alone? - I think I could with a great deal of truth and justice, by the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turkies had you altogether? - We had eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had only two remaining? - No.</p>

             in pursuit of these two men, the prisoners at the bar, running after them; I heard his voice before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Lucas before? - O yes, he was crying out two thieves! and then the two men ran up an hedge, the other side of the hedge from me, the same side as Mr. Lucas was.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see through the hedge? - Yes, I could; the end of the hedge reaches into the river, then immediately they got up on the top of the hedge, turned round, and ran all along by the river bank, and Mr. Lucas told me to run and tell the people of the house on Woodgreen Common, to stop them from going over the Common, and I went there, and there was nobody at home, and then immediately I run after them myself, when they were running along side of the river bank along side of the Common, to go over the river bridge, and I ran after them as fast as ever I could; and Mr. Lucas ran after them across that bridge, and I had got to go half a mile round to another bridge, to get on the top of Mr. Mitchell's hill, to go after them, and before I could get at the top of the hill, I lost sight of them, and then I heard Mr. Lucas halloo, stop thief; I see Mr. Lucas, but I did not see the men, I ran to Mr. Lucas directly as I see him, and I did not see the men any more not till they were catched, I cannot say who took them, I see them after they were taken just the other side of Tottenham Wood; they had got one of them in hold then, Mr. Whitmell.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the other prisoner?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160069"></xptr> - I did not see him before he was caught, about ten or eleven minutes after I see Whitmell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had got Whitmell at the time you see him? - Mr. Lucas here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had got Hawe when you see him taken? - He was brought to Lucas where Whitmell was, by Mr. Mitchell's coachman, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear, that the two men that you saw, after they were taken, were the two men whom you had seen so running, and so pursued by Lucas? - Yes, I could. They are the same men, by their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them by sight before? - I have seen Hawe at the Cross Keys, St. John-street, Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was Hawe before you saw him in custody? - No; I did not know him only by his dress. The other I never see before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You see nothing of any turkies? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>-LUCAS sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to work on Saturday afternoon, in the garden of Mr. Wilmot's; he sent me in pursuit of these men; he said there were some men driving the turkies about the road; it might be about four or five o'clock, as nigh as I can guess. I ran out of the garden into the road, and got over into a field; I ran down by the side of the hedge for a considerable distance, and then got over the hedge into the lane again. As soon as I got to the lane, I was within a dozen yards, as nigh as I can guess, of three men close by the ditch side; as soon as they see me, one man ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they were doing any thing by the ditch side? - Yes; one man had got a turkey in his hand by the neck, and was swinging it round; and the other had got a cloth, and was going to spread it on the ground. I have got a cloth in my pocket, which I suppose is the same, that was picked up in the New River, by the side where they ran. This man that had got the turkey in his hand, flung it down into the ditch, and ran away as soon as he stung it down; I never see him after he went away. The man that had got the cloth turned round and said, he would have a turkey for all me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him when he said that to you? - Within half a dozen yards, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to either of them before they said this? - I asked them what they were doing there? then I turned round towards home and hallooed for assistance, and then they ran away, and I pursued them over the fields till they came to the river bank, and ran down the river bank afterward all the way till they came to Tottenham Wood. As soon as they came to Tottenham Wood, they ran into the wood, then I ran down to Mr. Mitchell's farm-yard, and called out for some assistance; and Mr. Mitchell's men went up some distance from the wood. There was a field between the wood and the farm yard; we went up this field into the wood, and I got over the hedge into the wood, and the first man that I see was Whitmell, laying down flat on his back. I went up to him, and told him to get up, he must go along with me. He got up, and one of Mr. Mitchell's men got hold of one hand, and I of the other, and we took him to the farm-yard. Hawe was catched by one of Mr. Mitchell's coachmen, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see Hawe in the wood? - No, not after he went in first, I see him go in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160070"></xptr>Q. How soon was it that he was brought to where you was? - It might be about five or six minutes; I cannot justly say how long it was; it was within a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Mitchell's coachman here? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear positively the two prisoners at the bar are two of those men that you see standing by this ditch that you described, and whom you afterwards pursued? - I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of the prisoners the man that was swinging the turkey about? - The man in the blue jacket, Whitmell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that had the cloth? - Hawe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the man that said he would have a turkey for all of you? - He was, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - I never see him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing them so as to say, through all the pursuit, they were the same men? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, after they were secured, were you present that night? - No, but the next day I went up to Tottenham to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. But were the turkies found before you went to the justice's? - Yes they were. I went to the very place the next day, where I see the men throw the turkies into the ditch, about three hundred yards from Mr. Wilmot's, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there then? - There were a great many turkey feathers in the ditch, and a little distance from that I found the head of a turkey cock, nigher to Mr. Wilmot's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in a ditch? - It was, but not where I see the men with the turkies.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew Mr. Wilmot the place where the men were employed? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for you to swear to the head of that turkey cock? - I can swear it was the head of a turkey cock, and the turkey cock was missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hens that were found dead afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them? - perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - Five.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they old ones or young ones? - I believe they were young ones. I am not much acquainted with ages, but I was well acquainted with them, by seeing them in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known them? - Ever since they were hatched.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in what short space of time after Mr. Wilmot sent you out after the turkies was it you saw the two prisoners, and the third man? - In about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of that young lad, Marshall? - Yes, I see him in a field, and told him to go to a house and call for assistance, but I never looked behind me, to see whether he was following me or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are confident to the persons of these two prisoners? - I am very confident of these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. You were saying that you saw the dead turkies drawn out from some place by your daughters? - I did; that was the place where the five turkies were killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you knew the prisoners were taken, or before? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughters pull them out of the ditch? - No; they had just dragged them out of the place, and brought them into a place about the length of this Court, into the middle of the road, and said, there they were, all killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the place which the last witness has described, where a quantity of the feathers were? - I did; I went immediately as I saw the turkies to the place. I see a few scattered feathers, that in their hurry had come from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160071"></xptr>the turkies, and I could see the print where they had knocked down the reeds and bushes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might this he from your house? - About four or five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any way that the turkies could have got into that road? - They could not have got through the hedge; they were in a ditch by the side of the common, what they call the outside sence of a field.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nobody driving them? - I did not; I only took notice of the two waggons that were coming by at the same time that these men were coming by, these men being a kind of porters to the waggons, I immediately thought that they might be men belonging to the waggon.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the two men before? - I see several people with the waggons, but I did not take notice of them, nor my man; we were at work in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to send your man after these men? - Because my daughter were looking out of the window, and saw them driving the turkies.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whitmell. I went with the waggoner to drive the waggon on forward for him, and got some way on the road, and I got rather in liquor; I don't know how far I went, and laid myself in this wood to sleep, and this man came to me into the wood, and said I had been killing turkies, and I never saw a turkey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hawe. I went out along with the waggon, to drive it while the man stopped to have a little refreshment, and then I turned off across the way to Highgate, and a gentleman's servant hallooed out to me, and said he wanted me; and I said, if he wanted me I would go with him, for I had done nothing that I was afraid of; and he said I had been killing the turkies. I never see these men before they were hallooing in the wood. I was walking along, making the best of my way to Highgate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have one observation to make, this little road is three miles from my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 53, King Street, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—I went to see a brother workman, on Saturday night, who had the small-pox, and when I left him I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went up Friar Street about 12.30 on Sunday morning, and was surrounded by a lot of costermongers, who put me in a pen, as they do sheep, and <hi rend="italic">cross-buttocked</hi> me across a barrow—Carr was one of them—he got his hand on my head, and pressed it against a barrow—Salter's hand was across my chest, and Bennett said "Don't leave the b—, kick him in the head "—I believe. Bennett was the man who kicked me on my head—I had not known them before, but am quite sure they are three of the men who attacked me—they took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my inside waistcoat pocket—I cannot say which</p>

               <p>took it—they left the pocket empty—I became insensible, and they all left me—I believe a policeman found me—I gave information to him, and saw Salter on the Monday morning, on his own door-step—I at once iden<lb></lb>tified him, and gave him in custody—next day (Tuesday) the sergeant took me to the lock-up, where there were twelve men, and I picked out Bennett from among them—I am quite sure he was one of them—I afterwards picked out Carr at the police-court, where he stood between twelve and thirteen others—I am certain he is one of the men who robbed me, by the scar on his left cheek—I noticed that when I was robbed, and had men<lb></lb>tioned it to the police.</p>

I had nothing to drink at home—I was perfectly sober, and not reeling about in the least—I had only had a little drop of beer—I do not take spirits—I might have had one or two pots, not more, because I know my money would not run to it—I was thrown on my back on a barrow of whelks—Salter is the man belonging to the barrow—I have had a pint of beer to-day.</p>

I did not see any more of him that day nor on the Sunday; and when I found he did not come home, I took the key home with me in my pocket; I did not see him till Monday; when I came on Monday morning at nine o'clock, I found two strange horses in the stable, both belonged to Mr. Plum.

               <p>Q. How. - A. I do not know any farther than seeing them together. He told me that he told Mr. Beesy, the cooper, that belonged to the premises, he had lost the key, and he let him in the back way; when I come I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. They were Sargeant's horses then. - A. Yes; by what I could understand.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Fox let him the stables. - A. I do not know that Fox let him the stable, Fox had the stables in his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must let him put them there. - A. Yes; the horses were very much fatigued and splashed all over; I took one out of door to clean it, and Sargeant told me I ought not to do that, he would catch cold if I cleaned them out of door; so I took him in; I asked Sargeant whose horses they were, he said they were his own. Then Fox came in the morning, I was saying what two fine horses they were; he replied, pho! d - n<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180056"></xptr> you, I ought to know what horses they are, I sent Thomas down to Chatham after them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horses afterwards. - A. On Wednesday night Sargeant said get on the mare and ride behind me, and he got upon the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Longman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it to Longman, did not you. - A. Yes, we saw Longman's man. Sargeant told him they were his horses, that was at first.</p>

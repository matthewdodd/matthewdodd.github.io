                  </hi>. I live at North-place, Chelsea—the prisoner was in my employment about three years as a sawyer—this piece of deal was shown</p>

               <p>me by my brother, the prisoner, Rose, and my nephew; they all brought it together—I know it to be mine—I was looking over the first-quality tier of wood a fortnight previous, and saw this particular piece among it—I took such notice of it as to be able to know it again—I was quite certain, as soon as I saw it, that it was my property.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner has borne the highest character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the Magistrate admitted him to bail—as soon as he was spoken to about the board, he said that on the Saturday Mr. Moth had given him a board to saw to put a cut in—he did not tell me he had brought that board and left it in my place on the Saturday evening, and after he had received his money, it being dark, he took this board, thinking it was his—if he had told me that, I should not have taken any steps—he did not say a word till after he was out on bail—I saw Mr. Moth on Monday—he saw the board at the station—he said he had given him a board, but he did not believe that to be the board—he had had it in the place about a twelvemonth, and it was much more soiled—he did not say, in my presence, that it was extremely like it; but looking more closely at it, he did not think it was it—the prisoner was paid, I should think, on Saturday about six o'clock—I do not think it was as late as seven—I did not search for Mr. Moth's board on my premises—I had no idea there was any board there—I am aware that the prisoner did some work previously for Mr. Moth, to cut boards in two—he did not use my tools—he never cut anything on my pre<lb></lb>mises—I believe he cut them at Mr. Todd's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What passed between you and the prisoner on the Monday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stated to the prisoner that that was my property—he said he had received a board from a Mr. Moth, a greengrocer in the New-road, to put a cut in—my brother, the two other parties, and the prisoner went down to Mr. Moth—all four returned with the board in their possession—one of them, I do not recollect which, said that when Mr. Moth saw the board, he said he had given him a board on the Saturday evening something like the one in their possession—he could not swear to it, but believed it was not the one—the prisoner still persisted in his innocence, saying that he hoped he should not move from the place if that was not the board he had received from Mr. Moth—I told him I had no other step—to take to prove who were the guilty parties without taking him and the greengrocer before a Magistrate—I was confident that one of them had robbed me of that board—during the three years the prisoner was with me he conducted himself in a very praiseworthy manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Enterprize, in June-street, Chelsea. On Saturday evening, 4th Nov., the prisoner came to my master's about seven in the evening—he told me he had taken a board into the back-garden, and asked me to take care of it till Monday—he said it was a job he had got, and it came to fourpence—his partner Rose came in about five minutes to twelve that night, gave me some directions, and on Monday morning I delivered it up to the prisoner and his partner—Mr. Arthur's brother and nephew were with them—Rose is a sawyer in Mr. Arthur's employ.</p>
               <p>

               <p>in a new road cut through a brick-field at the top of North-street, Chelsea—he had a board with him—his partner Rose was with me—I said, "Have you got a job of carpentering?"—he replied he had not, he had got a board to cut which came to fourpence—we all three went to the public-house together, with the board, I do not exactly know who carried it, and it was then put in a back place somewhere—we had a pot of beer, and I went back to Mr. Arthur's to settle for my week's work—I left them at a shop in North-street, and did not see them again that night—I had suspicions that the board was my uncle's, but did not make any remark about it—I did not know it—there is a mark on it, but I did not see it at the time—I gave a slight information to my uncle's foreman, his brother, George Arthur, on the Saturday evening, but told him to inquire of my uncle whether he had sold it or not—I and he went and looked at it on the Monday, and he claimed it as his brother's.</p>

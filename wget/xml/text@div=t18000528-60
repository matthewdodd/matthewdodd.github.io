             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker in the Strand: I took in this pair of boots from one of the prisoner; to the best of my belief it was the prisoner Mason, on the 28th of March. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Knowles.) Had you missed such property as that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Acklem.) Do you recollect what time of the day it was? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Mason is the man? - A. Yes, I had seen him before; I believed him to be a shoemaker from his appearance; I lent him ten shillings upon them.</p>
               <p>Knowles. These boots have my own hand-writing; I know them by the cut, I cut them out myself; they have the name of the gentleman that they were made for in them, and my stamp upon the soles; I made for Colonel Hamilton, of the Royal Waggon Train; they were too small for him, and they were returned.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not sold them afterwards? - A. No, we never sell any thing in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop a part of the dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that pair of boots? - A. Eleven or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ailey. Q. The prisoners had worked for you some time? - A. The tall one, Brodrick, I have known ever since he was in the petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent these boots to his lodgings to be altered? - A. Not these; there are others in Court that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered your work out in the shop? - A. Myself generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mason employed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not given directions to Brodrick, your foreman, to send these boots to Mason's house? - A. No such thing; he could not make such a boot if you would give him a million of money.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you not send them to him to alter the seam? - A. No.</p>

Owen, Esq." written in them; I then sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Knowlys.) When did you miss these boots? - A. I did not miss any of them at all.</p>
               <p>Mason's defence. Brodrick gave them to me to pledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Brodrick was not put upon his defence.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Gress-street, I am a single woman, I lost a white silk gown and coat, two black silk cloaks, a shift, two pair of cotton stockings, a lawn apron; I lost these things on the 21st of August, I saw them the night before, I left them on the sopha in the dining room; I missed them in the morning; the prisoner went off in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040019"></xptr> morning, and I did not see her any more till she was taken; she was my servant; when she was taken she owned where the things were, that was last Friday I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you was not by when she confessed? - Yes I was; I told her if she would own to me where they were, I would not hurt her if it was in my power.</p>
               <p>And so then she told you where they were? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How came she in your apartment? - A servant that lived with a person in the house brought her up to me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Then in consequence of that you went and found them? - Yes, she sent for her friends to take them before we went to the Justice's; the pawnbroker is in Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You see the prosecutrix knew nothing at all where to find the goods, but from the confession of the prisoner, which she was induced to make upon the prosecutrix's telling her, that if she would own where they were she would not hurt her: a confession that is obtained by that expectation of pardon, is never evidence against the prisoner.</p>

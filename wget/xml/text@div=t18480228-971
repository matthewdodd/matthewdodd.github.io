I was in Nine Elms-lane, at a quarter past six o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners together—Cheshire was carrying this basket—I stopped him, and asked what he had in it—he said, "Old lead," that it came from the Iron Steam-boat Factor, and they had been at work there—I asked them how they came by</p>

The prisoners were in the company's employ—they were repairing a barge, which had old lead in it—I saw it safe a day or two before—I received information that the prisoners had been taken about eight o'clock on the night of 17th Feb.—I examined the barge next morning, and missed the lead—it was similar to this—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe this to be it.</p>

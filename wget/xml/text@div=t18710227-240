                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) I have been for four or five months watching Messrs. Defries' premises, in Houndsditch—I know the prisoners—the two Hodges are in partnership in Norfolk Gardens, Shore<lb></lb>ditch—I have also had those premises under observation—on 28th October I watched Messrs. Defries' premises from 7.45 in the morning, with George Blanchard, up to a little before 9 o'clock—Harvey came there at 8.5 and about 8.58, or 8.59—a truck came out of the import warehouse on the right hand side of Gravel Lane, with two crates of goods and an empty hamper on top of them, in charge of a man in Hodges' employ—I made a memorandum at the time of the marks on the crates; one was "Diamond G 1025"—the other was defaced as if it had been rubbed out—I could not distinguish any letter or number—I followed the truck to Hodges' place, and it was taken into their yard—Blanchard accompanied me as far as we dare go—I communicated with Sutton, a metropolitan policeman, who was on duty, and then returned with Blanchard to Gravel Lane—about 11 o'clock on the same morning I saw the same man with a barrow come to Messrs. Defries' warehouse—he took another crate out marked "Diamond G 1207," and I followed him to Hodges' place, the same as before—just before the barrow came out I saw Harvey standing on the pavement opposite the export warehouse in Gravel Lane—the import warehouse is on one side, and the export on the other—he was near the door at which the truck came out, at the time it came out, but on the opposite side of the way—at about 1.20 we saw Harvey come from "Polly's" public-house, next door to Messrs. Defries—we followed him to Hodges'—he returned from there at 1.50, and got to the prosecutor's about 2 o'clock—at 9 o'clock the same night I saw Mrs. Hodges at the warehouse, and saw Harvey come out of the prosecutor's</p>

               <p>warehouse—I followed him to the "George," in Fenchurch Street, where he was met at the bar by the female prisoner—they remained there about ten minutes, and then came out and walked arm in arm up Leadenhall Street, talking—they turned down Bishopsgate Street, and went into the "Black Bull"—I went in at the other side of the bar, to watch them, and saw Mrs. Hodges put something into Harvey's hand—I could not see what it was—I followed her to Shoreditch; she took a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—next day, the 29th, Saturday, I watched Messrs. Defries' promises—Harvey arrived at about 8.5, and about 10.50 I saw a crate come out on a barrow, drawn by the same man—the crate was marked "Diamond G," but the number seemed to be obliterated; all I could see was "539," which did not appear to be the whole number, but we could not get near enough to see what the number was, which was defaced—I followed it to Hodges' place, and it was taken into the yard, where Mrs. Hodges. and her son were—they both helped to it unload—their yard is a very awkward place to see well; but I saw John Hodges take some glass moons out of the crate; he had four in each hand; he followed me up behind, and I went round into Shoreditch—he took them into the "Fountain" public-house—on 31st October I saw Harvey at Hodges' place, about 1.15 p.m.—he was there about twenty minutes, and went into the "Fountain" with John Hodges—on Friday, 4th November, I saw the three prisoners in the "Nag's Head," Houndsditch—John Hodges fetched Harvey from the warehouse, and Mrs. Hodges was there—Harvey went in, and I followed into the private bar, on the other side—Mrs. Hodges had some gin, changed a sovereign, and gave Harvey a half-sovereign, a florin, and a sixpence—Harvey then spoke to her; but I could not catch the words; she then changed another soyereign, and gave some more silver to Harvey, I cannot say how much—Blanchard was in the bar—on Friday evenings Mrs. Hodges used to come at 6.30 or 7 o'clock, and wait till Harvey joined her, and John Hodges used sometimes to be in their company—that went on on Friday evenings, up to 3rd February—on Friday evening, 3rd February, I took Harvey outside the "City Arms," Heneage Lane, and saw the other two prisoners taken at the same time; they were all together—I said to Harvey "I hold a warrant for your apprehension, for conspiring, with other parties, to defraud Messrs. Coleman Defries, and others; the warrant I will read to you at the station"—going along he said "I do not know anything about it; this is done out of spite; <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Lane has <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on us"—I searched him at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., among which were three shillings, which I had marked that afternoon, and given to Mr. Norton, at Mr. Defries' house, to be paid to Mrs. Hodges—I afterwards went to 11, Manor Road, South Bermondsey, where Harvey lived, and saw his wife—I searched the premises, and found the articles mentioned in the list "No. 1"—I also went to 4, Boundary Court, Shoreditch, where the Hodges lived, and found the property specified in list No. 2," in John. Hodges' room, and in Mrs. Hodges' room what is in list "No. 3."</p>

I had the prosecutor's premises con<lb></lb>tinually under my notice for four or five months, always all day, and some<lb></lb>times all night—the premises are extensive—I never went inside Hodges' gates—I saw the same man take goods to Hodges &amp; Sons on many occasions during the four months; sometimes four or five times a day, and some<lb></lb>times he did not come at all—the crates are not here—they were about 5 ft. long, 3 ft. deep, and 2 1/2 ft. wide—these moons were taken out of them, and I informed Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs. Defries' service—I keep the keys of a portion of the premises where crates are kept—if Harvey or Abrahams came to me for the keys, I should give them; but to nobody else—those were my instructions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. Mr. Abrahams kept the keys of the upper warehouse, and I had the keys of both warehouses on Saturday; but some<lb></lb>times I was over on the other side—I recollect Saturday, 29th October—no communication was made to me by the police at that time—I got to know that the police were employed two or three months before the prisoners were given in custody—I remember 29th October very well—I should have the keys then; but I should not have them on one Saturday more than another—I cannot say whether I handed the keys to Harvey that day—the yard was washed down between 10 and 12 o'clock—that would be, I believe, the only time the gate was opened on Saturday—I live at the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) I saw all the prisoners come out of the house together—I told Mrs. Hodges I had seen a warrant for their apprehension, for being concerned, with a person named Harvey, in stealing goods from Messrs. Defries—she said "It is <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi> Lane is trying to put us away; but it is all spite"—John Hodges said "Mother, don't say anything more"—I cautioned Mrs. Hodges in the usual way, and asked her if she had given Harvey any money in the public-house—she said that she had not—I took them to the station, and next morning Mrs. Hodges said "What money I gave to Harvey I owed him."</p>

               <p>Q. Had she them in her hands. - A. She had nothing in her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the room were they removed. - A. From off a chair that stood at the window at the farthest part of the room from the entrance, they were removed close to the door; I laid hold of the prisoner and asked her what business she had there, she told me that she only wanted a lodging; I then told her I would give her one, I called for assistance, and then went down to the watch-house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had seen these breeches, waistcoat, and your wife's gown, how long was it before you found them at the door. - A. I pulled them off on the Sunday before the Monday that I found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed on Sunday night. - A. No, about the middle of the day when I cleaned myself, I put my clothes by the seat of the window on the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see them in that place before they were moved. - A. I cannot say whether I noticed them after they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body might have moved them of your family. - A. There was nobody in that room but my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Sunday to the time you discovered these things laying by the door, you had taken no notice whether the breeches had been removed or not. - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the waistcoat in the same place. - A. The waistcoat had lain there some time.</p>

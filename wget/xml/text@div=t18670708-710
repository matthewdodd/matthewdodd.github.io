                  </hi> I live at Poplar Road, Roehampton—on 7th June, about a quarter to four, I was asleep on the ground floor—when I went to bed the outside shutters were closed, and the window too, but not fastened, and the shutters were not bolted, neither was the window screwed—I heard something, looked towards the window, and saw daylight, and the prisoner looking in—he had the window up seven or eight inches to a little shelf which goes across the window—he laid his hand on the shelf, and his fingers were partly in the room—he shook the shelf, as if trying to move it—there was a pair of shoes on the window on each side of the shelf—I said, "Who told you to come in that way? "—he said that he wanted to know his way to Wandsworth—I said, "I will d—d soon show you the way, "and jumped out of bed, put on some clothing, and went to the door to see which way he went, as there are two roads—I met Sergeant Lloyd, and described the prisoner—Sergeant Lloyd knocked me up two hours afterwards, and I went with him and identified the prisoner—I can swear to him—not two minutes elapsed between his closing the shutter and my telling Lloyd, for the street door is at the foot of my bed.</p>

On the morning of 7th June I re<lb></lb>ceived a description from the prosecutor, and a few minutes afterwards found the prisoner about 500 yards off, on Wimbledon Common, at about four o'clock—he came across the heath and sat under a tree—I said "Good morning; you are out early"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose you have been travelling all night?

I sat down under a tree three-quarters of an hour before the policeman came up, and if I had opened the man's shutters I should not have sat there. I had no tools to break into any house. It would be impossible for me to walk that distance without the policeman seeing me go by the house. There was no mention of the shelf or the boots before the Magistrate.</p>

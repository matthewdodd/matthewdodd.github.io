               <p>Prisoner. I wish Mr. Gray would give me the character I deserve? - I have known her about a twelvemonth; and I have heard a number of people speak well of her; and I never knew any thing amiss of her before this; she is belonging to a man that did work for Mr. Bampstead sometime; she worked for him; she lives with a man, either as his wife, or lived with him as such; she then worked for Mr. Bampstead at closing the upper leathers, about six months before this time; she was not employed to take care of the things at this time, as I know of; I detected her before I stopped her with these shoes; she had another bundle, before, I spoke to her, she dropped it; when I saw her at the watch-house, I knew her again.</p>

               <p>I went to help Mr. Bampstead in his distress, as me and my husband worked for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

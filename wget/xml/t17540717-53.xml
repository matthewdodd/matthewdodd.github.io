               <p>Q. Do you lie at the inn, or at your own house?</p>
               <p>Davnell. I lie very often at the inn, but my wife lies at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here?</p>
               <p>Davnell. She is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe when you went home?</p>
               <p>Davnell. When I came there I found the back window was all of it taken out, and the cross bar of the window was taken away. I went up stairs and missed my watch and 2 shirts; we have but one room above. Then I went in search of the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Davnell. A neighbour of mine told me he had seen no body in the yard but the prisoner, and he had lodged in my house some time; in my enquiring I met with 2 gentlemen, who told me a man was taken with some things upon him, at a publick-house called the Nine-Pin and Bowl near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170037"></xptr> Edgworth. I went to the house; the landlord of the house had got the watch and 1 shirt, and the other shirt the prisoner had got on: I took the prisoner before the justice, there he confessed he took the things.</p>

               <p>Grant. I had heard the prosecutor's house had been broke open, and I saw the prisoner after that at the Nine-Pin and Bowl with the watch and two shirts: I stopped him. (The shirts and watch produced in court, and depos'd to by the prosecutor)</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. in what parish is your house?</p>

               <p>I went to the Nine-Pin and Bowl house, and was drinking there all day long: they were talking about watches, I said I had got one at home; I went home and fetched this, and being drunk I shewed it them. When they had me before the justice I did not know where I was no more than a post.</p>

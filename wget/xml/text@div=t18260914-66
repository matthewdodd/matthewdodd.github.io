On the 23d of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I went to bed; my female servant is usually the last person up; the house is generally fastened between ten and half-past ten - it was fastened as usual before I went to bed; about 3 o'clock my wife awoke me, saying she was much alarmed - there was a noise of somebody knocking at the top of the house- it was quite dark - I listened some time, and thought it was next door. I heard two or three voices outside the house; I listened some time, at last the noise approached my bed-room; we then got up - the rushlight went out as Mrs. Hill took it up - we struck a light and I looked up the chimney - the soot was falling down, and I could see nothing; I then went up to my children's room, but could find nobody; next day I went into Smithfield and spoke to my neighbour about his having the chimney-sweepers so early, and found he had none; it was remarked that my chimney-pot was broken; I sent a man up, and the prisoner was discovered in the chimney - he had stuck fast there - we were obliged to get him out with ropes; he must have been there before day-light, for all at once the noise of talking became confused and ceased, and, when I looked up the chimney, both soot and mortar fell down; we got him out of the chimney, and asked how he came there; he said he had lost some pigeons, and considering they had flown down there he came down to find them; I gave him in charge - he appeared a chimney-sweeper by his dress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear whether I broke the chimney-pot, or was it broken before? A. I am in the habit of seeing it very often, being out in the market, and know it was sound a day or two before.</p>

I was informed a man was concealed in this chimney, and found the prisoner there, with his arm up holding by a brick; the chimney is breast high above the roof; the part of the pot which was broken off, had been carried and placed across the roof - about half of it was broken, and it appeared quite fresh.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took him in charge with Matthews; nobody could have fallen down the chimney by accident; the tiles were taken off the roof, and put over the other pots, to prevent a noise going into the other rooms; we were obliged to cut him out of the chimney; I found in his trousers a chisel, which was all over mortar; he said he used it to scrape chimnies.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had two pigeons, they were disturbed that morning by some cats, I suppose - they flew towards Smithfield - I followed them, and thought I saw them pitch on some chimney, and seeing a ladder against some houses, I went up, till I got to Mr. Hill's house, and seeing the chimney-pot broken, I supposed they were gone down there - I went down and stuck fast.</p>

            . I live at Westminster. On the 7th of August I went out - I had been drinking. I met the prisoner, Arthur, and went home with her to <placeName id="t18170917-229-crimeloc1164">No. 12, Vine-street, Chandos-street</placeName>

I sent for half a pint of rum and a pot of porter, which I paid for with silver. I went out with Arthur to a public-house in Chandos-street, and asked the landlord to change a 5l. note; a man just by said it was a 10l. note - I found out my mistake; I returned to the house without getting it changed. I went to bed, and awoke between twelve and one o'clock at night-Arthur was there. I heard some person say, "Go along!" I do not know who it was. I got up, and found my pantaloons had been taken away. I had locked the door before I went to bed, and put the key into my waistcoat pocket, which I put under my head. I found my pantaloons in the room-my 10l. note was gone - I alarmed the watchman. When I opened the door, I found the prisoner, Hopkins, on the landing-place.</p>

               <p>Q. How many other women lodge in the house - A. Only one beside the prisoner. I had locked up the house, and was going to bed-my house is shut at eleven o'clock. The prosecutor came to the house between eleven and twelve o'clock; he offered me a 5l. note - I could not get it changed. He went out, and returned. I heard the alarm between twelve and one o'clock, and came to the top of the stairs; he said he was robbed. The prisoner, Hopkins, came from the next room - He lived with Arthur. Hopkins came and broke the door open. Arthur was taken to the watch-house, and at the second examination the charge was made against Hopkins also. Arthur gave Hopkins a paper. Hopkins could not have been in the room at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say at the time, that you saw Arthur give Hopkins the paper - A. No; the prosecutor said he had lost a 5l. note.</p>

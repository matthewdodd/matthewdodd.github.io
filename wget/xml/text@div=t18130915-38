               <p>Q. The number of the three large notes, the two twenty-pound and the twenty-five-pound note, did you take the number of the notes before you were robbed - A. After I was robbed I went to the bankers I took them of.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do; is there any mark upon them independant of the numbers you should know them - A. Yes; the mark over May, there is a kind of an impression on the paper that I had observed before I had lost them. It was over the letter M in May. The prisoners are the persons that shewed me the lodgings.</p>

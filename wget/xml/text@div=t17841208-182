               <p>How long have you known him? - About seven years, he has a very good character, I have trusted him with many hundred pounds worth of goods, and he always brought me a just account; I gave him some orders and he went to London, and he returned home in the afternoon about four.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a grocer in Newgate-street, I have known the prisoner three or four years, I looked upon him as a very honest man, he has had great opportunities in my shop and warehouse, I have often trusted him, and should not hesitate to send out goods by him at any time; I look upon him as a very respectable character.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you trust him alone in your shop and warehouse? - Yes, always, I never took the least account, he might go where he pleased; he keeps a little cart, and has carried goods from my house to Mr. Matthews for several years, and for people in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Court to Moss. What time was it in the morning you missed your pigs? - About nine or ten.</p>
               <p>You had not been at your sty before? - No, nor none of my people that are here, I did not track them myself, but as to the place they were tracked to, there never was such a place seen in the world.</p>
               <p>Court to Partridge. How did you track these pigs? - By the foot in the lanes, and roads by the back lanes, that goes from Hornsey-house.</p>
               <p>Were they ever out of the lanes? - No, not till they came to Mr. Jones's house, they turned out within three fields of Mr. Jones's house.</p>
               <p>What three fields were these? - Grass fields.</p>

               <p>But there is a road that goes all the way up to Jones's house? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know Thompson's fields? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there a gate out of that field, into Jones's yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they come through that gate into Jones's yard? - Yes, through the fields, and in at that gate that goes into Jones's yard.</p>
               <p>What sort of partition or gates are there between the first field, and the three fields? - I believe in every one there was a gate.</p>
               <p>Were the gates shut or open? - They were all shut, I cannot say the first gate was fastened, but we were obliged to get over that.</p>
               <p>Did you trace them through these fields, are you sure that the pigs went through that gate that was fastened? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they went through the other gate that was shut? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were there no gaps out of the lane into the field? - None, that I could see, there was a large ditch between the road and the field.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told us that you traced the man's foot with the pigs, as far as you traced the pigs? - Yes, from the very sty where we traced the pigs, we could see where the man walked up to open the gate, to let the pigs in.</p>
               <p>Was it wet weather at the time? - Yes, our watchman at past four o'clock, cried a rainy morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080178"></xptr>Court. You mean that gate into the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you are very positive they went through all the gates? - Yes, the man must have got over, and opened the gate to let the pigs in.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough, when any body enquired of the woman, whether Mr. Jones lived there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go up to the woman

            ? - I went into the passage adjoining, and stood as nigh as I am to this table, she said, yes.</p>
               <p>Did they ask about any pigs? - Yes, the officer asked her about some pigs, after a little discourse, she said, she had none at all, only three sows and a boar, and she said, they were upon the common.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, she knew none else.</p>
               <p>Court. She said they were on the common? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were there at the time Johnson found these pigs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any body go to shew Johnson where these pigs were? - No, I am sure of that, because we were all in the house talking to the woman, when Johnson went out and found them unknown to any body.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the house? - I cannot positively say; there were some children, and the woman, and Mr. Isaacs and myself.</p>
               <p>Was there any body there besides? - Not as I saw, I did not hear the little boy say, there is my daddy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you see a lad there about eighteen or nineteen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him go out in the yard? - Yes, after we had found the pigs, the boy of nineteen was in the house, and he was going to shew Mr. Isaacs where the pigs commonly lodged; and as we were coming out of the house together, they saw Mr. Jones coming up, he was just come out of the door, Mr. Isaacs, and I, and the boy, with the woman with a child in her arms, in order to shew where the hogs generally were.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnstone. Recollect yourself, and take care you do not mistake, you told us you traced the hogs, and you yourself got into the sty? - Yes, and I saw a man's foot in the sty.</p>
               <p>Then you found the track of the pigs, with the other man Partridge? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see the track of the man all the time that you tracked the pigs? - In general, I did not look every step.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the track of the pigs and take notice of them, without seeing the track of the man? - No.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far did these pigs go in lanes? - The space of three miles, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Where did they go then? - They turned into a grass-field, through a gate that led out of the lane.</p>
               <p>Was there any road there? - None at all, it was as much as we could do to track them there; we could not do it but here and there a place, and there we tracked them exactly the man's feet and hogs, and the gate shut again, and we made away from gateway to gateway, thinking they must drive them through the gates, and we found them at every gateway.</p>
               <p>How many gates were there? - From the first to the last, I believe there were four.</p>
               <p>How were they first got out of the lane? - I cannot possibly say, we looked and got over the gate, they had gone through.</p>
               <p>How was that gate fastened? - I cannot say as we knew they were gone through there, we made directly after them.</p>
               <p>How was it fastened, was it locked? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were all the gates shut? - All put to, some of them had only a bit of wood, I believe no fastening.</p>
               <p>Did the gates open towards the field, or towards the yard? - I cannot say, there are three fields and four gates, one going out of the road, and one going into the yard.</p>
               <p>Do these gates lay pretty near in a line<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080179"></xptr> towards the yard? - All leaning in a line towards the yard.</p>
               <p>Could the hogs have got under the gateway, from the lane into the first field? - No, I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>Court to Partridge. What do you say to that? - I do not think they could, one was too big.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawson. Could the sow get under the gate? - I think it was impossible.</p>
               <p>You heard nothing that passed between the woman and the officer? - Only this, we made enquiry if that was Mr. Jones's, she said, yes, he is gone to town, then I directly turned out of the house, and went to make search after the pigs, and found them; I heard no other conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Johnson. The only tracks that you found was it at different gates? - No, there was only one track over the gates.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawson. This first field opens first into the lane? - The two first fields adjoin to Mr. Thompson's, besides another gentleman's; sometimes the gates are all thrown open to go all over the farm, because Mr. Thompson is taking in droves both bullocks and sheep; Jones rents this place to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Then Jones has the liberty of driving any thing not to do damage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The grass is over the shoes in different places? - It has been a growing season.</p>

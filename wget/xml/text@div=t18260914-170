            . I am a watch-house keeper. I was in Bunhill-row, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of July, and saw the prisoner with this cask on his shoulder - I followed him opposite to the watch-house - I then asked what he had got - he said "A cash of butter;" I said "Have you a bill of parcels with you;" he said No; but he was going to the top of Bunhill-row; I said"You must go over to the watch-house;" he crossed over, and threw it down and ran away - he was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was carrying it for a person, who was going on before him? A. He said he had to carry it to the top of Bunhill-row for two men, who had given him 3s.; he did not tell me they were gone on before; a gentleman afterwards came and said he saw a man carrying a cask of butter in an awkward way.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Grange, a gardener of Kingsland-road, and live within fifty yards of this house. On the 1st of August, about twenty-five minutes before five o'clock, I saw the prisoners for about twenty minutes walking together, and looking over into the gardens of these houses. Gladden went over into the garden of the empty house, and was there about twenty minutes, then returned and gave this pipe over the wall to Greystock, also a brass cock and some pears which he gave Parker; he then came over and they began to break up the pipe; Greystock put the cock and part of it under his coat; Gladden took the other two pieces and put under his jacket. I came down stairs and followed them towards town to the end of Margaret-street, and met a man, told him what I had seen; they then went down by the side of the canal towards Hackney again; I followed, and took Greystock, the others turned back, and the man secured them. We delivered them to a constable, and found the lead on them, it appeared quite fresh broken.</p>

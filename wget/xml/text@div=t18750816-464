                  </hi>. I live at 18, Iron Mill Place, Wandsworth, and am the wife of Mr. Johnson, a greengrocer—I know the prisoner and his wife—on the evening of 30th July, about 6 or 6.30, his wife came into the shop—he followed her in—I asked the wife if she had made it up with her husband, she said "No," she never would—I said he did not look in his right mind she said "No, he is more fit for the mad-house, but he shall look worse before I have done with him"—upon that he drew an open razor from his left coat pocket and drew it across her throat—he had it in his left hand—he never spoke—I struck him in the face and held him by the neck hand<lb></lb>kerchief</p>

               <p>and dragged him outside—he then drew the razor across, his own throat—he fell over a barrow and I took the razor out of his hand and gave it to the sergeant—his wife was taken to a surgeon and he followed—I believe he had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said he did not look in his right mind, from what I had observed on other days as well as on this—they were not having any quarrel—I—was in front of them—their faces were towards me.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—shortly before 30th July I left him and took a room for myself, and then he used to come every day and annoy me by calling me names and striking me—on one occassion he broke the door open—on the evening of the 30th I went to Mrs. Johnson's shop he followed me—she asked me whether we had made it up, I said "No, I never intend to"—he said "What do you say?" I turned round to Mrs. Johnson to repeat the words, and before I could get them out he drew the razor across my throat—I recollect no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the razor before he cut me—I felt the cut and became insensible—Mrs. Johnson said that he did not look in his right mind, and I said he was more fit for a mad-house—he has been very strange in his ways, by drink, and to all appearance is not in his right senses—I left him because I was afraid of him—I had not made any communication to the parish authorities about his being taken into an asylum.</p>

I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at 69, High Street, Wandsworth—on 30th July the prosecutrix' was brought to my surgery—she had a clean cut wound extending from under the left ear to the middle of the neck in front; it divided the skin, the superficial muscles, and vessels—it was in a dangerous part; it was not very deep, it laid bare the carotid artery, if it had touched that, death would have been very speedy—she was sent on to the union—I examined the prisoner's neck; it was a wound in front, about two inches long, merely dividing the skin, not doing any serious injury.</p>

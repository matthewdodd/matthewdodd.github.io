                  </hi> I am a law-stationer, in Tavistock-row, Covent-garden. Franks was in my service—I have know Whitley about twelve months—he was in the service of Few and Co., and was acquainted with Franks—after he left Few and Co., their managing clerk gave him some bills, which he wrote at home, but which passed through my office—on 13th March I procured from the Stamp-office, in exchange for allowance-tickets, two 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps on parchment, and four on paper—they were brought to my house by Footman, and placed in a drawer in the counter—Franks was there when they were brought in, and he remained there—it is our custom to count the stamps at night, and one of them which was on paper was missed—I inquired about it, and inquired of Franks, but I could get no tidings of it—On Saturday, the 25th March, about a quarter past one o'clock, Whitley came to my house—(it is the practice of the Stamp-office, if any stamps are spoiled, to give allowance-tickets to get other stamps of the same amount, and it is usual to sell those tickets amongst law-stationers)—he brought this allowance-ticket, and asked me to give him cash for it—I said it was not quite convenient to do so then, but I would on the Monday, if he would leave it—he said he wished to make up some money, and I eventually gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, deducting five per cent.—while we were dealing, Franks came in, and he said, "What, Whitely, have you been spoiling stamps?"—Whitley replied, "What is it to you if I have been spoiling stamps?"—Franks remained there till Whitely was going—he them said, "Whitley, I have a letter for you;" and he was going out to fetch it—I said, "Another time will do;" but I saw he was very desirous of going out, and I did not prevent him—he was gone about ten minutes—that anxiety to go out created my suspicion, and I Want to the Stamp-office, and an affidavit was produced to me, numbered the same as this allowance-ticket—it was written by Franks, in the name of Whitley, spelling the name with <hi rend="italic">ly</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">ley</hi>—I saw there the stamp that the affidavit alluded to—I believe it to be the stamp that had been stolen from my drawer—it had been written on by Franks—I knew it from his figures of being on the back of it—this is the allowance-ticket—here are two figures of 35<hi rend="italic">s. on it, one in ink, which is my writing—I do not know whose writing the other is—it looks a little like Franks'—I lost a book at the same time I lost the stamp—this is it—it has my name in it—it was kept behind the counter—it was found at Whitley's lodgings—here are some entries of mine in it— —the last entry is Franks' writing, which has no reference to my business at all—Whitley would have no right to have any book of mine.</hi>

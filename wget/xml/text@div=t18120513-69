               <p>Q. When did you lose these things - A. On Friday morning, the 8th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, as I was at breakfast, two females came up stairs. I occupy the two pair and the attic. I opened the door on the two pair of stairs to let the females in, and inadvertantly left the stair-case door open. After the females had been some time in the second floor they fixed upon some worked muslin. I then wanted the yard measure to cut it off. I went to the landing, for the yard measure, and, to my surprise, I saw the prisoner go down stairs with an umbrella. I pursued the man, and called out stop thief. I ran across Brooks'-market, into Fox-court. I met the prisoner coming back, in the custody of the beadle. We took him up to the two pair of my house. He then begged for mercy. In his pocket we found a metal candlestick, which was my property. This is the umbrella that he dropped on the foot of the stairs, going out. It is my candlestick and umbrella.</p>

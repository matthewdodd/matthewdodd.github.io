He said he bought it of a man in Webb-square, named Grant, about five months before, and that he gave 16 s. 6 d. for it. While we were debating what to do with him he got away. I saw him again next day, went with Turnpenny to his lodgings, and found the coat there. We took him to Grant's, and asked him if he sold the prisoner the coat? he denied it. The prisoner said nothing.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Bank, and have the care of the Cashbook-office; the prisoner used to leave the Times newspaper there every morning - he generally came about half-past seven o'clock; the prosecutor lost his coat. I saw the prisoner in Wilson-street, Finsbury, with it on his back, and followed him to the Bank, waited till he came out, and then told him a gentleman in the Cashbook-office would be glad to see him. I delivered him to the gentleman.</p>

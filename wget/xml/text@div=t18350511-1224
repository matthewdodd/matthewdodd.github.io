                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 117.) I know the house of Mr. James Parker—it is at the bottom of New Gravel-lane—there it a passage which leads up to it out of Wapping-wall—I was on duty there on the 1st of May—a little before three o'clock in the morning I heard a noise like the breaking of a door—I listened, and heard some footsteps in the alley—I pushed the door open, and found Sowter there with his shoes off—I asked him what he did there—he said he had occasion to go there—I asked him what he pulled his shoes off for—he said it was a way he had—I then heard some one coming, and saw Andrews come from a door that leads to Mr. Parker's, with his shoes in his hand—I seized them both, brought them into Wapping-wall, and took them towards the watch-house—when we had walked ten or twelve yards, a large chisel dropped down—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded a little further, and they said, "Let us put on our show, and we will go quietly with you;" and in stooping down, Andrews put another chisel under a window-shutter—we went on a little further, and Andrews struggled to get away—I saw a sailor come by, I called him to assist me, and he took hold of Andrews—I went back with Sowter and took the chisel—I took them to the watch-house, and went to the premises—I got over the door</p>

               <p>the same way as they did—I heard some one about—I then went up, and found Mr. Parker—I tried this chisel to two marks which were in the door-post—they fitted exacty in all respects—the staple was pulled out, and was picked up by Mr. Parker's lad off the floor—I went back to where the chisel had been, and found a bit of candle by it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and this is my dwelling-house—it is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell. I was alarmed by a tea-tray falling down from where I had placed it, against the warehouse-door—at the same time I heard a shuffling—I listened a few minutes, and then rang a bell—I went over the warehouse, and found the property was all safe—I went down into the yard, and found all safe—I saw the chisels fitted to the doors and the posts—they tallied in all respects—the staple was drawn, and was on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to the last witness. On 4th Oct. I received some money from him, wrapped in white paper; I gave it to the prisoner in the same state in which I had it from my master—I told him to give it to Mr. Vaughan—he was behind the counter in Mr. Vaughan's shop at Aldgate—it was about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—I told him I brought it from my master; he opened the paper and I saw there was a note, I do not know of what amount, and a sovereign—I did not see any one else behind the counter.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a draper, and live at 19 and 20, Ald<lb></lb>gate. The prisoner was my shopman on 4th Oct.—he gave notice of leaving on that day, about half-past 1 o'clock or a quarter to 2—it was our dinner-hour, when the greater part of our young persons were out of the shop, the prisoner and one more being left in it—the prisoner came down to dinner with the second party; he spent but a short time—he hastened out of the room in one or two minutes—he returned again and appeared very much agitated, stating that a messenger had just come up from Oxford, saying that his brother-in-law had died suddenly, that his sister had been confined about a month, and was dangerously ill, and he hardly knew what he was saying or doing—seeing that he was so much excited, and supposing what he told me was the truth, I asked him what he wished to do; whether he wished to leave at once—he said if I would allow him to leave under these circum<lb></lb>stances, he would be very much obliged to me—I said, "Certainly," and in the course of two or three minutes I came up in the shop and paid him his salary due to him to that day, which was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—his wages were 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and he had his board and lodging—he lived in the house entirely—I had not heard before of his intention to leave, but I had intimated to him that he would not suit me—I had not given him notice, for he had promised to try to do better, and to please me, as the situation was very comfortable, and he wished to stay in it—my brother owed me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner in the course of his duty was in the habit of receiving money for me over the counter—I cannot call to mind that he received any debts for me, but he was in a position so to do if a person had called to pay debts in the regular course of business—if he received money for me across the counter, it was his duty to take it to the desk, or to give it to me—he did not on that day, or at any time afterwards, give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had received from my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is it a rule in the trade to give any warning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if you mean to tell a young man he is to leave the situation—it is not usual to give a week or a month's warning—the general rule is, to tell a young man he will not suit, and to pay him and dismiss him—it was not my intention to dismiss you that Saturday night—I had not engaged a young man to come in the following week—it is a rule, that from the opening of the shop till the close of it, there shall not be less than two young men in it—I have no recollection of any of the young men being absent at that hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came there to be but one young man in the shop during that dinner-hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner and a young man named Edgar were left in the shop; but Edgar broke the rule; he came into the dining-room to ask me a question, and I detained him about two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am perfectly innocent of this charge; I have elicited that it was one of the most positive rules, that not less than two young men should be left in the shop, nor do I recollect that it was left with only one—I recollect during that dinner-time I was relieved by Mr. Edgar, with a lady that I had had a long time; and if the apprentice came to the shop, and paid the money, it was next to an impossibility that he could have paid it without being seen by a second party; and he knew that I was going to leave, two or three hours before he heard any inquiry about the money; I had sometimes very much larger sums pass through my hands; what temptation was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, to what it was to a youthful apprentice; and is it usual for any one to pay a sum of money without a receipt, or seeing it booked, in any way? I leave my case in your hands; I speak as unto wise men, judge ye what I say.</p>

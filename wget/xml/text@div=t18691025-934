I am landlord of the Three Tons, at Wycombe—on Friday, 17th December, Baker and Carter came to my house—Baker asked me if I would buy a mare—I said that I did not think I should—he got into the trap and drove down the street and back again—I said, "How long have you had them?"—Carter said, "We <hi rend="italic">chopped</hi> for it at Uxbridge, yesterday"—Baker said, "Do not take any notice of my man; he will tell you any lie; I <hi rend="italic">chopped</hi> for it at Barnet Fair"—they left, and Davis after<lb></lb>wards showed me the same mare.</p>

On Sunday, the 26th of September, about two o'clock, the two prisoners came in a one horse chaise, with a woman - the chaise drove up to the door. Keaton came in, and asked if his master could dine there that day? I said Yes, and he went out again. All three came in, and were shewn into a room, where they ordered dinner - I laid the cloth, and waited on them at dinner; they all three dined together. Directly after dinner they ordered the bill, which I took them - the amount was 14 s. 3 d. The prisoner, Voss, gave me a 5 l. Bank of England note, and told me to take the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. As a naval officer, in a uniform coat. I took the note to my master, who was outside the door, and asked him if I should ask the name? He said, No, he wished he had a hundred of them. I gave him the note, and he gave me four 1 l. notes, and 4 s. 9 d. in change, which I gave to Voss; he gave me 1 s., and ordered the horse to be put to. They went away - they staid there about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you swear they are the same persons, though they are differently dressed - A. Yes, I am sure they are the same - we had not much company that day.

               <p>Q. Did you receive any note from your servant - A. Yes, a 5 l. Bank note. I looked at it to see if it was good, approved of it, and gave it to my wife to write on, which she did in my presence. I know her hand-writing - this is it - (looking at it) - it has,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told your servant it was a good note - A. I said I wished I had a hundred of them - I thought it was a good one. My wife did not go to the till; I did not compare it with another note. I had no other 5 l. note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you part with it - A. I paid it to Meux and Co., my brewers, on the Wednesday following; it was returned to me as forged that day month, when the clerk came to collect again. My wife took no other 5 l. note that day.</p>

            . I keep the Boston Arms, public-house, at Turnham Green, in Middlesex. On Sunday, the 26th of September, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon - I cannot exactly say the time, the prisoner, Voss, I am certain, came in a one horse chaise with another young man, and a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain as to the other lad - A. No, I think it was the same, but cannot swear to him, Two men came up, at the same time; one of them said,</p>
               <p>"This young man (meaning Voss) has fallen out, and hurt his arm." Voss said he had hurt his arm, and wished to have something to rub it with - the party went into my parlour together; I took him some vinegar, and rubbed his arm myself. He called for some brandy and water, which he had, he then ordered each of the other men a glass of rum. He said</p>
               <p>"Give each of these men a bottle of rum," I said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I dare say they don't desire a bottle of rum each." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, give them each a bottle of rum, for I don't wish any one to do any thing for me without being paid for it." I gave them each a bottle; the reckoning came to about 10 s. 8 d. Voss came to the bar, and gave me a 5 l. note. I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I have not got change in the house for a 5 l. note." He said,</p>
               <p>"You must get me change, for I have no small change to pay you." I then called my man, Stephens, who held the horse at the door, and told him to go to Mr. Ward's, my baker, for change. I gave him the note, and he brought the change. I put it on the counter, and Voss took it up.</p>
               <p>- Q. Did you ask his name and address - A. I gave him a pen and ink to write, but whether he did or not, I do not know - they then went away; the note came back to me as forged. Voss was dressed in a midshipman's uniform.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with it after it was brought back - A. I gave it to Mr. Christmas. I am sure Voss is the man, who wore the naval uniform. The other two men were not at the bar when he gave me the note. I can swear Voss was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You rubbed his arm - A. Yes; he took his coat off - I noticed his coat. I talked very little to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not Keaton - A. I have every reason to believe he is the same person - I have no doubt but he is the same; they came between two and four o'clock in a one horse chaise. Voss was dressed in a naval uniform. When they first drew up to the door, the younger one got out, and asked me if I sold wine? I said Yes. Voss got out, and went into the parlour - both came into the house. Voss asked for a bottle of Port and one of sherry, which I served - it came to 12 s. 9 d. with the bottles. Voss offered me a 5 l. note, which he took out of a pocket-book. I said I was not sure whether I could change it; the young one took the wine, and I went to get change.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said you was not sure whether you could give change, what did he say - A. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can you change a 15 l. note I then?" - I saw another note with the 5 l. note. I asked him for his address; he gave me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wilson, near the stairs, Blackwall" - (looks at a note) - this is it; I wrote that on it; I gave him the change, and nothing more passed. He said he should want four bottles more as he returned, but I saw no more of him. I wrote on it in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he gave you the note, the lad was not by - A. No, he was putting the wine into the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak with certainty to the young one - A. I have no doubt of him from his size and appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not from hearing circumstances from witnesses, rather than from your own observation that you say he is the man - A. No, it is entirely from my own observation. I will not swear to him, but I entertain no doubt - he was not by when I gave Voss the change.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JUDGE. I am waiter at the Angel, public-house, at Ilford, kept by Mrs. Ashmole; it is nine miles from the Three Pigeons, public-house - I know Voss. On the 30th of September I saw him with a lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other prisoner - what is your belief - A. He is about the same size. I cannot say whether he is or is not the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Voss - A. At the Angel, at Ilford, in the street - I stood at the gateway. They came up together in a one horse chaise, from the London way; they went a little way by the gateway, and then stopped - it was between three and four o'clock, as near as I can guess; Voss was dressed as a naval officer. He turned his head round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Waiter, can I have any thing to eat here?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you can." He said,</p>
               <p>"You had better draw the chaise into the yard" - I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it will be safer there" - they did so. Voss got out, and I shewed him into a room up stairs; the lad dined with him there. I asked Voss if he would have hot or cold? He said he should like a nice rump steak, and I ordered it. He rang the bell, and told me to send the lad up stairs, which I did; he rang the bell afterwards, and ordered a bottle of wine, which I took him - they then had their dinner, and a pot of ale; the reckoning came to 11 s. Voss gave me a 5 l. note, which I took to my mistress immediately, and she gave me three 1 l. notes, and 1 l. 9 s. in silver. I took it up to him, and he gave me 1 s., followed me down stairs, and drove towards London. They were there about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You put no name on it - A. No. The young man acted as servant, and attended the gig - he was in the room when I took the change, and when the note was paid. They both came down stairs together.</p>

            . I keep the Angel, at Ilford. On the 30th of September, I remember the last witness bringing a 5 l. note into the bar to me to change; I had seen two gentlemen pass the bar, but did not know them - the reckoning came to 11 s. I put the note in the till, and gave him the change; I locked the till - it was about half-past three o'clock. I had no other 5 l. note then, and took no other that day. I took it out at night, took it up stairs for safety, and brought it down again the next morning; I had no other 5 l. note. Next day Mr. Christmas called upon me, and I shewed him the same note, marked it while he was present, and he took it. This is it - (looking at it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean you had no other 5 l. note that day - A. Not Bank of England; I had a 5 l. Romford note. I did not mark it till I saw Mr. Christmas.</p>

            . My father keeps the Green Gate, at Plaistow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoner's come to your father's house - A. Yes, both of them. I only know Voss; another was with him, about the same size as Keaton - Voss was dressed in a naval uniform. The boy asked if we sold wine? I said we did - they came in a gig. Voss then got out, came into the bar, and asked for two bottles of wine, which came to 13 s. 8 d. - the boy did not come into the house. He paid me a 5 l. note; I examined it - I was some time at the bar. He came out of the parlour, and I told him I was fearful I could not change it. He said it was a very good one, that I need not be afraid, for he had it at the Bank that morning; that satisfied me, and I changed it. I took it up stairs immediately, and put it into the drawer, out of which I took some other notes to give him change. I laid the note on the top, locked the drawer, came down, and gave him the change. They went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after that you had some information - A. Two persons came the same day, and asked me if I had changed a note? I said Yes, and sent my sister, Louisa, to fetch it down - I gave her the key. She brought me a 5 l. note down, and it was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write on it - A. Yes, an hour after; I never lost sight of it, and am sure it is the note my sister brought me. This is it - (looking at it). I wrote on it,</p>
               <p>"Stranger, September 30, A S." I then sent after the prisoners, but could not have them overtaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many 5 l. notes had you - A. I do not think I had any; I rubbed the note when Voss stood at the door. I thought him a suspicious character, and rubbed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you always rub them - A. Sometimes, not always - (the note had the appearance of having been rubbed).</p>

            , at Plaistow; the prisoners both came to our house on the 30th of September; both came to my door in a single horse chaise, about five o'clock. Voss was dressed in a uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other dressed - A. I cannot particularly say. I noticed his features more than his dress; he appeared like a servant to Voss. Voss asked for a bottle of Port wine and one of sherry, which I gave to him, and told him not to shake it. He said that was of no consequence, and put it into the seat of the chaise; he was at the door with a little pocket-book in his hand, and appeared to have more notes. I saw a 20 l. and a 5 l. note - he gave me the 5 l. note, and I gave him the change. I threw the note on the table, and asked a friend, who was in the bar, what he thought of it? He thought it a good one. I marked it September 30., and blotted it - (looks at it) - this is is it; it has,</p>

               <p>"September 30, M. Cobley," in my hand-writing - I gave it to Mr. Christmas, the Bank inspector. I am positive it was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not send your servant with it to a neighbour to ask if it was good - A. No, it was never out of my sight until I marked it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the lesser boy, and say if you think him the other one - A. I have not the smallest doubt; I took particular notice of them both. I wrote on the note directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Keaton by at the time Voss paid you - A. They were both at the door. I think he must have seen him pay me, and have seen me give change. He was not attending to the gig, for the hostler was minding that.</p>
               <p>HARRIET HODGSON. I keep the Britannia, at Limehouse. On the 30th of September, Voss, I am certain, came to my house with another - I do not speak positively to Keaton, It was a lad very much like him - they were in a one horse chaise. About six o'clock in the evening, they passed the door a very little way, then came back and got out; the horse's head was towards London. Both came in, and asked if I had any good wine? I said I had. Voss ordered a bottle of white and one of red; he paid me a 5 l. note - the lad was out of doors, when he paid me. I called to my sister for a pen and ink, and asked him his name? He said he was lame in his right hand, for he had hurt it, and requested me to write it. I asked him his name again? He said,</p>
               <p>"Brown, No. 15, Oxford Road." I handed the note to my sister, and saw her write that on it. This is it - (looking at it) - they then went away. I know of no Oxford Road, East.</p>

               <p>"Here, Jack, take these two bottles." He took them in the chaise, and put them in a case made on purpose.</p>

He wanted a silk hat, and I fitted him He then called the young one by some christian name, and he came in. Voss told me to fit him with one too. I wished to persuade him to have a beaver one, but he said they only wanted it for a Sunday or two, while on shore and would have a silk one - I fitted Keaton. The elder one took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and gave me a 5 l. Bank note - he had another note, which I think was a 50 l.; he gave me the 5 l. note. I immediately took it to Mr. Shuttleworth, who is a neighbour, and he gave me four 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver for it. I returned, and gave the elder one two 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver.

            . I am a tailor, and live in St. Martin's-lane. On a Thursday in September - I think it was the 30th, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Voss, and a lad about the same size as Keaton, came to me - I am sure Voss was one. He ordered a superfine blue coat, a black kerseymere waistcoat, and a pair of blue trowsers; they were for the lad. I measured him, and the clothes were to be ready on the Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day of the month - A. I cannot be positive, but it was on a Thursday at the latter end of September. I got the clothes ready on the Friday; they came to six guineas; the two prisoners came for them. They waited in the shop about a quarter of an hour - I cannot say whether they had any conversation. Voss gave me a 5 l. note and 6 s. in silver, and the lad gave me a 1 l. note. They took the clothes away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they come - A. I believe they walked; I gave my wife the 5 l. note, and did not mark it. She was by my side I think, and I gave it to her. She put it into a bag in my bureau, but I did not see her.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago was it - A. Two months, and the last day of the month. About six o'clock they came, and ordered a suit of clothes - the little one was measured for them. I was there the next day, Friday, when they paid for them. Voss gave Cox a 5 l. note and 6 s., and the little one gave him a 1 l. note. I took them, and put them into a canvas bag, which I put into the bureau; I had no other 5 l. note in the house - I stood by Mr. Cox, and saw him take it of Voss. I took it of him. It was taken out of the bureau on Saturday, and I paid it to

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Chatham. On the 6th of October I remember Keaton coming to my shop about half-past seven o'clock in the evening; he was dressed in a naval uniform. While he was there, I saw Voss looking through the window; he was dressed in a blue great coat, buttoned very close round his throat, and appeared as if he was examining the shoes through the window, while I was serving Keaton. From his appearance I judged him to be a master's mate.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Keaton ask for - A. A pair of boots - I had none to fit him; he then asked for a pair of shoes, I fitted him with them. He gave me a 5 l. Bank note, I requested him to write his name on it, he said he could not write. I asked his name and address? he told me his name was Johnson, and he belonged to the Royal frigate, which I wrote on the note before him - (looks at it). I wrote,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Johnson, Royal frigate, R. O." I afterwards wrote the rest of my name. The shoes came to 8 s. 6 d. I gave him the change.</p>

He took a red memorandum-book out of his pocket, and from between the leaves he gave me a 5 l. Bank note. I said I hoped it was a good one - he said he should be very sorry if it was not.

            . On the 6th of October the last witness came to me, I gave her change for a 5 l. note, which I put into the till - there was no other 5 l. note there. I took it almost directly, and my brother marked it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you only to give her 1 l. - A. I did not exactly look at it. I was sure she had given me a 5 l. note, because I had nothing but 1 l. notes in the till before.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live on St. Margaret's Bank, Rochester. On the 6th of October Keaton came and bought some silk handkerchiefs of me; he paid me a 5 l. note, which I put into the till - nobody but my wife and I have access to the till - I did not mark it. I asked him when he was going to sail? he said in about a fortnight, and that the ship laid in the dockyard. About an hour after, I took the note out of my till and put it into my pocket. There was no other there at that time. I marked it at Gravesend - this is it - (looks at it).</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicions, did you not go in search of the prisoners that evening - A. Yes, about an hour after I took it. I went through different towns, and made inquiry. I went to Gravesend, and found the two prisoners in bed together at the Three Daws, about a quarter after twelve o'clock - the landlord was gone to bed also.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room where they were in bed was Everest with you - He was in the house. The landlord, and a man whom I got, were with me. We found three beds in the room, the two prisoners were in one bed. Only one bed was unoccupied, and on that spare bed the naval uniform laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to them about the uniform - A. Both denied it, and said they had never seen it, nor wore such a thing. After searching the clothes they dressed themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had dressed themselves were their clothes complete - A. No. Voss dressed himself without a waistcoat; he said the uniform waistcoat was not his. Without that, there was only one waistcoat between them. They had both dark blue great coats. Keaton had a blue coat over his uniform when he came to my shop. We found in the midshipman's coat pocket two guineas and three seven-shilling pieces - we also found in the pantaloons pockets 14 s. in one and 18 s. in the other; also a gold seal and a key. Each of them had pantaloons, and there was silver in each. I do not know which had the key and seal. Voss afterwards claimed the gold, and got it away from us. We made them undress two or three times, but could not find it. In a bundle on the table we found the handkerchiefs I sold to Keaton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bed in which they laid - A. Yes, and under the feather-bed, in the middle of the sacking, there was a pocket-book, the same sort as that which Keaton had in my shop. We found eighteen 1 l. local and Bank notes in it, and by the side of the pocket-book was another roll of notes, folded into three parts, about the size of the pocket-book. I think there were eight 1 l. notes, and outside the eight were two 5 l. notes - I took them into my possession, put them into my hat, and put my hat on my head for security. I desired the prisoners to wait while we marked the notes, that there might be no confusion. I believe I omitted marking eight of the notes in consequence of what Keaton did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the two 5 l. notes - A. I had them inside my hat, which was on the top of the bureau; Voss immediately walked behind the landlord, made a snatch over my head, caught the two 5 l. notes up, and put them in his mouth. We immediately seized him by the throat, to prevent his swallowing them - he gave a gulp and said they were gone. He said,</p>
               <p>"You can't blame me for what I have done - you may do your best," or</p>
               <p>"your worst" - I do not know which. I told him he had done the worst thing he could. I gave the property to Everest. (Looks at two fragments of notes) - these are parts of the two I found under the bed, and which I saw him put into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went for the purpose of apprehending them - A. No. They denied that the clothes belonged to them. I believe I said I was positive they were the clothes I saw them in. I was determined to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say it would be better if they told the whole truth - A. I do not remember it.</p>

             re-examined. I am a constable of Gravesend. I went with Mr. Homan to the Three Daws;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010035"></xptr>we went into the bed-room. The account he has given is correct. I produce two silk handkerchiefs, a pair of shoes, a pair of gloves, two silver watches, three keys, and two seals on one of them, and a watch and chain without; also a ring, two guineas, another seal, a brooch, a key, and 18 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about the notes that were found - A. Here are twenty-five 1 l. notes - seventeen in one parcel and eight in another, and two 5 l. notes. I marked them. Voss seized them - the last witness's account is correct - (looks at two 5 l. notes) - they are those I marked, and which Voss put into his mouth. Rivers gave them to me next morning, about eight o'clock, at the Three Daws. I took the prisoners from the Three Daws to prison, about half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 7th - I took them along High-street.</p>

I said it was, and asked him to try it on - he said he could not, for he had fallen down the hatchway. His arm was in a sling. He asked me to take a pocket-book out of his pocket, which I did, and laid it on the counter; he took a 5 l. note out and gave me - I marked it; this is it - (looking at it).

They were to be ready on the 1st of September. He came for them, but they were not quite ready, and he waited half an hour while they were finished; the price was 5 l. 8 s. - he had left 3 s. as a deposit. He had his arm in a sling, and I could not try them on. He asked me to put my hand into his left hand pocket, and take a pocket-book out? which I did; he gave me a 5 l. note, and said his uncle was Mr. Wilson, who resided in the Tower, and had a situation under Government.

            . I am seventeen years old. On the 2d of March, about seven o'clock, I locked the pigs up safe. I went there at five o'clock next morning, and found the staple of the middle door drawn, and seven pigs gone. I saw five of them again on the 10th of March, at the prisoner's house - he was a hawking butcher. I know them by the marks on the rump, which I put on them when my father bought them - they were alive; he had them in a dark corner of his shed. I had called at his house on the 8th, and asked his wife if they had any; I went in the yard and looked at two sows. On the 10th, I got a search warrant out and found them.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I went and found the pigs secreted in a dark place at the prisoner's house - bills had been printed and circulated; he said he bought them of a man three week before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I deal in pigs. I bought them of a person unknown to me, at Ratcliff-highway, for 23 s. each.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman; I cannot swear to these coals, they are the same sort of coals that were lost, there was no other craft near, or a passage to any other, unless a man jumped overboard; the barge was called the Hope, No. 1003, and an anchor painted on her stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a full room? - A. No, it was broken into the day before; there had been a great deal of rain in the night, which gives a different gloss to the coals, and these were taken after the rain left off; they had the appearance of having been raked out with the hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife had laid in that morning, and I had no coals to warm my three children; I went on board a sailing barge, and the man gave me some coals.</p>

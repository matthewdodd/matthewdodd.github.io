                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's. On the morning of the 6th of March, about half-past seven o'clock I left my shop for an instant while I went into the passage to close a door—I heard some one in the shop, who had come in from the street—I went back into the shop, and saw the prisoner going out with a bag with about 40lbs. weight of coffee in, it—I am sure he is the person—I followed him into the street—he dropped the bag at the next door, ran off, and escaped—I brought the coffee into my shop—I had known him before—I had seen the bag of coffee safe about ten minutes before, when I opened my shop—I gave information, and the prisoner was afterwards brought in custody—I gave the bag to the officer—this is it—this coffee is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information, and took the prisoner about two hours afterwards—I told him I wanted him to go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "I will tell you presently"—I took him to the prosecutor, and he immediately said he was the man—I then told the prisoner he was charged with stealing a bag of coffee—he said, "What time?"—I said, "About a quarter before eight"—he said he did not come out of his own lodging till past eight—this is the bag and coffee.</p>

I recollect the 6th of March, the day the prisoner was taken for stealing the bag of coffee—at eight o'clock that morning I was going for some rolls, I called him up, and when I returned he was dressed—he had his breakfast, and went out about twenty minutes past nine—when I called him I saw him in bed, in the adjoining room to me, and his shoes were in my room—I went up to the bed where he was, and awoke him—I saw his clothes on a chair in the room—they were what he has now got on—he has no other clothes but them—his hat was in my room, and his shoes—he had no other shoes—when I got back he had got his clothes on, and was washing.</p>

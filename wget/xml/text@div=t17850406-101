               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Rashleigh and Co. the prisoner came to our house on Tuesday the 11th of January last, about three in the afternoon, he came into the compting-house, and on seeing me he was coming up, I called out to him if he was coming for prize-money, he was too late that day, I was particularly busy in counting dollars, and I did not wish him to come near me, he said he had an order, or a power, I cannot say which, to receive prize-money, and he seemed to be going out, when Mr. Turner, one of the partners called to see his authority, upon which he gave him the order; Mr. Turner said he believed it was a forgery, and desired me to call Mr. Rashleigh, who immediately came out of the other compting-house.</p>
               <p>- TURNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I received this paper from the prisoner, I examined the prize list, there was no money due to this man of the name of Place, it appeared that the fourth payment was made, and the mark of William Place put as a receipt at the time of payment.</p>
               <p>Thompson. I paid Place two pounds six shillings the last payment, he made his mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turner. I called Mr. Rashleigh, and said I suspected it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Councel, to Mr. Thompson. Did you pay Place any money before? - He had been paid two or three times.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot say that he cannot write, all that you know is, that he made his mark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was called into the compting-house and informed that a person was present to receive prize-money; and they supposed there was a forgery; I went into the compting-house to see, and saw the prisoner, and shewed him this paper, and asked him how he came by it, as it was dated Plymouth; he told me he received it in a letter from Plymouth; I asked him where the letter was; he told me at his lodgings; I asked where his lodgings were; he told me at the White Lyon in St. Catherine's, I think that was the answer he gave; I then left him in the compting-House, and went for a constable, the constable came, and I charged him with the prisoner, on a suspicion of forgery, in uttering this note: I desired the constable to go with him to his lodgings; and if they found the letter there and the matter clear, I had no objection to the prisoner's being released, because I thought it would be a proof that he had come by it honestly; on the same day, and nearly at the same time I referred to some letters I had received from Mr. Nicholls, the Mayor of Plymouth, to compare it with the will.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present? - I think he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. He did not know what you did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. I believe you asked the prisoner how he came by this after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he come back again after he had been to search? - He was carried to the Compter immediately.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner after? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>I believe in that conversation you required him to tell the truth, how he came by this order to receive the money? - I did, and his account of it was that he received it from one

               <p>Mr. Keys. Did he say Eagan owed him any money? - No, the prisoner made this kind of declaration, with the view of turning King's evidence.</p>

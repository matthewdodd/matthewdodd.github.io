I am a chemist, and live in Church-street, Greenwich—the prisoner has been servant to Mr. Williams, a neighbour of mine—she was in the habit of coming to my shop two or three times a-week for articles in my business—on Sunday, 19th August, she was in my shop twice for a bottle of mixture for her master—on the following morning,</p>

               <p>about 8 o'clock, I missed a bottle of tolu lozenges, a box of lemonade powders, and other articles, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 27th August, I went with a con<lb></lb>stable to the prisoner's master's—I saw her, and told her from information I had received, I desired to look in her box—we went up to her room with her mistress and another lady and her master—the prisoner said, "If you think I have taken anything you can have my box broken open"—it was broken open, and the constable searched it—I found in it this box of lemonade powders, two bottles of scents, and other things—I should say this box of lemonade powders was mine—there is no private mark on it—it is similar to what I had in stock—I believe all these to be mine—I did not sell any of them to the prisoner—she first denied the charge, and afterwards acknowledged it—I said, "That is mine, and that is mine"—she said, "No, they are not"—she afterwards said, "That is yours, and that is yours"—she said she had taken them from the glass-case in my shop.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Peter Latzou; he is a Swede - I am an English woman; we arrived in town on the 11th of October, from the Brazils, and went to lodge at the prisoner's house, <placeName id="t18271206-40-crimeloc197">No. 36, Edmond's-place, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

On the 13th of October, in consequence of something that took place between my husband and myself, the prisoner came into the room; this property at that time was all spread on the table; the trunks were then all in the front-room; in consequence of what happened that day, I moved the small trunk, containing the property, under the pillow that night; it was locked, but the key was tied to the handle - I continued in the lodgings till the 20th of October - I kept the box under the pillow day and night, till then; we left in consequence of a disturbance with the prisoner - I made the bed myself, and saw the box safe every morning - I saw it under the pillow about half-past seven o'clock on the 20th, when I got up - I and my husband quitted the lodgings about ten minutes before eight o'clock; we took away every thing, except the small trunk, which I forgot, as the prisoner was quarrelling with me; we moved to No. 5, Princes-street, Ratcliff-highway, and ten minutes after I got there, I opened one of the large boxes, and seeing the vacancy in it, I recollected I had not taken the trunk from under the pillow - I returned directly, the prisoner opened the door to me - I said, "Mrs. Cornell, will you give me leave to go up stairs, for I have left my small box here, with all my property?" I got back there within three quarters of an hour, or an hour; she said, "Oh, Ma'am, walk up stairs, there has no one been up, only myself;" she went up with me - I took the pillow off, and saw the vacancy where the box had been, but the box was not there - I said, "Oh, Ma'am, I left my box here, will you please to give me my box again?" she said no one had been up stairs but herself, not even the woman, whom she had sent for to clean the carpet, had been there; but I was a silly woman, and ought to have taken better care of my property; and if it had been her's, she would have taken better care of it - I said, "Be so kind as to give me my property back, for it is all I have;" she said, "Go along, go along - you ought to have taken better care of it" - I went down, and said, "If you don't give it me by good means, I will make you give it me" - I went back, told my husband, and went with him to the Mansion-house; two officers went to search the house, but they went without a warrant; they did search, but found nothing - I went back with my husband to my new lodgings, and there saw the witness Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the prisoner's, with the officers, in what state was the bed? A. All tossed over - I had taken off the top-sheet myself, to show her what kind of sheet she had put on, but I had not touched the lower sheet; but on my return, the lower sheet and the pillow were tossed about - I asked Anderson to go to Mrs. Cornell to get my property: he went, but did not succeed - I had the prisoner apprehended that day week - Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060033"></xptr>Satchell, a witness, was apprehended with her - I gave this account to the Magistrate - I have not recovered any of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you employ any body to assist in taking away your trunks? A. Yes, the carmen; they are not here; they went straight to my lodgings - I had brought the bed from the Brazils; I did not sleep on it at the prisoner's room: we slept on her bed; my husband and I went to Princes-street together - I did not tell him when I first missed it, as I thought I could get it back without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he thought he could get it without your's? A. No, if he had it, I had it - I have been at the Brazils ever since I was a child - I have had two husbands - I have been married a year to the last; my first husband dealt in all the produce of the country - I was a widow eleven months; my second husband came to the Brazils to seek an uncle, and he was engaged as a performer at the Imperial Theatre, and not liking the country, he asked for a licence to travel; he was not a conjuror.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have been at words with him, have you not told him he was nothing but a conjuror? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were quarrelling on the 13th, and this property was on the table, was not the dispute that he wanted to have part of the property, and you said "No, it is all mine, you are nothing but a conjuror, and have no right to it? A. No - he wanted three or four hundred dollars to change. I said "Don't change above one hundred," as I expected a great loss from them. I had one in my hand - he squeezed my hand to get it out - I screamed, which brought the prisoner into the room. Mr. and Mrs. Satchell also saw it. I afterwards showed her my jewels; my husband had not a pair of tongs in his hand when he squeezed my hand - he never struck me in his life - he is not able to do that; we had then slept there two nights. Whenever I went out I shut the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner, or her husband, want you to pay for two weeks lodging, and you wanted to pay for but one? A. She said I had been there nine days, and should pay for two weeks. I said I did not know the rule of the country, and did not like to pay her 16s. for one night; two or three dozen spots of wax had fallen on her carpet, and gave her 2s. to pay a woman to scower it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not an officer called in? A. Yes - Harrison the officer came in, about a quarter of an hour before we left.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was part of the quarrel with your husband, that he could have no part of the property, as he had another wife? A. The quarrel has nothing to do with the robbery. I never heard that he had another wife, and never said so. I had first seen Anderson two or three days after I was in my new lodgings. I did not employ him as a friend, but as a steady man, who would speak to her, and perhaps get my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to a Police-office? A. Because I was a stranger, and did not know much about this country. I could not speak English very well, but being an English woman I have got the language back again since; Anderson speaks English.</p>
               <p>Q. You could talk to him? A. Very little - it was through my landlady, who speaks Portuguese - her name is Lloyd - she interpreted. I went before the Lord Mayor the day I was robbed - I spoke very bad English to him - I understood him, and could speak a few words. Two officers went to search the house. I went before the Lord Mayor again on the 20th - I did not speak then. I went to Guildhall on the 27th, I believe, to swear my deposition. Mrs. Satchell and her husband lodged in the prisoner's house - I never charged her with the robbery - she was brought up about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How she was brought before the Magistrate' you do not know? A. No - I received a communication from Anderson on Monday, the 22d - in consequence of that, Satchell was arrested. I do not know whether there were any other lodgers. I only saw the prisoner's husband one night, that was on the 13th.</p>
               <p>JOHN PETER LATZOU. I am a Swede. I was at the Brazils about two years and a half, and married my wife there about ten months ago; we arrived in London on the 11th of October, and took lodgings in Edmond's-place; I took four large trunks, a bed, and a basket with me; in one of the large trunks was a little box, with money and my wife's jewels. The prisoner was landlady of the house. On the 13th I had a quarrel with my wife - the money and jewels were then on the table; the prisoner came into the room, then Mr. Satchell, and then Mrs. Satchell; they stood by the table - I counted the money to my wife; Mrs. Cornell took my wife's bracelets off the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, in consequence of what you saw her do with the bracelets, did you suffer the small box to continue in the large one? A. No - after she left the room we placed it under the pillow; Satchell and his wife were also gone when we placed it there; we remained there nine days, and then moved to Princes-street, taking the four large trunks, the basket and bed: when we got there, on my wife going to the trunk, she came and told me, "Oh, my G-d! - we have lost all the money we have!" I have seen none of it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were in full dress when you and your wife had the quarrel, on the 13th, or had you any clothes on at all? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not your coat and waistcoat off when Mr. and Mrs. Satchell came up? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not your shirt off? A. I had my clean shirt in my hand; I do not recollect whether I had the tongs in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not beating your wife with the tongs? A. I do not understand English.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck your wife with the tongs? A. No, I did not touch her with them; she called out Hoy! she did not call Murder! I swear that. I was not standing over her with the tongs in my hand; I have been engaged in the Paris Theatre, and at the Imperial Theatre, as a mechanic, trying experiments with instruments; I am not a simple performer, and do not use cards and dice - I do not show for the public. I know something to make pleasure in families; I have played at cards with a few friends.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were quarrelling, did not your wife say you were a poor conjuror, and had no property when she married you? A. I do not remember it - I did not hear it; I do not know that she said I had a wife before at the Brazils; I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she accuse you of having left a wife behind you at the Brazils? A. No - I swear that. No officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060034"></xptr>was called in at that quarrel - that I swear; no officer was called in on the 13th; I did not see Harrison that day - he came into the house on the 20th, the day we left the lodgings - that was by my desire; I had no quarrel with my wife that day; we left the house about a quarter of an hour after he came: I do not know who called the officer in. I went out to fetch two carmen to take my property off, and when I came back Harrison was there - I did not call him in, nor did my wife, to my knowledge. I swear I did not hear Harrison tell the prisoner the sooner she got rid of us the better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send Anderson to Mrs. Cornell, to say you and your wife were sorry for the way you had behaved to her? A. No; I sent him to tell her to give the property back - I said nothing about bad conduct.</p>
               <p>MRS. LATZOU re-examined. I sent Anderson to the prisoner, to tell her to be so kind as to give my property back, as I had lost all, and, being in a strange country, I had nothing to exist on; I did not send any apology for misconduct.</p>

            . I am an American, and by trade a bar-pilot, belonging to New Orleans, and lodge at No. 5, Princes-street - I lodge there still; I was cast away, and brought to this country by the brig Havannah, and am now under the Consul's hands. I first saw Mr. and Mrs. Latzou when they came to lodge at No. 5, Princes-street; I saw them the first day they came; I had some conversation with them on Monday, the 22d of October, and went, by their direction, to No. 36, Edmond's-place, Aldersgate-street. I saw the prisoner now at the bar - I took more particular notice of her, as I was sent on a message to her- I asked her if a Mrs. Coleman lived there; she said perhaps she was the person I was looking for, and requested to know my business; I said I was sent with a message from Mr. and Mrs. Latzou; she said, "Oh, I know your business - walk in," and observed that her name was not Coleman, but Cornell; I saw several persons there, apparently females - I did not take particular notice of any, except a young lady, whom I saw up stairs in the second floor, with the prisoner - her name is Satchell: the prisoner desired me to follow her up stairs, and showed me a large room, containing a round table, and a small bed-room, stating they were the rooms which Mr. and Mrs. Latzou had occupied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what you came for? A. I said I was sent on a message from them; she did not wait to hear the message, but asked me up stairs (after running up), and desired me to search - I said I was not sent for that purpose, but only to know from her if she had found a small box belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Latzou, and whether she would return it or not - I was then standing in the large room, but very near the door of the smaller room; Mrs. Cornell was backwards and forwards; and a little time after, as I stood in the large room, I heard a conversation take place between her and another woman - (as it was a female voice) I could distinguish very well that the prisoner was one of the persons talking; I could not see the other person's face, but it was a woman, by her dress and voice; although they were speaking in a low voice, I heard very plainly every word that passed: they were in the small room; the door was open: I heard the other woman say to the prisoner, "It will be better for you to return the box, for I see plainly it will cause a great deal of trouble, and disgrace upon your family and house." I heard Mrs. Cornell reply, "Oh, it is now gone too far - it cannot be brought back," she then turned her head, and looked over her shoulder at me, as I stood very close, in fact, nearly in the door of the small room, looking at her and the other woman; she then caught the woman by her arm, and said, "But stop a little;" she then came out into the large room, and inquired if I had any former acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. Latzou; I said I never had seen them till they came to the house where I lodged, but I understood, from their conversation and appearance that they were foreigners, and I did not think it was their intention to remain long in London, or in the country - she then went back into the small room, and in a short time returned with a small net purse in her right hand, laying it on the table - it appeared to contain small gold coins, as if it was sovereigns - she said, "My good man, I will give you fifty sovereigns if you will go and say to Mrs. Latzou that no discovery can be made, nor any evidence produced concerning their property, and persuade them to leave the country, and say no more about it" - I observed to the prisoner now at the bar, that I was a stranger in this country, and was afraid of being led into any trouble or difficulty - she assured me if I would follow her directions, she would stand between me and any trouble or difficulty, observing, that I was a poor man, and fifty sovereigns would be of great service to me - I then said, I was willing to do any thing for her that laid in my power, as a servant, but that I understood from the conversation I had heard between my landlady and Mrs. Latzou, that she was an English woman, born in London, and had an uncle and some very respectable friends or relations in this City - she then desired me to go quickly, and bring the address of this uncle, for she wished to know who and what he was, and she would pay me well for my trouble - I then went home - Mr. and Mrs. Latzou were not there, I inquired of the landlady who their relations were; I brought the direction to Mrs. Cornell's house, and delivered it to her - she received me very kindly - gave me a chair to sit down, &amp;c. and asked me to have any thing to drink - she gave me some drink in the small room below stairs, where I saw the same young lady, sitting at tea, whom I had seen up stairs with the prisoner in the morning, accompanied by a young gentleman - after taking the refreshment, I left the house, Mrs. Cornell having first invited me to stay all night, saying, I could have a bed or any thing else - I said, being under the protection of the Consul, I could not be out at night - this conversation was in the passage; after bidding good evening she came out with me into the court, and gave me a nudge, as if she wished to say something to me in private - I followed her round to the corner of Aldersgate-street; she put two half-crowns into my hand, desiring me not to let any person whatever know what had passed between me and her - neither did she wish any person to know what money she had given me, saying, her husband was a very desperate man, and she did not wish him to know any thing of the circumstance; but for me to go home, and take particular notice what Mr. and Mrs. Latzou were talking about, to find out how they intended to proceed, and return next morning and let her know, that she might know what to do, and I should be well rewarded for my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060035"></xptr>trouble; I went home, and made every circumstance known, showing the money I had received to the lodgers and to the two injured foreigners; I went next morning and saw the prisoner; she said she could not speak to me then, there were so many sharks about her house she could not go out without being watched - I might go and come again another time, and she should be very glad to see me; I left her house, and did not return till I went with the officer from Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That was the same day, was it not? A. No; I cannot say how long afterwards, I did not make a memorandum of the day; it might have been two or three days after; I never saw the prisoner before I was sent to her; I did not see any body in the room, except Mrs. Satchell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Satchell the woman she was talking to in the inner room? A. I did not see the face of the woman, but there were but two women in either room at the time the conversation took place.</p>
               <p>Q. She retired to the room to have private conversation with the woman? A. Yes, more to her misfortune; they both spoke loud, for I believe the prisoner is a little deaf; the door was open; she seemed to see me very sharp, and much astonished at finding me there; I did tell her I had come to make an apology for Mrs. Latzou for their behaviour; they did not send me to say so, but I recollect saying it in the course of conversation; I said so before I went up stairs; I do not believe any person saw the purse put down besides myself, for nobody else was in the room; it was in the large room; I suppose she offered me the fifty sovereigns because I had heard the conversation, for she seemed much astonished to find me so near; one room opens into the other.</p>
               <p>Q. She talked loud enough for you to hear, and then offered you fifty sovereigns? A. It seemed so; the fact was she wished to bribe me not to say any thing, after finding I had heard the conversation; I refused fifty sovereigns, and took 5s.; I was well aware if I took the fifty sovereigns she would have made an instrument of me; I am under the American Consul's care; under his hands, the gentlemen in his office know me by sight; I do not suppose they know my general character; I never attempted to defraud them; I know Mr. Le Suth; I do not know Mr. Hughes by name; Mr. Lloyd is the landlord of the house where I live; he boards all the men, and clothes them.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 6, John-street, Mileend-road. On the 13th of October I lodged in the prisoner's house, and had been there about three months; I remember Latzou and his wife coming to lodge there; I heard a quarrel the day they went away, and after they were gone I went up into their front room with Mrs. Cornell; I attempted to go into the inner room, but Mrs. Cornell shut the door in my face; this was between a quarter and half an hour after they had left; when she shut the door, she said I had better not go in there, for the place stunk; I mentioned this to my wife, and went out in about twenty minutes; Mrs. Cornell had gone out twice previous to that, and I met her in Newgate-street; she appeared very much flurried, and wished me to call at the Swan Inn, Holborn bridge, to tell her husband she wanted him; she had asked me if I was going by there; I called and left the message.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go up into their room on the 13th, when there was a quarrel? A. Yes - Mrs. Latzou was crying out apparently in pain, and wanting assistance. I went up and burst the door open being the only male in the house. I thought it right to go up - the door was not locked; as I entered, the prosecutor was standing with his back to me - he had neither shirt, coat, nor waistcoat on. I saw nothing in his hands, but there was a great deal of confusion - he might have had something without my observing him; after seeing him in this state, my wife came up - he then retired to the inner room, and came out with a clean shirt on; his wife appeared in great distress - she said he was a conjuror, and had married her for her money - she said that to his face, before the quarrel was settled; she did not positively accuse him of being married, but she said she believed he had other wives, or something to that effect; she did not say that she knew it; she mentioned several times that he had been a conjuror - whether she meant that as a slight, I cannot tell. Mrs. Cornell was flurried, and there was such a disturbance that Harrison, the officer, was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. She said the room had a bad smell - was not part of her complaint, that they had left the room in filth and grease? A. Certainly it was - the grease was in the front room. I never heard any thing said about the back room; they had my wife taken up - she was discharged.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. When there was the quarrel on the 13th, did you see any property on the table? A. I did, a vast quantity that astonished me - dollars and doubloons; in fact a large round table was covered with them nearly. Mrs. Cornell came up after me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harrison, the officer, sent for on the 13th, or on the day they left the lodgings? A. On the day they left, not on the 13th.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was taken on this charge. I was present on the 13th, when the prosecutor and his wife quarrelled - I went up. I saw silver, gold, and trinkets of different sorts on the table. I was in the room with Mrs. Cornell on the 20th. and remember Anderson coming there. I saw Mrs. Cornell go out with him the second time he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She went out at the same time as him? A. Yes - she came back in about ten minutes, or not so much; it was the prosecutrix's screams that took me up on the 13th - we thought her husband would hurt her - she called Murder! I believe; I think the prosecutor had the tongs in his hand - they talked in their own language a good deal about their property and jewels. I heard her say he wanted to take away her property, and spend it in his own extravagancies; she told him she was not his only wife - that he wished to take all her money from her, and had brought her into a strange land for that purpose. I did not hear her say any thing about her having respectable friends, who would see her righted, or about an uncle in Winchester-street. On the day they left, the prisoner told them they had made the rooms very dirty, and dropped the tallow about the carpet; the woman said "If you say a word about paying for two weeks, when we have been here but nine days, we will stay two weeks, and spoil every piece of furniture;" this was said down stairs - the husband was not present; the prisoner was obliged to call Harrison in. I was present when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060036"></xptr>went away. I did not see the prosecutrix pull her bed clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, some time after this an American coming? A. Yes - he said in the passage, that he had come to make an apology for their bad behaviour. I went up stairs at the same time as him and Mrs. Cornell. I was not in the room all the time he was there. I was in the bed-room with Mrs. Cornell - Anderson was in the bed-room also. I could see him there - there was no other woman in the bed-room. Mrs. Sparkes was sitting on the sofa. I was the person Anderson saw in the bed-room with Cornell - she did not address herself to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to her, "You had better give up the box, for it will bring you and your family into trouble?" A. I did not say any thing of the sort, nor did I hear any thing of the kind mentioned; the prisoner did not say"It is gone too far now, it cannot be brought back," nor any thing of the kind - she did not utter a single word tending to show she had any guilty knowledge of the box. I was taken up as accessory to the robbery afterwards, and was bailed. I heard Anderson examined before the Alderman, and said all he had said about me was false; also all that he had said of the prisoner, as far as I had any knowledge of it; he said I was the person with whom the conversation took place in the bed-room - not a word he has stated did take place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Anderson was there, did you hear your husband say any thing in the prisoner's presence about the box? A. I do not recollect hearing him say any thing; the prisoner is rather deaf, and more so sometimes that others. I was not in the room all the time Anderson was there; my husband came in and called me down - I left the prisoner in the room; she never spoke while I was there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, on the 26th of October, at her house in Edmond's-place - I searched her, she produced a leather and a bead purse, and in the bead-purse, I found this direction (reads)"Mr. De Cavello, merchant, No. 6, Great Winchester-street," which Anderson stated the prisoner had given him 5s. for obtaining - I have not inquired whether such a person lives there.</p>

            . This is the direction a young gentleman gave me - I took the name my landlord gave me, and went to the office of a gentleman, who gave me this direction. I gave it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Mrs. Satchell the woman who held the conversation in the bed-room which you have spoken of? A. I saw her in the bed-room - I do not say she is the identical person who conversed with the prisoner - I did not see any other person in the bed-room, but I did not take particular notice, till I heard the conversation; I then stepped very close to the door, but had no opportunity of observing the person's face, but I took very particular notice to see if a third person besides myself was in either room, but I could see nobody but the woman the prisoner was conversing with.</p>

            . I am acquainted with the prisoner, and was at her house on the 22d of October, when Anderson came; I went up stairs with Mrs. Cornell and him; nobody, to the best of my knowledge, except Mrs. Cornell and him went into the bed-room - I sat on the sofa, and did not see Mrs. Satchell go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, or hear any body else say, "You had better restore the property, or it will bring great disgrace on your house and yourself?" A. Never; nothing of the kind passed, nor was it said the thing had gone too far, and could not be recalled - I was in the large room with Mrs. Cornell and him all the time; no purse of gold was produced.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. You are positive no person went into the bed-room, but him and Mrs. Cornell? A. No - Mrs. Satchell stood against the bed-room door; the sofa is in the front room, close to the bed-room door - I could see into the bed-room as I sat there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If any body had said, "You had better return the box, or it will bring you into trouble or disgrace," must you have heard it? A. Even if the door had been shut, I could hear almost every word, but it was open - I swear no such conversation took place.</p>

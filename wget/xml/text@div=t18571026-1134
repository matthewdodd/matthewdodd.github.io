                  </hi>. I live with my mother at No. 1, Durham Place, Lambeth Road; she lets out perambulators—I know the prisoner. On 6th Oct. she came to No. 1, Durham Place—she wished to hire a perambulator for a lodger of Miss Smith, No. 6, Webber Row, Westminster Road—she did not say who Miss Smith's lodger was—I let her have a perambulator—she also said she wished to have another one after tea—she came after tea, and I let her have another—she said she would bring them home together—she did not bring them—I did not see her until the Friday after, at the corner of Kennington Road—I caught hold of her, and asked her where my perambulators were—she said she had not seen them, and she knew nothing of them—I am quite sure she is the person—the value of the perambulators was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am fourteen years old—I live in the same house as Miss Thoms—I was present when the prisoner came and hired the perambulators—I am quite sure she is the person—she hired both the perambulators at the same time—she said a lodger in the house wanted one after tea, could she have one—I saw her take away the second—mistress sent me to look after the perambulator—I watched the prisoner, and she kept looking behind her—I watched her as far as Tower Street—I waited a moment—she went down Waterloo Road, and took up a child and put her in the chaise, and said to me, "Now you see it is all right"—she said she would acquaint my mistress when she brought it home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy to Mr. Wicker, of Cock Hill, Stepney. The prisoner drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and came to my master's about ten o'clock on the 20th of September—he had a pint of ale—my mistress served him, and my mistress's niece took the money—he drank all the ale in the house but one glassful, and that he took out—I sat in the window getting my supper, and saw the prisoner go out with the glass—it was full—he walked a little way out of my sight and returned with the glass empty—he put the glass under the seat of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he got in and drove off—I jumped out of the window and took hold of the rein of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I said, "You have got a glass"—he said he had not—I said he had—he said, "If I have, a woman put it in"—my master came out in the scuffle, and took the glass from under the seat where he sat to drive—this is it—it was found where I saw him put it—I cannot swear to the glass—it is such a one as we give out with ale.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called out by my potboy. He told me in the prisoner's presence, that the prisoner had secreted a glass in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said nothing—I found the glass under his driving seat—he was sitting in the body of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I think his nose-bag was there—the glass was covered, so that I had some difficulty to find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas and Zephaniah Simpson, of Farringdon-street. On the evening of the 23rd of May I was engaged in serving Gale and Smith with mouslin-de-laine dresses—Gale wanted to purchase a dress, and Smith was with her, helping her to choose—Smith objected to different dresses—they bought none—whilst showing them the dresses, Gale whispered something into Smith's ear, which I could not hear—Smith told her to go to the window, and see if she saw anything there that pleased her better, and also told me to pick out any<lb></lb>thing she pointed out—I was near the window, and did not go out—Gale went out, and came back, saying there was nothing in it to please her—Smith was anxious to get off, saying her husband was wanting his tea, and she had to kindle a fire—I went to another part of the shop to bring some more dresses, and when I returned the prisoners were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I had some painting to do at Mr. Simpson's—I was going to look after my men, and, just as I got to the corner of the door, I saw Smith come out, and go to a female, who was standing at the next door (I am not sure whether it was Allen or Gale—it was the one that was afterwards brought into the shop while I was there) I saw Smith hand something to that female which looked like a dress, and she concealed it under her shawl, or cloak—Mr. Simpsos came out, and took the woman into the shop—I brought Smith back—she was coming away—Charles followed Gale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> This man was not there at all when I came out, but when I went away from the door he came after me, and said one of my friends was taken inside the shop; I do not know anything about the dress. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite sure I saw what I have described—I had just got up to the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> On the 23rd of May I was in doors ill; Gale came and asked me to take a walk with her, which I did, and had some refreshment; she asked me to go to Holborn to purchase a dress; I said there waa quite as good in Whitechapel; she said "No," and we went; before we looked at any, I asked the shopman whether we might be allowed to pay off for one; he asked his master, and said "Yes;" he shewed her some dresses; she said she could not see any to suit her; she went out to see if there was any in the window she liked; I did not know that she had one with her; she came in again, and said she saw none; she told me to get up, which I did, and went out; she stopped behind; Allen called to me, and said, "I have got a dress, has Gale paid for it?"

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Allen.</hi> I came out with Smith and Gale; I was going into the shop with them: Gale said "No, Miss, you are not fit to go in with us, your bonnet is too shabby;" I stopped outside about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; Gale came out to me, laughed, and said "Catherine,</p>

               <p>here is a dress, walk away with it, do not let Mary Ann Smith know of it;" I thought it very strange, not being wrapped up in paper; I walked as far as the other window till Smith came out; I said "Gale gave me a dress, was it bought?" she said "I am not aware that it is, take it back to the shop;" I said "No, I will not take it back; when she comet out, I will give her the dress;" the man came and took me; he asked me who gave it to me?

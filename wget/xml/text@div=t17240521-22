Mr. Lamp depos'd, that the Prisoner came to him, and borrowed Money on some of the Spoons, saying, they were a Gentleman's, who had lost Money at Play; and that he came afterwards and wanted to borrow more, saying, that what he had before did not answer his Master's Occasions; that a considerable Time afterwards he came again, and would have borrowed more Money on the rest of the Forks, but he having seen an Advertisement concerning the Baron's Forks and Spoons, and perceiving the Marks, which as it appear'd by the Evidence was the Baron's Coat of Arms, very artificially filed out; suspected the Prisoner and stopp'd him; that thereupon the Prisoner entreated him to let him go, saying, he was undone if he stopp'd him, and told him, if he would let him have his Liberty, he should have the Plate; but he telling him he could not do that, sent for an Officer, secur'd him, and sent Word to the Baron.

               <p>MISS HARRIET ORCHARD. I am single, and live at No. 9, Great George-street, New-road. On the 8th of June, at a quarter before 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking up <placeName id="t18270712-4-crimeloc31">George-street, St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he strike you with one hand and at the same moment snatch the watch with the other? A. Yes - the blow was first, and I felt him pulling my watch - he struck me violently with one hand, and was pulling at the same moment with the other; I felt the blow before I felt him pulling - it was done as near as possible together, for it was all done in five minutes or less - he wrenched the watch round, and got it in a moment; he ran away - I pursued him down three streets, till I was stopped by the mob, somewhere in St. Giles' - I do not know the name of the place; he got quite away - I had no opportunity of seeing his face; I only saw his size and height as he ran before me; the man was the prisoner's size as exactly as possible; I believe from his size, and what I saw of him, that he is the man, but my sister, who was with me, can tell more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the person standing with his back or his face towards you? A. I did not see him standing - he came with his face towards me, and struck me, but he held his head down, and darted right against me - he ran away immediately; I followed, and was stopped as I turned the third corner; I had come to near the same place as where I was robbed; I followed him into the same street again; he got clear away. I afterwards went to Clerkenwell prison, but did not see the prisoner - I pointed out a person there as being about the size of the man, but did not say he was the man. I did not see the prisoner in the yard; I said a lad there was near the size of the man, but I did not like to identify him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's sister. I was walking with her up George-street, St. Giles'; I was about a yard before my sister; I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the wall as we turned out of George-street into Phoenix-street; he was standing with his back against the wall as I passed him; I took particular notice of him when I passed him, seeing him standing there, so decently dressed, and in such a low place - he had white trousers on then; I saw his face as I passed him, and am certain he is the man; I passed him before my sister - I heard her scream, then turned round, and she said, "He has got my watch;" I knew she had her watch before, for she looked to see if it was right by St. Giles' church; I saw her watch was gone, and instantly followed the prisoner, who ran; I followed him round three streets, without losing sight of him; he got round into the same street again, very near to where he had taken it, but the mob came up so strong I could go no further - I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the person standing at the corner? A. Yes, with your face towards me; I saw your face; any body passing might see it; I ran first, and my sister followed, but we were parted.</p>

No; I said it was in the fourth street; I saw a person lay hold of you, but you got by him; I did not observe any body meet you before you turned the corner.</p>
               <p>MISS HARRIET ORCHARD re-examined. I saw nobody lay hold of him; I was stopped at the third corner, by a man who laid hold of my reticule; it was held for nearly two minutes; my sister was almost out of my sight; she was almost the length of the street from me; I could not see whether any one stopped him, for I did not see him in the third street, except at the beginning of it.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in George-street, St. Giles'. On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner standing against the dead wall, opposite my window - I am certain of his person. I saw these two young ladies come up the street; I saw him make a drive at one of them, but what he took I could not see; she had a reticule in her hand I think; she screamed out, and both of them ran after him: my leg was so bad I could not go out to follow him: a crowd collected directly, and several people pursued. I did not see whether he got any thing away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. Standing at my shop window, looking through the glass; I live at No. 40, within seventeen yards of where you stood; you ran directly up towards Rats' Castle, right up George-street, and the lady after you; George-street and Phoenix-street join each other; my window faces the dead wall where you stood.</p>

            . On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along George-street, and saw the prisoner; I turned round to speak to Fitzgerald, whom I knew - he was going up the court; the prisoner ran down the court; Fitzgerald put his arm out to catch him, but he slipped down just by him, and ran towards a mob of people, who made way for him to pass between them; these two ladies came up - I took them into a shop, went out to find the beadle, and described the man to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the ladies coming up George-street? A. No, coming down Church-street, I think it is called; Fitzgerald caught you in his arms, coming down the passage; you went round, and came down the passage, so that the ladies met you; I went down Broad-street, and lost sight of you by Phoenix-street.</p>

            . I live at No. 33, George-street, St. Giles'. On the 8th of June I was standing by my own door, and heard a cry that a lady had been robbed - I turned round into the adjoining street, and saw a young man running towards me; conceiving him to be the thief I remained quiet till he came up, then caught him in my arms, but he slipped away; this was in Ivy-street, St. Giles' - it leads into George-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when you heard the cry? A. Standing at my own door; I saw the ladies running, and a young man in a blue coat and white trousers running before them; I stopped him; I cannot swear you are the man: I caught hold of him in Ivy-street, which was formerly called Rats' Castle; there was nobody very near him. I did not notice who was in the street; a good many people followed him; when he got from me he ran into George-street, and turned, I believe, to the right.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of June, in George-street, St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>JENKIN STRADLING re-examined. I know the prisoner to be the man; I pointed him out at Bow-street, from among other prisoners; he had changed his dress, but I knew him; I saw Fitzgerald lay hold of him, but I do not know the name of the street it was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of June I was walking down George-street - a man laid hold of me, and said he wanted me, and his brother officer had been insulted in St. Giles'; I said I knew nothing about it: he took me to Bow-street; a gentleman came and looked at me in a little time, and Duke said, "You know what is the matter now?" I said No, and about eight o'clock I was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded till Monday. The first witness came to the House of Correction, with Mr. Beeby, a young gentleman, and another; every body in the yard was told to stand round - the young lady looked round, and said she believed a young man named Anderson was the person; Beeby said, "Put on your hat, and turn round; he did so, and she said she believed he was the person. At my examination on Monday the lady and two or three more witnesses came against me, but none of them swore to me; I was remanded for another week; then Adams and the lady's sister swore I was the person. Now the first witness says she saw me standing at the corner of Phoenix-street, with my head down, that I snatched her watch and ran, and she lost me in turning the third street; the next witness swears she saw me at the corner, holding my head up, that any body might see my face, and when her sister screamed she followed, and in turning the third street she saw a person lay hold of me, and yet the sister did not see that. One witness swears I ran up George-street and the ladies swear I ran down Church-street; I could not run both ways at once. The next witness swears that as I was coming through Ivy-street, the ladies came round and met me, but they say they followed me. God knows I am innocent.</p>

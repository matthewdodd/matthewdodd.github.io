                  </hi> I live at 10, Minerva Terrace, Brixton—on Saturday, 3rd July, I, with my aunt and two other young ladies, took four ponies from Blackheath to go to Shooter's Hill—the prisoner accompanied us on foot as driver—on the road we stopped at an inn and had some lemonade, and the prisoner held the head of my horse—I had in my pocket at the time my aunt's purse, a bunch of keys, a sixpence, a penny, and two pears, and a pair of gloves—when we left the house the prisoner put my dress straight—my pocket was on the right-hand side—we then began to descend the hill—the prisoner was behind—when we passed Herbert's Hospital I saw two or three soldiers—when we got to the stand my aunt asked me for her purse to pay for the ponies—I felt in my pocket, and it was gone—I do not exactly know what there was in the purse, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190108"></xptr>
               <p>I know there were two sovereigns—I am quite sure my pocket was all right when I paid for the refreshment—when I missed the purse my pocket was cut, but my frock was not (<hi rend="italic">pocket produced</hi>.—I could not have torn it like that.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the Army Hospital Corps—on 3rd August I was going along Shooter's Hill Road, and when near Herbert's Hospital four ladies on ponies passed me—one of them was ahead, and three almost together—the prisoner was behind, and I saw him stoop and pick up a leather pocket-book that I saw drop from one of the ladies—I heard money in it—he looked at me and laughed, and then ran on and overtook the horses—I went and reported it to the corporal on duty at the Herbert Hospital.</p>

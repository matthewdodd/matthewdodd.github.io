            . I live in Compton-street. On the 1st of May, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner; she came to my house (which is two doors from Offer's), went along the passage, and opened the yard-door; my wife asked her what she wanted; she said she was taken ill, and wanted to go into the yard, which she did; she afterwards went away; in about ten minutes I saw her come down the street, with this coat - I stopped her with it; she said it was her husband's, who had been drinking at a public-house, and had sent her to fetch it; there was another woman with her - I let the prisoner go; she returned and peeped round the corner, to see if I was looking after her - I went and took her again; she confessed taking the coat, and offered us any thing to make it up, and said she had no husband.</p>

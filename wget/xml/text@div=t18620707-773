Austin gave the prisoner in my charge for uttering a bad two-shilling piece—I asked the prisoner where the two-shilling piece was—he told me the lady had got it—she said, "No, I have not; you have got it in your pocket"—on taking him to the station I saw his hand move to throw it away, and I said, "Hold on, Mr. Austin, the money is gone"—we stopped and picked it up, and I said to the prisoner, "This is the two-shilling piece you have now thrown away"—he made no reply—I searched him at the station, and found on him a half-crown, a shilling, two sixpences, and 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—he gave the name of Charles Smith the night he was taken, and next morning he gave the name of Charles Hughes—he said he came from King-street, Borough.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your candles lighted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop part of your dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen nothing of the prisoners before they were brought in to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any goods in your window? - A. Yes; I went out with the candle, and observed that the glass of the window had been cut with a diamond, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than one pane cut? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any goods in reach of that pane? - A. Yes; the glass was beat in; it was first cut, and afterwards the piece beat in.</p>
               <p>Q. That was your conjecture, from the appearance of it? - A. From the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was taken out? - A. Nothing was taken out; a table-cloth was removed, but not taken away; the corner was drawn out of the window as far as they could draw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did it lay from the pane that was cut? - A. Close by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one end of it was drawn out? - A. Only one end.</p>
               <p>Q. It had not been removed, only the end pulled out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed upon their being brought in? - A. The witness said, he found them cutting the window; and I found, as I have described, that the table-cloth was bloody; upon which, I went into the shop again, and said, the man whose finger was bloody was the man who attempted to take it out; one of them had his finger cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been dark at this time? - A. About an hour, I believe; I recollect both the prisoners, but I don't know which had his finger cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by the prisoners when they were brought in? - A. They protested they had not done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pate. Q. Did you hear the window break? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>LEEMAN CASEBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: On the evening of the 19th of December, I was in Fleet-street, between six and seven; I observed the two prisoners at Mr. Thompson's shop window; I and another officer. Dean, were taking a walk up Fleet-street; I saw the prisoner Pate with his face to the window, as if his hands were at work.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by, as if his hands were at work? - A. He was stopping at the window, and his right-hand moving, as if at work: Francis stood with his back to the window; they stood close to one another; I and Dean went up and took hold of them; I took Pate, and gave up Francis to Dean; I saw Pate put something in his right-hand pocket; when I was taking him into the shop I searched his right coat pocket; when I got him into the shop, I found this book and an instrument that broke the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You took these two instruments out of Pate's right-hand pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That does not appear to contain any diamond? - A. No; it was done at the corner of the window; this table-cloth was out at the corner of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the window was? - A. A piece was taken out of the lower part of the pane.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been taken out? - A. The glass had been starred with an instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of the glass appear to be cut? - A. The piece was broke out; it did not appear to be cut; this table-cloth had the corner of it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much hung out? - A. Not much; the table-cloth was bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Which end was bloody? - A. The end that was out: I looked at Pate's left-hand, and one of his left fingers were cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130014"></xptr>Q. Was it a fresh cut, and bleeding at that time? - A. Yes; it was bleeding; I looked at it in the shop; we took the prisoners to the Compter; I found nothing on Francis relating to this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Francis stood close to him? - A. Yes; with his back to him; looking back in the street; we observed them, and passed them before we took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe either of them doing any thing before this time? - A. Pate was stooping down, doing something to the glass, and we returned and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned? - A. Not a minute.</p>


               <p>Q. Was the glass broke from where the putty is put in? - A. It was broke out from the putty; the hole was big enough to put a hand in.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see the prisoner pull the table-cloth? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Pate. Q. Can you take your oath that my finger was cut? - A. Yes; a finger on his left-hand; I cannot say whether it was his fore finger or middle finger.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On Saturday the 19th of December, a little after six o'clock, I was going up Fleet-street, with Caseby, the other officer; I observed the two prisoners standing at Mr. Thompson's shop window; Pate was standing with his face towards the window, and Francis with his face towards the street, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Francis to Pate? - A. They were close together, touching each other; we passed them; I observed to Caseby, I thought they were breaking the window; and we immediately returned again, and took them into custody: Francis had this knife open, in his right-hand; we took them into Mr. Thompson's shop, and told him we suspected they had been breaking his window; Mr. Thompson went out and looked, and said, the window had been broke, and a piece of a tablecloth was hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe the table-cloth out before you went into the shop? - A. No; I searched him afterwards, and found some other things about him, some knives.</p>

            Did you observe afterwards how the cloth was? - A. No; I kept in the shop with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of Caseby? - A. I believe Caseby went out with him; I do not recollect that particularly.</p>
               <p>Francis. He says I had that knife open; when he took me, it was in my pocket. - A. It was open when I took him; he was endeavouring to shut it, to put it in his pocket; it was half shut and half open; I saw it open as he stood by the window.</p>
               <p>Pate's defence. I never saw Francis in my life, before I was taken up; I was looking, to buy a pair of stockings; this gentleman came and took me into custody; I have worked at a blacksmith's shop.</p>
               <p>Francis's defence. I never saw Pate before with my eyes.</p>

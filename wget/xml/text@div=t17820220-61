            ; he asked him where Caston lived, he said over the water; the next day he was examined again; this sugar is mine, I am clear of it; it was intended to be lumped, but not clearing so soon as was expected, I bid the boiler give it another clay, and put it in the stove, and he said, suppose we put it in with the head on; the heads are generally cut off, being perfectly brown, and full of syrup; I have been nineteen years a sugar-baker, and verily believe such a thing was never done before, as goods of this kind being put into the stove with the heads on, (the sugar produced in court had the heads on) I have no doubt the sugar was stolen; we got a constable and searched his dwelling, we found none of those things we expected, but we found this carpenter's mallot, which is just such a thing as we use in the sugar-house to knock the heads off, and this would bruise it small, it is all over sugar; I have missed five hundred weight at one time, and six hundred weight at another, during the time of this Caston Haseman being the <rs id="t17820220-61-deflabel292" type="occupation">miller</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17820220-61-defend656 t17820220-61-deflabel292"></join>, and the custody of this sugar was in the hands of Haseman, he had the care of the cutting mill, he has the key and none else, nobody could get in but those who had the key; the door was locked that night, the goods were lost on the Friday morning, the 1st of February; on Thursday night, about eight, I went to see all the doors fast, this in particular, I found the folding doors fast, I searched the mill over and found no key, this is the mallet.</p>
               <p>Was the window fast? - I don't know; the door opens into the mill, and the mill is always open to the dwelling, but not to the street, they cannot go from the street; the mill window is common sash, the other are iron-barred, the cutting-room window is not barred.</p>
               <p>What day's work was this sugar? - From a day's work of pieces, the Friday and Monday.</p>
               <p>What day was it cast? - Boiled a great while before these goods were taken from the stove to be ground on Thursday night, our process takes six weeks going through; I was angry about his not doing what I expected on Saturday evening, at tea time the maid came, and said Caston wants to speak to you, he said he should be glad I would give him his wages, there were sixteen pounds in my hands, I said I could not give him his wages, I said your warning will be on Thursday, I cannot spare you before; he fell into the most violent agitation I ever saw a man in my life, cried out Oh Lord, what shall I do, what shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200079"></xptr> I do; he said a friend of his was going over to Germany, and he should have a place there, if he went, I made him an offer to stay with me; he wanted to go to Bremen, I said I could not spare him, and then he fell into a more violent agitation than ever I saw, it was heard by all in the house; on Monday morning I went into the mill and found him got remarkably forward, he asked to go when he had finished the next hogshead; I said, is not the ship gone? he said no; there was about an hour and an half's time between my accounting for this mystery, and the time of his intending to have gone off; the window shutters were all close, and no outward marks of their being forced; I suppose my house to be near half a mile from Bishopsgate church, Seyfert left me about Midsummer day, we parted friends, I had told him, at the time of paying his wages, if he was short of money, I should not mind lending him twenty or thirty pounds, little suspecting what I heard afterwards of him.</p>
               <p>When did you discover the loss of your sugar? - Between ten and eleven at night; from the circumstance of being taken out of the stove, and cut as this was, on the Friday morning, the 1st of February, I understood it was lost; Saifert was apprehended the Monday morning following, two days had intervened.</p>
               <p>It is clear the sugar was not carried to Seyfert's house on the first? - He was discovered on the first; I entrust nobody but myself to sell the sugars, for a twelve month past I have been my own clerk; the room this sugar was deposited in was in the custody altogether of Caston Haseman, who had the key.</p>
               <p>Whether you did not collect from Prosser and the rest, that Caston Haseman was the name by which it was discovered? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It was the declaration of Saifert that led to the discovery of Haseman? - The man going to gaol, said he met a man that spoke to him, according to Prosser's account to me.</p>
               <p>Are these sugars now in a saleable state? - No, by no means, they must be ground in a mill, this instrument will do it as well in time.</p>

               <p>I am a sugar refiner, I don't know when it was taken out of the stove; I boil for Mr. Glover, it was taken out on Thursday in the afternoon; I am almost sure that is the sugar.</p>

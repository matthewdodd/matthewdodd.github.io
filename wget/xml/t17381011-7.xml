               <p>The Councel for the Prosecution having open'd the Indictment, it was objected on the other Side, that the Act required, Notice should be given, that the Statute was awarded and issued; every one knowing there is a material Difference between - awarded and issued; the one signifying, the Thing order'd to be done, the other, the Thing done: Whereas in the Indictment, they had only made use of the Word, awarded. It was objected further, that the Act says, the Bankrupt shall surrender to the Commissioners, or the major Part of them; instead of which, in one of their Notices, they spun out their Directions for the Prisoner to surrender to all the five Commissioners, leaving out the Words, - or the major Part of them. And in the other Notice they say he must surrender to 3 of them, without mentioning any of the rest. It was objected likewise, that there should have been an Averment in the Indictment, that the Commissioners did sit, and that those Commissioners should have been nam'd. whereas they were not nam'd in their Notice, and they had only set forth that he was required to surrender to the Commissioners at Guildhall; which might as well be understood of the Commissioners of Sewers, or of the Lieutenancy for they sit at the same Place. <rs id="t17381011-7-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

When the lads went to do that, he seemed to object and ran into the street without his hat; he was brought back again by the lads and the constable; I then told them to examine his pockets, and he did begin, and pulled out the leg of a chicken in a bit of paper that he had; the constable observed that as he was come back he had better be taken into the room and examined; and then, I believe, he found some tea spoons on him; I was not present. The spoons, I have reason to believe, are mine; they have my name on them.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the constable? - Yes. I was officer of the night. and I went out to see that the watchman were all on their duty, and I see the prisoner, and I followed him to Mr. Wiltshire's house, and Mr. Wiltshire thought proper to send him home, but I thought it proper, it being my duty as a constable, to search him, which I did, and found this property on him; he had two pair of breeches on, and between the skin and his under breeches I found this property wrapped up, three tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can only believe them to be mine; I cannot swear to them; I have one to answer the mark on one of them, A. W. I had three spoons missing that day, and this man attended a large company of forty or fifty who were at tea. He is a man that gets his bread by waiting from house to house, by the day; he waited at my house on that day. I cannot swear to the marks because they are not marked with my name; there were three missing when we counted the spoons, which we did the first opportunity after we found this; we might have counted them a week before; we do not count the tea spoons every day, but we do the table spoons. This napkin in that they are wrap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160070"></xptr>ped up in I cannot swear to; we had a great many napkins about that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent of it. About half past eight o'clock I was going to the vault, through the yard, as I was going between some empty bottles that were there; I seeing a parcel lay of something as if white paper, I came back again and picked it up, and thought it might have been something that some gentleman might have dropped, and I picked it up and put it into my pocket, I did not know what was in it; there was nobdoy see me pick it up at all. I was as willing to be searched as any one in the place.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character, except being guilty of getting a cup of liquor too much.</p>

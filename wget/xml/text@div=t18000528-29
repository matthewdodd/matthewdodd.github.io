I went to Bow-street, I was advised to get a constable, and be upon the watch; on the morning of the 3d, Thursday, about the same time, or rather before, I perceived Standen coming; I saw Treadway, the constable, waiting, he suffered her to get into my house, he waited a few minutes; he was then let in by the servant boy, and detected Standen going down into the kitchen, I had never seen her before; he brought her up stairs, searched her, and found in her possession several duplicates, twenty-two, I believe; he took particular notice of one of the duplicates, of a curtain, which she had pawned for seventeen shillings; he then told her she must go along with him; she told him, if he would walk with her into the adjoining room, he would find something; they went into the adjoining room together, I did not go with them; and when the constable came out, he said she had acknowledged.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pitt, Surgeon. The Misfortune happen'd on Tuesday or Wednesday the beginning of July. I was sent for immediately, and found the Deceased wounded in the Back, and a large Blood Vessel belonging to the Kidneys being cut, there was a great Effusion of Blood; but upon dressing him, it stopp'd. I attended him 3 Times, and then he was so well, that I order'd him to come to my House to be dressed for the future; and during that Time, he grew so well, that he went out of Town to his own Place, (to Chiswick) I was apprehensive he would go to work too soon, therefore I cautioned him against it, and advised him to live regularly, and not to use any Exercise. The Week following, I was obliged to go out of Town, but the Deceased was then in so good a Way, that I told him in 2 or 3 Dressings he would be well. When I came Home again, I heard he had been abroad with some Fidlers, had got drunk, that there had been a Flux of Blood, and that he was in a Fever, which I believe was the Occasion of his Death. The Monday before I took him to be quite out of Danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Effusion of Blood any Cause of his Death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitt. No, for we lost no Blood from the Time of dressing him first, till he was guilty of this Irregularity.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the Fever have occasioned his Death without this Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitt. I cannot take upon me to say the Wound occasioned his Death, his Fever was very violent.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business was the Prisoner?</p>

We found the Net was not to be recover'd; so as we were returning, the Father said to me, Come don't mind the Net, - Shall we have a Pint of Beer? I said, Aye, with all my Heart; but the Son said, - you are Drunk enough already, and bid the People not bring any more. Upon that, the Prisoner catch'd up a Knife, and accidentally dash'd it on the Table, and it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070009"></xptr> bounc'd against his Son's Side: The Prisoner at the same time cry'd, - Must I be rul'd by my Children, and be afraid of having a Pint of Beer!</p>

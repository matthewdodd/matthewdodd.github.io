A little before 5 o'clock, on the morning of 27th Jan., I was on duty in Cavendish Street, New North Road—I noticed the side door of No. 13, Brudenel Place, partly open; I went in, and looked round the yard; I then came out, and waited till I got assistance—I then went in again, and got over the walls, and, as I was getting over the wall from No. 12 to No. 11, I saw three men getting over the wall from No. 11 to No. 10—I called out, "Stop thief!" and they were taken by two constables—I did not see them taken—I was not near enough to see who they were—I saw the prisoners in custody in about a minute—I found a pair of boots under the kitchen window of No. 11; I found no owner for them—I also found a single boot in the garden at the end of No. 11; that was about six or eight yards from where I had seen them getting over the wall—when I saw Taverner in custody, I asked him if he knew any thing about the single boot; he said, "Yes, it is mine"—he had no boots on at that time; it was at the station I saw him.</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" about 5 o'clock on the morning of 27th Jan., near Brudenel Place—I got over the wall into the back yard, and found Taverner in a bye garden, that does not belong to any house, about ten or twelve yards from Mr. Brooks' house—he had to get over several walls to get to that place; he must have come across the garden of No. 10; he was hid in a dark place—I turned my lamp on when I got over the wall, and saw him screwed up, with this cloak on his left arm—I took him into custody, and took the cloak from him; it has been identified by the prosecutor.</p>

I went to Brudenel Place about 5 o'clock on 27th Jan.—I got over a wall there, and found Hillier just over the wall at the rear of No. 3, Brudenel Place, curled up in a corner, about three yards from where Taverner was found—I had a struggle with Hillier before I secured him—I handed him over to Sergeant Higgins—I found a pair of girl's boots in the garden of No. 2, Brudenel Place—I afterwards went into the back garden of No. 11, and there found a pair of goloshes; I also found a single boot—I took them to the station and paired it with one that one of the other witnesses produced; it was the fellow to it—when I took Hillier he had boots on—I asked if the boot belonged to them, and Taverner said, "Yes, it belongs to me; give them to me and I will pat them on,"and he did so—I believe the boots Hillier had on were his own.</p>

I am a clerk, living at No. 11, Brudenel Place—I was called up about half-past 5 o'clock on this morning—I found the back kitchen window wide open—I waited till one of the constables came in, when we searched the house, and I found that a chest of drawers in the front kitchen had been entirely turned out, and a lot of clothing about the kitchen—I found a lot of clothes lying in the garden, outside the back kitchen window—I had fastened that window the night before, previous to going to bed, about 9, or between 9 and 10, o'clock; I am pretty well certain it was after 9 o'clock—I usually fasten it every evening about that time, or see it safe—these things belong to me; this cloak is one of my daughters'; these boots belong to one of my children; these are my daughter's goloshes, and these are my children's capes and cloaks; these trousers belong to one of my boys—these boots are one of my little girls'; these are my own boots, they were on the drawers.</p>

I am a cow-keeper, and live in Old Boswell-court—the prisoner was in my service, and had to go round with milk, and to receive money—I enter in a book an account of what he does not receive, and when he received money, either I or my wife took the account of him, and marked it off in the book—I supply Mrs. Duncan with milk—I did not receive any money on her account, from the 17th of March to the 23rd—I have the book here—I have entries of milk to Duncan, on the 22nd and 23rd of March, but I did not receive any money on either of those days.</p>

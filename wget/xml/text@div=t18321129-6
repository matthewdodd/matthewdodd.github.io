On Monday, the 19th of November, I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, and left nobody at home; it is a small house - I shut and bolted the shutters; they are outer shutters: the window was down, and the street door locked - I came back between seven and eight o'clock, found the street door wide open, the kitchen window shutters open, and the window broken; the kitchen is on the ground floor; I left the window fastened - I found the shutters broken, and forced open; there was a piece of iron on the cill of the window, which was not there when I went out - on going up stairs, I found my father's box, which contained all the articles stated in the indictment, and three sovereigns, gone; it was quite safe when I went out: it is a seaman's chest, and a dark green colour - I know the prisoner; he had been at our house with a woman on the Sunday: he wanted something to drink - the public-house was not open, it being church time: my father stood at the door, and he came into our house and sat down nearly two hours, till church was over - I knew him by sight, but never associated with him; they went away together - I had seen the piece of iron in the prisoner's possession about half-past nine o'clock on the Monday morning before the robbery; he was in the court where we live - the woman he lived with had words with him, and he lifted up this iron, and was going to strike her; she had come to see a person opposite our house: I saw but one woman with him then - it was the same iron.</p>

               <p>DANIEL HORRAGAN. I am a labourer. My daughter came and told me what had happened; I suspected the prisoner, and gave information to the Police, and he was taken soon after - the trunk was brought to the station-house, about three quarters of an hour after we missed it; it had then been rifled of every thing almost, except three sovereigns, which were in a till in it, in a black pocket-book, which might not be seen in the dark - on the Sunday, the prisoner had been fighting in Golden-lane, with another man; after the fight was over, he met his father-in-law, whom I knew, and they came to my house, but I never drank with him before.</p>

About half-past six or a quarter to seven o'clock on the Monday evening in question, I saw the prisoner at my house, in company with the woman he lives with, and her father and child - they drank nothing at my house; they stopped there about half an hour, and said they had been drinking down at the Goat; they went away nearly together - I went and placed myself in a small parlour to watch them, and saw them leave the tap-room, and go out at the back door, which leads into Pigeon-court; after the prosecutor's daughter gave an alarm, I went and found the piece of iron laying on the cill; the prisoner might have had it in my house, and I not see it - the shutter appeared to have been broken open with that iron; I have not a doubt of it - I gave it to the Policeman.</p>

On the Monday night I was going to fetch my child home from Macclesfield-street; I came down Brick-lane, and in Golden-lane saw a person carying a box, which I believe to be the one produced - he was not above twenty yards from Pigeon-court; I had heard a noise in Pigeon-court, like the scraping of something against the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290008"></xptr>wall, and I made way for the person with the box - he was dressed in a white flannel jacket, and a leather apron; he came out of Benbow-rents - he had something which seemed like a sort of great coat on his shoulder under the box; forming a kind of pad - the prisoner is the man who was carrying the box; I have seen him off and on for the last eight or nine months, and speak positively to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man was not broght forward till the second examination. Witness. I did not know any thing was wrong at the time - I put my child out to nurse, being a widower, and fetch it home every evening; I know nothing of the prosecutor's family.</p>

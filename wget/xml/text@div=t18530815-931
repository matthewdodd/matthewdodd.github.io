                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Ratcliff; I am a sailor. On 6th July, about 11 o'clock in—the evening I was at the Cock and Neptune public house, I saw the prisoner there when I was coming out of the house—I do not know whether some of the company had a quarrel about a watch—I had only just come on shore—I was only drinking with my shipmates—I saw the prisoner in the room—I went out of the public house—I and my shipmates were going on board—I had no dispute with the prisoner, I never saw the man in my life—I was standing at the Cock and Neptune door, and he came and took me by the shoulder and said, "Are you an Englishman?"—I said, "Yes, I am nothing else"—he took hold of me with his teeth—he pulled me out in the middle of the street—I said to him, You are coming too far a head"—I seized him, and while we were together he put his head against my belly, and I felt a knife go into my thigh.</p>

               <p>—I had just come on shore—I was not, to my recollection, d——g the foreigners, and saying they might all go to hell—I made use of no words, nor did the prisoner tell me I had much better go to bed and go to sleep—I did not tell him he might go to hell too; I am quite sure about that—I had two or three glasses of half and half, I had no spirits, the prisoner had a straw hat—I did not touch him—I got hold of him by the back of the neck when he took me by the two shoulders; I was in the act of striking him when I was held back by another person—the prisoner's head was down against my belly—I do not know whether he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. Up to 24th June last, I kept a private boarding school at Blackheath—the prisoner was in my service; I am not certain as to the time, but, I believe eight or ten months—so far as I remember he left in August last—during the time he was in my service I missed a great many things; silver spoons, a gold watch, and other things—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my son's watch—as my son has another gold watch we cannot say precisely whether it was missed while the prisoner was in our service, because my son did not look in his drawer for it very often—this silver gilt pencil-case is my property—I cannot say as to this dessert-fork, nor the silver dinner-fork—these books are all my property—as far as I can remember, at half-past 7 o'clock on Thursday evening, between three and four weeks ago, my great plaid, my son's umbrella, and my coat were in the hall—that was after the prisoner had left my service—there were also missed two large silver spoons and some other articles—this scarf is mine—the umbrella is my son's—the pawnbroker returned me my coat—as far as I can remember, I went to the prisoner after he was apprehended and advised him to make a full confession; I thought it was his duty to do so—afterwards, when he was coming down from the police-court he asked me to go and speak with him—he said, "Well, there is no use in my denying now; I am guilty"—he said there were some tickets in his portmanteau; he said he had been deceived by a poor woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker—on 2d May this year, the prisoner came to our shop, with, I believe, a female—he pledged fourteen handkerchiefs, and a silver teaspoon—part of the handkerchiefs belong to the prosecutor; the other part, and the spoon, do not—the prisoner came in the name of "John Francois"—the whole of these articles were pawned by a female—that was the female who came with him on one occasion—there were on 1st July, a shirt, two waistcoats, and a pair of drawers—on 3d July, two pairs of drawers, and a shirt; 13th, calico, and a shirt; 17th August, two shirts, and some silver dessert spoons; 20th August, a coat, sheet, and three shirts—that is the coat that I gave up to the prosecutor—on 3d September, a shirt, two pairs of drawers, a tablecloth, and a fork: 6th September, a Bible; 7th September, four books—those are the books spoken to by the prosecutor—on 12th September, a table-cloth, and several smaller articles: 14th June, 1860, this scarf—I likewise produce some articles of plate, a table-spoon and fork, on 18th May: 20th June, a table-spoon, dessert-spoon, and fork: 5th July, a dessert-spoon: 10th Sep<lb></lb>tember, a pin: 12th September, a pen-holder, and two pencil-cases; and 6th September, a gold watch, the one that has been spoken to.</p>

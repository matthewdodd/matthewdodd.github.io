                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 113.) On Saturday night, the 19th of March, about nine o'clock, I was in the Richmond-road, in the parish of St. Mary Abbot, Kensington, near the public-house—I saw the prisoner and another coming in the direction from Mr. Hutchins' potato bed, each with a sack on his head—I stopped the prisoner and felt his sack—I asked what he had got, he said potatoes—I asked where he got them, he said from Mr. Hutchins' potato heap—I took them from him and took him into custody—the other man escaped—they weighed eighty-four pounds.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Samuel Hutchins, who has a potato ground, about a quarter of a mile from the Richmond-road There is a large potato bed there—I have compared the potatoes found in the sack the prisoner had, with those on the heap, and am satisfied they are the same sort, and the pit had been newly opened—the potatoes are called the "long keepers" in Somerset—the seed was sent from a gentle<lb></lb>man, and these were the first grown from it—the pit bad evidently not been opened many hours—there were three sacks taken from it a few days before—we have lost seven or eight tons during the winter—I am quite certain they are part of the same potatoes—the prisoner had no business in the fields.</p>

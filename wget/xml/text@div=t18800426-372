                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On Saturday morning, 10th April, from information I received I went in search of Middleton—I found him outside the Mitre public-house, at Sudbury—I said to him "How do you account for putting that hay and straw up into Howe's cart last night?"—he said that he sold him a quarter of a load for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and gave him a truss of straw for halfpence—I took him to the station—he said that Mr. Smeeton, his master, gave him authority; Mr. Smeeton was present and denied it—I then took him into custody—on the same evening I saw Howe at Carlton Road, Paddington—I told him that he was at Harrow late last night, that Middleton was in custody for stealing hay and straw, and said "How do you account for receiving that hay and straw from him?"—he said "I bought half a load of him and paid him at the rate of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load"—I said "What about the straw?"—he said "I know nothing about that"—I told him he must consider himself in custody, and took him to Kilburn Station—I then went with Cluny, the policeman, to his premises, and found three crusses of meadow hay in a shed—I told him afterwards that I had found and he said "That is part of the hay that I received"—I produce a piece of rope which I found attached to one of the trusses that I found on</p>

               <p>Howe's promises—I have compared that with some other cord that was on the rick cloth and it corresponded—on the way from Kilburn to Harrow Howe asked me what Middleton had said about it—I said "He told me he had sold you some hay and straw"—he said "That is the straw that is under the horse now."</p>

                  </hi>. On 9th April I was coming from Harrow past Mr. Smeeton's rick, and saw Middleton with three more; one of them was his son—one of them was going up a ladder, and I saw one of them take a bundle of thatch straw, which was put on a cart about 10 yards from the rick—Middleton was standing by the cart—he came and asked me if my name was Walter Seymour—I said "No, it is me"—I knew him; I did not know whether he knew me—he asked what I wanted—I told him I wished to see "Walter Seymour—he said "I think it will rain"—I said "I think it will"—I then went into the road—the cast went towards London—two of the men went towards London with it, and two went towards Harrow—Howe was leading the cart—I did not know him before—I saw him again on the Wednesday following at Edgware, in Court—I did not recognise him then; I speak to him to the best of me recollection; I don't swear positively to him—there was only one man on the load; the load was hay and straw—there was half a load of hay and four or five bundles of thatch straw.</p>

                  </hi>. Howe is my uncle—I was living with him for about three weeks—on the morning of 0th April he said to me that he was going up to London to get in some debts that were owing to him, and then to Harrow for half a load of hay that he had bought—I went with him to Hanrow and went to Middleton's house—we got there about 6 in the evening; ho was not at home; he was sent for and came there—Hewe said to him "I have come for the half load of hay, but I have not got the money I. will pay you some of it and the rest next-week"—Middleton said "That will do if you will pay me on Tuesday"—about 8 o'clock we went to the rick—I stopped in the cart and got it ready to put the hay on—we loaded it with 18 trusses and a bundle of thatch—when we had loaded two trusses young Middleton said "Father, here comes Mr. Sweeton; I can hear his voice"—Middleton said "It does not matter who comes, my boy, I have got the privilege of selling it"—this loading took about three-quarters of an hour—Mr. Smeeton did not come.</p>

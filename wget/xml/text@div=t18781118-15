                  <hi rend="italic">Defended</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES JOHN LISSON</hi>. I am a diamond merchant and live at 46, Beresford Road, Highbury—on 25th September I left the City about 7 o'clock in the evening, I calle 4 at the Bank Stores refreshment rooms, in Throg<lb></lb>morton Street, opposite the Stock Exchange—I was in there about half an hour—I left about 7 and went from the Broad Street station to Canonbury, which is about four minutes' walk from my house—I had in my possession some loose diamonds, a box with seven diamond rings, a little box with a pearl pin in my left-hand pocket; in my right pocket I had some sapphires and pearls, and in a back pocket in my trousers a box with diamond rings—in my waistcoat pocket I had a watch and chain, and another very fine watch worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also four half-sovereigns, a watch-glass, three keys, a pearl measure, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the value of the property of which I was robbed was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went straight home from the station, I met nobody; when I was within three or four doors of my house somebody came behind me and put his hands over my eyes, I thought at first it was a joke, but as they did not take the hands away, I began to struggle—at that moment the hands came off me, and a man came in front of me; that man was the prisoner; he tried to put his hand in the breast of my overcoat, and seeing what danger I was in, I tried to button my coat—I began to scream, but I was choked and could only bring out "Oh"—I then got a knock in the back and fell senseless—when I recovered I saw nobody; I was lying on the ground I dare say two or three minutes, when I got up I found my property gone, not all of it, some was left in my other pockets—I got up and went home and told my wife, and we took a hansom and went to the station and gave information—two or three weeks afterwards I saw the prisoner at Highbury Police-station, he was with six or seven people—I identified him and have no doubt about him—I was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was in the Bank Stores about half an hour—I showed some diamonds there—there were about 10 or 15 people there—I did not see the prisoner there or at Broad Street station—the man had his hands over my eyes half a minute; the whole affair was not more than two minutes—I don't think the policeman was standing near me when I identified the pri<lb></lb>soner at the police-station; there was a woman there—she had not made any communication to me—I am not in the habit of showing my diamonds in public-houses—in certain refreshment-rooms I show them where gentlemen come in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 442). On 13th of October between 12 and I a.m. I was on duty in Cross Street, Islington, and heard some conver<lb></lb>sation between some women, in consequence of which I communicated with a woman named Mc. Gavan, and went to the prisoner's residence that same morning with a sergeant—I saw the prisoner there, and took him to the station, and charged him with this offence—the female made a statement there in his presence—she was there at my request—I told the prisoner we should detain him for being concerned with two other men not in custody in assaulting a gentleman in Canonbury, and stealing a quantity of diamonds and jewellery—the female said in his presence that he was the man that went behind the prosecutor, and that he held him and took the diamonds from his pocket, and there were two more men in company with him—she said the diamonds were sold for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the prisoner having 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his share, and that he had furnished the two rooms where he was living with the pro<lb></lb>ceeds</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180015"></xptr>
               <p>of the robbery—she said that they left the prosecutor insensible on the footpath; that they had followed him from the City—she also said "If you go to the house you will find both rooms all nicely furnished with the pro<lb></lb>ceeds of the robbery"—I went there and found it correct—the prisoner made no reply to what the female said; he merely smiled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The woman is not here that I am aware of—I heard that she and the prisoner had had a quarrel, and that he had been taken to the station on the 12th, but she was not charged—I have not heard that the whole of the furniture was sold for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was removed from the house the same day he was remanded—I don't know where the woman is—I have searched everywhere, and cannot find her—she did not appear at the police-court—I have not seen her since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). The prisoner is the man who was in front of me—I had never seen him before—it was a dark night—there was a gas lamp about four houses off; that would be about twice as wide as this Court—it was light enough for me to see distinctly—I looked the pri<lb></lb>soner in the face when he wanted to rob me, which made a great impression on me—it all happened in a minute, and in that minute I had a view of the man—he was dressed in a brownish coat, but I did not look at that—I looked particularly on the face—I noticed the moustache; there was nothing else about the face that I noticed—I don't remember anybody following me, but I heard somebody coming behind me before the hands were put on my eyes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to George and Robert Emery, of No. 43, Farringdon-street. On 5th May, I saw the prisoner sitting at my counter—a communication was made to me by another shopman, and I observed the prisoner picking up 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the floor; a lady sitting by picked it up for her—I then went round and saw something bulging from the pri<lb></lb>soner's right arm; I lifted up her shawl, and found this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I turned her round, and showed it to a customer sitting there, Mrs. Leonard—the prisoner said the shopman had given it her, and that she would make it all right with me; she wanted to go to the end of the shop—I called a policeman, and gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Messrs. Emery's shop, and saw the prisoner there—she dropped a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she was a few minutes picking it up, and I asked her if I should pick it up for her—she said, "Yes"—I did so, and she thanked me—I afterwards saw the last witness turn her round to me; he then pulled her shawl aside, and said, "Do you see that this lady has a shawl under her arm?"—I said, "Yes;" and she dropped the shawl at my feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shopman, in Messrs. Emery's employ. I saw the prisoner come in on 5th May; she asked for some print, to match a pattern that she had—the young man who sells the prints was down stairs, and I asked her in the mean time if I should show her anything in the way of dresses, or shawls—she said, "I will look at some shawls"—I took her to the shawl room; she said she wanted a black square shawl—I showed her several common ones, but they would not do at all; I showed her some scarf shawls, but they were too expensive—she asked me to open one, and when I was in the act of doing so I saw her putting something under her arm—in consequence of that, I made a communication to the first witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). I had occasion to go to the shop of my pro<lb></lb>secutor for a few articles I was in want of; the young man who was in the habit of serving me was not there; I waited some minutes, when another young man came, and asked me to go up stairs with him, and look at some shawls, which I did; I told him I was not in want of one at present, as I had not sufficient money with me to purchase one, and I did not go there with the intention of buying one; he kept me there up stairs for about twenty minutes, and would not let me down; he knew me by living on the opposite side of the street; I told him I would acquaint the man in the shop of his behaviour, for his conduct was disgraceful; he begged me not to say anything, and with that he gave me the shawl now produced; I then came down stairs and bought some print; I had been down some time when the shopman came and asked me what I had under my arm; I told him it was a shawl, and said the young man up stairs gave it me; on his being asked if such was the case, he denied it; I was then taken into custody, and explained how I came by the shawl; I have had to work very hard for my living, and this is the first time I have ever been accused of dishonesty; I trust that you will be led to see that I am innocent of what I am now accused.</p>

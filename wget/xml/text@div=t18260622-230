            . I am a pastry-cook. The prisoner came to my bake-house, and asked me to purchase four tins; I bade him 4s. for two; he went away, came back, and said I might have them for 4s. 6d., which I gave him; he said he had made them for a man, and they were too wide for his oven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor said he was going to take a bake-house, and asked if I could get tins; I asked 1s. 6d. each for them - we agreed for 8s. 6d. for the six; I went to Mr. Smith's, and bought the six plates, which his porter took to the prosecutor's shop - I took four away one morning, as he said, "I don't want these - you may take them when you please" - and he gave me a fortnight to do them.</p>

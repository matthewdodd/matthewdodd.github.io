Morell is the landlord, but did not live in the house - it is let out in tenements - my father had two rooms on the third floor. On the 12th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting at work in my mother's front room - my mother went out on the landing-place, and called out, "Caroline! Stop thief!" I ran out of the room, and saw the prisoner running down on the second floor landing - I ran after her; my mother was on the top landing, the prisoner could hear her call. I pursued, calling Stop thief! the street-door was on a spring - she opened it, and it banged too again of itself. I opened it, and saw her running in the street, and pursued, calling Stop thief! and only lost sight of her in turning the corner down Union-street - she was not out of my sight for a moment, and was still running. I saw her turn into Wells-street, caught sight of her again immediately, and saw her come down two or three steps from a leather cutter's shop in Wells-street. I caught her at the corner of Mortimer-street, and asked what she had taken from No. 20, Great Titchfield-street; she said she knew nothing of me, and if I thought she had taken any thing, I might search her. I wanted her to go back, and while I was talking to her, Mrs. Graves came up, and wished her to go back; she went within a door of our house; a woman came up, and said in her presence that my things were thrown into a leather cutter's shop, and the apprentice came up - I left her with Graves, and went to the shop, and Mrs. Bruce gave me my things; it was a puce silk dress, a poplin skirt, and a shawl; which I knew; I had seen them that morning, in my box - they all belonged to me. I had made the silk dress for a lady; it was in my care. The box was in a back room, on the same floor, as we were sitting - the door was not locked. They are worth 6 l. altogether. When I came from Bruce's I saw the prisoner at the corner of Monmouth-street, and followed her a long way; the street keeper and constable came up, and took her. The house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone.</p>

            . I am the last witness's mother. On the 12th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner on the same landing place as me; there is no floor higher than ours - she must have been to our room: there are only two rooms on that floor. I asked twice whom she wanted; she made no answer: I asked her a third time, and she said she wanted a person, but I do not recollect the name she mentioned; I asked what she had got under her arm; she ran down stairs as fast as she could - I called my daughter, who ran down after her: I called "Stop thief! stop that woman." Graves lodges on the second floor; he ran also, and I followed him. I saw Mrs. Taylor, (who lives on the first floor,) with the body of my daughter's gown.</p>

            . I was in Wells-street, between three and four o'clock, on this afternoon, and saw a woman running very fast up the steps of a leather cutter's door, and pull a bundle from under her arm, under her shawl, and throw it into the passage: it was loose, not tied up - one of the things appeared green; she ran down the steps, and down Wells-street. I stood at the shop, and saw some things picked up in Bruce's passage, in about two minutes; it was the same things as the woman had thrown down. I saw the prisoner afterwards in the prosecutrix's custody, and am sure she is the woman.</p>

            . I live in Titchfield-street, with Mr. Sherrin, in the same house as Clarke. On the afternoon of the 12th of November, between three and four o'clock, I was in the second floor back room, somebody rang the bell - I went down, and found the door open; the prisoner was in the passage, pretending to wipe her feet: I am sure of her person - she passed me, and went up three pairs of stairs. I went into my room, and in ten minutes I heard Mrs. Clarke call out - I went out, and caught a glimpse of the prisoner's shawl as she passed the staircase window; she had a blue shawl on. I went out, and saw her turn the corner of Union-street and Wells-street, and saw her taken by Miss Clarke and Mr. Graves. I am certain of her; we got her round into Titchfield-street: a man came up, and said that was not the woman; I said I was sure it was - he said, "It is not, let her go;" she was not let go.</p>

On the 12th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief! in the street; I hastened through the shop, and on opening the shop door, in the passage I saw a puce dress, a plaid skirt, and a shawl. I gave the same things to Miss Clarke in a quarter of an hour.</p>

I saw the prisoner in custody afterwards; she was dressed the same as the person I saw. I went down stairs directly, and picked up the body of the plaid dress behind the street door, and gave it to Mrs. Clarke.</p>

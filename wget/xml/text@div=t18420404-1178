On the 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March about half-past one o'clock, I was in Highbury-grove, which is about a mile and a half from Mr. Boulton's shop—I saw the two prisoners in Mr Boulton's cart—Coe was driving—when he got about half-way down the grove, he pulled the horse up into a dead stop, banded the reins over to Ladd, put his left leg over the seat on which he was sitting, and I saw him moving some meat in the cart—he then took the reins again and drove to the bottom of the grove—Ladd there got out of the cart—Coe put a tray of meat out of the cart, and gave it to Ladd, who went away across Canon. bury-fields—I followed him some distance, and asked him whether he had not come from Highbury—he said "No," at first, and then recollected</p>

On the 19th of March I employed the policeman to watch—I knew Ladd by sight, by being about Islington for some time, but not at all connected with my business—it was Coe's business to go out for orders, return, give me an account of them, have them entered in the book, and go out with them—he gave me no orders on the 19th of March for a neck of mutton—he weighed his orders, put them into his cart, and started with it—he had no business in the direction of Highbury-value—Sunnex came and made some disclosure to me—after that I saw Coe—I know a beer-house kept by a person name Just—Coe had no busi<lb></lb>ness there—I saw a neck of mutton on the day in question, and compared it with a shoulder at my shop—to the best of my belief it was my pro<lb></lb>perty—it fitted the shoulder exactly—I have not the least doubt about it.</p>

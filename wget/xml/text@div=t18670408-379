                  </hi>. I am engaged by the Mint to make certain inquiries, and went in February to 44, Tufton Street, Westminster, with Inspector Fife, Sergeant Elliott, and Inspector Humphreys—the street door was open, we proceeded up stairs—Fife opened the door of the first floor, and we en<lb></lb>tered and proceeded to an adjoining room and found the prisoner in bed with a female—I said, "Mr. Nixon, I need not tell you my name; you are suspected of passing counterfeit coin; we have a search warrant from the Magistrates at Westminster Police-court to search your place"—I directed the officers not to take any part in the search till they had searched his clothes, as he put them on—he said, "God bless you, Mr. Brannan, there is nothing of the sort here, Mr. Brannan; you know I do nothing of the kind"—I said, "I believe you do, for I have observed you many years"—Elliott took from his trousers pocket this purse, which contained this shil<lb></lb>ling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "This is bad"—he said, "That I took last night"—he was taken into an adjoining room, and Inspector Fife went to a cup<lb></lb>board, and in his presence found this flower-pot, with a gally-pot in it, as it now appears, in which was a rag and some paper containing three half<lb></lb>crowns, four florins, two shillings, bad—the prisoner said to Fife, "You must have put them there"—I said, "No, Mr. Nixon"—he said, "Well, somebody else must have put them there who owed me a spite"—he swore on several occasions that the woman knew nothing about it (she was taken, remanded, and discharged)—Inspector Humphreys got a light and went to the watercloset on the landing of the same floor—I held the light part of the time on the landing, and saw him remove a loose board at the back of the closet, and from a little aperture at the side of the pan he produced seven shillings and two half-crowns—I said, "These are bad"—the pri<lb></lb>soner was present, but made no reply—I said, "Do you occupy the stable at 33, Vincent Street? I know you have done so until very recently"—he said, "Yes; anything you find there I shall hold myself responsible for"—Elliott had found some keys in the prisoner's trousers pocket, and said, "Are these the keys?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—we went to the stable, one of the officers unlocked the padlock with one of the keys, Humphreys and Fife entered, and after searching a little time Fife produced three bad florins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said, "Oh! then somebody else must have put them there that owed me a spite"—he was taken to the station—the bedroom opens from the sitting-room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it Alice Scott who was in bed with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she is not his wife, nor yet the woman he usually cohabits with—he has not lived with his wife for years—I believe her to be respectable—the sitting-room door was not locked—there are other lodgers in the house—the prisoner did not say in my presence that he had taken the shilling at a corn chandler's—he said that he took it last night—the stable is in a cab-yard; there are other stables there, but he has the separate use of this one, and it was locked.</p>

I searched the cupboard and found the flower-pot containing these articles—I saw Elliott take some keys from the prisoner's clothes—I went to the stable with him and found three bad florins on a ledge wrapped in paper and rags—they were not in separate papers—the ledge could not be reached without unlocking the door.</p>

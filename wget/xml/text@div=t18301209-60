On the Tuesday before the 18th of November he came to my father's shed with the other prisoner; they brought some sashes, which were put into our shed, opposite the Swan - they were painted white outside and red inside; I saw Witt come with a van, and the sashes were driven away - the prisoners called Witt.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the Tuesday morning, previous to the 18th of November, in consequence of some information, I went with Armstrong to Plummer-street; I saw Howsden deliver the sashes to the carman, and he put them into the van - I then saw the two prisoners go over to the public-house; I followed them, took one of the prisoners, and Armstrong the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090037"></xptr>other - Howsden said he bought them of a man at Stratford for 16s., and the man asked him a guinea for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you hear Armstrong tell Merry what he was charged with? A. Yes; I will not be certain, but I think he said that Howsden got him to help him up with them - I have inquired about Merry, and I believe him to be a very honest young man: the Swan public-house is five or six miles from the house the sashes were taken from.</p>

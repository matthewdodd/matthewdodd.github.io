            , JUN. I am the son of the last witness. On the 25th of November I was in the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030005"></xptr>minding it, the candles were burning in the shop; I saw the prisoner, William West, break a window with his hand, it was whole before. The prisoner, Robert West, came and took a pair of shoes out, I immediately opened the door, ran out and called stop thief! they were taken directly and brought into the shop - I knew the shoes to be my father's. I took William West myself, he was walking, I collared him-Evans came up and secured him. I am sure I saw him break the window, it was a quarter before six o'clock. I went to see the time directly as they were brought back, it wanted ten minutes to six.</p>

               <p>Prisoner WILLIAM WEST. Q. Will you swear I broke the window - A. Yes; I knew his face - I had never seen him before. I stopped him about twenty-yards from the house; I was close to the window when he broke it. There were three candles in the shop, one was near that part of the window that he broke. I am sure

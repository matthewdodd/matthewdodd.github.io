                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, carrying on business a No. 14, Strand—Mr. John Edmonds is also in the business. The prisoner was in a respectable employ in Panton-street—I know the firm in which he was employed—he came on the 15th of August to purchase a watch, and paid me for it in a few days—on the 15th of September he came again—he said the other watch he had formerly had had given so much satisfaction to the lady, that a sister of hers would like to have one precisely like it—I</p>

               <p>showed him three or four, and he ultimately took away three, and said, "If you will let me have them I will bring them back again almost directly"—I said, I must have them back the same day, or an answer about them, which he agreed to do—he was to pay me for the one selected by the lady, and return the others—he went away, and came back on the second or third morning, and said he had not been able to see the lady, she being out, and he had left them—I told him I was uneasy about them, and must have an answer—he called again next morning, and brought once back, which he said was not likely to be kept—the other two he had left, but he had not seen the lady—in the course of the second morning after he called again, and said he was very sorry the lady had locked them up in her desk, and gone to Brighton, and he was sorry he left them at all—I pressed him to return me the watches directly—he kept calling constantly till the 3rd of November—he said the lady had kept the one similar to the one she had at first, but it was fortunate he had left the other, for a younger sister of hers had taken a liking to the other, and he would bring the money on the 5th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, when the lady was to be in town—he called on the 5th of November, at half-past one o'clock, stating he should see the lady that evening, and I might depend on having the money; and if he did not see the younger sister, would it do to have the money on Monday?—I said it did not much difference, but certainly I must have the money—he said if the lady kept the watch would I give him a bill, to show that the lady did not give him more than she would give at the shop? I did so—I had no inten<lb></lb>tion of giving him credit for it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of August, I received information that the prisoner was endeavouring to pledge a wet counterpane at Mr. Flemming's, pawnbroker, Fleet-market; I went and met the prisoner coming out of Mr. Flemming's door; she was endeavouring to roll this counterpane in a dirty rag. At that time the counterpane was quite wet. I asked her what she had got there; she made no answer. I told her I was an officer; I should see what she had got I asked her whether she had taken it from her lodgings; she said, no, it was not hers, she did not know any thing about it. I locked her up, and made enquiry about the way I understood she came; I discovered it belonged to Mrs. Gillies; I went and told the prisoner I had found out an owner. This is the counterpane.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This counterpane is mine.</p>

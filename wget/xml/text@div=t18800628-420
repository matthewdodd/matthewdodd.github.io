                  </hi>. I live at 31, Wilton Place—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1877—he was then a cab driver—he at first drove me casually and afterwards called for orders—he drove a horse and old-fashioned cab, which he represented as his—I lent him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1877 on the security of his cab, and later on 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—on 9th July,1877, I bought a Royal Forder cab at the Baker Street Bazaar for, I think, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was to keep that with the other cab, and it was to run in the street as a public cab—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month at that time to drive me, and he was to disburse the stable expenses out of the returns for the public cab, and put them down and account for them to me—in April, 1878, I bought two Forder cabs and harness at Wolverhampton for 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were bought to London and placed in the prisoners charge, and on 6th June I bought another Forder cab at Wolverhampton for 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 25th March, 1879, another for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also bought a sufficient number of horses for all those cabs to be worked, and placed them in the prisoner's charge, first at the Man in the Moon stables and afterwards at the Rising Sun, which is sometimes called the Crown stable—when I increased my stock of cabs the prisoner was to have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, for which he had to look after the cabs and act as a kind of foreman in the cab business—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

The endorsements to these cheques (produced) are in the prisoner's writing—I am not sure about the writing on pages 3 and 8 of this book (a memorandum or betting book), but I believe pages 37 and 38 are the prisoner's writing—I believe this is also his-writing.</p>

I believe these entries at page 37 are the numbers of the licences of my cabs—I know that licences have been taken out at Scotland Yard for each cab in the prisoner's name—I believe these are the licences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know that ho was summoned as the owner for a horse being worked when he was not in a condition to he worked—I paid the fine—it was a few pounds I think—I was not present—I never knew till you told me on the last trial that an action had been brought against the prisoner in the County Court for an accident with one of my cabs through negligence, or that he was arrested for the damages and had to go to Hollo way Prison—the stables were taken in his own name and he was to be responsible for the rent—he was to pay all outgoings in his own name, but I have had several bills sent in to me—he paid the Inland Revenue licences in his own name—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, for which he was to be at my beck and call when I wanted him to drive me, and occasionally her Ladyship—I paid him in cash once a week or once a fortnight the same as you pay a coachman—if I had not done so it would be in the book—he came to my house to receive it, or I gave it to him outside the club, or at any time when he asked for it—I started these cabs partly to make a profit and partly to introduce Forder's new cabs for the benefit of the public—the prisoner is a good driver—he was earning 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year certain—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was not suggested on the last trial that the prisoner said to me in Wilkinson's presence that he wanted some money to pay a bill of sale—it is not true that he has asked me for money and I have refused—the only thing I refused him was a loan to let him go into the horse business on his own account—that was last summer—he wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I was frequently out of London, and I then used to pay his wages before I left or when I returned—this book is entirely In his writing—he never made any claim for wages in the book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a receipt for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I have paid for rent—it is down in his book as having been paid by him.</p>

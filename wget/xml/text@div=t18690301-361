                  </hi>. I live at 12, Latchmere Road, Battersea, and am a commercial traveller—the prisoner lives at No. 10, which is next door to me—on 1st February, about 3 a.m., I heard screams of "Murder," coupled with my name, and tapping at the wall—I called out that I would come directly, and called my sons up—I saw the prisoner come from the adjoining house, and on going down stairs found the prisoner in my daughter's bed-room, blood running from her head—the prisoner was in the passage—I said "Halloa, young fellow, what have you been up to?"—he never spoke a word—he had his trowsers and shirt on, but no boots—I requested him to fetch the police—he would not do so, and at last I demanded that he should fetch them, but he would not move—the prosecutrix bogged of him to fetch the police—she said if your father was here he would have run all over the neighbourhood for the police by this time—she said, in his presence, that she was lying in bed, and had a stroke on the side of the head, and woke up and called for protection—I went into the next house with the police, but saw no evidence of breaking, or of footmarks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is No. 10 next door to No. 12? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the even numbers are all on one side—the prosecutrix tapped against the wall with the heel of her boot, and screamed, "Mr. Lawrence, they are murdering me"—I know the prisoner's father and mother, as next door neighbours—they were 80 or 90 miles away in the country at the time—his father is an officer in the Civil Service—I have lived there five or six months, and have heard them say that they have lived there six or seven years—as soon as I came down I saw the prisoner in the middle of the passage—my sons had let him in—I went with him next door—the door was opened—one window in the front door was broken, and another in the back door, and another opposite the landing in the bed-room; three broken panes in three different parts of the house.</p>

               <p>1st of February, I found the prosecutrix and prisoner at my father's door—my brother opened it—I asked the prisoner what was the matter—he said that somebody had been murdering Caroline, or striking her—she had a great deal of blood on her face—the prisoner was dressed in a dark shirt and trowsers, he had no boots; I could not see whether he had stockings—I heard my father's evidence, it is correct—my father told him to go for a constable, but he did not say anything—I went over the house next door when the first policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday morning, 1st of February, I was first down, I opened the front door, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix—the prosecutrix was covered with blood—she said that somebody had been in the house trying to murder her, and the prisoner said the same—he had a dark flannel shirt and trowsers on, but no boots—I went into a field at the back of our house, about 11 o'clock that morning, and found this policeman's staff and bull's-eye lantern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Sunday morning, 31st of January, about 3.30, I saw the prosecutrix and prisoner outside the door—I said to the prosecutrix "What is all this noise about, what is the meaning of your stand<lb></lb>ing out here?"—she said that while she was lying on the bed upstairs some man or burglar had been hitting her about the head, and nearly murdered her—the prisoner said nothing at that time—I went up to his bed-room which adjoined the prosecutrix'—there was no clothes on her bed, only the ticking, which had blood upon it; the window was open, and there was a quantity of blood upon the floor, and drops of blood on the outside sill of her window, which is on the second floor; it is very high—each story is about ten feet—I asked the prisoner who opened that window?—he said that he did not know—I found a poker secreted against the wall outside the prisoner's bed-room door—his bed-room window was open—I asked him who opened it?—he said "I did"—I said "Whose poker is that?"—he said "Ours"—I said "How do you account for it being here?"—he said "It has been hare over a week"—I asked the prosecutrix if she knew the poker—she said "It was theirs"—I asked her if they were in the habit of keeping it there—she said that it had been there, but on the Saturday morning, when she cleaned the house, she took it down into the kitchen"—I said "Are you positive of that?"—she said "I will swear it"—on the landing, as you go down, six or seven steps from the bed-room, I found a pane of glass broken, and asked the prisoner if he knew how it was broken—he said "No"—I looked round at the fastenings and they were all secure—he said "Very likely the party may have escaped this way"—there were no means of escape from the aperture—the catch was fastened—I undid it, and in raising the window a piece of glass fell from the inside—I went down to the parlours and saw that everthing was secure—the front kitchen was also secure—a pane of glass in the area door was broken, the top panel, and there was room enough for anybody to get their arms through and reach the top bolt; but it was impossible for anyone to reach the bottom bolt—the bolts were both fastened—the prosecutrix said that the glass had been broken some months—the catch at the back kitchen window was broken off, and the prisoner said that it had been off some time—he lifted the sash up a little way, and said "He may have got out this way and made his escape"—there was a row of flower-pots, and some gallipots outside the window, and it was impossible for any<lb></lb>body</p>

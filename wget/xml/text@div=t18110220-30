            . I am shopman to Messieurs Needham and Co. cheesemongers. The prisoner first came to our shop in December, he said, do you buy waste paper. I answered yes, if it was clean, I would give him four pence a pound for it, he said he was clearing out an old warehouse, where a large quantity of waste paper lay which was consigned to be burnt, he came the next day with four or five books, which we purchased at four pence per pound at different times he sold to me from a hundred weight to an hundred weight and a quarter. I delivered up the whole that I purchased.</p>
               <p>Smith. I have looked the books over, they are the property of Messrs. Colson and company, and those from the year 1790 to 1800 were deposited in a chest. I told the prisoner those in the chest, were not to be destroyed.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the partners in this firm - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the prisoner being apprehended did you signify for what he was taken - A. Certainly; he at first denied the fact, and then he confessed to have taken a few. They are our property. I should imagine the weight he took to be five hundred pounds and they are as late as 1806.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I readily acknowledge here, as I did before the Lord Mayor. I disposed of some as waste paper. I did not think it was a serious offence because my master ordered me to burn a considerable number of papers and books in the warehouse yard, I certainly should have asked my employer's leave. I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

            . I was going home to the King of Prussia, Lower John-street, Golden-square, about five minutes before one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar in King-street; I had never seen him before to my knowledge; he asked me where I was going; I said, home. He said, he would see me home; I told him I could find my way home very well. I am sorry to say, I was very much intoxicated at the time; I had a bundle in my hand with two pair of small clothes, which I had fetched away from Bond-street, they were tied up in an handkerchief. He walked with me, and pulled me about in a very rude manner; he pulled me about, and shoved me against the wall as we went along. I remember being down, but whether he pushed me down, I cannot say; my bundle was dirty; I cannot say whether the prisoner was on the top of me, or I on him, or whether we both fell down together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated - A. Not that I know off. The watchman came up, and lifted us up, and want away. We went on together till we came opposite London-street; I wanted to go to King-street; he said, that is the way, and he would see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him where you lived - A. Not to my knowledge. We went into <placeName id="t18150510-20-crimeloc121">London-street</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I first saw the prisoner and Beadle together in King-street, Golden-square; I was calling the hour of one. They were by the Red Lion public-house window. I perceived Beadle was intoxicated with liquor. I saw the prisoner handling him by his arms. Beadle said, he had a wife and family, and he wanted to go home; the prisoner said, he would see him home. Beadle had a bundle in his hand. I heard the prisoner say, you had better deliver it to me. When the prisoner saw me take notice of him, he took Beadle across the road; he had got hold of him by the arm. Beadle said, this is not my way home; the prisoner wanted to take him through a court, and put Beadle on before him, and they went on to Lucas-court, which is no thoroughfare. The prisoner said we will go in here, and make water. The prisoner said, you had better deliver it; there were some persons in the court, and I found they both returned again, and moved up King-street about twelve or fourteen yards. The prisoner said, take hold of me by the arm. The prisoner pushed Beadle, and Beadle and the prisoner fell; the prisoner was at the top; I went to their assistance; the prisoner said, help me up, watchman, in a faint manner. When I stooped down to help Beadle up, I saw the prisoner had got part of his bundle, and Beadle had got part in his hand. After I lifted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100018"></xptr>them and I asked the prisoner if I should see him home; he said, no. I kept hack behind, and watched them. I saw the prisoner having Beadle about the waist. Beadle says, what do you want of me; I want nothing of you; I want to go home. The prisoner said he would see him home. The prisoner turned to go on London-street; he had got Beadle by the arm; they went together up London-street; Beadle said, that was not his way home; he wanted to go up King-street. I followed them about three parts of the way up London-street, I saw them turn round the corner into Marlborough-street; I lost sight of them, I waited about a minute; I heard Beadle call out watch three times; immediately I turned the corner into Marlborough-street, and saw Beadle had got the prisoner down. On my coming up, I asked Beadle what was the matter; Beadle said, the rascal has robbed me of my watch. I said, I thought there was something of that kind going forward; I said so in the hearing of the prisoner. I seized the prisoner by the collar; another watchman came up, and seized him also; a third watchman came up, and took Beadle to the watch-house, and we two took the prisoner. On entering into the watchhouse, the prisoner attempted to make his escape, he tore the sleeve of his coat off. Beadle gave charge of him, and I conducted Beadle home. After I had seen Beadle home, I went round with my candle and lanthorn to the spot where we took the prisoner; in an area by the light of the candle, we saw the watch in one part, and the key in another; the glass was broke, and the face also; this was at three o'clock; we went again at five; I, and the beadle of the parish,

Beadle had forced the prisoner down; he said, you rascal, you have robbed me of my watch; you have put it down the area; the prisoner made no answer at that present moment. As we got the prisoner on a little way, down the street, he said, Beadle had assaulted him. We took him into the watchhouse before the constable; Beadle gave charge of him; in taking him into the watchhouse; he endeavoured to make his escape, by tearing of his coat sleeve.

We had some rum and water after tea; I then went to go home with my friend; we went into a house the corner of Wimpole-street, we had two glasses of rum and water; there I was till past twelve o'clock, Going up Oxford-street, at a watering-house, I saw this man; I went in, and had a glass of rum, and he had another; we both came out together; he pointed over the way; I told him, I knew my way; that I was going straight to Upper John-street, where I lodge. We walked together some way; when he gave me a blow, knocked me down; as I was rising, he rushed on me, thrust his hand into my waistcoat pocket, took out the one-pound note and some of the silver; he said, I am out of place, and therefore you must give me some money; this was in Marlborough-street; I called watch; he called watch also. When the watchmen came up, the prosecutor said, this fellow has robbed me of my watch. I was taken to the watchhouse, and from thence to Marlborough-street.</p>

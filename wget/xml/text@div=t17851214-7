               <p>Court. Were the lamps lighted? - Yes, I called stop thief, and he cried stop thief! I took him opposite to St. Clement's Coffee-house, he run round the church, I was quick after him, I never lost sight of him, I brought him back, and asked my sister if the prisoner was the person that took the things, she said, he was; the neighbours gathered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140019"></xptr> about me, and they knew him, I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Was your door shut? - It was, I had been in the shop just before that to snuff the candles.</p>
               <p>Did you go to your door at that time? - I did, to see if it was safe.</p>
               <p>What induced you to do that? - We generally make a point of doing that when we are at meals.</p>
               <p>How long was this after? - I suppose, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty that from the time you snuffed the candles, and saw the door to the time your sister went into the shop, no person had been out of that door? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Are you shure that no person had been into the shop? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>How did you examine the door at this time? - By seeing that the latch was safe, and the door was fast.</p>
               <p>Did you put your hand on the latch? - Yes, I speak upon certain recollection.</p>
               <p>There was no fastening but the latch? - No; I took out my watch while I had the prisoner in the shop, and it was thirty five minutes past five; then he had been in the house about five minutes.</p>
               <p>When you were out in the street, could you distinguish people at all, except by the light of the lamps? - No, day-light was too far past.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about the boy's person? - No, the prisoner is the person I brought back.</p>

               <p>I am sister-in-law to Mr. Hazledine, about half past five in the evening, it was thereabouts, I cannot say to five minutes, we were at tea in the back parlour, the candles were lighted, my brother said he heard the door open, and desired me to look into the shop, the door was open, and I saw the prisoner come into the shop, put his hand in the window, and take out two bundles of bedgowns.</p>
               <p>Did he come completely into the shop? - Yes, the bedgowns lay in the corner of the window, I saw them there half an hour before.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of them? - Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Had they any mark upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What mark? - They were marked with the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw him take them? - Yes, I was rather in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to him? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any candles in the shop? - Yes, there were ten candles in all, I saw his face, as soon as he was gone out of the shop, I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your property again? A woman in the alms-house picked them up as they lay in the street, she is not here, I saw him take them up from the window, he put his hands across a wire into the window, and took them up, he was brought back in about five or ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>When he was brought back to the shop, did you see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the boy that was brought back to the shop, was the boy you saw in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you no doubt? - Not the least doubt, because I saw his face, my brother ran after him immediately, I saw the property about ten minutes after; the woman that brought in the property did not see him drop them, and she is a very elderly woman; I examined the property that was brought in, they are my brother's with the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me open the door? - No, I did not, he was just coming into the shop, he was partly in the shop with the door open.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who went last out of the shop, before your brother went out? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your brother going to snuff the candles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in the shop after he snuffed the candles? - I do not know.</p>

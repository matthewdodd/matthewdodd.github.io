He gave me the four dozen of eighteen-penny tokens at the Grapes. The officers were waiting for me upon that occasion. I joined company with them, and then I went to Mr. Westwood. I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether these are the same eighteen-penny tokens that you marked upon that occasion - A. These are the same; they were wrapped up in paper, and paper laid between them, to keep them from rubbing. I saw the prisoner the next day; the officers were waiting there then. I bargained with the prisoner for two dozen; he said, he had no more than fourteen, I should have the remainder the next day or the day after. I received them as if for the whole two dozen. The officers were waiting for me. I went to Mr. Westwood; I marked them before I delivered them to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at these fourteen - A. These are the same I bought on the 5th of February; he never delivered me the remainder. He was taken up on the 24th, at night. I saw the prisoner on the 10th in his father's parlour. I received a dozen three-shilling tokens of him, for which I had paid the father; I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Westwood. These are the same.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTWOOD. Q. Did you receive of the witness these different parcels that you have produced - A. I did; at three different times. I have had them in my custody ever since. They are the same.</p>

On the 23d of February she came to borrow 10 s. for Mrs. Nettleship, a laundress, whom she also worked for. I was ill in bed, and ordered my daughter, who is thirteen years old, to go to the drawer, and give me a pair of stockings, which I kept my money in - she brought the stocking, I took a note from the rest, and gave it to the prisoner - there was a 10 l. and seven 1 l. notes remaining. She stood at my bedside, saw me unroll the notes, and saw the drawer the stocking was taken from; it was in the same room and not locked; she saw it put back into the same drawer. I gave her a note, and told her Mrs. Nettleship might send me the change or not, as she liked. She went out, and came to work for me that, and the next week, as usual, and on the 6th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280016"></xptr>March she came to beg a bit of starch for her cap. She knew I had to go to Brunswick-square, between twelve and one o'clock, to fetch linen. I went, leaving her in the house, alone, ironing her cap at a quarter before twelve o'clock. I returned in about an hour and a half, she was then gone; my little girl was then at home. I went to my drawer for money on the Thursday following, found the stocking unrolled, and the notes all gone. I missed one 10 l. and seven 1 l. Bank notes. She did not come to my house after that. She had told me she lived at No. 11, Edmond-street, Battle-bridge; I went there but did not find her. I enquired at different shops - a boy took me to No. 3, Paradise-place, Battle-bridge; I saw her bonnet hanging up, but Dudley, who kept the house, said she was gone to the Isle of Wight. I went with her to Button's, a pawnbroker, at Battle-bridge, who shewed me a 10 l. note. I do not know it myself, but Mr. Allingham is here, who paid it to me.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Paradise-row, my husband is a paviour. I have known the prisoner about twelve months, she lived with me about three months. She came on Friday or Saturday about three months ago, and said she had got a laundress's place to go to the Isle of Wight. She said on the following Monday, if they would not pay her passage back she would not go. She came in about eleven or twelve o'clock, and said they were willing to pay her passage, and had advanced her some money to redeem her things. She asked me to go with her to Button's, the pawnbroker. I went; she gave him some tickets, he said he could not give her change, she said she must go and get it. She had offered him a 10 l. note. She went out for change, returned, and said she could not get it, he then changed it for her. She told me she was going to return the change to the gentleman who gave her the money, but did not say where he lived. On Thursday Mrs. Green came to enquire about her. She had left my house on the Thursday morning. I took her to the pawnbroker's.</p>

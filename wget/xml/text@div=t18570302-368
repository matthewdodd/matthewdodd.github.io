                  </hi>. I live at No. 100, Chancery-lane. On 13th Jan. the prisoner Spurgeon called on me, and asked me if I knew Mr. Woodmass—I said, "Yes"—he said that he was very ill, and he had come into some property under a will, some thousands of pounds, and that he was about to raise money on it in some Insurance-office, and had been doing some busi<lb></lb>ness for Mr. Emas, I think he said in a Chancery suit, who had given him this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and is drawn by Thomas Henry Emas—he said that Woodmass being very ill, he required a little money for present use, he being in a very bad state, wholly out of order, would I advance 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it merely for a temporary purpose—he said Mr. Emas did not wish the bill to be discounted, and, as Woodmass owed me a little money, he wished me to take that and the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the note when it became due—I said, "The better plan will be for you to get from Woodmass a note to that effect, stating what he really wants, and call on me to-morrow"—he went away, and took the note with him—on the morrow Spurgeon came again, about 12 o'clock—he said that he had left me a note in the morning, which I had not received, but I looked about, and saw it lying on the desk—I opened it in his presence, and said, "Here it is then"—I read a portion of it—he said that was his note, and he then handed me this memorandum—I said to him, "Where is Woodmass?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020010"></xptr>
               <p>did not answer—I said again, "Is he at Islington now?" as I knew he did live there—he said, "No, he is staying at a coffee house"—I know Mr. Emas's writing, and it occurred to me that this note was not his writing—this memorandum is signed by Woodmass—I desired <hi rend="italic">my</hi> son to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave him a sovereign and a half sovereign—the prisoners were taken between 4 and 5 o'clock on the same afternoon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Woodmass. Q.</hi> When the note was given to you, was it not stated that it was not to be negotiated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that it was not to be discounted, and it was stated that I was to deduct a former sum due to me, and the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when the note was due—I have no recollection of its being stated that, if the money was not paid before it came to maturity, then I might deduct what I advanced, and what was due to me—I verily believe that Spurgeon stated that the note was in your writing—it was shown to him—I have seen your writing, and I believe the signature to the memorandum to be yours.</p>

I have known Woodmass for twenty or twenty-five years—I know nothing of Spurgeon; I never saw him—this note is not my writing, nor is the signature—I know the writing of Woodmass; the body of this note is his writing; I have not the slightest doubt of it—I do not know the writing of the body of this memorandum, but the signature, I have no doubt, is Woodmass's—I never authorised any one to sign this note for me.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, G</hi> 32). I took the prisoners—they were both lodging in one lodging house, not a coffee shop—I told them the charge—Spurgeon said that what he had done, he had done for Woodmass—Woodmass was by at the time, and he said he knew nothing about it—I took them to the station, and found on Spurgeon a sovereign and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he said was part of the money he had from the prosecutor—he said he had given Woodmass 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money—I showed Spurgeon the promis<lb></lb>sory note, and asked him whose writing it was—he said it was Woodmass's—Woodmass was present; he made no reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did you ascertain that Spurgeon had been lodging at that house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six weeks, and Woodmass since April—he was known there by the name of Herbert—I told them the charge—Spurgeon said that what he had done, he had done for Woodmass; Wood—mass said that he knew nothing about the forgery—I do not remember that Spurgeon asked if the note was a forgery.</p>

On the 6th of October I went out on my business and returned about six o'clock, and observed a light in my house, I had left nobody there, and had the key of the street door in my pocket. I looked through the key-hole into the passage, and saw two persons - After observing them about three minutes I opened the door, and then saw them distinctly in the passage; one had a candle, which they blew out, and both ran down stairs. I kept guard over the street door, and alarmed the neighbourhood. I have a yard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050020"></xptr>backwards, which joins my neighbour's yard. In about a quarter of an hour the prisoner was brought to me by Schmollinger, I knew him to be one of the two I saw in the passage, and have doubt of it. I lost nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You returned at six o'clock - A. Yes, to fasten up the house, knowing that nobody was at home. I looked through the key-hole, their backs were towards me. When I went in they came out of the parlour and ran down stairs. I was inside the door when they blew the light out. I am certain of him. When I went out I left the door fast and nobody in the house. They must have entered at the front door.</p>

            . I live three doors from the prosecutor. In consequence of information I went into the privy of my yard and found the prisoner there, standing with his face close to the wall, I secured him. Beecroft saw him in my passage. I found a candle and some matches in the privy. I asked him how he came there; he said "Do not hold me fast, I have done nothing." I said "What business have you here?" he said "I do not know." A person could come from the prosecutor's to my privy; there is a wall between my yard and his, five feet high.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I heard the alarm and went into his privy and found in the soil of the privy four skeleton keys there, and a bottle and matches; the bottle contains a liquid to produce fire. I found them there an hour after the prisoner was taken, I tried two of the keys to Beecroft's door, they opened it with perfect ease.</p>

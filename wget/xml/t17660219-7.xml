            . I live at Mr. Bellamy's in James-street. I went to go into a necessary house: the prisoner followed me down in the cellar. I felt his hand in my waistcoat pocket. I missed my money after; which I had put into that pocket but just before, which was five shillings and some odd halfpence.</p>

            . I am a constable: I live in Denmark-court, by Exeter 'Change. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. The prosecutor there told me the prisoner had robbed him of five shillings and some halfpence: this he said three times over. I searched the prisoner, and found 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and 9 d. in halfpence (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you certain to what pieces of money you lost?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and 6 d. in halfpence.</p>

            . I keep the public house where this happened. On the 28th of December I heard Benson cry, he was robbed. I went to him, and saw him and the prisoner had hold on each other. I saw the prisoner searched in the watch-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190006"></xptr> that was about an hour and three quarters after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was upon my duty upon Whitehall guard. I received my pay that morning. I went to refresh myself at a public house in Westminster. Mr. Benson came in a little in liquor: he forced himself into my company, and said he had been a soldier; he was going away and said, if I would go with him, he would treat me with a pint or a pot. We went to another house, there we had a pot of twopenny; then he took me to another house in Covent-garden; after that he took me to Mr. Gibson's house, and called for a pot of beer, there he asked to go to the necessary house; a boy lighted him down; he staid there some time. I wanted to go, the boy lighted me down. He went away with the candle. The prosecutor had not found the necessary house: he insisted upon going to it before me: we struggled for it: he had bought some eggs as he came; we broke them. When he found they were broke, he said, I had robbed him of his money.</p>

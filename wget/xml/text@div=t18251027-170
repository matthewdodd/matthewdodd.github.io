On the 4th of October I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock, and fastened the house up - I was awoke, between two and three in the morning, by something falling against my bedstead - I sleep on the ground floor - I got up, found the door wide open, struck a light, and missed this property - the window was open; I had fastened it the night before; I pulled the window down, pulled the shutters to, and in a short time heard a rap at the shutters - I said, "Are not you satisfied in having robbed me of all I have got?" somebody answered "Good morning;" I unlocked the door, went out, and saw two men; one dressed in a coat and trousers, and the other in a jacket and trousers - I spoke to the watchman, and lost sight of them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 5th of October, about a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I was on my beat in Bluegate-fields, and saw two men - I went up to them, and knew one by sight - his name is Jennett. They were about five minutes' walk from Heatley's house. One was dressed in a blue coat and trousers, and the other in a blue jacket, light trousers, and a Scotch cap. As I returned, I met Heatley, who informed me of the robbery, and about twenty minutes past five o'clock I was in Bluegate-fields again, and saw Crawley standing there - I asked what he was doing there at that time; he said he had left his mother's house at two o'clock to sleep with a girl in Hyam's-buildings, but he could not get in, and he was going to work at Spitalfields as a weaver. I took him in charge - he was dressed in a blue coat and light<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270074"></xptr>trousers - his clothes were reddish, as if he had been among the bricks.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge, and found four sheets of whitey-brown paper in his hat; the back of his coat appeared as if he had been rubbing against a wall. I went to Heatley's, and his wall was of the same colour as the dirt on his coat. I returned to him, and said his coat was very dirty; he said, Yes - he got it where he slept.</p>
               <p>Q. The window-shutter could be opened without his putting his back against the wall? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of October, between one and two o'clock, I was in some waste ground by the Docks, near a stack of bricks, and found a blue handkerchief sticking out of the bricks, with several pieces of silk - a pinafore and gown in it; it was about a quarter of a mile from Heatley's house. I have seen Crawley wear a handkerchief similar to that the things are in, and have often seen him on that ground.</p>

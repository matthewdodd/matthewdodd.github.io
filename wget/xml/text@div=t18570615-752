                  </hi>. I live in High Street, Peckham. I am a shareholder in the Peckham Loan Society—I make inquiries on application being made for loans—in Feb., 1856, I received some directions, and in consequence I went to Pearson's house to make inquiries, and see how they were situated respecting a loan—that was on 14th Feb.—I saw Eliza Pearson, and pro<lb></lb>duced</p>

               <p>to her this paper, which is a form filled up by the borrower—it was filled up as it is now, with the exception of one erasure—I asked her who it was filled up by—she said her husband—it is an application by James Pearson, shoemaker, for a loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the note purports to be signed by James Pearson—the security was to be a promissory note to be given by James Pearson—when I showed this form of application to Eliza Pearson she said it was for her husband—I asked where he was—she said he was not at home—I then went to Head, the security—he said he was willing to become security—I showed him the paper, and asked him if he was willing to put his name at the bottom—he said yes, he was willing to become the security for James Pearson—I told him I had not seen Mr. Pearson, but he must see him, and tell him to be with him at our office on the Monday night following, and the money would be paid—on 18th Feb. the two pri<lb></lb>soners came—I asked Mrs. Pearson where her husband was—she said, "He is not here"—I said, "You must go and fetch him; we cannot do business without him"—to the best of my recollection they both went away together—Head said he might be home by that time—they came back with a third person, who represented himself as James Pearson, and he wrote his name to this promissory note—I showed him the form, and asked him if he wrote the name of James Pearson which was there to it—he said, "No"—I said, "Then you must write your name here, on the form, and the application as well"—I erased the one that was written, and he wrote his name in the two places—Mr. Cork asked Mrs. Pearson whether the person who was standing there was her husband—she said it was—Head was present, and heard her say that—the promissory note was signed by the three, and I passed the money over to the strange man, the supposed James Pearson—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the promissory note is for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called at the house of Pearson when the money was about three weeks or a month in arrears—I saw a man, and I asked whether Mr. Pearson was in—he said, "My name is Pearson"—I said, "You are not the man that came to our office and signed this promissory note"—he said, "No"—I afterwards saw Eliza Pearson—I told her I had seen her husband, and he knew nothing about the promissory note—I asked her what she gave the man to come to our office and sign the promissory note—she said, "Two shillings"—I asked her what she had done with the remainder of the money—she said she divided it between Head and herself—I told her husband knew nothing of it, he never borrowed any money of us, and he was not the man who came to our office—she said she would settle the matter—I told her, unless she did, it would come to something very serious—she said she would see Mr. Head, and get him to pay half the money back with her.</p>

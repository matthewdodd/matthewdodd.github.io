            . Q. You superintend the business of William Turner - A. Yes, on the 15th of February, I gave the prisoner a bill for two tons of potatoes, he was to take them them to Mr. Maclean, Young's Quay, Thames-street. In consequence of information, I got Mr. Rickards and Mr. Baker to watch the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOW BAKER. I am the master of a West Indiaman; I, with Mr. Rickards, watched the prisoner along Mile-end road; we were walking towards Bow, and he was coming from Stratford, when we got opposite Thompson's Nursery. The prisoner got up in the waggon, he continued at the tail of the waggon, the tail board was then down, he put the sack at the near side of the waggon; as he got out of the waggon the horses went on; the sack fell out of the waggon, the sack bursted in falling out, and he fell out of the waggon; about the fourth part of the sack of potatoes were scattered on the ground; he asked two persons to get the sack in the waggon again, and gave to them the scattered potatoes; he put that sack on the opposite side to where it was before; he put a full sack in the spot where the other sack was before; he drove on to the Coach and Horses, Mile End-road, he drove three doors from the public-house; he looked about seven or eight minutes, when an opportunity offered he got the sack on his back, and hurried into a passage to a stable belonging to the Coach and Horses.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the gentleman's name that keeps the Coach and Horses - A. Porter. I met the prisoner coming out; I went in and saw the potatoes in the passage, that led to the stable; I took off the name, 
               <persName id="t18110220-92-person821">

             upon the sack; I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with the sack of potatoes; he said he thought he had one too many, he wished to leave it there until he returned, he was going to take it back to his master. A constable was sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord upon that occasion - A. Yes. The landlord wished the sack to be restored again that there might be an end of the business; he called it a foolish piece of business; the man had made a mistake.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

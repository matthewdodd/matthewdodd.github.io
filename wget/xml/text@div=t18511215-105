                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house, 17, Winchester-place. The prisoner has been my tenant a short time—he commenced last Michaelmas Day—the house was empty for thorough repair for one quarter, from Midsummer to Michaelmas—I made the repairs—the house was entirely tenantless during that period—the name of the previous tenant was Mr. Battersbee; he left at Midsummer last—I very seldom went to the house</p>

               <p>when the previous tenant was there—the signatures to these receipts for rent are not my writing—I never authorised any one to give these receipts—the rent of my house is 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I never authorised any one of the name of Robertson to write receipts for roe—no rent has been paid to me by the prisoner—there is none due till Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Before you let the tenant in, you made inquiries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; he gave me a reference to a Mr. Stanley, in Bridge-street, South<lb></lb>wark-bridge-road—I endeavoured to find him, but he has absconded from the neighbourhood.</p>

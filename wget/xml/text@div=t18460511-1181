                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Williams, of Princes-buildings, White Hart-street, Kennington—it is his dwelling-house. The prisoner lodged with us, but had left about nine weeks—on Friday, the 24th of April, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, she came to the house—I went out afterwards, locked the door, and took the key with me—I shut all the windows down, I am quite certain—I cannot say whether I fas-tened them—I left nobody in the house—I returned about a quarter to eleven at night, and found everything disturbed—the door and windows were just it I left them—I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I had seen safe hanging up in the room up stairs before I went out—the pencil was in a box—this dress produced is mine—I found this ring on the carpet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Watts, and live next door to the prosecutrix.

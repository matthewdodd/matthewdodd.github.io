On the 28th of May I was sent to Mr. Boldero's, in Cornhill, for a hundred and fifty pounds, which I got in thirteen bank notes, four fives, five tens, two fifteens, a thirty, and a twenty. I put them in my waistcoat pocket, and at the corner of <placeName id="t17950916-94-crimeloc537">Milk-street, Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did they go down Milk-street? - I don't think they did. He that came to ask me what I had lost, so much took my attention that I could hardly take notice; I told him I had lost a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge this man with it? Are you sure he is one? - Yes, I do recollect him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was he taken? - I don't know exactly; I believe it was the 13th or 14th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About one o'clock in the day. He was taken by picking another gentleman's pocket. I had information at Bow-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160248"></xptr>and they knew the person by my information.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you see him? - The 14th of July, at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are You able to swear that this was the man that came under your right arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt on the subject? - Not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that made the first stoppage? - That I do not recollect; there came a good crowd; I pulled my coat down, and I had no sooner done that than a taller man than the prisoner struck me with his elbow, and one rather shorter than him came before, and this is the shortest that got under my right arm, I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen him at Bow-street, should you have known him again? - I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were you at any other office besides Bow street? Were you at Hatton-garden? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar there? - No. I was sent for there to see another, but it was a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as certain to the person of the prisoner? - Yes, as being one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so at Bow-street? - I did, that he was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt more than you have now? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great crowd in Cheapside, occasioned by the Lord Mayor going in procession to St. Paul's? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one of the persons came directly before you; the prisoner under your right arm; why he must be stooping at the time? - I don't think he stopped much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he did not stop at all? - I don't think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you as good an opportunity of seeing the prisoner, that was stooping under your arm, as the man that was facing of you? - I turned to him instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. You put these notes that you have described, into your waistcoat pocket loose? - All wrapped up together.</p>
               <p>Q. You put them into your pocket in Cornhill? - No, in Mr. Boldero's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them again before you got to Milk-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel them before you got to Milk-street? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you felt yourself in a crowd, you buttoned your coat together; that was not till you got to Milk-street? - My coat was not buttoned, because it is rather too little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that those notes were in your pocket when you got to Milk-street? - Yes, I am positive of it, not only that, but I had my hand on them not six yards before.</p>
               <p>Q. Originally I took you to say this, that you see the prisoner at the bar, that he was under your right arm, and you believed him to be the man that picked your pocket; and then, when my lord put it to you, the young man's life being at stake, you say you are sure he was the man? - I was sure he was one of the three; I believe him to be the man that picked my pocket, but I did not feel his hand in my pocket; and therefore I did not so positively swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your notes since? - Three of them came to the bank. I know him by his size and way of walking.</p>
               <p>Q. His size is not very particular, nor his person neither. Perhaps you have heard of a reward for a highway robbery? - I did not know pick pocketing was a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there is a reward of forty pounds if you convict this man on this charge? - I do not; I can safely swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160249"></xptr>Q. Were you ever in a court of justice before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at Bow - street, had you ever been at Bow-street before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. The man that struck you, was that done for the purpose or an accident? - The man came full drive against me with his elbow; it alarmed me a little; I suspected what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive as to the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am innocent of this charge; for about three weeks before I had an accident, and I was very bad, and never was in the street all that day.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his christian name? - James. I know the prisoner by using our house four or five months; and I recollect, on the night before that this procession, went to St Paul's, his coming very ill to our house, with a pain in his side.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the procession to St. Paul's? - The 28th of May, the Thursday in Witsun week. He came in the evening before about nine o'clock, and begged the favour of us to sleep there; and he had bought a bottle of some stuff to take; and I slept out of my bed to let him sleep with my husband; we had but one bed; and he was so ill, he had fell down a brewhouse cellar some time before and had hurt his side; I did not understand whether it was inward or outward. In the morning after, I wished to go and see the procession to St. Paul's; but my husband refused, and went himself, and the prisoner never went out of my house all the day; I made him broth in the course of the day. I staid at home with him the whole day, and he did not go out till five or six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure it was of a Thursday? - Yes, I am positive it was of a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What procession was there on Thursday? - The children going to St. Paul's, as I understood.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there no lodgings in Clothfair to be got for him? - He did not try for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. So you set up all night? - No, I slept with the servants that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What servants have you in the house? - Two, both young women,</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they think it odd for you to go and leave your husband's bed and sleep with the two maids? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is not here? - No, he knows nothing of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160250"></xptr>Q. O, yes, he must! He must know he said with a man instead of laying with you; How came you to six on the day of the procession? - On account of my husband going out to see the procession.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no curiosity to ask him then? - I knew it to be the time of the childrens going, and therefore I did not think of asking any further.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the other maid servant's name? - Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live with you? - She might live with me longer or shorter; she was with me a very short time; it might be a month, or it might be less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she come from? - That I don't know. My husband went to the office at Snow-hill for her. I do not recollect her sirname at present.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the names of the two that you have now? - I know the names of them I have now; one of them I have had about six weeks, her name is

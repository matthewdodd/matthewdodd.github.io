                  </hi>. I live at 60, Oxley Street, and am in no employment—on 6th March, between 10 and 11 p.m., the prisoner and another man overtook me in the Commercial Road—the prisoner came on my right, and the other man on my left—the prisoner asked me to treat them—I refused, and walked on a few yards further, and he put his hand into my trousers pocket and took some money, and at the same time I was tripped up and my ear and finger were cut—I had seen my money safe when I had a glass of beer just before—it was in my waistcoat pocket, which was torn when it was taken out—I met a constable and described the prisoner.</p>

I was not quite sober—I did not pass two police sta<lb></lb>tions—I know there was a police-court within 50 yards—I walked about half a mile before I spoke to a policeman—the other man was much taller than the prisoner—I did not notice his beard—he was as much un<lb></lb>like the prisoner as he possibly could be—Sandy asked me if I could identify the prisoner, I said that I could not—that was not in front of the cell—I was taken to a cell in which were two men—I do not think any<lb></lb>thing was said to me, I simply said "That is the man."</p>

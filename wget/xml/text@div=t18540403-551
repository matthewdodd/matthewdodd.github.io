                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Richard Parry, a clothier and pawnbroker at Deptford. On 22nd March, in the afternoon, I was outside my master's shop, taking care of the goods—I saw the prisoner come out of the Beehive public house, which is next door to my master's, take a pair of trowsers off a hook, and go into the Beehive again—I followed him in, and saw him hand the trowsers to another man in the passage—I asked him whether he had the trowsers; he said he did not know anything about them—the other man escaped—I called a policeman—the prisoner left the Bee<lb></lb>hive—I kept him in sight, and gave him in charge—these trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>) are Mr. Richard Parry's.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you in front of the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, five or six yards from you—you could have escaped if you wished—I am quite sure you are the man who took them, and not the other man—I cannot say whether you knew I was following you.</p>

I was called to Mr. Parry's house, and found the prisoner lying on the pavement, scuffling with Morgan and the shopman—I told the prisoner what he was charged with, and took him back to the Beehive—I there received the trowsers from the shopman—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been putting ballast in a ship all night; there were seven of us, and we went to a public house and had some rum; we were drinking from 8 to 12 o'clock; I went to sleep for two hours, and when I came out the boy accused me of taking the trowsers; I never saw him before; the man must have taken the trowsers and ran away; I never saw the trowsers till they were produced at the station house; I had a drop of drink, and do not recollect their knocking me down at all.</p>

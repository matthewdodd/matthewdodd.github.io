I am servant to Mr. James Gamble, who lives at Mort<lb></lb>lake—the prisoner is his grandson—he does not live with him—on Sunday evening, 24th March, about half-past seven, I was alone in the house—the prisoner knocked at the door and asked to see Mr. Gamble—I told him that he would not be at home till eight or a quarter past—he said he would come inside and wait—he came into the parlour, but did not sit down; he went straight towards the wall, and turned himself to the wall, and when he turned round I saw that he had a mask on—he said if he could put a shilling or two in my way he would do so—he then asked me to show him Mr. Gamble's room—I said no—he said if I made any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> others outside would come to his assistance—I had not seen any one outside—he took a candle and went up stairs; I did not see whether he went into Mr. Gamble's bedroom—I went out the back way to get assistance—I went to Mr. Edwards, who lives close by—I returned with him in about five minutes, in the meantime the prisoner had gone from the house.</p>

I found the back door open, and went in and sat down for about two minutes; the pistol was then lying on the kitchen table. I heard a noise outside, took up the pistol, and went out at the back door, when I was stopped by some men, who said I was a thief. I told them it was an untruth, and offered them to search me; they did so; some one threw stones at me, and hit one man on the back of the head. I then returned with them to my grandfather's house, and saw the servant and others. One of the officers asked the servant if I was the man, and she said she did not know."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Recorder, upon examining the pistol, said that it was evident, from its construction, that the priming, if any were there, could not have fallen out, and, as it had been decided by a majority of the Judges that a person cannot attempt to discharge a pistol if it had no priming to it, there was no case to go to the Jury.</hi>

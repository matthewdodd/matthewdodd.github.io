             sworn. - I am an officer in Marlborough-street: on the 27th of last month I took the prisoner into custody; on searching her, Holden, the butler, perceived she had dropped something on one side, in a half-handkerchief; it had two half-guineas and a seven-shilling piece in one end, tied with a knot; there was a fourpenny piece of silver, a piece of muslin, a new sixpence, of the last coinage, and a bit of edging, in the other end; I asked the prosecutor to look at the two half-guineas and the seven-shilling piece, if she could swear to them; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the notes before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing, if she would confess? - A. No; there were two 2 l. notes and 1 l. note in the purse; she told me she found the notes in the passage; she found two 2 l. notes, and denied knowing any thing about the 1 l. note; she told me she had thrown the purse away; she had changed one of the 2 l. notes, and bought a gown-piece with it, and about two yards of cotton, besides half a yard of linen, or thereabouts; I saw a new velvet bonnet lying on the table; I asked where she bought the new velvet bonnet; she told me in Cranbourn-alley, and gave 12 s. for it; she said she paid 17 s. for taking property out of the pawnbrokers; she did not say any thing about opening the box.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Newman.) You say your money was in your purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that purse in your box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at those things, and see whether you can swear to any of them? - A. The four-penny piece and the piece of muslin I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you swear to the four-penny piece? - A. By the hole that is in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you swear to the piece of muslin by? - A. By the edging; there are two sorts of edging upon it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150029"></xptr>Q. Did you put it on yourself? - A. No; I did not; I have had the edging by me two or three years; I have no doubt but that it is mine. When I went to the box, I found it would not unlock as it used to do; it made me suspect that somebody had been there.</p>

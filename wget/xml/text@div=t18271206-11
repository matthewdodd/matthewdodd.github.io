On the 17th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting by the fire with my wife; the prisoner came into the room, and asked how I did, and how my son was - he was a total stranger to me, but I thought he might be an acquaintance of my son's; he went away soon after; my attention was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060012"></xptr>afterwards directed to my pillows, which I missed, with the cases.</p>

I was standing at my master's door, in Halfmoon-street, which is two doors from Snow's; between eight and nine o'clock on this evening; I saw the prisoner go in without a bundle, and come out in about ten minutes with one; Gregory went and took him with the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I go further from the door than opposite it? A. Yes, you went along on the right hand side, and was taken on the left.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, Smith told me he thought the prisoner had stolen a bundle; I went up Halfmoon-alley about one hundred yards, and took him leaning against a door-way, with these pillows in front of him; he said he only did it out of a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he would give me a lift, and do every thing for me that lay in his power. - Witness. I said no such thing.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to get measured for a pair of shoes, and was informed the person who was to make them lived up there; when I found my mistake, knowing Mr. Snow, and having drank with him at the public-house opposite, I went in, and asked him if he would have something to drink; he gave me a bottle, and as I was going to fetch some liquor, I kicked against the pillows in the passage. I have a wife and family, and nobody can feel more than I do my unfortunate situation.</p>

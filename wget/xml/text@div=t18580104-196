                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, D</hi> 16). On Thursday, 24th Dec, I took the prisoner at Kensington—I had been in search of him since three days, after his discharge by the Magistrate on 5th Nov.—Sankey was before the Magistrate on the day prisoner was discharged at Marlborough Street—I found the prisoner in a public house; I called him out and told him I wanted him, and he must consider himself in custody, charged with being concerned with Sankey and others, who were convicted in Oct., in stealing a great quantity of property, plate, jewellery, linen, and other articles, from No. 68, Great Portland Street—he said, "That is a bad job; I am glad I am taken; if I get twenty years I shall be easy in my mind." On our way to the Mary-le-bone Police Station, I had called another constable in uniform to my assistance, and he said, "Potter, I should like to speak to you personally;" that was in Bayswater Road—he said, "You are a d—d fine fellow I can see, you make me think of Sankey, we understand each other, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to square me in this job"—I said, "Is that all you have to say? if that is all we must go on"—he said, "Do not take me any farther, take my word I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three hours"—I said, "You must come on to Mary-le-bone Lane police station"—on the road, he repeated the offer of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several times—after I had lodged him in the station, I took Hammond, a constable, with me, and went and searched the prisoner's lodgings, a marine store dealer's, No. 18, Warren Street, and in a drawer in the parlour, I found this linen which has been identified, and a quantity more which could not be positively sworn to—I asked the prisoner coming along the road what account he gave of the bread basket and coffee pot which had been sold at his shop; he said, "that <hi rend="italic">licks</hi> you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever said that before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not state it at the police court, but this is not the first time I have said it—it slipped my memory, but I mentioned it at the station—it was about seven weeks after Davis brought him up, and charged him with making him drunk, that I apprehended him; it was in the evening, he seemed to have been drinking then—I did not have anything to drink with him, he very politely asked me to have a drop of gin and water; perhaps he thought he had got a Sankey to deal with.</p>

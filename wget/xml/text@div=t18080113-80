               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge the waggoner having any butter consigned to Mr. Todd. - A. Yes. On the 21st of December a certain quantity arrived by the Exeter waggon, it was put into the warehouse, as is usual, till the owner applied for it; it was marked I T and a diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. How many firkins, were there. - A. Five firkins and three half firkins, marked 17 to 24; in consequence of Chapman the officer making application to the inn concerning a firkin of butter marked I T 19, with a diamond, we observed one of that number was gone. I attended the office in Hatton Garden when the persons were examined; I knew Parsley very well, he was in the habit of coming from Messrs. Todd and Benson at Pentonville, to our inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their mark the same as this, I T. - A. No, T B.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. Q. You are an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. - A. I am. When Ekelsoe, a brother officer, and I entered the prisoner Martin's room on Saffron-hill, she turned her back on the butter and opened the cupboard door; she said we might look there for any thing; I pulled her of oneside, and upon the ground, between her and the foot of the bed, the firkin of butter stood; I told her that was partly what I wanted; a child in the bed about five years old cried out, mammy, Thomas brought it; I said I know your husband deals in a great many comical things, I did not know that he dealt in butter; I took her to the office and the butter; the next morning I saw Parsley and her husband. I introduced them into the office. I went to the Bell in Friday-street, I found the butter belonged to Mr. Todd, of St. Paul's church yard. Parsley said he carried it for Mr. Todd of Pentonville; he was so intoxicated he could not carry it there.</p>

            ; I live at Islington; we receive butter from the Exeter waggon; the mark was T D.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner on the 21st to receive any butter. - A. I believe he was, I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Parsley's Defence. On Monday the 21st, I was employed by Mr. Todd at Islington, to go to the Bell inn, Friday-street, to get the firkins of butter for him; when Mr. Todd is there he puts them all right, as I am no scholar. I found but three; he told me there were four; I carried these three to him. In about four hours afterwards they had found the one; I went back for it, I was so intoxicated I fell down; I went to Mrs. Martin's with it; I there fell fast asleep against the fire place; when I awoke I told them it was late to go to Islington, and being intoxicated, I asked them the favour of letting me leave it there till the morning, and then I would take it up to Islington; they granted me the favour; I went home to go to bed; sometime after I had got home Martin came to inform me that the firkin of butter I had left at his house I had stolen, his wife was in custody for it. I told him it was wrong I would go to Chapman's house; I went, Mrs Chapman told me he was not at home; the next morning I went to Chapman's house, the boy there told me to go to the Royal Oak and he would be with me; I did, and saw Chapman there. As to this woman she is entirely innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Martin said nothing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Parsley called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

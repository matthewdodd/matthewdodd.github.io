               <p>On Monday last, at about two or three minutes before two o'clock at noon, as I was walking up <placeName id="t17820515-21-crimeloc97">Warwick-lane</placeName>

The prisoner was in liquor at the time; otherwise I am persuaded he would have got the knife out of his pocket, before I could have secured his arm. I desired Mr. Proctor to take him to the Compter, and he was ordered for trial.</p>

               <p>Did he say what purpose he had the knife in his pocket for? - Not then; but going along, he said he had it to cut his leather strap.</p>

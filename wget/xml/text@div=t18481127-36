                  </hi>, Esq. I have been in the army, but have retired, and live at 11, Wimpole-street, Marylebone; Rogers was my housemaid. On 29th Aug. I left town, leaving her alone in charge of the house—my wife and family had left on the 9th—the day before I left, I gave Rogers directions what to do in my absence, and wrote it down, and read it over to her—on. 23rd Oct. I received information, came to town at eleven o'clock at night, and found Rogers alone in the house—I went up to my bed-room, and found a closet on the landing, where plate, linen, and valuables were kept, wide open, and the ground covered with things which had been taken out of it—I had left it locked, and also my wardrobe and drawers—I found them open—Sergeant Harris came to the house with me, and I missed a silver tea-pot, coffee-pot, twenty-four silver forks, a quantity of linen, and a great many other things, amounting to nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the Jennings's—I never gave them leave to come to the house—Rogers had a married sister, and I said, "I will allow you to see your sister, Mrs. Osborne"—this is my plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is my daughter's box; it was in her room up stairs, and is broken open.</p>

On 26th May last I went to the plate-closet with Rogers—a tea-pot and other things were taken out, which would enable her to know there was plate there—the family left town on Aug. 9th—the day before that, Mrs. Ridout packed the plate up—Rogers came down, and said, "Mistress is up stairs, packing away the plate; I suppose she is going away to-morrow"—my master remained till the 29th—I went away with him, leaving Rogers in the house—she slept at the top of the house, above the plate-closet.</p>

Jennings came to me, and asked me to lend him a great-coat and a pair of boots—he said he would bring them back in an hour or an hour and a half—I lent him them—it was after Mrs. Jennings was in custody—he said he was afraid the pawnbroker would identify his wife; that he was the person who had stolen the plate, at two different times, and this was a part of the plate he had given his wife to pledge, part to another party, and the other part he had taken away and buried—I asked where he buried it—he said he would not tell me, unless he was taken into custody, and then he would tell me, to pay for Counsel—he went away with my coat and boots, and did not come back, as I gave information, and he was taken—I saw him at the station, and asked him what he had done with the plate he had buried—he said his brother <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> had got it; he had not seen anything of him since—I asked where he was—he said he thought he was at Windsor—I asked what he had done with the money from the plate he had first stolen—he said he had thrown it down the water-closet—the water-closet—was searched, but no money found—he said a <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> girl had pawned the other part of the property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 240). On 2nd Oct. I was left in charge of 11, Wimpole-street, from nine o'clock in the morning till between five and six—in a closet where they said the plate was, I found a silver cream-jug—I asked Rogers if she knew if the plate was left at home—she said she did not—I asked if she had had any one in the house—she said only her sister, named Jennings, who lived in East-street—I said, "Was her husband here?"—she said, "No, he has been to the door, but has not been inside."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, D</hi> 14). I went to the house with Super-intendent Hughes, and asked Rogers who she had had in the house with her—she said no one but her sister—I asked if her sister was married or single—she said, "Married"—I asked what her husband was—she said a servant out of place, that he had been at the door, but had never been in, that her sister lived at 24, East-street—I went there, and saw Mrs. Jennings and another person—while I was there Jennings came home—I said, "I suppose you have heard what has occurred at your sister's master's"—he said, "I have heard something about it"—I said, "Have you any objection to go to Mr. Ridout's?"——he said, "No"—I asked Mrs. Jennings what she brought there on Friday night—she said only her own clothes and some baby-linen—I found several bundles of women's and children's linen—I took Jennings to the house—Mr. Ridout and Rogers were there—I took Rogers and Jennings to the station—I found two iron skewers in the kitchen—one was bent, which attracted my attention—I fitted them to some marks on this box of Miss Ridout's, and to</p>

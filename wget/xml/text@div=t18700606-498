                  </hi>. I live at 2, Denman Street—on Friday night, 13th May, I was in Archer Street leading into Great Windmill Street, near where I live—I went into a public-house at the corner of Archer Street—I saw the two prisoners and a female in the house—I knew McKan, by seeing him at the public-house he frequented next door to me—Courtney was with him—I have not the slightest doubt about them—I had a drop of spirits and water—the two prisoners and the female left about ten minutes before me—I had a gold lever watch and a gold chain with me—I had occasion to go to a urinal in Ham Yard, after I left the public-house—I proceeded about 12 yards down the yard, and my heels were knocked from under me, and some one behind me pressed me on the chest—I put my hand out to save myself, and fell on the bottom of my spine, and my head—as I was falling McKan came in front of me and snatched my watch—Courtney was the one who tripped me up—I laid on my back, and they ran in front of me, round the lamp-post, and I saw them both—the lamp was 12 or 14 yards away—I also saw them as they were taking my watch—there was light enough for me to recognise them—I had not the slightest doubt about them—I saw their backs as well—they ran away—I called out "Police!"—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation, and described them to the police—about a fortnight afterwards a</p>

               <p>policeman came to my house, and I went down to the station—I looked an ten or twelve men—I saw McKan amongst them and recognized his face—I asked them to right about; I knew his back as well—he had a pilot coat on—I picked him out—he said "It was not me that took the watch, but I know who did; you were drunk and know nothing at all about it"—I was afterwards sent for a second time, but did not recognize anyone—the third time I was sent for, I recognized Courtney—he was among a number of men—I recognized him directly; he did not make any remark.</p>

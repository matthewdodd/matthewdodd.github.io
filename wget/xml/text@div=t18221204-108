            . I was working by Burlington-street, and saw him take up the boards, (it was about the middle of the day). I went after him and asked where he was going with them, he said, he did not know, but he would put them down if he had done wrong. I let him go - he was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Four or five of us were working at a cesspool - we wanted two short pieces of timber to lie our planks on; I thought they belonged to Mr. Burton, who had given us leave to take some from his building on a former occasion. I worked at the place for six days after, and the prosecutor came backward and forward and never mentioned it to me.</p>

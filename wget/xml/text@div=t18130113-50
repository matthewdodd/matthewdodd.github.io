               <p>Q. Did you at any time, last month, lose any property out of your house - A. Yes, a new watch. On Sunday morning, the 5th of December. I am not certain whether it was done night, or on Sunday morning. I lost the watch from my sleeping chamber; it hung up at my bed's head. I hung it there when I went to bed, and two other young men lost property at the same time. I have not seen my watch since. The prisoner slept in the same room with me, and another young man. The watch cost me five pounds; I had not had it long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the night or not - A. No. When we awaked in the morning we found the prisoner gone, and my doors undone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you - A. About a month. He had not said any thing about his going away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. At the end of a fortnight. I saw the said Bennet coming towards my own door. I spoke to my lodger. My lodger spoke to him, and he ran away. We pursued him. I took him myself near Cranford-bridge, towards London. That is about six miles from my house. When I overtook him. He was walking very fast. I charged him with taking the things. He denied it at first. I charged the constable with him. He then confessed that he had pawned the watch in the Borough for thirty shillings. He said, he had lost the duplicate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlady of the house where the two prisoners lived. This was my box, which I let to them as part of the furniture of their room—they slept together—Mrs. Carden came to search the box last Monday week in the evening—Donoghue had left Mrs. Carden a week before,—she had left my house the Saturday night before, but had not removed her things—there was a handkerchief and two napkins in the box—Mrs. Carden took them away—neither of the prisoners were at home—it was looked, and Higgs gave her mistress the key to open it—that was the first time that Mrs. Carden came—Donoghue came to my house on the Tues<lb></lb>day—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183606130153"></xptr>
               <p>explained to her what Mrs. Carden had found—she said she was very sorry such a thing should occur in consequence of what she (Do<lb></lb>noghue) had said against Higgs—I saw Higgs on Tuesday, after she was liberated—I told her that Mrs. Carden had been there, and found these articles, and told her that Donoghue said she had been down to Mrs. Carden, and charged her with robbing her—Higgs said she should not care what she said, she was quire innocent, and she did not know that these things were in the box—I do not know which of them kept the key of the box.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 6th of June I went to the prisoners' lodgings I had parted with Donoghue on the Saturday before—she left had her work in the afternoon—I found in the box this handkerchief and two napkins—they had been instructed to me wash—I have paid for two of them—I have paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other—I went to the prisoners' lodgings in consequence of what Donoghue said to Redman—these have marks on them, one has a "D" and the other has a mark, which I always put on linen.</p>

                  </hi>. I overheard Donoghue, in the ironing-room, say to Higgs, "I will prove to Mrs. Carden, that you got more from her in the few months you have been here, than I have in eight years"—Higgs said, "What can you prove?"—she said, "I can prove you have fives napkins, now hanging on the line?"—they then went out, and in an hour and a half after, Mrs. Carden went to their lodgings.</p>

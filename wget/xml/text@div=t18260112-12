Hales and Brooks, in the market, to be sold for me; he never took it there; he was to return for more, but did not. What I delivered to him was worth 3l. 10s.; he was alone, I believe, when I gave it to him; but there was a crowd about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are not partners generally? A. No, only for that week. I went to Hales', and found the meat had not been brought.</p>

            . I am a porter at Newgate-market. I saw this cart in Newgate-street, and saw the prosecutor deliver the meat to Lee, whom I knew - Morgan was with him. Woodman told him to take it to Hales and Brooks - he went through the market, and turned down Ivy-lane- Morgan followed, and said, "Go a little further, and I will take it of you;" and in Ivy-lane he took the mutton from him; I do not think he heard Woodman say where it was to go, but he must have seen it delivered to Lee - he took the mutton in Ivy-lane; they parted. I ran, and sent an officer after them; Morgan was taken on Tuesday morning, and Lee afterwards. I have seen them walking in Newgate-street together before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been into a public-house with Morgan since this? A. No; I went to one with his wife. I was never accused of any offence; I was once charged with buying the ticket of a watch; I was stopped when I went to take it out of pawn. I was taken up on suspicion of robbery only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his wife that her husband would be safe with her in the morning, for you could not swear any thing against him? A. No. I had tea and some beefsteaks with her; I went with a view to find out where the meat was; there were more thieves in the room - she asked me to take the steaks, but I paid for them; I bought them of Mr. Walker, my master - she complained of being in distress for meat, and I got the steaks - it was the day he was committed. I always buy my meat of my master; I have a wife and two children. It was five or six years ago that I was charged with robbery; I was never charged with any other - I was remanded for three days, and then discharged. We only had a pound of steaks between four of us; there was another man, named Baker, and a woman there, and I thought the other man knew where the beef was. I do not think I ever spoke to her before. I am in Mr. Walker's employ now, and have been from my childhood nearly. I went to school with Morgan - I was with his wife ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I did not say any thing about her husband - she asked me to tea. I talked to Baker about the meat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you been making yourself busy with Lee's friends? A. No; I do not know where he lived. I am a meat porter, and work for Mr. Walker when he has work for me. I took Lee in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120010"></xptr>Ivy-lane on Friday; Bill Knap was with me, and helped to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said you were not so sure of Lee's person? A. I did say so, because his face was covered with a handkerchief, up to his nose, and as soon as he took the handkerchief down, I said, "Joe Lee I want you."</p>

            . I look after the slaughter-houses in Warwick-lane. I was at the end of Ivy-lane - Painter came and said something to me, in consequence of which I went into Cheapside, and saw a person with the beef, very much resembling Lee, but he had no mutton, and I said nothing to him. I saw Morgan turn down Foster-lane, with something in his handkerchief - they were following one another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the mutton? A. No, it was in a handkerchief, but it looked like a leg of mutton; it was the shape of one - it might be pork for what I know. I had heard that mutton was missing.</p>

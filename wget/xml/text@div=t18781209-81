                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Old Brentford—on the night of 24th November, between 10 and 11, I was going home; I had had some drink, but I had my senses perfectly well—between the Gas Factory and Drum Lane, in High Street, I saw two men and a woman; the woman was behind the men, she had a long pipe in her hand; I said to her, "Give me the pipe," she made no answer that I know of; as I passed on the prisoner, who was one of the men, put his hand to my collar, put his foot before me, knocked me into the road on my face, and as I lay in the road he put his hand in my left trousers pocket and took out three half-crowns—I had had them safe five minutes before—he ran away, I pursued him into an alley, and lost sight of him—as I was looking about he and some others came out in their shirt sleeves, he had a large knife in his hand, and said, "If you don't get out of the alley quick, I will run this through you"—I went out and met a constable and gave him a description of the man—next morning he took me to the station—I saw several men there and pointed out the prisoner; he is the man; I had an ample opportunity of seeing him—it happened four or five yards from a gas lamp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I passed the police-station when I was pursuing you; if I had gone in there I should nave lost you—you were more than two yards from me—I did not take the pipe from your <hi rend="italic">missis</hi>—I did not insult her—I knew you by sight, but not by name, or where you lived.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant T</hi> 1). I was on duty on this night at Old Brentford—the prosecutor came to me in the road close to Raven Alley and made a complaint—he had been drinking, but was not quite drunk; he knew what he was about—his clothes were muddy, as if he had been on the ground.</p>

I was in company with the ser<lb></lb>geant when the prosecutor made a complaint—he gave me a description, and from that I apprehended the prisoner next morning at 6 o'clock in his own house in One Tun Alley, Old Brentford—I took him to the station, placed him with five others, and the prosecutor identified him—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

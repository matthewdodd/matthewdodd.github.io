            . Upon the 27th of May, between ten and eleven, as my spouse came down, I heard her cry out, thieves upon the staircase; and when I heard my journeyman was out I sent my apprentice for the assistance of the neighbours: I fastened the back door below, lost the man should come out and escape that way. I found my apprentice gone a long while; my spouse sent me to look for him; she stood upon the step of the door, as I came out; I saw a man come out of the next house with a bundle under his left arm; I then heard my wife cry out, thieves, thieves: I saw the man turn round, in the cart-way, and he fired a pistol, I believe with his left hand, and dropped a bundle; I was not above ten yards from the man; my wife and I stood together at the door; the pistol was directed that way. I took up the bundle, pursued the man, and cried out for assistance; I was constantly within two or three yards of the prisoner, and I did not lose sight of him while I threw the bundle in the house, nor till I came to White-Cross Street; but, presently heard he was taken, in Old Street, fourteen or fifteen yards from the top of the street. I think the prisoner is the man, by his cloaths, and by his stature. What became of the pistol I do not know. The top of the street may be a hundred yards, or a little more from my house: he was taken about that distance from my house. I examined the place, but I know nothing of the condition of the garret, I saw that a pane of glass was broke there; I judge they came in at the garret window.</p>

            . Upon the 27th of May, upon Saturday, about half past ten, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's house, I heard a cry of, stop thief. I went directly into the middle of the way, and saw the prisoner running from the prosecutor's house. As he passed, I crossed upon him: he said, do not stop me: that gave me a suspicion that he was the guilty person. I run after him about fifty yards; then he turned round and stood with his arm out, and bid me stand off; I did not perceive any thing in his hand; then I ran up up to him and clasped him in my arms round the waist, had him about a minute and a half in custody before any assistance came; then Parker the butcher came up to my assistance, and I took hold of his left hand: the prisoner said, do not use me ill - I am a dead man. I laid hold of his collar, and Parker laid hold of the other side of him: we led him to the constable at the watch-house, and there delivered him up. It was about fourteen or fifteen yards from the end of White-Cross street, in Old Street, where I took him. I felt the outside of his pocket, but I found no pistol; he dropped something, I could not quit him to take it up. It was about half past ten, and the first sight I had of him was in White-Cross Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Christmas, surgeon, of the London-road. On Wednesday evening, 20th Oct, the prisoners came to our shop, and Chesterton asked for two Siedlitz powders—I mixed them, and they each drank one—Chesterton gave me a bad half crown—I told him it was bad—he said it was not, referred to the date, which was 1819, to prove it was good, and persisted it was good—I put it in the crack of the till and bent it double—I afterwards broke it in two pieces, and he then gave me good money—I had sent for a policeman, he came, and I gave him the two pieces—the prisoners were searched, and a bad shilling found on Chesterton—when I was going to bend the half crown, Chesterton wished me not to deface it, as he should not be able to pass it.</p>

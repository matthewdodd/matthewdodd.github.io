               <p>About nine o'clock in the morning of the 27th of August, the prisoner knocked at my door and asked if the mistress of the house was within, my children said I was, he said, he had something to say to me, I went to the door and the prisoner stood at the door and asked me to buy a pair of sheets; I said, young man, come in; I suspected he had stole them; when I got him in I locked the door upon him, and myself and an old gentlewoman that lives with me; I said, he should be my prisoner, and he then confessed that he had broke into a room in Dyot-street and stole a pair of sheets; they were marked with the man's name at full length; there was a man waiting at the outside of the door; I asked him whether that man was a confederate with him or not, for I would insist upon it he should come in along with him; he said, the man knew nothing of the matter nor did not know what he had got; then I asked him if he knew the consequence of these things and what it would come to by and by, and that there were eight men to be executed, and whether it would not bring him to the same; he said, he hoped not, he never would do so again; but he made his escape from me through the back door; I went next day with Dowley and we found the prisoner in a cockloft.</p>

               <p>I met a shipmate of mine, he had some sheets on his arm, and he asked me to take the sheets to this woman; he said he owed the woman some money and perhaps she might stop it; I thought at the time they were his own property, and it is very improbable that I who can both read and write should offer such sheets as them for sale, with the man's name and the street, the man was at the door till he knew I was apprehended, and then he run away: I told Briggs I was not guilty, and she said, then go along I shall not hurt you, go out the back way and make the best of your way.</p>
               <p>Jury to Briggs. Did you know the man that stood at the door? - I never saw either of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Briggs. Did I never lodge in your house a night or two? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You keep a very irregular bad house, and you know the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edwin Wood, a baker, of Victoria-terrace, Kennington-road—on Friday, 19th October last, in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a half-quartern loaf—I served him, and he gave me, in payment, a bad shilling—I took it into the parlour and put it on the table by itself—I took some change out of a small box, went back into the shop, and gave him 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I then went back into the parlour and saw that it was a bad shilling—I made a communication to my husband—he ran out directly after the prisoner—I kept that shilling alone all the week—my husband ultimately gave it to the policeman—on the evening of the 25th October, the prisoner came again—I was then sitting in the parlour—I recognised him as the same man, as he came in—I went into the shop—he asked for twopenny worth of cakes—I served him—he took out a handful of silver, and selected from it a shilling, which he put on the counter—I made a sign to my husband and he went out after a police<lb></lb>man—I gave this second shilling also to my husband—the moment my husband was gone, the prisoner said, "Where is your husband gone?" I said, "He has gone for change"—he said, "What a time he is gone"—my husband had not been gone a minute—I said, "He has not been gone a minute"—the prisoner said, "Oh! he has been gone a long time"—I said, "He has not had time to return"—the prisoner went to the door to look out, and I went too, for I was afraid he would go away—he said, "Well never mind, I won't wait, I will call another time for the change"—he then went out of the shop, and went down Kennington-road—he left his change behind—I watched him all the way—I saw my husband coming with the constable, and saw them stop the prisoner.'</p>

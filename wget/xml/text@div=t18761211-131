                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder, of 17, Love Lane—the prisoner was a lodger in my house—I remember his coming home last Saturday night, at about 8 o'clock, the worse for drink—he came into the kitchen, and began abusing his wife—he threatened her, and wanted her to go up<lb></lb>stairs, and made a kick at her—I asked him to go upstairs to bed, and fol<lb></lb>lowed him—he said to his wife "I will let your b——y guts out; you have put somebody on to me; I will set the b——y house on fire," and he took the lamp, which was burning, off the table and smashed it into the fire<lb></lb>place—the oil flew all about the place, and lighted directly the lamp was broke—I went into the room to put it out, and he up with the shovel and said "I will dash your b——y brains out if you don't go out of my room"—I went for a policeman, and brought him upstairs, and we extinguished the fire—prisoner was in the act of trying to put it out or beat it out with some<lb></lb>thing in his hand (I am not sure whether it was his cap or what it was) when the policeman came into the room.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never opened my mouth to you. I have one child blind and paralysed. There is a person who sleeps with her. I own I had a little drop to drink, but had no intention of setting the place on fire. I took the lamp off the table to put it on the mantel-piece. My wife wouldn't come up, and this woman who sleeps with my daughter came up and struck me in the mouth and said "You don't pay for my drink," and knocked the lamp out of my hand. I cannot say whether accidentally. I never said "I will set the b——y house on fire."</p>

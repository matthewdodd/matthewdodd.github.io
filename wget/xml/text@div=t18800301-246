                  </hi>. I live at 19, London Street, Stepney, and am a labourer—on Saturday, 10th January, I was engaged on board a ship called the Azoria, lying off Fresh Wharf, taking boxes of oranges from the ship to the warehouse—the prisoner was also engaged there—I was called by a fellowship porter to take a box—Iput it on my knot and the prisoner matched it away from me, put it on his own knot, and ran at me with it, struck me on the head and knocked me down, and I became unconscious—when I recovered I was in the bed in Guy's Hospital—I had had no words with the prisoner previous to this, but he was always tantalizing me and telling me I was copper—I was in the hospital four weeks and three weeks in a convalescent home.</p>

I am a fellowship porter and live at 22, Green Street, Stepney—on Saturday afternoon,10th January, I was engaged with the prisoner and prosecutor and a lot of others—there was a kind of wrangle in the street as to who should get the boxes—the prosecutor got a box, and the prisoner got it on to his knot, and he stooped down and bumped the prosecuter with the front of it and he fell flat on the ship's deck—I said "Fitz, you have nearly killed the man"—him he is only "shamming" he did it willfully.</p>

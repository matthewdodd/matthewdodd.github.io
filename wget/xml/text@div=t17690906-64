            . Last Wednesday was a week, between nine and ten at night, my master sent me with some sugar in a handkerchief to carry on board our ship, the Enterpize, a collier; she lay at Cole-stairs. As I was going with it three men passed me; when I was got not ten yards from the door of the public-house where my master was, the hindmost of the three, which was Murphy, took hold of me, but I would not let go the handkerchief of sugar; then he gave me a knock with his hand on my arm, and I was obliged to let it go; my fellow-servant was with me, he catched hold of him. (He is a boy.) Then Murphy knocked him down, but my fellow-servant got up again, and catched hold of him; the prisoner gave the sugar to another man that was with him, who ran away with it. Then the prisoner Murphy came back to the public house. My master told him he had no business to knock me down, and shoved him away; then my master sent me to the boat. I never saw Murphy before he laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Murphy come back of his own accord, or was he brought back?</p>
               <p>Bond. There were several people along with him.</p>

I was sent with him on board the ship, between nine and ten that night; he had some sugar; and in going we met three men; Murphy was one of them; he was the hindermost; he laid hold of Bond, and took the sugar away. Then I took hold of him, and he knocked me down; I got up and laid hold of him again; then I cried out Stop thief! when some people came out and laid hold of him; he was then carried back to my master at the public-house. Mr. Willson keeps it. I told my master what he had done. My master bid him go about his business; he went away directly, came back again, and abused us, and said he was not the man.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night. I was sent for by Captain Taylor to take the prisoners to the watch-house. I found the two prisoners at the public-house, the Plume of Feathers. The captain told me the prisoners had robbed his boys of a handkerchief of sugar. I asked them why they were guilty of such a crime; they said they had not robbed them. They said they would give the captain the value of the handkerchief and sugar. I asked the captain the value of them; he said four or five shillings. Murphy told the captain he would give him that money, if he would let him go clear. The captain was not willing they should go, so they were taken before the justice the next morning. There Murphy confessed he took the sugar from the boy, and that Miller sold it for two shillings and six-pence; and Miller said he had sold it, but he said he found the sugar lying by a post. Murphy said he delivered the sugar into Miller's right hand.</p>

            . I keep the Plume of Feathers, a public-house, at Cole-stairs, Shadwell. Captain Taylor was at my house. I heard him bid these boys take the handkerchief and carry it to the boat. The boys had not been long out before I heard one of them call Stop thief! The people ran out of my house and brought Murphy in. The boy said, as soon as he was brought in, he was the man that took the handkerchief out of his hand. The captain said, Are not you a rogue to go to rob my boy in this manner? Murphy denied it. Upon that the captain bid him go about his business, like a villain as he was. After that the captain said, It is a bad thing I should be robbed in this manner at your door. I replied, I was very sorry for it, but throught he was to blame to let the man go, without bringing him to justice. I went out, and said I would see for him. I found him at the George, that is better than two hundred yards from my house. I brought him to the captain. I said to him, You had better return the sugar to the captain, and the captain will let you go about your business. Upon this he said he would get it, and give the captain it again. His wife came in, he sent her about to look for Miller, and to desire him to bring that handkerchief again. A little time after, Miller came to my house; but he denied that he knew any thing at all about it. Then I told the captain it was proper to charge them both, so he charged them both. When they were before the justice, Miller owned he had sold some sugar, which he picked up in a handkerchief behind a post.</p>

I turned about and said, Well, if I have it, I must have it; so upon that his master came up, and searched me, and desired me to go about my business, saying to his boy, You d - g, now you see he has not got it. I went to the Three Cups, and sat and drank a pot of beer. I know no more. I was mortal drunk. My scull was fractured on board the Royal George. I know not what I do, or what I say.

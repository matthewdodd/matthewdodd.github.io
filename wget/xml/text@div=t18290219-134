            . This is the prisoner's writing - I never received this 5s. 6d. - he never accounted for it in any way; I had discharged him about the 19th of December, and paid him what was due; we settled our accounts; he gave no account of this 5s. 6d. - I discovered it on the 23d of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has not he sometimes detected errors in the accounts, and told you of them? A. Yes he has; I have no recollection of his paying over to me different sums, amounting to 13l. 14s., which were not entered - I had not taken money from him in the street without an acknowledgement, to the best of my knowledge; I should think it could not have happened without my recollecting it; my son receives money of him; I am confident my son did not receive this money of him, because I asked him; he always receives money of him, he is not here.</p>

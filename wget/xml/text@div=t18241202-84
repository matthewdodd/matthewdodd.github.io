            . I am a porter. On the 1st of November, about a quarter past eight o'clock at night, I was by Mr. Waithman's, at the corner of <placeName id="t18241202-84-crimeloc456">Bridge-street</placeName>

He was taken directly by the gentleman, and then he got away, and was taken in Bell's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not the prosecutor take some other person first? A. Not to my knowledge - he went up to another man; I said, "That is not the man." It is a great thoroughfare, and the prosecutor had been waiting some minutes to get across. I told him he was robbed, and said, "There is the man." I had never seen the prisoner before - he turned his back upon me, and ran away.</p>

I was in Bridge-street on the day stated - I did not feel any one at my pocket; Alloway told me of it, and that the man was gone up Bridge-court: there were two young men, several yards apart. I went up to one of them, and Alloway said it was not him, but the other; I went up to the prisoner, and charged him with it; he resisted, but was secured; he denied it all the time. I do not know that I had used it after I left Essex-street. It has not been found.</p>

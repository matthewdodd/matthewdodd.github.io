Gentlemen, it is an object with me, as your servant, whenever an opportunity happens, to discriminate, as far as I in my closet can, between the different degrees of atrocity of each offence; and the rule (whether right or wrong, is the best which my judgment enables me to perform) is this, that where murder is committed, or the circumstances are such, that it is by God's providence only, that murder does not happen; in such a case, I shall think it my duty to bring the aggressors before you; in other cases, where there may be much disregard to the laws, but at the same time, where there is not that extreme degree of disregard to the lives of fellow subjects; in such cases I endeavour to aim at as much moderation as is in my power. Gentlemen, I need not state to you the absolute necessity there is of affording protection to the revenue officers, few as they are in number, in comparision of those by whom they are frequently attacked; in different ways has the law done this, but one law in particular, upon which this prisoner is indicted, has said, that if persons, to the number of three, or more, shall assemble themselves, for the purpose of seizing goods from the revenue officers, being armed with offensive weapons, such persons shall be guilty of felony, and shall suffer death without benefit of clergy. Gentlemen, I shall by and by make a very few observations to you on the different ingredients that must enter into this case when I close the evidence, or at least the subject matter of it, and if I fail in any of those ingredients I fail entirely, for they must all concur to your satisfaction; I shall therefore briefly state to you the circumstances of the case, and then come to that little detail to make you perfectly comprehend what the meaning and object and jet of the evidence is Gentlemen, I will now state to you the case itself in general: - Mr.

            , an officer of the Excise and mate of an Excise cutter, called the Resolution, at the time this transaction happened, in November last, had been stationed at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, with directions to cruize off the coast of Sussex, Hampshire, and Dorsetshire, to prevent smuggling; this boat was under the directions of Quick, and Quick was under the captain; just at that time they observed a small cutter at anchor in a bay called Studland Bay, at a few miles distance; as soon as the crew of the cutter perceived the boat, she slipped her capable and went out to sea. Gentlemen, the Resolution was further out; the consequence of this was, that the smuggling cutter found she was intercepted, and was under the necessity of running in again; they perceived the small cutter had put off a bit towards the shore; as the sea was high, they got to shore perceptibly, and threw out into the spray of the sea about 150 gallons of spirits in small casks, far under the size of those in which that sort of commodity can be by law imported into this kingdom; I shall shew you the application of that by and by: Quick made a seizure of those 150 casks, they pulled them up, meaning to avail themselves of them and keep them, and guarded them for two hours, as the surf of the sea was so high they could not carry them off. Gentlemen, the general circumstances which followed were these, and I would rather that they came more accurately from the witnesses than me, but in general they are these: the crew of this smuggling boat carried as many of them up the cliffs as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100129"></xptr>they conveniently could, and went away; in about two hours between thirty and forty men came down in a body, all on horseback, and, with a very few exceptions, all armed; the officers, as became them, warned those that came of their danger, and told them they were armed, and they must make use of those fire arms; the answer to this was, damn you, we are come resolute, together with some other expressions that I do not chuse to make use of; upon this Quick and his small party were under the necessity of firing, the other galloped on, and the situation in which Quick was left will be seen by you from the inspection of himself; he had his head fractured, a piece of flesh cut out from his arm, and bruised in a manner that left him for dead; and another of the officers, namely Anderson, whom I shall call to you, was treated in the same manner, and with a barbarity peculiar to these men (for I think I never met with such before) it was such, that in passing they gave what they called the parting blow, and it had nearly been the parting blow between their souls and their bodies; Quick will be produced to you, he is a cripple for life, and in the vigour of his age; he must retire, and get his living in some way where honesty is more required than activity; Quick was carried on board the boat, and recovered his senses, he was put under the care of the surgeon, and is recovered as far as he ever will: another circumstance, gentlemen, attended the arrival of these thirty or forty men, or at least very soon after, a cart or waggon came down, (clear proof of premeditation) and in these were put the 150 casks and carried away. Gentlemen, I said I would state to you what was the essence of this indictment, in order that it should be supported: first it is essential that it should appear to you that those persons were not casually or accidentally assembled, but for the purpose of this rescue; the coming to the number of 30 or 40 on horseback, and armed; soon after the alarm was given by the boatsmen, most of them running up the country, is a strong circumstance; and that of the cart, is a clear symptom of the same sort; in short, the common-sense of the thing speaks, that this was a premeditated design to rescue these goods, both by the manner in which they came, and in which they went, and in which they conducted themselves towards the cutter. The next essential ingredient is, that these goods were liable to duty, and had not paid it; - the circumstance of their being in such casks as I have represented to you, those casks being slung, and many of them removed; the circumstance of the boat having endeavoured to make their way to sea it possible, are all too plain for me to enlarge upon, and which throw the proof on the other side; if they had paid duty the prisoner will prove it; the next circumstance is, that the individual prisoner was armed with an offensive weapon; what an offensive weapon is, is a matter of common-sense, but as a necessary matter of evidence, will be described by the witness; but my own idea of the word is this, I take it simply to be the direct reverse of an ordinary defensive weapon, that a man carries about with him, calculated more for the purpose of doing mischief, and injuring another person, than for any of the ordinary purposes for which any of us may carry a whip, or walking-cane; if that is not of itself a reasonable definition, I shall, with great pride and pleasure, borrow one from the best authority, and that is, Mr. Justice Foster, who says, it is</p>
               <p>"an instrument likely to kill." Now, gentlemen, such an instrument may be of a great variety of kinds; sticks of certain sizes and dimensions, unquestionably may be likely to kill, and are not those which are ordinarily and customarily used by the subjects of his majesty; and that a whip may also be so, I presume no man will doubt; because, if a weapon, very likely indeed to occasion the death of a man, should happen to have a thong hang to it, that will not deceive the jury, and they will say whether it is simply for the use of a person going on horseback. Gentlemen, another description of an offensive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100130"></xptr>weapon is, that it must be such an instrument as is unaccustomed to be used, and such as would naturally, on the first appearance, excite a certain degree of surprize, and induce any person to say, this is for some other purpose than riding on horseback; now, if a whip of very large and enormous size, being in its nature a thing elastic, with a spring, is not much more likely, when so used, to be the cause of the death of a man, than a stick, I know not how, in the shape of a whip, it is possible for any weapon to be offensive; and I presume you will have no doubt, but the death of a man might easily happen by such a weapon; but suffice it for me, that the reasonable intimidation of an officer is effected by it, that is sufficient for this purpose. - Gentlemen, these are the circumstances, which I have stated to you as simply as I could, for the purpose of directing your attention to the evidence which will be given; I shall leave it with you, with the same conviction I have hitherto had, that you will, on the one hand, attend to the necessary interests of the public, in protecting the officers of the revenue, and that, on the other hand, you will pay regard to the superior interest of the prisoner, and that is, that he (although accused) should have the full benefit of that law, which is his inheritance.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Silvester.)</p>
               <p>You are an officer of excise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was mate of the Resolution cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you stationed on the 5th of November? - At the port of Cowes; on the 5th of November, being at anchor in Swannick's bay, we looked out, and seeing a vessel we suspected to be a smuggler, we were ordered to go along-shore in the boat belonging to the Resolution; but after putting off from the vessel, it blowing very fresh that night, I judged it not prudent to go down on the north shore, but went into Brown-sea, the entrance of Poole-water; upon which I landed, and took my men out with me, armed, down to Flag-roadway, over land; in going down the roadway, I fell in with three horses standing in the road-way leading from Poole, on shore; I descried three men laying on a sand-bank, when another rode up on horseback, and asked me what we belonged to; one of the people answered, to the excise; at that time they asked me, whether we had got any more people on shore; that was the same men.</p>
               <p>When did you see the boats? - On the 6th, the next day, as I was going out of Brown-sea, it might be about seven or eight in the morning, it was day-light, I went back to my boat, I put to sea.</p>
               <p>Where was the cutter then? - The cutter was riding in Swannick's-bay, as they told me after, where I left her; going out of Brown-sea, I saw this vessel with a large boat upon deck, she was rather at an anchor at Studland-bay; which made me think, seeing a large boat on deck, it blowing so fresh the night before, and my being down on the north-shore, that she had not landed her goods.</p>
               <p>What did you take her to be then? - A smuggler; I immediately made towards her as fast as possible, and I found that I could not fetch her with my sail; I lowered my sail down, and struck my mast, and pulled my oar down, to get towards her; as soon as the smugglers saw that, they slipped their cables, and went out of the bay, and went out to sea; and I put one hand on shore at Studland, to go over to Swannick by land, to call the cutter; he came back to me, he saw the cutter, and the cutter came round; he turned back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; when the smuggler saw the Resolution coming, she immediately hauled her weather, and went down on the north-shore; I chased him in the boat, and the captain in the cutter.</p>
               <p>Court. They went down towards that part of the shore that lays between Poole and Christ-church? - Yes; he had time to put his boat out, and put about 150 kegs that lay on the shore into her.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100131"></xptr>What kind of kegs were they? - What we call half ankers.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards know what was in those kegs? - I tasted rum afterwards, when I have them out; they sent the kegs off with the boat; I did not see them put them in, but they hove them out into the surf of the sea, when they landed; I got them altogether out of the surf upon the sand; after the captain had time to get a four-oar'd boat out, and send on shore from the cutter, before I reached the shore, she arrived ashore before me.</p>
               <p>Had the smuggling-boat got off? - No, she had not; there was she and three of the people that came on shore in her, upon the shore, when I went on shore after the goods.</p>
               <p>Did they haul her up out of the surf, or what? - No, she was laying beat up out of the sea, on the shore, they were on the beach; I had six men in my boat with me, and four that the captain sent, which made ton, besides myself; after I got to shore, and had possession of the goods some time, I attempted to launch the four-oar'd boat, being flat; I had taken possession of the goods, and the keg that I tasted, which was rum, they had slings round them, they were not fastened together; the slings are ropes put round them, for the purpose of carrying them; I found it impossible to launch the four-oar'd boat, and afterwards got an eight-oar'd boat mast and sail into the large tub-boat, the boat that brought them on shore, and they attempted to get her off, when I saw a company of horsemen riding down in Bourne-bottom; there was about thirty; they were dressed, some in smock-frocks, and some in coats; I desired my people to break off from attempting to launch the boat, for I fancied we should have work enough; for I told them, I thought the company were coming; we broke off, and took to our arms; when they rode up, I desired them to keep off, or I would fire; their answer was -</p>
               <p>"fire,</p>

               <p>"damn your eyes, you b - gg - rs, for we</p>
               <p>"are come resolute!" - they were about twelve or fourteen yards off, to the best of my remembrance; then they made a drive at me with their horses, and sticks and whips uplifted.</p>
               <p>Court. They rode at you with their sticks and whips uplifted? - Yes, they were sticks with large heads to them.</p>
               <p>What kind of whips had they? - Whips with large heads to them, which appeared to me to be what they call loaded whips.</p>
               <p>What thickness were they? - The whips were thicker round, I suppose, at the but-end, than any part of this stick; they held their whips and their sticks by the small end with the large end raised; when I saw them riding up in that manner, and after the answer they made me, I desired my people to fire on them, and I and some more of my people did fire, and one man dropped from his horse; after that, I turned round, and was attempting to load my piece again, and a man came behind me, and cut my scull open with a tomahawk.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by a tomahawk? - A thing that is like a small axe at one end, and at the other there is a small spike; with that blow I fell, and after that I arose again, I put my hat on, and here is a cut on the head which I received after. Shews his hat cut through.</p>
               <p>What is it cut with? - I cannot say, I look upon it to be the point of a tomahawk drove through; after that, with my hat on, I received another blow through my hat; after that I was knocked down again with a stick or whip.</p>
               <p>That was with a blunt instrument? - Yes, it was with a blunt instrument; after I was knocked down again, I was wounded in my right thigh, with the point of a tomahawk; these are the breeches I had on; this is the hole; likewise I had a piece taken out of this left arm, and the bone fractured, I cannot say what it was cut with; I have lost the use of my arm; I was slightly cut in the joints of these fingers, which I suppose was by drawing a cutlass through my hands; I cannot use a fork, not cut my own victuals, and the little finger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100132"></xptr>of my right hand was broke at the same time, and I was very much bruised from head to foot.</p>
               <p>Court. Then by that account you received many different blows? - Many, after I was laying bleeding on the sands, they got off their horses and beat me; I cannot ascertain the number, but I had a great many blows from several, with sticks and whips as I lay bleeding on the ground; after I received them blows, and some more of my people were wounded and beat, they put their goods into a waggon and a cart, which came down with the company, just behind them; and after I and my people were beat, then they loaded the waggon and the cart, and drove the goods off; the Resolution being near the shore, seeing that, and seeing the action, she fired a six-pounder at them.</p>
               <p>Had that any effect in dispersing them? - No, none, they got off with the goods.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity, at any time, to observe the persons of any of the people that came up to you? - Yes, I had, the man that split my skull was on the shore with me during the whole time I had possession of the goods; the boat's crew never struck a blow.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I recollect his features.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him? - I saw him after I was laying on the sand; I recollect him on account there was a man going to cut my ear off, after I was laying on the sand, and another came up, and would not let him do it.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, that came up, and would not let him do it.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoner before that? - No, sir, not to be any ways active, only amongst the men.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him amongst the men? - Yes, I saw him after I was laying on the sand, but I did not take any particular notice of him; the prisoner came up, and was on foot, and prevented the man from cutting my ear off; he was on foot; they had got off their horses; to the best of my knowledge the prisoner had a whip.</p>
               <p>What kind of a whip? - The same I have described.</p>
               <p>That large loaded whip? - Yes, whether it was loaded I will not say, but it appeared to me, to be the same kind of whip that I described before, to the best of my remembrance; they were obliged to carry me on two oars as far as Bourn-sea, and then taken on board the cutter, and put before a fire; and after that, I was carried up to Poole, where I was confined a long time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Quick, what time in the morning was it when you went out with your cutter, on the 6th of November? - It was about seven or eight in the morning, as near as I can guess; I had no watch in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, or do you know, about what time it was you landed? - I suppose, it might be about two hours after.</p>
               <p>Then it might be about ten? - Thereabouts, about ten, or it might not be quite so much.</p>
               <p>Then you got possession of these hundred and fifty kegs that they left on the surf? - Yes, I cannot ascertain the number exactly.</p>
               <p>How long was you on shore, before the company came? - About two hours, as near as I can guess; we had had possession of them two hours.</p>
               <p>Then this being about twelve, you had not got possession of the goods, in the way it was stated; I understood you to say, that you told them to keep off, or you would fire on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon which they answered, d - n you, you b - g - rs fire, for we are come resolute? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I believe it was, that you gave orders to fire? - Yes, they rode up to me.</p>
               <p>The man that dropped, was of the name of Bishop or Butler? - I could not swear to his features, but I look upon it, it was the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100133"></xptr>That man was tried since, and hanged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon this, you attempted to load your piece again, and then you received a blow that fractured your skull? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose, in that state you was very much confused? - I was, but in a little while I arose again, and put on my hat.</p>
               <p>How long did you lay on the ground? - Not, I suppose, above the space of a moment; I did not know my skull was fractured; I suppose, I had not been up above the space of a moment, or a moment and a half, before I was knocked down again.</p>
               <p>Then you was something more confused than you was at first? - Yes, I was; says he, d - n your eyes, you have shot the man.</p>
               <p>The second time, you say, you believe you was knocked down with a stick or a whip? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was you in that state before the man came up to cut off your ear? - I was some time.</p>
               <p>How long? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You was of course examined as a witness on the prosecution of the other man? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you a perfect recollection now of the testimony you gave on that prosecution? - No, I cannot explain the words.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, that at that trial you could not swear to any person being present, except a man called Dominick? - I did not recollect at that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, that you did not know any person but a man of the name of Dominick? - Not to know him perfectly, that I swore then, till I saw the prisoner at Southampton, and I recollected his features.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the trial of Bishop, he said, he did not know any person, with certainty, but Dominick; but he says, he afterwards saw this man at Southampton, and recollected his features.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. You have seen the prisoner at the bar since the trial of Bishop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you had not seen him till that time, from the time you received the accident? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not recollect, that between the time of the accident, and the trial of Bishop, you had seen this man at all? - I do not recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Then you have not been into the goal of Newgate, to see the prisoner since that time? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Others have? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came it you did not go? - I was not ordered.</p>
               <p>But you say, that you now recollect the features of the prisoner, and he was the man that saved you from having your ear cut off by the others? - Yes, sir, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>But be it as it may, you do not mean to be quite positive? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say, that you are not quite positive as to his being there, or that you are not quite positive as to his being the man that prevented your ear from being cut off? - Neither, but to the best of my recollection of his features, he was there, and was the man that prevented my ear from being cut off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Did you see the goods taken off, Mr. Quick? - Yes, I saw them ride away with them.</p>
               <p>Then you mean to swear now, that you saw the goods carried off; because at the last trial, you said, that at that moment you was insensible, and had no account of it? - The goods were carried off, because I remember hearing the report of the six-pounder; I was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Then you was perfectly sensible at that time? - I was confused.</p>
               <p>How long was it, either before or after that, that the man came to cut off your ear? - I look upon it, it might be about five minutes, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Was he the only man left of the Smugglers party? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you a man in your party, named Breedon, familiarly called

               <p>Do you know much of this John the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100134"></xptr>Painter, with more names than one? - No, I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>He is too bad a man for you to keep company with? - I have no opinion at all of the man; I have no such opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Do you not know him to be a very bad man? - No, I know nothing of him, more than his being here at the last trial.</p>
               <p>He was not called as a witness then? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If I understand you, you know nothing of the man? - I have no acquaintance with him, and I do not know that I ever saw him before.</p>
               <p>Court to Quick. Are you sure the man that prevented your ear from being cut off had any weapon? - Yes, sir, a whip, or stick, I cannot positively say; I believe it was a whip that he had.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection how that man was dressed at the time? - He had a kind of frock-coat on, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Do you mean a smock frock or coat? - No, a coat.</p>
               <p>He was dressed in the common usual way? - In the common usual way.</p>
               <p>No disguise? - No disguise at all.</p>
               <p>Now can you recollect with any certainty, whether you observed that man at any time before you was knocked down? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Whether you saw him on horseback or not is the meaning of my question? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You give your evidence very properly and very fairly; do you recollect seeing that man, who interposed at that time, and whom you took to be the prisoner, striking yourself or any of your party? - I do not recollect seeing him strike me or cut me, or any of the party.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection in what manner he interposed, what he said? - I was laying with my head towards the cliff, and a man came to my left side and took hold of my car, and got his knife out and open, and the man whom I took to be the prisoner said, let him alone, he has got enough, or something of them words, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of observing whether this action between you and the smugglers had brought together any of the country people, or any more than the party that came down? - There was this Dominick, as I had heard him called, he was on his horse all the time, but I do not recollect it bringing together any more than those that were with the waggons and carts and horses.</p>
               <p>Whether there were any people who were drawn there by this action as spectators, that were not concerned on either side? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the tomahawk was taken from that you was cut with? - Out of the bow of my boat.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In what employ was you on the 6th of November last? - In the employ of the Excise, on board the Resolution cutter.</p>
               <p>Do you remember having been with Quick at the time these casks were landed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what hour was it that you saw any company coming towards you at Poole Bottom? - As near as I could tell it was twelve o'clock, I had no watch; I had been employed about two hours in pulling up the tubs; I saw a company of about thirty coming towards me on horseback; and I think about the space of thirty yards, Quick the mate desired them to stand off.</p>
               <p>Tell us, as near as you can recollect, the words that Quick made use of, and what followed? - If the Court will excuse the expressions, they are rather indecent; Quick desired them to stand off or he would fire upon them.</p>
               <p>Were they then within hearing? - They were then, I suppose, within twenty yards, they were riding on full speed.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they coming on at a gallop? - With a fast trot or gallop.</p>
               <p>Coming on with considerable speed? - There was a general exclamation, fire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100135"></xptr>you b - g - rs, for we are come resolute; the words were very express and very plain; they still kept riding on, they made no halt at all; when they were within ten or twelve yards, by that time they had finished their expression, Quick and several others fired; I fired, and I saw one man drop from his horse, and they rushed in upon our party and separated them; they were on horseback with bludgeons and sticks, or whips; they held the whips by the small end, and so they did the bludgeons.</p>
               <p>In what manner were their arms used? - They were held by the small end, and they were brandishing them ready to make a blow.</p>
               <p>What sort of whips were these? - They were large whips, I cannot say I can describe the nature of whips so well, because I am no horseman; it was very much like this, (producing a large whip) but some of them I think were bigger; as for the weight I can say nothing, and they were held with the small end in their hand with one hand lifted up.</p>
               <p>What was the size of the sticks? - The small end of the sticks were about this size, (a middling size stick) and the other end was thicker considerably, and at the top of it a large knob.</p>
               <p>Then these men came onwards in this way with their whips and sticks brandished, and they broke in amongst you? - Yes, the first thing I saw, with respect to our people, I saw Mr. Quick knocked down, and I received a blow on the head, but not very considerable; I picked up a musket which would not go off; I ran to Quick's assistance, and there were two men beating him, and I no sooner relieved him from one of them, but I was knocked down myself, and I thought it was by one of those bludgeons, but on examining the wound, it appeared to have been given with a sharp instrument; I lay blind for some minutes, or rather insensible; the first thing I saw was a man coming to make a blow at me, I saved it with my arm; he then went to Quick, and I suppose about twenty passed between Quick and I, and gave each of us a blow, expressing</p>
               <p>"which of you killed the man;" one man presented a pistol and attempted firing, the pistol would not go off, he in a passion took the pistol and rammed the muzzle of it quite into my mouth, I lost two teeth; I wrenched a club from one of them, and saved a blow; all this time they were loading a cart and waggon which came following them at a little distance.</p>
               <p>How long were they so employed? - I think I may say about twenty minutes; they put the goods on the cart and waggon and drove off.</p>
               <p>How many of your men besides Quick and you were there? - There were two boats crews, in number eleven, ten besides the mate.</p>
               <p>What became of them? - They were dispersed and ran to the beach, except Quick, myself, and one Morgan, he received some blows; several of the men went into the water, and they fired at them with short muskets.</p>
               <p>Court. What, the smugglers? - Yes, if the party that came down were smugglers.</p>
               <p>Some of them had fire arms? - Yes, they had those pieces, I cannot describe any of their arms to have been their own, they might have been ours, except those short muskets, we had none such.</p>
               <p>How many had fire arms? - There were about six or eight, and it appeared to me that those pieces were discharged on our people that ran into the water.</p>
               <p>How far did they run into the water? - I cannot positively say, the sea was running high; the most expressions that they used were, who killed the man? none of them remained with me after the cart and waggon went away; the last man that was with me was a man that I beckoned to and desired to leave a little spirits to wash our wounds, as I was then doubtful of being able to get off, the whole party went immediately with the cart.</p>
               <p>I have nothing more to ask you, only whether you recollect seeing the prisoner at the bar there at the time? - I have taken particular notice of the prisoner, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100136"></xptr>with any recollection say that I do know him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, prisoner's counsel. I will ask you a question, being a very fair witness, you say you observed people beating Mr. Quick after you attempted to fire the second gun? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they beating him very unmercifully? - They were beating him with all their might.</p>
               <p>This was before the cart was loading? - Yes, it was before they could possibly load the cart, the cart was just coming up.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of this country? - I know a little of it.</p>
               <p>Then this place where the accident happened is very often used as a road? - I do not know that it is ever used as a road but for the convenience of smugglers.</p>

               <p>Do not you understand it is a nearer cut to the road? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears it is a road down from the beach, and not a road from one part of the country to the other, that is as it appears at present.</p>
               <p>You say there were some persons remaining? - I was the last that remained, there was the whole company at that time within ten yards, round the carts and waggons, and at the time I was speaking to this man they then had the wounded on the cart; I was rather hot with defending myself, I did not feel the wounds, I was sometimes obliged to wipe the blood away to clear my eye-sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. This track then down which the cart and waggon came was not, according to your knowledge of the country, a common road? - I never knew it but leading down to the beach, and I have known it for years.</p>
               <p>Court. The fact of the goods being carried clear off, seems to render the enquiry about the road clearly immaterial; there having been an actual attempt.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you belong to the Resolution cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you one of the persons that were on shore with Mr. Quick, at the time of this seizure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any part of the persons coming down the country? - Yes, about thirty; they rode as hard as they could ride, with their sticks and whips up an end, above head; we stood by the goods, and Quick desired them to keep off, or he would fire; they said, oh, fire, fire, for they were resolute bent! upon that, Mr. Quick fired, and ordered his people to fire.</p>
               <p>What did the party do? - As soon as we fired, they rode right through us, and every man that came athwart them, they knocked quite down.</p>
               <p>Had they any other weapons, besides these sticks and whips? - I cannot say that they had then, but I afterwards saw them with muskets.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the persons that came with that party? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there? - Yes, when I saw him, he had a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing? - No, I cannot say I saw him strike any person; he was on horseback; he was in the company; and he had a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of that? - Yes, I got very much beat; after we fired I ran into the water; two of them came into the water, and beat me very much, and afterwards I saw a man with a musket aiming at me, but the piece did not go off; the prisoner was holding his whip at the small end when I saw him.</p>
               <p>What sort of a whip was it that he had? - It might be about three or four inches round; it was as large as that, or, I think, rather larger.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner after the time that he came up? - Yes, I saw him twice.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come up with the party? - Yes, he did, and I saw him afterwards, when I was in the water; it was after Mr. Quick had been struck down; Quick was laying then on the sand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100137"></xptr>Was it before or after the six-pounder was fired? - I fancy it was before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Where do you live? - I live at Cowes, when I am at home.</p>
               <p>Had you any habitation there, at the time of this affray? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Lodgings, I presume? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you employed as a mariner on board this cutter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been on board of her? - Six or eight months, I fancy.</p>
               <p>Then you are perfectly familiar with the person of the prisoner, I presume? - No, I never saw him before that time.</p>
               <p>And I suppose you have never seen him since, till you saw him now? - Yes, I saw him the other day.</p>
               <p>That was in Newgate? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Who was with you? - There was a gentleman with him; I went in by myself.</p>
               <p>What was that gentleman's name? -</p>
               <p>That is the gentleman over the way. (The Clerk of Mr. Mayo.)</p>
               <p>Then when he came there he left you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of the coast of Sussex? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>You say, after you had fired, being one of the company, you ran into the water? - Yes, I was knocked down first, before I ran into the water, and I got up after.</p>
               <p>Was it a very violent blow that you received? - I fancy it was, for it stunned me; I was stunned about a couple of minutes.</p>

               <p>Was Quick knocked down at that time? - I fancy he was knocked down on the sand then.</p>
               <p>Did you give any evidence on the trial of the unfortunate man of the name of Butler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, on that trial, you said, you could swear only to one person? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>That was one Dominick? - I knew Dominick very well.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner had a whip? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that a common hunting whip? - No.</p>
               <p>What were they dressed in? - Some in frocks, some in their common habits.</p>
               <p>Have not you before swore they were all dressed in frocks? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>You have not? - No.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of the prisoner, except, you say, you saw him there? - No, sir, I saw him there; I did not see him strike any man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Quick was an officer in the Resolution, and an officer in the Excise, was he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you quite sure as to the person of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before, till you saw him in Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so particular in a man, that you saw doing nothing? - It was a time, when a man would be particular; I saw another of our people beating, and this gentleman rode up to him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him off his horse at all? - No, I did not, for as soon as ever I turned round to him, two or three knocked me down; I never saw the prisoner off his horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When you went to Newgate, was the prisoner pointed out to you, or in what manner was he shewn to you? - There were four, or five, or six prisoners came out to me, besides him.</p>
               <p>Did any body point him out? - No, sir, they did not; I pointed him out from four, or five, or six others.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Where were you on the 4th of November last? - I sailed from Albany, on board the Phoenix cutter.</p>
               <p>What were you loaded with? - Brandy, gin, and rum.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to from Albany? - To Bourne-bottom; we arrived there, and we boated part of our goods; that was on the 5th, at night; and there was a signal given us by the company that were on shore to push off; and we went to sea again; and we lay in Studland-bay till the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100138"></xptr>morning; in the morning of the 6th, we saw a boat coming, that we suspected to be a Custom-house boat; on that we slipped our cables and stood off to sea, till we saw the Excise cutter, then we bore up to the north shore; while we were running, we boated our goods.</p>
               <p>How did you dispose of the goods? - When we came on shore, we have them over-board; there might be a hundred and fifty, or a hundred and sixty out of the boat; there were a few left in the cutter; we threw a hundred and fifty or a hundred and sixty into the surf; I ran away with two tubs on my head; that is, I went away; and I saw the excise officers pull up the tubs; I came back and spoke to Quick, and asked him for a tub, as I had lost my voyage; he said, he might as well give me the whole seizure; I proposed that he should drop one in the water, and I should pick it up after he was gone, but he refused; about two hours after Quick had seized them, there came down a gang of people on horseback and foot, about twenty-five or thirty, they were most of them on horseback.</p>
               <p>Did they come of themselves, these persons, or were they brought by any body? - There was a man went away from our boat, and came back among the party; the party had whips and sticks; they were some larger, and some smaller, about three inches round, not so large as my fist at the end, but large knobs; the whips were large whips, thick at one end, and small at the other; a long lash to them, as nigh as I can guess, about the size of that; Quick called to his people, when these persons came, to desire they would stand in defence of the goods; the people stood at some distance, I suppose it might be about twenty or thirty yards, as nigh as I can guess; he told them to stand off, or he would fire, and they made him answer, d - n your eyes, you b - g - r, fire, and he fired in upon them immediately.</p>
               <p>Did they strike? - They struck several people, but I cannot find out who struck in particular, only one man that struck me, I found his name out, but I never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with his person particularly? - Not intimately acquainted, but I had been on shore before with him; I have known him about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Take care of the answer you give to this question; are you sure he was one of them? - I am sure the man was in company, and more particularly, he spoke to a man, not to beat me, because I belonged to the boat.</p>
               <p>Was you struck? - I fancy some of the party took me to be one of the officers; and the prisoner rode up, and prevented my being struck any more, being one of the boat.</p>
               <p>You know his name, I take it for granted? -

             otherwise Brandy, he used to be called by the name of Brandy; he had a whip in his hand; it was a large whip, about the size of that; (holding it up in this manner) the small part of it in his hand.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt, have you, whatever, that he was there? - No, sir, not in the least.</p>
               <p>And that he was so armed as you have described? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Breedon, pray where do you live now? - At the Isle of Wight.</p>
               <p>At Cowes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Ever since this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before? - At Parsley, near Pool, in Dorsetshire.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived there? - I suppose, on and off, about two years; I rented a house.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this service of smuggling? - Me, sir! I was never long in it; I never went but one voyage before that.</p>
               <p>Then you was one of this notable party I presume? - No, sir, I was not; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100139"></xptr>one of the boat's crew, but the boat's crew has nothing to do with the party; I was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Do you go by no other name than Breedon; what is your honorable title that you go by in the neighbourhood? - The people call me Jack the Painter.</p>
               <p>I suppose, that is because they know your character well; you are a very good sort of a man, I presume? - I cannot help what character the people give me.</p>
               <p>You know a man of that name was hanged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I find that Mr. Quick and you could not agree about this tub for the whale? - No.</p>
               <p>But you, knowing the complexion of Quick, drop it on the sand, says you, and I will pick it up, Mr. Quick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you make your peace afterwards, now you are become a notable witness for the crown; how many tubs have you had since? - None.</p>
               <p>I suppose, you went up unsolicited and made a full discovery? - I made application.</p>
               <p>Who applied to you first? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Did not you go before some gentleman in the commission of the peace for the county of Dorset? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to go there? - I went there to give the true state of the case; I was obliged to surrender.</p>
               <p>When you had made this affidavit and swore to Vincent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you went before an Honourable Judge, Mr. Justice Buller, and swore a second time to his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now after having taken these two bold steps, where did you go to next? - On board the cutter.</p>
               <p>That was not the way to find him, did not you go to Newgate? - No, sir, I never went to Newgate to see the person of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>You never did go there? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all that you have swore is just as true as that? - Yes, I did not go to Newgate to see him, I did not see him in Newgate; I went in company with another man, that was Mr. Cross.</p>

               <p>I understood Mr. Cross to swear, that he went in alone? - I did not go in with him.</p>
               <p>Who went in with him? - I do not know; I stood on the outside; I never went in.</p>
               <p>That is a little extraordinary, because, I believe, you went for the purpose of going in? - No, sir, I did not intend to go in.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go into the goal? - Because I knew the men, if I had gone in, would have thought I should have pointed him out to them.</p>
               <p>Then have you never declared to any human being that that man was not present at the time of that affray? - I declare so now, sir.</p>
               <p>You never have? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know a gentleman of the name of Akerman? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know the person of the keeper of Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from? - I live at Cowes.</p>
               <p>Did you and Cross come together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the parish of Hemhurst? - I cannot say I know it by that name.</p>
               <p>You know what I mean? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You swear you have known the person of the prisoner twelve months, do you happen to know where he lived? - To the best of my knowledge he lived at Red Hill, I do not know what parish it is in.</p>
               <p>How far is Red Hill from this scene of action? - I cannot be positive to the length of it.</p>
               <p>No, no, do not treat it in that way; what do you think, is it five miles? - To the best of my knowledge it might, I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. About what distance do you take it to be, as near as you can guess? - I do not know the proper distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100140"></xptr>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Let us try your memory another way, do you recollect the substance of the affidavit you made before the justice in Hampshire? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear before that magistrate that he had actually beaten you or some of the party? - No, sir, I did not; I swore that Northeast beat me, and that he spoke to him not to beat me.</p>
               <p>You being on board this boat, was very much on the look out; do you happen to know what time of day it was when you landed your goods? - I cannot say, I suppose it might be about eleven or twelve, I cannot be positive to the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney. When did you make the first affidavit respecting this matter? - I think it was the 7th or 8th.</p>
               <p>Soon after the transaction, was it? - Yes, I believe it was the next day to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you then mention the prisoner by name to the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now as to this nick-name, is it a common thing among smugglers, do not they give one another nick-names almost always? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been at the prisoner's house? - I know no further than I was told so by

               <p>Is it from that information then that leads you to think that the prisoner was of the party, or your own knowledge? - I swore positively to the prisoner from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Were not you instructed not to go into Newgate? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington objected that it was necessary to the construction of the words of this act of parliament, for the counsel for the prosecution to prove that these were goods which had been exported on debenture or certificate, which was over-ruled by the Court; but they observed, that as it was in the record, if the objection was good the prisoner would not be proscribed by a verdict of guilty.</p>

               <p>What time of the day was it he called at your house? - Between ten and twelve,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100143"></xptr>or near about twelve, to the best of my remembrance, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing with him remarkable? - No, nobody was with him, nor any thing he had with him.</p>
               <p>How far is Red Hill from Bourne bottom? - I cannot justly say, because I never went the road much, but I suppose I have heard it was about four miles.</p>
               <p>Was he flurried at all? - He came in as calm as he used to do when he called as he came by; I thought he was going to Poole on some business.</p>

               <p>Was he on horseback or on foot? - I never saw any horse that he had, he was not on horseback when he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - No, I do not remember he had so much as a stick or whip, or any thing; I have lived in that place ever since I was born; I keep house there.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a witness of the name of Breedon? - I saw him at a public-house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>What character did he bear? - He bore but a very indifferent character about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Would you believe him on his oath? - I do not know that I would.</p>
               <p>Do you know that you would not? - I should chuse not to do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Whereabout is Park-stone? - About a mile and a quarter from Poole.</p>
               <p>It is near East Bourne-bottom? - It is a little nearer than Poole.</p>

               <p>Is it one mile or two? - It is four or five miles.</p>
               <p>Is your house further from Bourne-bottom than Red Hill is? - I cannot say whether there may be much difference, I never went the road, and I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman or single? - A single woman.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a public-house or a private, one? - Nothing but a private house.</p>

               <p>How came you to recollect his calling on you the 6th of November? - I will tell you very remarkably, because we heard there was such a great rupture on the shore there, and we knew it to be the day after the 5th of November, and so we knew it to be the 6th, not only that, but we knew that we heard the found of such a rupture being on the shore.</p>
               <p>That is true, you may remember the riot at the shore, but how did that make you remember that Mr. Vincent, who was in the habit of calling upon you, called on you that day? - I do not know how it was, but I remember it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the 6th? - I should not have recollected it being the 6th, or any thing, but I know it was one day after the 5th of November; we do not have a great many call on us, and by that means I remember.</p>
               <p>Did you put it down? - No.</p>
               <p>What day in the week was it? - I cannot positively say the day of the week.</p>
               <p>When had he called on you before? - A week or two before.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect the day? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor the day of the month? - No, nor I should not have recollected this, if it had not been for the 5th of November.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100144"></xptr>How often? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him since January last? - Yes, a good many times.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that he called upon you frequently? - Yes, when he went to Poole, he used to call.</p>
               <p>Can you fix any day in January, February, or March, that he called upon you? - I should, not have remembered that day, but because it was such a remarkable day; the day after the 5th of November; and then hearing the disturbances, I knew him to have called there that day.</p>
               <p>What is the latest day that you have seen him, or the latest month, I will not fix you to a day? - I saw him about seven weeks ago, I believe.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the habit of seeing him, from November, frequently, down to six or seven weeks ago? - Yes, I have, when he used to go to Poole, he used to call.</p>
               <p>You mean to say, that he was frequently seen during the month of January and February and March? - I might not see him for a month.</p>

               <p>You do not know how far it is from Parkstone to Bourne-bottom? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>I understood you at first, to say, that Parkstone was nearer to Bourne-bottom than Red-hill is, do you mean that or not? - I do not know that there is any odds in it; some say, that it is so far from the place, others might say not.</p>
               <p>You were well acquainted with this man? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Down to what time did your acquaintance with him continue? - Why, I suppose, I knew him four or five years ago, and continued to know him till the man was taken and carried away; I cannot remember how long that was exactly.</p>
               <p>About how long? - I think it is near about a month or five weeks, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Within these two months, however? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him frequently, during all that time? - Yes, sir, I saw him once now and then.</p>

               <p>When was that? - I do imagine that I have not seen him for more than a month sometimes.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear of any proclamation for him to surrender? - No, sir.</p>

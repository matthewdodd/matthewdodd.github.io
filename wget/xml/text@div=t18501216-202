                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of York-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was my town traveller—his duties were to take samples round to the trade, to get orders, to enter the orders when he returned, and to bring back the samples—he was never to leave his sample-box or books at his own lodging, but to bring them back, however late—I received information, and on 25th Nov. went with a police-sergeant to Ravenscroft-street, near Shoreditch Church—I went into the prisoner's room—he was not there—I found a vast quantity of books lying about, some of them packed in brown paper, ready for carrying away; others stood in a large cupboard, half-open; and there were, I think, thirty or forty in a box—most of those in the cupboard were the "Standard Library," the "Scientific Library," and the "Illustrated Library," duplicate and triplicate copies—I am the publisher of those—I found altogether 169 books, which cost me at least 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of them had not been published a fortnight; they were that month's volumes, such as "Kitto's Sacred Lands," of which here are six copies; "Cicero's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160007"></xptr>
               <p>Offices," of which there are four copies; three of "Sewell's Horace" and "Plato"—none of these are cut—he had no business with them at his place—I had not sold them to him—he could never want back samples, or more than one copy, to show to the trade, which we call subscribing—when he has dune with them at night it was his duty to deposit them in the stock—I had not the slightest idea that he took them home—these books are mine(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has he been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five years altogether; his salary originally was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, it being his father's salary, and his mother was dependent upon it; I discharged him for taking away a favourite porter, and re<lb></lb>commending him to another house; but he pleaded hard, and I allowed him to stay, at a guinea a week, while he was getting a new place—he afterwards said he felt he had done wrong, and I re-engaged him, at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and promised that if he behaved properly he should be raised to his original salary—his expenses were allowed him, and were paid him by the clerk, either on Saturday, when he received his salary, or else at the time he spent money—there was no one for him to account to at night for bringing the books back—the warehouseman would be there, but he knew just as well where to put them—he had to take out from one to six books in a day, but at Christmas one or two boxfulls—his hours were from nine to eight; but it was his duty to be in and show himself before dark—every one of these works is complete in itself, and is published separately—here is a manuscript book in my own writing, which I identify—it was originally lent to the prisoner, to copy, on my premises—he had no right to take it away—none of these books have any mark on them—I cannot swear to them—I should not like to say certainly that I could ascertain by taking stock whether I had lost these books; the stock might not be taken accurately; I should know that I had lost a number of books—I never sent the prisoner with books to reviewers; that is the province of the advertising clerk—I do not know that reviewer's copies are often brought back cheap; they do sometimes come into the market cheaper than printers' copies, after they have been reviewed, but not in any numbers; and they are always stamped on the title-page by the advertising clerk, if he did his duty; and if the reviewer did his duty he would cut the book; they do not always do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rutland Terrace, Forest Hill—on Tuesday morning, 5th February, about half-past seven, in consequence of what my servant said, I went down to my fowl-house at the end of my garden, and missed all my fowls but one, that was setting in a kennel; and the head of a pigeon that I had was cut off, and the body taken—eleven fowls were taken—the necks of two had been wrung off and thrown in a field—they had been safe at nine o'clock the night before—I traced the feathers across a meadow to the back of my house, and found two of my fowls lying dead there, with their feathers on—my wife went and fetched them—I gave information to the police, and that same evening I went to the station and identified some of the feathers of my fowls, also the cock's tail, which I could swear to, and the feet—I also recognised the heads of two other fowls.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 5th February, I went to the prosecutor's house—I found the fowl-house had been broken open—I traced feathers over the railway, within thirty yards of the prisoner's house—I went to the prisoner's house, and knocked at the door—his wife, who was inside, said, "Who's there?"—I said, "Is Mr. Church at home?"—she said, "No, he is out"—I looked in, and the house was completely strewed with feathers and blood—there were seven fowls on the table already picked, and there were some heads and legs—she had the cock's legs in her hand when she opened the door to me—I afterwards found a fowl's head and some legs in</p>

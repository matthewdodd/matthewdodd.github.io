            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I remember the deceased being brought to the Hospital on Saturday, the 22nd of April. On examining him, I discovered a contusion on the forehead, and a mortification of the foot and leg, and a fracture of the larger bone of the leg. It appeared that the fracture had arisen from violence, either a blow or a fall might produce it, and suppose the injury might have been done three or four days; It is impossible to say exactly. The mortification which had succeeded, would certainly occasion death. I don't think the decased could have walked after the fracture. I attribute the mortification to the fracture, and the violence done to the leg. There were a few excoriation or scars about the knee; they were not of a recent nature. The mortification had proceeded to that lenght that amputation was necessaray. The amputation took place, and the deceased survived it but twelve minutes or a quarter of an hour. I attibute his death to the violence done to the leg, and to the mortification.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. The deceased had been seven days in the Hospital before the amputation took place; there was a fever on the deceased, which were symptomatick.</p>

In April last, I was in my own house, and I remember the male prisoner, the deceased, and another boy coming at about ten o'clock in the morning; it was the 2nd of April; they went into a room over my head, which was empty, for the purpose of sweeping the chimney. After they had been there some time, I heard the cries of a child screaming violently, and I heard blows. In consequence of this I called Mrs. Reeves, who went up stairs and I followed her. The first thing I saw when I got into the room was the prisoner, stooping up the chimney shaking back handed at the child up the chimney with such a brush as chimney sweepers usuly have; the child was screaming violently, and had been screaming for half an hour before we went up. I told him the child was not his own, or he would not use it so; he said it was nothing to me, and pulled him down by his legs, and dashed him down on the hearh stone. The child layed on its back, and received a violent blow on the back of its head by this fall. I told him if I was not confined in the manner in which I was, namely child-bed, I would lay an information against him. The child was then put up the chimney; he lifted it up in his arms and put it up the chimney, and put the other boy after it, The other boy was about ten years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The other boy went up without force or violence. I went down stairs then, and did not see the little boy afterwards.</p>

            . On the day the last witness has mentioned, I remember the prisoner and the two boys coming to our house to sweep the chimney. I remember Mrs. Ware calling to me, and my going up stairs with her into the room where the prisoner was. Before she called me, I had not heard any noise. The little boy was then some little distance up the chimney; I could not see any part of him. The prisoner was standing by the chimney, and he was extending his arm up the chimney, and I saw him bring the child down by its little legs. I don't know whether I was in the room before Mrs. Ware or not. Then he put him up the chimney again, and the child cried, and said his knees hurted him. Then the child came down again; he took it by the back part of its little breeches, and dashed it on the hearth. Then he put it on the big boys back, and sent him up the chimney, and when they came down again, the prisoner took the hearth broom, and struck the little boy several blows on the back and loins. He was then standing on the hearth shaking the soot off its cloths, It put its little shoes on, and trembled very much, and the prisoner put a black bag on it, and then they went down. The child walked down stairs with his hand against the wall, and the prisoner turned round to him, and swore he would serve him out. I followed them down towards the door, and saw them walk out.</p>
               <p>Evidence was here about to given of some transactions supposed to have taken place relative to the prisoner and the deceased on the 23rd of April, the day stated in the indictment to be the day on which the deceased sustaind the injuries that occasioned his death but</p>
               <p>THE COURT, Interposed to prevent such evidence from being given, in as much as the prosecuting party had gone in the first instance to establish the guilt of the prisoners by evidence of a transaction which took place so far back as the 2nd of April; it was by no means from any desire to stifle inquirs or prevent the ends of justice that the court here interposed, because in all cases, but more particularly perhaps where the case of a helpless infant came under consideration injury would always be traced as far as consistence with regularity would permit.</p>

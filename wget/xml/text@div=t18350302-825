I live in Harrow-road, and have one partner—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in our service as conductor to one of the omnibuses—it was his duty to put the proceeds of the omnibus into a parcel, and leave it at the toll-gate in the Hampstead-road—the omnibus ran from Kentish-town to Leadenhall-street, and he was to take 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for his own wages—I went to the gate on Monday, the 2nd of February, and several days afterwards, to see if he had left the money, and he had not—he was then gone—I met him in Tottenham-court-road on the 20th of February—I gave him into custody—he said he had received 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on my account, on the 1st of February, and that he had taken his wages from the same, and had incurred some expense, but what I could not make out, and the remainder was so little, he did not think it of any account—he sometimes took 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the two journeys.</p>

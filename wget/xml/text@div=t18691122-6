I am the wife of George Benningfield, tobacconist, of 60, St. Martin's Le Grand—on Wednesday, 27th October, about 6 p.m., the prisoner came in for a three-halfpenny cigar, and gave me a sixpence—I gave him change, and he turned to go, but my husband tried the sixpence, found it was bad, and went after him—I had put it in a drawer where there were two old sixpences—this was a new one, and the old ones were at the back of the tray—two days afterwards my husband called me into the shop, and I saw the prisoner and identified him.</p>

On 27th October my wife served the prisoner with a cigar, and he left—shortly afterwards I looked in the till and found a bad sixpence in front of the tray—I did not notice whether there were others—I went to look after him—on 29th October, about 3 o'clock, I served the prisoner with a cigar, and he gave me a bad sixpence—I called my wife, and said, "Do you know this man?"—she said, "This is the man who passed the bad sixpence the other day"—I do not remember whether the prisoner said anything—I gave him in charge with the two sixpences.</p>

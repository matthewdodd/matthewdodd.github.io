            . I am an Excise inspector on the River Thames. In consequence of information which I received, on the 17th of March I went on board the Alliance, and gauged the puncheons Nos. 7, 11, 28, 32, 33, and 41, were deficient; in all thirty-four gallons were deficient. I seized the rum on account of the deficiency. They did not appear to have leaked at all. There were spiles in four or five of them.</p>

            . I was cabin-boy on board the Alliance - the prisoner was mate. I remember the puncheons of rum being shipped on board, some of them were seized.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any of them were seized, had you and the prisoner any thing to do with them - A. Yes, the mate told me to go down into the hold and fetch some rum, I said I would not go; he said if I did not he would flog me. The captain was not on board at the time, and the prisoner had the command of the ship. He went, pulled a key from his pocket, and took a half-anker - he got down into the hold, and called me down; I went down, he took a gimlet from his pocket, and bored a hole in the top and side of one of the casks - he made me hold the half-anker, and half filled it - he took about two gallons. He then went and gave the people some work on the top of the vessel, that they might not come down to see him. He then came down and put spiles in the top and side of the puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to more than one puncheon at once - A. He filled the half-anker out of two puncheons that day, and gave it to me through the hole, to put in his birth where he sleeps. He afterwards told me that he had sold the rum to a man in a boat, for 28 s. I told the captain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days before he was taken up did you take the first quantity of rum - A. I do not know; I was on board when he was taken - it was two or three days before he was taken up. Nobody charged me with stealing it. I told the captain of it two or three days after, on the same day that Gatty came on board; I was with him, and told him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you spill much in taking it - A. A great deal.</p>

            . I am surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 20th of March I apprehended the prisoner on board the Alliance. The last witness went into the cabin with me. I saw the prisoner, and asked the boy, in his presence, which way they got the rum out of the hold? he pointed to the scuttle, and said they got it up that way; and that they put it in an half-anker. I asked him what they did with it? he said they put it in the mate's cabin. I turned to the prisoner, and asked him what he said to it? He speaks English distinctly. He said it was all true. I asked him what he did with it, whether he took it to the shore, or whether anybody got it away? He said a man came on board and fetched it. I asked him what the man gave him for it? He said 28 s. for three half-ankers, which is about twelve gallons. The captain gave me the information. The prisoner went with me to find the man whom he said had bought it.</p>

               <p>"A man came three or four times on board to sell stockings, waistcoats, breeches and knives, and asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210077"></xptr>several times if I had any spirits or tobacco to sell. When we were loading rum he came sometimes on board, and said I should try to get some rum to sell him. I had a half-anker on board, I filled that out of the hold, and sold it to him. He fetched it. Another day he brought an empty one, and I sold him a full one. He a third time brought an empty half-anker - I filled that, and sold it to him. He asked for some more, but I would not let him have any more. He gave me 28 s. for each half-anker. The man to whom I sold the rum is a Swede, and I know he is a patrol. I have seen him in Ratcliff-highway about eleven or twelve o'clock at night."</p>

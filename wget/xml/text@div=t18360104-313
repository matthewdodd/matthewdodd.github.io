                  </hi>. I am a shopman to Mr. Soulby, of Cheapside. On the 31st of December, about a quarter or twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner in the door<lb></lb>way—I am quite sure he is the person—there was a gas-light in the door-way—there are sashes to the window—the one nearest the door was open—I saw the prisoner put his hand into the window, reach round from the door-way, and run away with a bundle of silk handkerchiefs—the window is glazed towards the street, and has a sash within—he crossed Cheapside, and ran down Bucklersbury—I ran, crying, "Stop thief," and never lost sight of him till be turned down Pancras-lane; and in half a minute after I saw him in custody—I found the handkerchiefs in Pancreas-lane, not two yards from him—the officer stopped him—one of the handkerchiefs was taken from him in my presence—the others I picked up—they were all cut and hemmed—there are thirty-two in all.</p>

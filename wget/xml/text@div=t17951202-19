            Most certainly; I made strict enquiry after it; in the course of an hour after, the prisoner, Jesson, was brought to the ship, to the best of my knowledge, by William Elby, and another person whom I should know if I saw him; when Elby brought him on board, he said, he stopped a box of sugar from the prisoner and another person; the prisoner informed him they had it from the ship; he asked me if I had lost such a thing; I said undoubtedly I had; he said Jesson informed him it came from my ship, the Rose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the company of Elby. - A. Yes, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was not brought with him? - A, No, I said I had lost a box, and supposed it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of this, go any where with the prisoner and Elby? - No, I did not; they left the ship, and at five or six o'clock I went to the Public-office, Shadwell, there I saw the box, (The box produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the quantity of sugar in it? - A. About forty pounds; when I saw it at the office there was more sugar in it than when I saw it before.</p>

               <p>On his Cross-examination by Mr. Knowlys. He said there were two other persons in the boat besides Jesson; that it is common for watermen to help in lifting boxes out of the boat when they are hired to bring them on shore; that he did not see the two men pay Jesson for bringing it, but that it is not customary for lumpers to pay any thing till they have disposed of their goods; that he told them, before he stopped them, that he could get a customer for them, in order that he might have an opportunity of sending for a constable.</p>
               <p>On being asked where he came from to give evidence, he said, from the New Prison, where he was for a quarrel; that he had been there a week, or rather better; that he did not ask any body to be bail for him, because he did not chuse to trouble any body.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the Public Office, Shadwell; I was sent for about two o'clock, on the 3d of November, to go to the Queen Catherine, in Brook-street; I went, and saw both the prisoners there; I found Payne sitting along side this box; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Jesson's Defence. - About one o'clock, I was rowing about, and these two lumpers called sculler; I went to them, and they put this box in the boat, and I carried them to Ratcliff-cross stairs; Payne was employed to carry the box, and before I got my money they ran away.</p>
               <p>(Jesson called five witnesses who had known him, many years, and gave him a good character).</p>
               <p>Payne's Defence. - I have plyed at Ratcliff-cross twenty years as a porter; a man came up to me, and said, there was a box in the boat to be carried to the mates house, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020025"></xptr>should be paid when I came there; it was covered over; I did not know that it was sugar; I slipped off the curb-stone, some sugar sell out, and then they ran away.</p>

On the 22d of January I lost my till, and some money, from my shop - I cannot tell what money there was in it - I had seen it safe about half-past ten o'clock at night. My shop is generally open till about eleven. I was in the back parlour, and no one was in the shop. I was putting up my shutters, about eleven o'clock, when some persons passed my shop, and I heard that they had taken some thieves. I called my man to mind the shop while I went to Mr. Cooper's, at the corner of Hereford-street, and saw my till, and some copper, on the counter there. The prisoners were then in custody. I then went back to my shop, and missed the till and money.</p>

            . I live in Stafford-street, near Mr. Gillett's, and am a milk-man. I was passing Hereford-street on the 22d of January, and saw the two prisoners running towards me about the middle of the street. I heard one of them say to the other, "Let us go in here," meaning into the carcass of a house. I immediately hallooed over to them, "What have you got there?" and they ran off. I pursued them a short distance, and called to a watchman. He went out near them. They threw down the till, turned round and ran towards me again. I heard the money drop. They jumped down into a foundation, which is dug for some more houses. I immediately went after them, and in a few minutes a light was brought, and I took them both, concealed in two separate vaults. Robinson asked me to let him go, as he had neither father or mother. Smith asked me to let him wash his hands, which he did. I asked him why he did not apply for relief to the parish? he said it was no use.</p>

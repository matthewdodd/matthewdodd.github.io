                  </hi>. I am a builder at Plumstead in Kent—Darley has never been in my service, Ward has, at three different times, eighteen months past; the last time for about thirteen weeks, up to the time he was taken into custody—he was in my service then, he worked at piece-work or task-work as they term it—about half-past 5 in the evening of 23d December, two constables came with the two prisoners in their custody to my house—previous to their coming I had gone across the road out of the house—mine is a public-house—when I came in at the door, the boards' were lying at the door—I said to Ward, "Halloa, this looks like some of my timber;" and said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "Is this some you have taken away in the cart this afternoon"—he said, "Yes"—I had not seen the cart; I was not able to get out—I had given him authority to take a board for work that he required, but that would not have taken him more than two boards—instead of that, he obtained a cart and took a cart-load—I had given him authority to take two boards—he said in the presence of the two constables, "I dare say it will be paid for"—they were taken to the station-house—I was with the constable to Ward's house, but was not able to go inside—I saw some wood there, there were some forty pieces of various descriptions brought out of that house, put into a cart and taken to the station-house—those forty pieces were my property—we have some of the stuff in Court which I pur<lb></lb>chased—I know this to be mine by the peculiar way of cutting, and the class of goods—it is a class of goods that is not generally used—they are here—this timber is bought in this shape, in the whole, it is five inch cut, and then cut this way twice—this other one, much larger, was found in the bakery, and the other at Ward's house, and it exactly corresponds—it is cut in London before I purchase it—it is cut to my order, as it is now—the lesser ones were found at Ward's house, and this at the baker's shop, one much larger—I can positively identify a portion of that found at Ward's place as my property—I never gave him any authority to take it away—I never sold him it—I did not know of my own knowledge that he was working at this baker's shop until the Saturday previous—I had not seen him working there—the long piece which he had in his house is a piece of very thin floor-board; this was purchased at the same place—I know that to be my property—I have seen that on my premises; a great quantity of the same class of goods—there is no particular mark on it that I know it by, more than it is white wood—I had never given him any authority to take that wood away or to sell it—we have a portion of the four pieces that were at the door (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is my property—this is a piece that was cut off—there are four pieces, eight feet six inches long—I identify them as mine; no doubt whatever about it—I never sold any of that or gave him permission to take them away—those I told him to take were for battening in a small pair of gates for a side entrance—they were thicker than this—that was for some work on my premises—I went to a bakr's shop in Plum<lb></lb>stead, and there took a piece of wood away—it forms a portion of this other wood, and forms a five-inch square—I have only valued the forty pieces of wood at fifty shillings—they are various lengths and widths; pieces that were taken at different times.</p>

               <p>not generally—I cannot say that I am the only builder who these timber merchants send white wood to—this other piece, found at the baker's, exactly corresponds with the other pieces, allowing for the saw out—the prisoner told me that he had been working at the baker's shop—that was the reason I went there—I should have known nothing about it unless he had told me—he was working for me at piece-work—I did not know that he was working for other persons besides—there would be nothing wrong in his doing so—he did not defraud me of any portion of his time by so doing—it did not matter for how many people he worked—I do not know that he had been in the Royal Arsenal before he was with me—I don't know that he was making a pair of large gates, and a glass door and shutter for Mr. Flanders—I know Mr. Flanders; he is here; and I know Mr. Gaselee, a builder, by sight; he is here—I did not go inside the prisoner's premises—I believe his kitchen had been under repair—I cannot say that he used that as a work<lb></lb>shop—I don't know that in consequence of that being under repair he took some timber from his own premises to my place to work—I have never heard it—I keep a public-house as well as being a builder—there are two other pieces of wood here that I identify—there is no mark on it; only it corresponds exactly with the pieces I have left—it is used for different pur<lb></lb>poses, such as up-rights for partitions for small cottage buildings.</p>

There was some yellow timber taken to the station besides the white; that was selected from mine, and there it is for Mr. Flanders when he likes to come for it—I do not identify that; it is a different thickness to mine—I never identified it as mine.</p>

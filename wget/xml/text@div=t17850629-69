            , last Sunday, between three and seven, I lost seventeen guineas and an half, and two shirts, I was out at three, and back again at ten; I am sure they were there when I went out, and the box was broke open; it was kept behind the room where I used to work, I found one of the shirts at the prisoner's daughter's house, in King Edward's street, Mile-end New Town: the reason I had for accusing the prisoner was , he returned some of the money back again the next morning, he said he had been in fault, and was sorry for it, and I told him if he would return the money I would not trouble him; upon my telling him that, he returned me a part of the money, I only found one shirt, the other he had on, as he said himself, I did not examine it, he told me he had the shirt on before I promised not to trouble him.</p>

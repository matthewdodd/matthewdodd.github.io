I am the wife of George Sutton, and live next door but one to the prosecutrix—on 18th March, between nine and ten o'clock at night, in consequence of hearing something, I went to Mrs. Wheatley's house—as I got up, the street-door wan opened upon me, and the male prisoner came out—he put his fingers through the key-hole of the door, and shut it after him—I said, "What do you do here? I am sure you have no business here, you have nothing to do with Wheatley's family. I think you must be the thief"—I took hold of the collar of his coat and held him—I called to a man who stood some distance off to come and assist me—I do not know the female prisoner at all—she does not live near us.</p>

I sent for an officer, who examined the premises, and said it must have been done by somebody who knew the way of the house. There was no appearance of outward violence. I have a lodger, who is a salesman at Covent-Garden market; he goes out very early, and leaves the door on the lock, unbolted; anybody might come in who had got a key.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. On Thursday, the 26th of November, the prisoner offered a pair of trowsers, two waistcoats, and a handkerchief, for sale. I questioned him to know if they were his own property. I suspected him, took him to Lambeth-street Office, and gave him in charge of Griffiths, who found five tea-spoons in his pocket. When he was before the magistrate he confessed to robbing the house, and said where it was.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. The prisoner was given into my charge by Lewis, on the 26th of November, in the morning. I searched him, and found five silver tea-spoons in his breeches-pocket. He was taken before the magistrate that day, and charged on suspicion of this robbery, and committed until the Thursday following. After he left the office he said, if I went with him, he would show me where all the property was, but he could not tell me without going with me. The magistrate gave me leave to put him in the watch-house that night. I put him in a coach next morning, he ordered it to drive to the Obelisk in St. George's-fields; when he got there he ordered it to drive on, and he would point out where it was to stop, and told him to turn to South-street, Lambeth; when we got there, he desired him to stop at the Marquis Wellesley public-house, kept by Cribb; we went in there. I took him into the passage, and asked the landlord if he knew him? He said Yes. I asked him to show me the room where he lodged. Before he took me up stairs, he produced a clock, which he said the prisoner had left in the bar; the prisoner acknowledged leaving it there. We went up two pair of stairs into his room, as soon as we got into the room the prisoner stooped down himself, and pulled a bundle from under the bed, and said that was part of the property, and if I would open the closet, I should see a box, where all the rest was. I found all the property stated in the indictment there. Three legs of pork were packed up with the clothes, which the prosecutor claimed. I took him to the office, with the property.</p>

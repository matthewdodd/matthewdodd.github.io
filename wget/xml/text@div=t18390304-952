                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I have been married to him ten years and two months; he is a seafaring man—we have been living apart for four years—I have two children by him, one nine, and the other six years old. On Wednesday night, the 27th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, he came to my lodging, in Bluegate-fields, Shadwell, under the pretence of proposing to leave me his half-pay to take the two children out of the workhouse, and go to sea again—we stopped and talked together for about an hour—he then wished me to go out and drink with him—I went, and bad one glass of gin and water—I persuaded him, if he meant to do what he proposed, to go home and go to bed, as he had had sufficient, for he was very tipsy when he came to me—it was near upon between ten and eleven o'clock—he went back with me—I have only one room—as soon as he got into the room he began irritating his temper, and said he would not sleep with me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that was not the proposal he made when he came to me, and directly I said that, he up with his fist, and knocked me down on the floor, and kicked me on ray arm with his foot—it is quite black from the elbow to the shoulder—I got up, and he knocked me down again, and jumped upon me—I took hold of his collar to prevent his going out, and then he knocked me down the stairs—my head caught one corner of the stairs, and both feet caught in the bannisters—I called out for help, and the witness Sanders came to my assistance—she got my feet out of the bannisters, and I got up again—he knocked me down again against a room door, and the door came open—there was a mahogany chair standing within the door—he took it up, smashed it all to pieces, and with one piece hit</p>

               <p>me over the knee, saying, with an oath, "I will do for you, but I will do what I can now"—I then lost my senses, and cannot remember more—Sanders went out to look for a policeman, and when she came back he was gone—I was conveyed to the London Infirmary next morning, and have been there ever since—there was a wound in the side of my knee that I could bury the first joint of my finger in—I have suffered a great deal of pain from it within the last few days, and have been confined to my bed—my knee was violently bruised, besides the hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house. A little before twelve o'clock at night I was in bed, and heard a noise up stairs—I took up a light, and gave it to the prosecutrix—(I sleep one pair of stairs below her)—they were in their own room—I saw the prisoner knock her down two or three times while I was standing there, and kick her on her arm with his foot—I got her up, and sat her down—her clothes were all torn off—whether it was done by him I do not know, but she had not a bit of clothes upon her—I returned to my own room—they came down stairs, and he knocked her down, and burst my room door open—I got out of bed, got her up, and went in-doors again—he kicked her down stairs—I came out again, and eased her foot out of the bannisters—the chair was broken while I was gone for the policeman—just as I was coming back I met the prisoner going to get a policeman himself—I found the prosecutrix in the passage, without a bit of clothes on her—I took her up stairs, and put her to bed, and saw where her knee was cut with the piece of chair—it was bleeding so much I could hardly see what was the matter—it was ragged and bruised—she seemed to suffer great pain—she was sober—the prisoner was in such a passion I could hardly tell what state he was in—I really think, if it had not been for assistance, he would have murdered her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at the London Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there about the middle of the day—I found a wound on her left knee—it was a very uneven wound, not as if done by a cutting instrument—it was not very severe in itself, from the situation it was in—it is now going on very well—it must have been done with violence—a piece of a chair would make such a wound—it was about half an inch deep, and rather above the cap of the knee—there were also extensive bruises on the left arm, and rather severe—she did not appear to have suf<lb></lb>fered a great deal—she complained of other parts of her body, but very slightly—they were of no moment—she will be cured without being lame—the wound itself would be very immaterial in any other part of the body—if it had been on the middle of the thigh, it would hare been of no im<lb></lb>portance at all, except making her lame for the time.</p>

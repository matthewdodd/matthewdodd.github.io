                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live in Lawrence-lane, City. On Saturday night, the 16th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I met the prisoner in Leicester-square, and went with her to Heming's-row, and afterwards to Princes-street—we had a glass of gin-and-water in Heming's row, and another in Princes-street—I was drunk—I had a watch when I went into Princes-street—I had seen it a very short time before I met the prisoner—it was fixed to me by a guard—it cost more than twenty guineas—I fell asleep in Princes-street for about twenty minutes, and when I awoke I found my watch in the policeman's hands—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican in Princes-street. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner at my house, standing in front of the bar together—the was persuading him to treat several other people who were round, to pints of beer—I afterwards watched, and saw the prisoner take the watch from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's waistcoat pocket—she bit the guard through, and pulled it away, and deposited it somewhere about her person—she took his hat off, took the handkerchief out of it, and put it under her shawl—I sent for the policeman on seeing the handkerchief taken, before I saw the watch taken—he came in at the time, went up to her, and she put the watch down—the policeman said, "That won't do."</p>

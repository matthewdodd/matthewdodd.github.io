                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Fiskin, of 4, Wood-street, Cheapside, lace-merchant. On the night of 19th Oct., I went to Pearce, Allan's, and Stone's, Waterloo-house, with a parcel of lace—the house was shut up, and as I returned I met Williams, who said, "It is a nice even<lb></lb>ing"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he asked me to go of an errand for him—I said no, I had a parcel—he said well that would not matter, if I would go he would give me sixpence or a shilling—I did not know him before—I said I would go, to oblige him—we were then going up St. Martin's-lane, and he said he would wait at the Star and Garter—I went in with him there, and he said, "Go to that stationer's in St. Martin's-court, and ask for Mr. James, he owes me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he is my brother; if you take the parcel, there may be a dispute"—I was going to leave it with the girl at the bar, and he said, "We need not trouble her," and I left the parcel with him—I returned shortly after—he was gone, and the lace also.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 142). On Saturday, 26th Oct., I met Furzman in Drury-lane, and told her I was about to take her into custody for being concerned in stealing some lace, which had been pledged at a pawnbroker's in Lambeth—she had a basket in her hand, and told me where she lived—I took her to the station, examined the basket, and found it contained 200 pieces of lace—I asked her where she got it from—she said from Mrs. Ryan, her landlady, No. 6, Queen's-place, Great Queen-street—I went there, saw Ryan, told her what Furzman said, and she said she gave the lace to Mrs. Furzman, to dispose of it in the best way she could—I searched Furzman's room, which Mrs. Ryan pointed out, and found a piece of lace, and sixty-nine duplicates, one of which relates to lace pledged at Mr. Dicker's, Lambeth-marsh, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Furzman was not then</p>

               <p>present—Ryan at first said she picked it up at the corner of the court, and while I was searching Furzman's room, she said, "I had better tell the truth about it, as I heard there was an advertisement in the paper, and I shall be obliged to tell the truth"—I said, "You can do as you like about it" —she then said she bought it of Warner, who lived in Great Wilde-street, a fishmonger, for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a few minutes after that, I asked her if she had any more—she went to her parlour, and then gave me another sixty pieces—I took her into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lace I found at her house and in the basket—I afterwards took Warner in Great Wilde-street, and told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and he said he recollected something about some lace he had sold to Mrs. Ryan, and she gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he got it from a man living at 9, Wilde-court, he did not know his name—I went there, and could find nobody who knew anything about it.</p>

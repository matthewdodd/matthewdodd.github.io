                  </hi>. I am foreman to William Turton Newton, and another, of Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. The prisoners were employed by him, Sharp at a journeyman plumber, and Walker as his labourer—it is the custom for them to work in pairs—my masters were building in Lowndes-st., Lowndes-square, Chelsea—about five in the afternoon of Tuesday, the 14th of Nov., I went there—the plumbers work till half-past five—I went into the second floor front room, and found them both—Walker was in one corner of the room, with his face to the wall and his back towards me—he appeared to be button<lb></lb>ing up bis clothes—Sharp was standing about six feet from him—he was not at work, and was quite near enough to see where Walker was—I asked Walker what he was doing there—Sharp replied that his brace button was burst—Walker gave no answer—I went up to him, ordered him to turn round and let me see whether he had got any thing—he turned, and was walking into another room—I told him to stop and unbutton his waistcoat—he did not do it—I opened his waistcoat and found a bar of lead, and a bar of solder rolled up in lead—I said, "This looks very like a brace button being broken"—he had a belt round him, which was taken from him at the station, that would enable him to carry these things—it has a strap to expand or con<lb></lb>tract according to circumstances—Sharp remained in the room during the whole of this, but did not say any thing—it would take a man a quarter of an hour to roll the solder in the lead and put it on this belt—the lead would have to be cut open first—it is pipe, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the solder about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the White Hart public-house, Temple Mills, Hackney—on 10th February I was driving out between half-past two and three in the afternoon, towards Walthamstow, and met the prisoners in Leyton, in Temple Mills Lane, coming from Walthamstow—they each had a parcel, which I saw was lead, because the handkerchief was not sufficiently long to cover it, and the ends were out—I took a policeman back to where I had seen them, and found them stooping down under a bank—they seemed to be knocking the lead together into smaller compass—when they saw me they ran away—I took Brown, and Henderson took Williams—when he first started he threw this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into a dry ditch—I picked it up as we came back—there was a third man, who stopped—we went after those who ran away, and the third one was not there when we came back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 140). Mr. Beresford gave me informa<lb></lb>tion, and I went back with him and saw three persons fully engaged—I got down to see what they had got, and they both ran away—the lesser one stood still—I got up in ray cart and overtook them—something tripped Williams up, and he fell—I apprehended him before he got up—we picked up the lead coming back which Brown had thrown away, and I pointed that spot out to a brother constable—it was a bank near a ditch with an arch, and a stream of water running through it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 129). I went to a place near the arch-way where the water runs, and found three parcels of lead—I afterwards went to an unoccupied house, and matched this lead with a vacancy on the parapet, and it fitted—I have seen this lead for years, and know it—I visited the place—the house belongs to the Hon. Lady Catherine Downay.</p>

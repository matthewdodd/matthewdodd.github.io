                  </hi>. I am an officer in H.M. Customs, and live at 52, St. George's Road, Peckham—on the afternoon of Saturday, 1st April, I was on the vatting floor of the London and Continental Wharf, at Wapping, which is in the possession of Messrs. Goulay, wine merchants—I was standing, talking to Mr. Geddes—I saw the prisoner come in—I recognized him as having been in the employment of Messrs. Goulay—Geddes was the first to speak, addressing the prisoner and a man named Taylor, who accompanied him, and who had also been discharged from the wharf—he said "I have nothing to do with your discharge"—the prisoner said "Yes, you have"—Geddes said "No, I have not; Mr. Goulay did it"—the prisoner then said "Mr. Goulay wants you"—Geddes said "Very well; when he sends for me, I will go"—the prisoner said "He does send for you; he wants you"—Geddes said "If he sends a special messenger for me, I will go"—the prisoner again said "He does want you"—Geddes said "I have nothing to do with your discharge, and I shan't go, unless a special messenger comes for me"—the prisoner then advanced towards Geddes, and said "I could" or "I would <hi rend="italic">scragg</hi> you"—he then placed his hands in this position, one at the back of Geddes' head, and one in front—I can't say that he actually seized him back and front, but his hands were put in such a position that I thought he intended carrying out what he said—the prisoner's back was towards me, and I could not say whether he touched or seized him—they immediately struggled together; it was a mutual testing for priority—I mean they were like two men struggling for the mastery—Geddes fell on his back—he was standing employed at the mouth of the vats, at the time, at what is called the man-hole—he was standing close to it all the time, not 3ft. from it—when he fell, he did not fall into the man-hole; he could not fall into it—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a small sketch of the place</hi>) this is a correct sketch of the vatting floor—it is a level floor, and there are four vats, each having a distinct man-hole—there are troughs, where several casks may be rolled and emptied at the same time, and the troughs empty themselves into the man-hole—when being used for the purpose of starting the wine into them, pieces of the floor are taken up—they were not removed at this time—Geddes was standing about a yard from this man-hole—he could not fall into it; impossible—I did not measure the orifice of the man-hole—I saw him fall down the man-hole, by the troughs, immediately over the man-hole—his head was pointing to the man-hole, his legs were a little raised up into the air—if the man-hole had been sufficiently large, he would have slipped down—his head was not in the man-hole, but in the shoot, or trough—the boards were taken off; it was all open—the operation was going on, and the troughs were exposed—when he fell, his head was at the man-hole, but in the trough—I could not say whether his head touched anything—the trough inclines to the man-hole—he fell across the trough; part of his body was resting on the edge of the floor, and his head was over the trough—Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140028"></xptr>
               <p>Bowen was close by at the time—I did not see him make a snatch at Geddcs—I don't know how he got on his feet—he did get on his feet, and challenged the prisoner to fight, or to "Come on"—he did not use the word "fight"—they met, and had another tussle, and the deceased was down again—he got up again, and said "Come out into the open," meaning more in the middle of the floor—the prisoner obeyed the challenge, and they met again, and had another struggle, and Geddes went down a third time—he got up, and again said to the prisoner, "Come on"—the prisoner said "Mind, I have not struck you yet; but I will"—Geddes said "Hit away; come on"—then I heard a slap—from the sound, I inferred that it was an open hand slap; I could not see any blow—I saw the action of the body, but I could not say that I actually saw the prisoner's hand against the face—I saw him lift his hand, and then I heard the blow—they closed, and struggled together, and Geddes again went down—I then left the floor, to get the constable of the wharf to come and stop it—Geddes was an elderly man; I should think near sixty; but he gave his age as fifty-four—he was short and stout—there was about 1450 gallons of wine in the vat at the time—the place is called a man-hole, from the fact of a man going down there to clean the vat out, but he must be a man of slight stature to do so; it is only a slight man who could go down it—I could not go down it—the deceased was stouter than me, bigger across the shoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased could not have gone down the man-hole—he was standing facing the trough; the trough was between him and me, and the prisoner was on the same side as I was—the deceased fell over the trough, leading to the hole, on his back—before the prisoner said "Mind, I have not hit you yet, but I shall," he had been challenged by the de<lb></lb>ceased three separate times—the blow he struck the deceased was decidedly with the open hand—I saw the deceased afterwards, and there was no appearance of any blow on his face—I saw Geddes with this instrument called a flogger, in his hand—I did not see him use it, but I heard him say afterwards that he had struck the prisoner with it in the face, or beard, and he wished it had been a sound one—I saw blood on the prisoner's cheek afterwards—when the prisoner asked the deceased to go and see Mr. Goulay, he answered positively "I shan't go"—he did not speak in a civil way—when he said to the prisoner "Come on," I don't know that he made any movement; he could not have moved far, or else he would have crossed the trough, which he did not—he appeared to be very angry; he meant doing all the mischief he possibly could, no doubt—he seemed in a great temper—I did not hear the prisoner say "I did not come here to fight, I came here to get work"—I had known the deceased six or seven years—he was not exactly a quiet inoffensive man—I had not known the prisoner at all, I had only seen him occasionally on the wharf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the prisoner came in, Geddes was superintending the operations, putting the wine in the vat, and the mixing of the finings—he was vault-keeper, and was superintending the work, and the men—the prisoner was several minutes asking him to go and see Mr. Goulay before I saw him seize Geddes, or use that action; Geddes was then at the man-hole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you heard the slap you had not seen any actual blow, on either side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was a struggle, a wrestle—Geddes prided himself very much on the power of his arm; his intention, as explained to me afterwards, was to seize the prisoner by the throat.</p>

Goulay—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was on the vatting floor, engaged in stirring up some finings in a small tub—Geddes was there superintending—I saw the prisoner come on to the floor—he asked Geddes to go up and see Mr. Goulay with him—Geddes said he should not go without Mr. Goulay sent for him—the prisoner said "Mr. Goulay has sent for you"—he said "It is no use, I shall not go unless Mr. Goulay sends his own messenger"—that was all I heard—they were talking some few minutes—I was standing near the man-hole, in a stooping position, and I saw Geddes lying over the shoot, on his back, or it might have been a little bit on his side, I can't say for certain, I did not take much notice—he was lying longways over the shoot—the man-hole goes across the shoot—I don't know whether his head was on the floor, or in the shoot—I took hold of his arm, and lifted him up—I seized him quickly—I did not see him actually fall—the first thing brought to my notice was seeing him just on the shoot of the man-hole, when I seized him—I did not see whether he fell on anything—I have not measured the man-hole—Geddes was an elderly man, stoutish, not very tall, nor yet very short, middling-sized—after I picked him up he wanted to fight the prisoner—he wanted him to come out into the clear part of the floor—he picked up a flogger, and said "No, come on, I have got my right hand"—the prisoner said "Are you going to hit me with that?"—he said "Yes"—the prisoner said "I will take it away from you," and as he was going to take it he struck him on the beard, and they fell together—Geddes challenged the prisoner again, and they fell again, and Geddes went down stairs after that—I kept at my work—he came up a few minutes after, and I went down stairs with him—he walked down.</p>

I was vault-keeper at the London and Continental Wharf, Wapping. On 1st April, at 3.45, I was on the vat floor. The prisoner and a man named Taylor, who had been discharged a few days before, came and asked me to see Mr. Goulay about their being discharged. I said 'You know, James, Goulay would not send his messenger if he wanted me.' He said 'What am I to do.' I said 'It is no use my going up, I reasoned with him before you left; if you can get a job, I will myself give you a character as an honest industrious man; I can't do more.' I then walked away to wards the man-hole, and stood close by Maynard, when I was seized back and front by the throat, by the prisoner. He took me quite off my legs, and I found myself down the man-hole, at least my head and shoulders and one arm were. I cried for help, a witness took me up, and pulled me out. I was maddened, and said 'Let me get at him.' The fall I had hurt me. I fell over an iron bar, and then struck my right side. The man Taylor, I think, stood between us. I stepped past him, and he again got me by the throat. I saw a flogger on the floor, and picked it up, and said I would hit him. I could not do so, however, I fell exhausted. After this I went down stairs, and walked up Commercial Street, and saw McCombie. He said 'Have you had enough?' I said 'Quite enough, <hi rend="italic">Jem.</hi>' I had nothing to do with his discharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I fell over the iron bar into the man-hole. It was the fall over that that broke my ribs. The bar is the edging of the man-hole. He told me the governor wanted to see me. I told him I would not go till a special messenger came. I did not tell him to go off the premises. I did not first take up the flogger; when I had the flogger, he rushed at me, and his head got cut, but I did not strike him. I believe to some extent he meant to push me over the man-hole. He was in a great rage. I respected him; it was Mr. Goulay who had all to do with dis<lb></lb>charging him. Men do go down the man-hole to clean the vat."</p>

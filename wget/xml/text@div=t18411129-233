The prisoner has been in my service from six to ten months, and in consequence of something which happened, I asked her if she had seen any body go up stairs—I asked her for the key of her box—she said she would not give it me—I asked if she would allow her box to be searched—she said no, nobody should search it; there was nothing there which it was not fit for a man to see—I asked her to allow my wife to search it—she said no—I said, "If you have any thing belonging to me, give it up"—her mother lived at Ratcliff, five or six miles from me—I gave her into custody—she would not go up to have her box searched—sergeant Daniels was present when a witness searched it—it was not opened till he was present, and the door of the room was locked.</p>

               <p>I do not call her by that name—her name is Elizabeth—at the office she booked her name as "Betsy"—that is what I call her—I do not deny but I have made her one of the family, and she had a good situation—I certainly have kissed her when the boy has asked me—the boy is only two years old—I went to the prisoner's father while she was locked up—I did not tell him that as soon as she got out of this I would take her back again—I swear that—never any thing of the sort—I did not tell him I had been kissing her—there never was any unpleasant feeling at home about this—the pri<lb></lb>soner never complained of my conduct to her—she always behaved as a good girl till this happened—I never endeavoured to thrust my hand up her petticoats—what I have done I am not ashamed to do before any body, I have done nothing to the girl though I am accused of it, and my character injured—it is merely the town talk since she has been in custody—I never heard it before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she call out, and tell your wife of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh no, it was merely a joke—she never gave notice to leave—I never heard that she had done so—I never heard it was said so—she did not bring a sovereign to me which she had found—it was laying on the table about half-past seven one morning, I was serving customers—my wife was in bed—we take it by turns to get up in the morning—my man and me are always up first—I did not know the sovereign was there—she did not bring it to me—she said, "Master, here's a sovereign"—I said, "Oh, I suppose my wife left it there last night?"—I have a tailors' club held there, and I suppose she gave change late at night—this was about three or four, two months ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she refuse to take the bar-maid's place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not put the question to her—all I said, was, "I must have a bar-maid," and said to my wife, "We may as well learn Elizabeth the business, and have some<lb></lb>body to do her work"—I said to her, "If you like to take this place, I shall advance your wages"—she did not refuse it—she said she should not dislike it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> 12.) I was called in by Mr. Beagley on the 23rd of November—I went and saw the prisoner—I was present when her boxes were opened—one I opened with a key which I found in her pocket—the other was opened by a locksmith—I asked her to give me the pocket, and in the pocket I found the key of the first box—she gave me some keys on a ring—I found a key for the other box, but I could not open it with the key—it would not open it—I found in her boxes some knives and forks, a quantity of farthings, some crockery, linen, a pair of stays, some china ornaments, and some carpet—I said nothing to her about them—she was in custody, and not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many boxes were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two—they were in a back room at the top of the house—I believe this key opened the box—I rather think this is the key which belonged to the other box which I could not open readily—I did not take the lock off—I thought the key was too small for the lock—I did not notice whether the aperture for the lock appeared the shape of the key—I did not find that the lock had been hampered—I will not swear it had not—I tried it and found I could not open it, and the locksmith said he thought it was on account of the lock having been a little rusty, not that it was not the key, but that the lock was rusty—that was his opinion—I have a list here of what I found in each box—in the box which opened easily, I found six plates, two salt-glasses, two basins, one wine-glass, one rummer, one tumbler, and two china cups—I beg to say that this is to the best of my belief—the room is very small, and there was a bad light—there was also one jug, two bottles of oil, three cakes of soap, one housewife, nine chimney-ornaments, one candlestick, one pair of snuffers, one corkscrew, four brushes, two pieces of carpet, and a piece of green baize—the knives were found in the box the key would not open—the articles named at the top of this list were found in the second box, I think as far as the knives—all the articles were found in the two boxes—I found the money and bag in the second box—the hampered one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sail-maker. I came to the Old Bailey yesterday with a friend, to see a person named Evans, a stranger, who had come up about a situation—I met with him in the Old Bailey—I saw Mrs. Beagley cross the road from the Pitt's Head public-house over to this Court—she appeared to me in a beastly state of intoxication—she fell down on one knee, and was pulled up again by the man with her—I believe she was intoxicated.</p>

               <p>I live at Stoke Newington; I bought a bullock, on the 11th of September, in Smithfield market, of Mr. Ireland; I went to breakfast between seven and eight, and when I came from breakfast about half after eight or nine, I met a butcher, and he said, is this your Scot? it is a little wildish, I would have you take care of him; I said I did not know of it; accordingly I went to the bullock, and the two prisoners stood at the hind part of the bullock, I looked at it, and either one or both of the prisoners persuaded me to have it locked up at one of the inns, and I gave then a pint of beer to lock it up.</p>
               <p>Can you tell which or them it was that persuaded you? - I cannot say indeed; I gave the pint of beer to one of them, I cannot tell which, they said they would put it into the Bell, I went to pay for it at the Bull's Head, and in about ten minutes I came to see about it, and I was told it was run away, when I had stood a minute or two, there was a mob of people coming back, with a poor man brought on a window shutter through Smithfield, which very greatly surprized me, I made all the baste I could home, directly I rode after the bullock to Holloway turnpike, I enquired about him, and found it was gone to Holloway; I found it laid down by a little public house on this side Holloway, on the right hand side of the way, I understood it had run at some people, and there it sell; I ordered my man to cut the tail a little bit, and it bled a little, but we could not get it up till we killed it, and we brought it to Islington; I meant to order it to the Bell till my own drover, who was a careful man, came from Stoke Newington, who would drive it carefully.</p>
               <p>These men had your authority and consent to carry it to the Bell-Inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the butcher that gave you advice to take care of it? - Mr. Peach of Shoreditch; the person of whom I bought it said he was not subpoened, and would not come; the salesman said he knew nothing of it, he told me repeatedly that he had not the least knowledge of it's being vicious, but the prisoners did.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPH. BLACKWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday morning the 11th of September, I went to cheapen a bullock just by where this wild bullock stood, and this Plata, the prisoner, and another says, do not go nigh that bullock it is mad, it is wild, for I am obliged to tie it up with a double rope, or it would run at any thing when it came into Smithfield; I said to him if that is the case you should secure it before you take it off from the rails, that it may not do any mischief; he made no answer; I drew off for about half an hour, after that the two prisoners at the bar had got this bullock untied and loose, one was at the head and the other at the tail of it after it was loose from the rail, the prisoner Parker with a stick took and pricked it, and forced it almost upon me, indeed I was but a little way from it; after that he kept following close to the tail of it, and spurring it with his stick, forcing it away, forcing it on, with that I followed him, I saw what he was after, and he kept pricking it the same till he forced it away from the other beasts, with that it took to it's heels and ran up St. John's-street, and the two prisoners after it; I said to the person that stood by, that bullock will do some mischief which these rascals are after; I had not spoke a quarter of an hour before the poor man, Messenger, was brought back with his bowels out, carrying to the hospital; I understood the bullock was followed to Holloway and brought back to Islington; I went up to Islington in the afternoon to see whether the bullock was the same, and I found it was the same; coming to the hospital to see how the poor man did, I saw Parker in Long-lane, Smithfield, and I said to him you must be a very bad man to take this bullock out knowing it to be wild, whereby this poor man will lose his life; he gave me a good deal of abuse and ill language, and told me that he should have one of mine hunted off before a month's time; I said no more to him but I came away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250082"></xptr>Court. Did Parker hear what Plato said to you about going near the beast? - I do not know, he was not near at the time.</p>
               <p>Is the pricking and goading of bullocks at all necessary to force them from the rest of the beasts? - In order to separate them from the others, they do sometimes.</p>
               <p>Suppose for instance, they were going to put that bullock up at the Bell, would it have been necessary to prick it, and force it, to get into the yard? - No, my Lord, because I should take some others with it, and there were two other beasts with it.</p>
               <p>Jackson. My Lord, they said they would take two other beasts with it, in order to secure it.</p>
               <p>To Blackwell. Then there were three beasts loose in all? - Yes, I look upon it, that this bullock would not have gone away from the rest, if it had not been forced by the ill usage from this drover.</p>
               <p>Then supposing their business was to have driven the three beasts to the Bell Inn, in your judgement was they conducting them properly, in forcing them with their sticks? - Undoubtedly they were doing wrong, for they forced it in such a manner, that they forced it away from the others.</p>
               <p>Where was Plato at the time that Parker was urging the beast on? - He was on one side of him; Plato was keeping them together.</p>
               <p>Then according to you account, Plato was doing what he ought to do? - He was not doing any thing wrong in forcing it away, only knowing the bullock to be mad, he was forcing it from the rails.</p>
               <p>These drovers are dextrous fellows in the management of their beasts? - They do a great deal of mischief; they very often trust too much to their dexterity; this man Mr. Jackson lost three or four pounds by the bullock; it was not fit for any use at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did he follow the bullock in your sight? - He followed it quite out of Smithfield.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dickenson, the brewer; as I was going to breakfast on Monday, the 11th of September, coming up my master's yard, I saw a bullock come running up St. John's-street, and I stopped a little, and the bullock ran by me; facing Aylesbury-street he stopped, and headed that way; there were three bakers coming by with pails of yeast upon their heads, and another man standing against the post at the corner of the street, daring the bullock.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by daring? - Wavering his hat backwards and forwards, whether to keep the bullock from himself or no, I do not know: after it was dared a little time, the bullock ran between the post and the house, and this man that was behind the post, slipped on one side into the street, that goes into the high way, and the deceased was coming just to the corner, and the bullock caught him, and smacked him against the wall, and he tumbled down; and as soon as ever the bullock had done that, he set up the street as hard as he could run; and the man got on his hands and knees, and leaned against the wall, till assistance came to him; the man was taken to the hospital afterwards; I know the man's son very well, but I did not know it was the father till it was done; his name is Messenger; I saw him in the hospital after he was dead, the night the Coroner sat upon him.</p>
               <p>Look at the two prisoners, did you see any thing of them there? - I cannot say I did.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 11th of September last, a little after nine in the morning, I was desired to attend an accident in St. Bartholomew's hospital; I immediately went, and found the deceased in bed, with a large wound on the lower part of the right side of his belly, through which about two-thirds of his intestines protruded; they were soon after returned, and the wound was sewed up; he lay in great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250083"></xptr> agonies, till between four and five the following day, and then expired.</p>
               <p>Could you discover at the time, or have you discovered since, whether the intestines were wounded? - The intestines were not wounded.</p>
               <p>That wound, I presume, was in your judgement, the cause of the man's death? - It was.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you, after the caution you had, when you knew that the bullock was wild, how came you to loosen it, without it's being properly secured? - Mr. Jackson knows that he told me, if I would take it off for him, he would be obliged to me.</p>
               <p>The question I ask you is, why you loosed him wholly, why you did not hamper him immediately? - That bullock, if he had been left to myself, I could have drove him twenty miles with any two or three beasts, had he not been pricked about the market; the bullock was not half so wild as they say he was, when he was against the rails; here is a man at the door who tied him up; Mr. Jackson gave me a penny three farthings, and promised to give me more.</p>
               <p>Did not Parker lend you a hand to drive him? - He lent me a hand to put it up in the yard, but it was more than we both could do.</p>

            's master, Mr. Ireland, he came to me and asked me for two beasts, says Plato, I have got a beast here that is wildish, I wish you would help me, for the butcher has given me a pint of beer to lock him up; he did not say what butcher; nor I did not go; I lent him two beasts, and in going along the carts and coaches made such a noise, that it drove one of mine along with it, and it took up St. John's-street, and mine with it, and I went and fetched mine back; presently the man was brought back killed; I verily believe Plato is innocent of it; he begged and prayed of the people not to make a noise, but to let it alone; I never saw any thing of Parker; nor to my knowledge I never saw him at all with the bullock.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Blackwell? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackwell. Did you see that man there? - No, Sir, I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody to take care of these other two beasts? - I do not know that there were; I saw nobody but the two prisoners after the three beasts; I have seen Lee in Smithfield; I do not know his station; nor I do not remember seeing Smith in Smithfield at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Who was you employed for? - For Messrs. Boys and Ure, in Rose-street, Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plato. It being Saturday, there is no other butcher here; Mr. Blackwell knows me very well; I have been in the market sixteen years; I have a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Blackwell. As to his general behaviour I do not know any thing at all; they are all very bad fellows, and sometimes they act with a great deal of cruelty to the cattle, and if we say any thing to them, we only get ill will, and abosive language.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a very common thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250085"></xptr> tie beasts, or do they depend on their skill in general? - If they take them out they generally cut them down or disable them, or hamstring them, or tie them by the horn of the head; but the proper method when a bullock is mad as this was, is to have him confined; Plato told me it was wild, and says he, I am obliged to tie it up with two ties.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plato. I declare to God, I never saw Mr. Blackwell, so help me God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Lee. The bullock was wild at Boston, in Lincolnshire; he ran at a country drover, so he told me over night; but the bullock was pretty well then; it came very well along with the rest of the beasts; we had a bullock yesterday, and after his fellow bullocks ran away from him, he was as mad as a March hare almost; he was killed directly; we always tell a butcher when he is wild.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is perfectly a new case in practice; though the principle of law is by no means new; the principle of law undoubtedly is, that if any man wilfully and maliciously drives a beast which he knows to be wild and mischievous into a crowd of people, meaning to do mischief, that such a man will be answerable for all the consequences that that act produced, and that if a passenger is go- red passing by, by a bullock under those circumstances, and dies of a wound, it will be murder in the person who is the cause of it, by that wilful and malicious act, which had a necessary tendency to do wilful and bodily harm to whoever should meet that beast: This is certainly a principle of the law of England; at the same time, that I do not know that there has been any instance that has fallen within that principle in my experience; it is therefore extremely necessary to be careful what to do; to understand very well the correct state of the matter of fact; and also to attend closely and minutely to the principle of law; now this indictment seems to me to have very properly stated the charge, by way of application to that general principle, and it therefore states, that these two men did wilfully and maliciously, knowing this to be a wild and mischievous beast, loosen him, and drive him, and goad him through the market, by which this mischief was consequently produced; that the beast by being so drove, ran against this unhappy man, and gored him in the belly, of which he died: the constituent parts of the charge are first, that they knew this beast was mischievous; in the next place, that they loosened him for a mischievous purpose, intending to do mischief; and in the next place, that having loosened him, they drove him in a malicious and mischievous manner through the market, which irritated him so as to induce him to commit the mischief as followed. As to the matter of fact, the representation of the fact is unfortunately very different, by different witnesses; therefore you are to ascertain the fact in the best manner you can, as you must, where it does happen that the representation differs, as I am afraid you will find it does in this case: You must therefore judge for yourselves, and determine what is the precise state of the fact before you can go a step farther. According to the account given by the prisoners two witnesses, the prisoner Parker, who is charged by the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, as most active and mischievous, appears not to be there at all, which flatly contradicts Mr. Blackwell, who represents Parker, as taking pains to get him to do mischief; you have therefore the disagreeable circumstance to collect the fact, and to apply it to the rules of law, upon which the quality of the offence must be tried and determined; there is no remedy but patient and cool consideration of the evidence, to see where the truth is most likely to lay; you must do that in this case; you must first of all determine whether you believe Blackwell, or these two drovers; if you believe these two drovers, I hardly think there is any room to impute any offence whatever to the prisoners; because though the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250086"></xptr> beast was a wildish beast, yet the manner of taking two other beasts to go along with him, seems a reasonable care, if not quite sufficient: It is not very unreasonable, if their representation be true, to believe that the drovers did really think they should be able to manage the beast very well, and that no harm would ensue: on the other hand if you should be of opinion that the representation made by Blackwell is the truth, and that the drovers have sworn falsely; to be sure that alters the case; and if you should be persuaded that the prisoner Parker (for Blackwell does not charge Plato with any thing more than a knowledge that the bullock was wild) had so infernal a mischief in his head, as to wish to provoke this beast, in order to drive him mad, in order to make him do mischief to some person, for the abominable entertainment it would afford him and the mob; I do not see how the crime can fall short with respect to him of that of murder; but with respect to Plato, the most that can be urged against him is, that he knew the state of this beast, and to be sure where the neglect is very gross, it will sometimes amount to the crime of manslaughter, as where a man drives furiously along the street and drives over any person; but you must suppose him to drive at people to make it amount to murder; on the other hand, if the true complection of the case is, that Mr. Blackwell has seen it in a little too strong a light with regard to Parker, and that he is not warranted in his conclusion, to use that expression which he used,</p>

               <p>"of seeing what he meant to be at;" and that Parker, though not so careful as he ought to have been, only tried to get the beast to the place of his destination; then there would be a ground to take the middle course, and to say, that as to Parker, he would be guilty of the other crime of manslaughter, and as to Plato, if you should be of opinion, that he cannot be excused for trusting to his dexterity, he may be guilty of manslaughter also; it ought to be a very strong plain case of wilful and intentional mischief, that should lead you to carry this to the utmost strictness against these prisoners: To the nature of their business some indulgence should be given; men like them fall into habits of unnecessary severity, very often without much malignity of heart; men in such situations acquire dangerous and bad habits; they are not to be tolerated to be sure, but at the same time, when the question turns upon the malignity of the heart, there are some allowances to be made; you would not understand their language nor perhaps their actions exactly in the same manner as those of persons in a different situation; and if the case admits of any shadow of doubt and of difficulty, it will be a reason for you to moderate it into that, which is most likely to be the case nine times out of ten; that is the case in which they drive their cattle, incautiously trusting to their own superior skill in managing them, and behaving criminally negligent. It seems as if it would ultimately resolve itself into a question for your consideration; whether these prisoners can be said to be free from all blame, so as to lead you to acquit them all together; or whether they are guilty of manslaughter. Not guilty generally would be the opinion that my mind would go to principally: You however are the judges; if you find clear wilful deliberate malice against every body, in their conduct; and that they, with a view to do mischief, let this beast loose, on purpose to enjoy the fun of doing mischief, and this man lost his life in consequence of it; undoubtedly they may be reached to the full extent of the crime of murder: If you think it approaches more to the other crime in which there is neglect and incaution and rashness, but not deliberate malice; then they will be responsible for the crime of manslaughter: If you are of opinion that they have acted with a reasonable degree of caution, though not with all the caution that every prudent man would take, and that the beasts ran wild by others exciting them, and not by the prisoners themselves, then I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250087"></xptr> the prisoners will be entitled to your acquittal.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, near the Broad Sanctuary, at the end where the Old Gatehouse was, the prisoner passed by me with a bundle under his arm. Hearing a woman's voice calling out stop thief, a soldier with a bundle, I ran immediately to seize the soldier; when he found me near him he dropped the bundle; I did not stop to pick up the bundle but secured him immediately. The woman came up and picked up the bundle. He was carried before a magistrate, who committed him.</p>

               <p>I was in that house; and the woman was in at the same time; she asked me to give her a glass of gin. I said I could not afford it. She asked me to buy something of her. I bought a pair of sleeve buttons for a penny; she asked me to toss up for a quartern of gin. I would not, but went out of the house directly; going home I recollected I should go to the washerwoman's for a shirt for the next morning. I ran back in haste; as I was running along the street, I ran against a woman who had a bundle upon her head, the bundle fell down; I continued running on till I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned round and asked what was the matter. They seized me, and said I had robbed the woman. I never had the bundle.</p>

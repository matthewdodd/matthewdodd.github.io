                  </hi>. I live in Steven-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner is my daughter, and is a servant out of place—she told me she had found a silver spoon underher feet, and told me to pawn it—she has lived in my room since she was out of place—on Ash Wednesday, Mary Grimes and the prisoner went out together—the prisoner came home in the evening, and on the following day I looked in her box, and found a silver fork—she sent me to the pawnbroker's with it—the pawnbroker kept it—I said be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate that I discovered it in her box, and took it to the pawn-broker's—I told the prisoner it was stopped—she said she picked it up, and would have it back—I was told to go and get it out, and the officer stopped me with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Gideon, a pawnbroker, in Stafford-street, Lisson Grove. On the 25th of February, Eleanor Gainer brought a silver fork to my shop—I detained it—the next day the prisoner came and said it was her fork, and I had no right to detain it—she said her mother had no business with it—I asked her where she got it—she said she found it coming from Kilburn—I told her to leave it till the morning—in consequence of something, when the prisoner came for it, I refused to let her have it—I told her to send her mother—she came, I gave her the fork, and the officer took her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Lucy Dawes, of Beaufoy-terrace, Edgeware-road. On Ash Wednesday, the prisoner and Mary Grimes were at the house—Grimes had lived servant there—they came between six and seven o'clock—Grimes called for her box—we have about half a dozen silver forks—I went up with Grimes to her room, leaving the pri<lb></lb>soner in the kitchen—on Grimes coming down they went away—I had carried the plate into the back-kitchen—any one could pass from the front to the back kitchen—the next morning I missed this fork—there is no pri<lb></lb>vate mark on it—I think it is one of the six, but I cannot say—I did not allow them to have any forks—here is another fork, which I have brought from home—they appear to be the same pattern, and the same sort of forks.</p>

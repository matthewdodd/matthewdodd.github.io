                  </hi>. I was twenty-five years: in the police, and am now in the employ of Her Majesty's Mint—on Saturday evening, 21st October, about a quarter to seven o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house, the Swan, 20, Little St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials, with Inspectors West, Brannan, and Fife, and Sergeants Ackrell and house had been under observation since the early part of June—I have known the house eight or nine years—I knew the prisoner by sight before, and found him standing behind the bar—West took him in custody, and took him into a back room—I followed with the other officers, and said that we came then with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200016"></xptr>
               <p>a search warrant signed by one of the Magistrates of Bow-street, to search for counterfeit coin, and asked him whether he had any in his possession—he hesitated and then said, "No."—I said, "You are entitled to have the warrant read to you if think proper"—he said, "There is no occasion, MR. Brannan."—West commenced searching him, and I went outside the bar with Fife to command a view of the inside—I afterwards returned to the prisoner and asked him whether there was a back way out of the premises—he said, "Yes" and I directed the officer to search the back yard—the prisoner entered the yard first, followed by West—I <hi rend="italic">took</hi> a lantern and saw West go to one closet and then to a second, when he put his hand between the rafters and the tiles and handed me seven packets—I opened one—it contained ten bad shillings, and West opened another—six of the packets contained ten shillings each, and one contained nine—when I opened the packets I said to the prisoner, "This is bad"—he said nothing—I then went outside the bar, and West and Ackrell went up<lb></lb>stairs with the prisoner—they did not search him till they returned down<lb></lb>stairs—they then searched the bar—there was an elderly female there, and I believe the prisoner's two daughters—one of them handed me a packet containing twelve fragments of counterfeit coin, old and discoloured—she said, "This we have taken in the way of trade"—I said, "Oh, very well"—Ackrell and Elliott searched a little closet behind the bar which she took the fragments from—I heard something drop—the female stood between me and the officers—Ackrell then handed me two bad shillings and Elliott three bad shillings—the females had no bonnets on—they were evidently behind the bar attending to the business—the middle-aged woman attempted to take a packet from Elliott's hand, but did not succeed—he handed it to me, and she said, "<hi rend="italic">Them</hi> were not there last Saturday fortnight when I cleaned out that place"—they were bad shillings—we all went back into the parlour, and the prisoner said, "Do they correspond in date with those you found in the privy?"—I looked at them, and said, "Yes, some of them"—he said, "Let me look at one of them"—I said, "Certainly, you shall have every indulgence"—he bit it in two; I produce the pieces—he was taken to the station—the coins were wrapped up separately in tissue-paper as counterfeit coin usually is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you all in plain clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; two In<lb></lb>spectors were in uniform—the prisoner did not order me out of the bar when I went in, and say that it was private—he has known me for years, and knew me when I was in the police—he did not say, "You are quite welcome to search, I have nothing about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> premises of which I am ashamed"—when they went upstairs he said to his daughter, "You had better get a candle"—there was no candle in the yard, only the lamp we brought from the station—I do not think we were twenty minutes before we went into the yard—we were not two hours searching—I was only keeping the females under observation—the prisoner was searched, and some gold was taken from him—I did not direct the females to be searched—I did not see them searched—after the money was found in the closet I directed a search to be made of the whole house, and then the prisoner told his daughter to fetch a candle to shew the policemen about the house—I remained in front of the bar, because I saw the old woman concealing a bottle of gin, and the middle-aged female excited my suspicions very much—they were serving the customers—Elliott and Ackrell first searched the bar—I noticed some barrels standing on a shelf—I do not think the female took them down—she put her hand</p>

               <p>behind them, but she stood between me and the officers, and I could not very well see what she did, as her dress was rather extended—the Shelf was twelve or thirteen inches from the floor—I saw no bottles removed from the shelf before the money was found—they were from seven minutes to a quarter of an hour searching all the shelves—the female was between me and them—told her to stand on one side, but she would not, and I said, "What, do you want me to apply force"—I do not mean to say that any of these coins correspond with those found in the privy—they told me that they were taken in the way of business—I did not hear the prisoner make a similar statement—I did not hear one of the females say to Elliott when the coins dropped, "If you found it you put it there"—I do not think the till was searched—every cupboard was searched, and I believe all the drawers were pulled out, but nothing was taken possession of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I went with the other officers to the Swan, and saw the prisoner behind the bar—I called him into the back parlour—Inspector Brannan took a warrant out of his pocket, and told him he had a warrant to search his place, as he was suspected of dealing largely in counterfeit coin—it was not read—I found 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, in good money on him—I think he said, "You are at liberty to search my place"—MR. Brannan said, "Have you got a back yard?"—the prisoner went into the yard, and I followed him—Ackrell and Brannan followed us—it was about a quarter to seven o'clock—I had one of our lamps—I searched the closets—in the first I found nothing, but in the second I found seven parcels on the rafters—I saw them by turning on my light, and handed them down—I said, "Here is something looks bad here"—I unfolded one packet, and said, "You see, this is counterfeit coin"—the prisoner made no remark—I took him to a room while the house was searched by Brannan and Ackrell—nothing was found—we were up stairs, I should think, an hour and a half—we then came down into the bar, and Ackrell and Elliott searched the bar—while I had charge of the bar, standing by the parlour door, within the bar I could see Ackrell and Elliott, but could not see what they were doing—two hours or more were occupied—on the way to the station, the prisoner said that it was an unfortunate affair about the coin behind the bar; they had taken a great deal when he first came into business at that house, but he did not remember taking any lately—the charge was read at the station, and he wanted to know whether the dates of the coins found behind the bar corresponded with those found in the closets—we examined them, and Brannan told him that they did—I took some good silver from his pockets.</p>

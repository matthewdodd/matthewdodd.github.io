                  </hi>. I am a draper, at No. 7, Market-street, Stepney. Oh Saturday night, 8th March, I shut up the shop and premises—I live on the premises—the shop was not'opened on the Sunday—I was in the shop between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning—it was then perfectly safe—I went to bed about 10 o'clock on Sunday night—T had not seen the shop since the morning, it appeared all quite secure, the shutters were up—I was aroused, between 1 and 2 o'clock on the Monday morning, by a policeman—I then went down to the shop—I found an outside shutter had been moved on one side, and a square of glass broken—I missed three boxes of ribbon, neck ties, and gloves—a person could reach them by putting an arm through the broken pane, it was not more than twenty or thirty inches from the window—the shop communicates with the dwelling house—there are two houses, but I made a door communicating between the two—I kept that door looked, and kept the key.</p>

On Monday morning, 10th March, I was on duty in High-street, Stepney, about half past 1 o'clock, and saw three men walking along, and the prisoner on the opposite side, with a bag on his right shoulder—I spoke to the sergeant, and went across for the purpose of stopping the prisoner—as soon as I got in front of him, he made a dart on one side to avoid me—I then made a grasp at him and the bag, and in so doing I was kicked between the feet, and fell on the ground on my knees—I instantly rose, and sprang my rattle for assistance, and called out "Stop thief!"—the prisoner ran away, I retained the bag—I did not see him stopped, I lost sight of him at the time I was getting up off my knees—he was taken by West, another constable, I should say a good 400 yards from the spot where he left me—he ran in the direction of Stepney-green; there is a bit of a bend in the road, and I just lost sight of him there—when I first got up on my feet I saw him, and I lost sight of him as he went round the bend towards Stepney-green—I followed him round</p>

I was on duty, on the morning of 10th March, in Garnet-street, near Stepney-green, and about half past 1 o'clock I heard the springing of a rattle, and the cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner and two more men running—I made a grasp at the prisoner, and laid hold of him by the left side, and I was tripped up by two men who were following him—I seized the prisoner by the left breast—as soon as I laid hold of him I was tripped up by two men who were follow<lb></lb>ing close behind—I let go of him directly I fell down—I got up and pursued him—I followed him about 500 or 600 yards, and never lost sight of him except momentarily, in turning round the corner from one street into another—I sprang my rattle, at the same time I saw the constable coming up—I <hi rend="italic">sang out</hi>, "Stop thief!" and the prisoner immediately stopped, and placed himself against a wall, under a lamp—he was taken into custody—another constable came up to him rather before me, but I took charge of him—I told him he must go back with me to where the springing of the rattle was—he said, "What for?"—I took him back on to the Green, the place where the springing of the rattle was—it was in Fayer-terrace that I stopped him, opposite the station—I met Church on Stepney-green, about 500 or 600 yards from the spot where he was taken into custody—Church said, on seeing the prisoner, "That is the man"—the prisoner denied it, and said he had done nothing—Church afterwards pointed out to me the place where he had first seized him—that was about 150 yards from where I first saw the prisoner running—he appeared to be coming from that direction, and I saw the light turned on at the same time they were running—the prisoner is the man—he had on a rough coat and a black cap—when I took him he was very much out of breath—he could scarcely speak.</p>

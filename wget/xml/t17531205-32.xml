I was there and saw it; they shook hands before they began, and I don't think they had malice against each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this money to be spent?</p>
               <p>Clarage. I heard nothing of that, not being at the first agreement, but heard of it at the time of their fighting. The deceased died in about nine hours after the battle. They fought at nine, and he died about six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober when they fought ?</p>
               <p>Clarage. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased's death owing to any bruises he received?</p>
               <p>Clarage. I can't say any thing to that. He was bruised very much about his breast, which I believe the prisoner gave him; the prisoner was bruised very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near of an age?</p>
               <p>Clarage. Yes, two strong young fellows; the deceased was very well before he began to fight.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the agreement made to fight ?</p>
               <p>Clarage. The same morning about eight o'clock.</p>

            . I saw the beginning of the battle. The deceased was very hearty and well before they fought; they said it was a fix'd battle. They shook hands before they sought. As soon as it was over the deceased lay on the ground; they neither of them spoke a word. I saw no appearance of malice any farther than striving to beat each other. I carried the deceased out of the field.</p>

            . I saw the deceased on the Friday before they fought, which was on a Monday. Willet said the first time he saw the prisoner he'd give him a punch on the head if he would not fight him, and he'd throw him behind the fire and burn him. I saw the battle, and the deceased about an hour or two after the battle; but never heard him speak, and believe he died of his bruises then received.</p>

            . I saw the battle, and believe the deceased died in consequence of that battle. I saw them in Cheapside the Saturday before; they had words, and I saw the deceased turn and shake his hand at the prisoner; the prisoner said, Do you threaten me? The deceased was a very quarrelsome man; had it been on the stones he must have kill'd the prisoner, I believe he threw him fifty times.</p>

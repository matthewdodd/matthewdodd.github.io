The prisoner at the bar and I were going along Shoreditch; in Webb's-square we saw a pane of glass out of a window: he put his hand in and undid the window, and took out two books, a tea-kettle, which we sold for 1 s. 6 d. to a woman which I did not know before, or seen since: we took also some other brass, which we sold Madding: there was a chocolate-pot, a brass tinder box, a candlestick with three legs to it, a brass mortar, and a copper lid to a sauce-pan, for which he gave us half a crown.</p>

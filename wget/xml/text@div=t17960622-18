             sworn. I am a watchman upon Kensington Terrace; a little before twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner with a basket of peas upon his head; I asked him what he had got there, he said peas; that he was going to market with them; I asked him; where he got them; he said, they were his own; I said, I know they are not your own; you are upon some of your old tricks, says I, I have given you a caution many times; I took him to the watch-house; I told him I knew the mark of the basket, and I was sure they were stole; he desired I would keep the peas, and let him go; he would come forward in the morning; and then he told me they were Mr. Kendall's; that he had taken them out of the yard; I told him he had taken them out of the cart; he said, no; it was twy-light, and I was not quite convinced that it was his, and I went and got a light; and then I was convinced it was his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming home about a quarter after ten, and picked them up in the road. and I did not know what to do with them, and I turned back to carry them to Covent-garden, to see who they belonged to. <rs id="t17960622-18-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

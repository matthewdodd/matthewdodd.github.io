On the 6th of January I was on duty at Old Brentford, about a quarter past five o'clock in the evening, and the prisoners passed me together—Gardener had a bundle—I ran, and over<lb></lb>took them about 100 yards off, and asked Gardener what he had there—he said his sister's gown—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "To pledge it at Mr. Potter's"—I took him to his own house—his sister was not at home, and I took him to the station—he said he knew his sister was at home, but she was concealed—I returned, but could not find her.</p>

I know the prisoners—Gardener is my brother—they came to my house, at two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 6th of January—Thompson had a waistcoat under his own waistcoat, folded up under the arm—Gardener said, in his presence, that they had found a waistcoat—I</p>

               <p>asked where—they said against the chapel—I asked three or four times it they were sure they had found it—they said yes—it was stained, as if it had fallen in the mud—I brushed it with my apron, and then pledged it at Mr. Potter's, and gave the money to the prisoners—they were together—I went on to Burford's, and there heard of a waistcoat being stolen—I went back and spoke to the prisoners about it—they began cry<lb></lb>ing, and both said they had taken it, and begged me to forgive them—I said I could not forgive them, it must be Mr. Burford's—I began crying—I, took off my gown, and took two aprons and two handkerchiefs, and told my brother to go with all the haste he could to Burford's, to pawn them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and redeem the waistcoat—they were going for that purpose when the policeman stopped them—I said very likely, if they begged Mr. Bur<lb></lb>ford's pardon, he would forgive them.</p>

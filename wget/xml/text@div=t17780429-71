One struck me upon the nose, and said, d - n your eyes stop! I said, no, no, not to-night. Then I felt a blow upon my forehead, which knocked me down; when I lay upon the ground, I said they should not rob me, and I kept my hand on my breeches pocket. The prisoner held a pistol to me, and the other snatched his hand from my breeches pocket, and tore my breeches pocket out, with the contents of it. I had my hand on the outside of my pocket; I told them they should not rob me. They took from me 2 s. in silver and 9 d. I had a half guinea and also a half crown in my other pocket, but somebody coming, they ran away and did not take that. I positively swear that the prisoner was the man who held the pistol; I was afraid the pistol would go off every minute, and kept looking at him. I thought if any body came I would make a little more resistance. I saw him at the Rotation Office, and knew him directly.</p>

               <p>I was at the taking of the prisoner. At the Rotation Office the prosecutor picked him out as soon as he saw him.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor said at the Justice's that he knew me by a scar in my cheek. Dixon, who was in the Office, came up and looked in my face, and said there was no scar in my cheek, and then the prosecutor said he knew me by my shock head of hair. The Justice asked him if he knew me by any thing else? He said no.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did say that as I lay on the ground I thought he had a scar in his cheek, but I said that I could pick him out from a thousand. I might be mistaken as to the mark, but I can positively swear to the man, I did think, and I think now there might be a scar in his cheek; I said I knew him by the scar and his hair. He had the same clothes on he has now; I took notice of him, and the pistol particularly, because I thought it would go off every minute; I did not take notice of the other. At the time I was robbed it was so light that I could see a man coming from the top of the field.</p>

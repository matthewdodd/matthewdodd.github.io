            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in Featherstone-street, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 30th of September, from the description I had received of him - he was on the opposite side of the way; I called, him and he ran away - I pursued and took him; I asked what he had about him; he said some money - I took it from him, and found the duplicate of these things; he said he had been to the play with another lad, and he had given him two half-crowns to mind for him - I went into the Vinegar-yard after the other lad; I knocked at the door - his mother opened the window, and threw out two half-crowns; I said the lad must come with me - she said he was very ill, she would not open the door - I broke it open, and took the lad out.</p>

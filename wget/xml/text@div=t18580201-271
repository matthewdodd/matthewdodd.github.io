               <p>Street, Newington. On 7th Nov., about 11 o'clock, I secured the house, and went to bed—about 2 o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by a noise in the house—I got up, went on to the landing, and listened—I heard nothing, but felt a draught—I went and found the staircase window open—I went down, and in the passage I saw two men, and the street door was open—I made a rush at them, and they went out, and I saw the prisoner getting over the railings, at the side of the house which is at the corner—as he was the nearest, I made a grasp at him, and he struck at me; I slipped, and he ran away—I got up, and followed him 200 yards, calling out "Police!"—a con<lb></lb>stable stopped him, and when I got up, he and the constable were struggling on the ground—we secured him with some difficulty, and brought him back to the house—I had not lost sight of him; I ran after him in my night dress, and it was very cold indeed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you nothing but your shirt on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not catch cold—there were no other people running—it was not very dark—I did not hear any body say that another man had been seen—theprisoner's face was towards me when he was getting over the railing; there was a lamp in front of him at the opposite corner—there was no light between him and me—the policeman could not get at his rattle, and asked me to get it, as he had tried to get it once, and the prisoner attempted to escape—a man then came up, and I asked him to take my position while I went up to dress—that man remained till the place was searched, and was there for an hour or two afterwards—he has not called since—the prisoner is not one of the men who was in the passage—the prisoner was getting over the railing at the side, which led to the back of the house, where the entrance had been effected—I had not made the slightest alarm; I do not think they heard me till I was right upon them—I had locked the front door, and saw that the windows were shut, and the latch door also.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What door did you find open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The staircase win<lb></lb>dow, at the back of the house—the door leading to the back of the house had been opened, and the yard door, and the street door, and all from the inside—theentrance was effected from the staircase window, which is ten or twelve feet from the ground; but there is a lobby which projects out, and they got in from there—that window was shut down, I did not observe whether it was fast—it is necessary to get over the iron railings to get to the back of the premises; they must have got over the railings unless they had come through the house—they had to climb a wall twelve feet high—there was a door which was nailed up the night before, but the nails had been extracted, and the door was open—the rails were in the inside; they would have to get over the wall first.</p>

On 7th Nov., between 2 and 3 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police!" and, as I went up, I saw the prisoner getting over Mr. Searle's iron pailings; he immediately struck Mr. Searle on the head, which caused him to fall on the step of the door—he ran, and I chased him—I never lost sight of him—Mr. Searle came to my assistance; a tustle ensued between the prisoner and me, and I heard something fall—aftertaking him to the station, I went back and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> at that spot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

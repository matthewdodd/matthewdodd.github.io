                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Chelsea—on 3d November there was a ball at the Teetotal-hall, 56, Lower George-street, Chelsea—there were posters like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) put up, to show where it was to be—I was employed, along with another man, to stand at the entrance, to take the money and tickets—the other one took the tickets, and I took the money—whilst I was standing there people passing could see me quite plainly—it was about 1 o'clock when I left—I had to go across Sloane-square to reach my home—as I was going past the "Star and Garter" I thought I heard foot<lb></lb>steps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240119"></xptr>
               <p>behind me—I turned round, and saw a shadow cast, but I saw nobody—I went straight on into Symonds-street, which leads into Sloane-square—when I reached No. 2, Symonds-street I heard some very quick steps come—I was turning round to see whether they were coming on to me or no, and before I got round, Marks came—he had a white jacket, or a white something on him at the time—he worked himself right behind me, and put his arms round me, under my chin—I was going to say "hallo," but I could not say "hallo"—I said "ho"—that was all I could say, and he pulled me back as hard as he could pull—I was trying to stoop down, but he pulled me back, so that I could not stoop—with that three more came up, and began to ran-sack my pockets—they took what they thought proper—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket, and my purse in my left-hand trousers pocket, with 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I did not carry home the night's receipts with me, I left that at the hall—the value of my watch was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after they had taken the things Marks let go of me, and then struck me with some heavy thing that he had in his hand—it was something that came cold, and very hard—he struck me in the mouth, and the blow sent my teeth all back—I fell down, and was bleeding very much at the mouth—I am quite sure Marks is the man that did it—I had never known him before, but he stood a second to see whether I would get up—I could see his countenance, and he had on a white jacket or something of that sort—I am quite sure he is the man—I could not swear to the faces of the other three, but their size and dress resembles them very much—I went to the station-house on the 6th, I think, on the Thursday, and was shown several men sitting along a form—I picked out Marks and Lane, and there was another I picked out, but I could not say that he was the man at all—I believe Lane was one of the men—I only believe it.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Lane). Q.</hi> You say you picked out Lane at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there might have been a dozen men or more shown to me, for what I know—I cannot say positively, because I was taken out of my bed at 11 o'clock at night—I could not swear that they were policemen; they were in plain clothes—I cannot swear that Lane is the man—I only form an opinion from his size and dress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marks. Q.</hi> Do you, or not, state that you are positive it was Lane that was with me at the time they came before you, and ransacked your pockets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say positively—I have said that I can't swear positively to any of these three—I swear positively that you are the person that came behind me, and choked me—I was not told so by other persons—my wife's daugh<lb></lb>ter's husband did not come to me, and tell me this, not that night he did not—after I had picked you out I was told it was you, not previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marks.</hi> It is a person, a relation of his, who is implicated in the case; when I say implicated, he is wholly and solely concerned; the innocent is now suffering for the guilty; and the prosecutor openly said in Court that he would not prosecute that man. Lane is suffering for the party who is guilty, his name is Hurley; were you not told by the police that they were in search of that party? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes—his name is Hurley—he is a brother of my wife's daughter's husband that he is speaking about—I heard afterwards that he was implicated in the case—my wife did not then say to me, "Now I know Lane is innocent of this"—she did not tell me that Lane was innocent, and that a hair of his head should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marks.</hi> If this Hurley was not a party concerned, why should he abscond from his home; but he would not have him taken because he is his relation, so they make Lane answer for him. I know it is useless to ask anything about my own case; I know I can't speak anything in my own behalf,</p>

               <p>because my word would not be taken, as I have not long been out of trouble, but I don't wish the innocent to suffer for the guilty; I have not the least to ask about my own case.</p>

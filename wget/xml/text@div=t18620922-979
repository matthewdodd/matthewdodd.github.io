                  </hi>. I am the charge taker at the Walworth district office—the prisoner was employed as a letter-carrier in that office—on the morning of 30th August, the registered letter-bag arrived from the Southern district office at thirty-eight minutes past 7; it was properly tied and sealed at that time, and inclosed in the general letter-bag which came from that office, and which was also tied and sealed—I opened both bags; I found the list in the registered letter-bag, and the letter addressed to Mr. Cotton—I handed that letter, with another addressed to Mr. Jones, Newington-crescent, to the prisoner; they were both on his delivery—he signed this slip for them, and there is my signature at the bottom—I, at the same time, gave the prisoner I receipt docket to be signed by the person to whom the letter is delivered—the prisoner signed this paper at forty-one minutes past 7; he received them three minutes after their arrival at the office—I am quite certain it was before 8 o'clock—he left the office at fifty minutes past 7—the district he is upon is not an extensive one—the furthest distanoe he has to go is about six minutes' walk; it would take him about an hour to deliver an average quantity of letters—he should have delivered Mr. Cotton's letters about a quarter-past 8, I should think—he would finish his delivery at five miniutes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220048"></xptr>
               <p>past 9—when he delivered the letter he should have got a signature to the receipt and have brought it back to the office—he had a small linen or can<lb></lb>vass bag, similar to that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to carry his letters in—into that bag he would put the registered letters as well as the others; the registered letters are given to him first, before he has the other letters—when he makes up the bundle he lays them in with the others so that they may be delivered in the ordinary course—he would get back to the office after concluding that delivery at five minutes past 9; at 10 o'clock for a fresh delivery—he would leave the office again for another delivery at 10.30; he would be back at 11.15 from that delivery, and then the next would be half-past 3—he would leave the office about 4, concluding that delivery at 5.10, I think—he would not come to the office at all between the end of the 10 o'clock delivery and the begining of the half-past 3 delivery—he would have that part of the day to himself—I am sure he returned for the 10 o'clock delivery that day; he signed the book, and also at half-past 3—I expect the receipt back the next morning—sometimes the person to whom the letter is addressed is away, and they have to go three or four times; they don't leave the letter without getting the receipt, not without a proper signature; the housekeeper's is a proper signature, or any person responsible in the house—the prisoner returned the receipt for Mr. Cotton's letter to the Southern branch on the following morning; I found it on a file there—he said nothing to me that day about a missing letter, or not having delivered a letter—I saw Mr. Jones' receipt also on the following morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, West-terrace, Penton-street, Newington—the last week in August, Mr. Stephen Cotton was lodging at my house—I recollect the prisoner bringing a registered letter for him, on the afternoon of 20th August, between 4 and 5 o'clock—he had not brought a letter to the house before that day—he produced this slip of paper, which I signed and gave back to him—I put the registered letter that the prisoner delivered to me on the mantel-piece—Mr. Cotton came home about half-past 8, and I told him there was a letter for him—he shortly afterwards made some communication to me about that letter; and a few minutes after that, the prisoner called again to deliver another letter—I called him in, and took him up to Mr. Cotton's room—Mr. Cotton asked him what time he brought the letter—he said, "About half-past 4 or 5"—Mr. Cotton said, "It ought to have come in the morning"—the prisoner said he brought it as soon as he got it—Mr. Cotton then told him that there ought to be two</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at 6, West-terrace, Penton-street, Newington, and am agent for Messrs. Lawson—on the evening of 20th August, upon coming home, I found this registered letter—I opened it, found the inclosure, but no notes—I saw from the letter it referred to some notes, and gave the numbers of them—I rang the bell, and Mrs. Jackson came up—I ultimately saw the prisoner—I did got take any particular notice of the letter before I opened it—I did not notice that it had been tampered with at all; it was tied at that time—I called the prisoner's at<lb></lb>tention to the fact of the registered letter not being delivered until between 4 and 5, and asked him how that was—he said he did not know how that was, he delivered it as soon as he could—he said letters were brought in the road-carts from the chief office to the Walworth office—I told him that two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes had been taken out, and asked him for his number, which he gave me—I put it down on the envelope, and he went away—he did not say a word to me about having brought the letter before 8 o'clock; he said he brought it as soon after he received it as possible—I telegraphed to Leeds next morning, received a message from there, and communicated with the Post-office authorities.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior clerk at the General Post-office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier at the Walworth post-office—I have seen this slip, signed by the prisoner, containing the entry for two registered letters; one addressed to Mr. Jones, Newington-crescent, and the other to Mr. Cotton, West-terrace, Penton-street—I saw the prisoner at the General Post-office on 25th August—he had been brought there—this slip was shown to him—he said he had signed for the two registered letters in the morning, after he had tied up his other letters and put them into his bag; that he put the two registered letters in the bag, went home, and did not discover them till 3 o'clock—he also said, in answer to some questions that were asked him, "I discovered one letter, and delivered it at 10 o'clock; I went home about half-past 11; I finished my <hi rend="italic">eights</hi> about 20 minutes past 9, and went home and got my breakfast; I felt, in my bag at home, and found one letter, which I delivered, Mr. Jones's, with my <hi rend="italic">tens;</hi> I got home at a quarter-past 11 o'clock; I ran home as fast as I could with the intention of looking for the registered letter, but something called my attention, and, I suppose, I forgot it; I had to cook my dinner, and did not see the letter till I was going to the office for my <hi rend="italic">three"</hi>—he was asked what he did after dinner, and he said, "I laid down and had a sleep until I went to the office"—that was all that passed in my presence.</p>

I am a paying-clerk in the Bank of England—on 20th August, these two notes were presented at the bank, and cashed by me, to the best of my belief, about 2 o'clock—the bank closes at 4—it was not after half-past 3—I left myself at half-past 3—I should say it was about an hour before I left—they were both presented together by the same person—I cannot say who the person was—they were paid in gold; all</p>

I am a police-constable of the Post-office—I was present at the office on Monday, 25th August, when there was an investigation about this letter—Mr. Gardner was then present—I heard what was said, and have heard what Mr. Gardner has said, but I think he had left some time when the prisoner said something—the prisoner was asked whether he went to the Bank of England on 20th August—he said, "No; after I had finished my tens, about a quarter-pant 11, I went home; I cooked the dinner, and after I had my dinner I laid down; I never went out until I went to the offices at half-past 3 for my threes"—he was asked if he was quite sure of that, and he said he was positive of it—I then accompanied him to his lodgings, which are three or four minutes' walk from the Walworth district office, and it would take about that time, or not quite so much, to go from the office to Mr. Cotton's—I unlocked a drawer at his lodgings with a key from a bunch which he gave me, and in that drawer I found this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid on the 20th—in the pocket of the waistcoat I found four new sovereigns, wrapped in paper—they are not here—they were each dated 1861—I asked the prisoner whose money that was, and he said, "It is money I have col<lb></lb>lected on behalf of my mother for ground rents"—I said, "Why, here is a receipt for ground rents; who paid this?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "When?"—he said, "I do not know; look at the receipt, it will speak for</p>

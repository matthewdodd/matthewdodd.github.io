               <p>You could not much doubt what she was? - No, not much; I asked her where she lived, and she said, just by; and being early in the morning, I went with her to a lodging, where the woman of the house asked me a shilling for the bed; I said I will give you a shilling; says I, I do not want any thing of this woman; if you can find her a lodging, I will pay you for it, and she shall have a lodging in any other part of the house; the woman did not seem to say much to what I said, but went up stairs with me; and I took out the money out of my breeches pocket, and put into my stocking, at my knee, and buttoned my breeches up tight, in the presence of the woman; and I took my coat and shoes off, and laid down myself; I fell asleep, and she was in the room; she did not attempt to lay down, or undress herself; I awaked, and I lay awake some time before she offered to go out of the room; I suppose this was in an hour after I had been in the room; seeing her going out of the room, I felt the knee of my breeches, and found the money gone, and my knee-buckle gone; I got up immediately, and laid hold of the woman as she just got the door open, and got out of the room, and calls immediately for a watch; and the landlord came up immediately, and asked what was the matter; and I said, this woman has robbed me, and I will not quit her till the watch comes and takes charge of her; the watchman came, and I gave her into his custody, and put on my coat and shoes to go along with him, and went to the watch-house, and gave charge to the constable: I lost two guineas in gold, and twelve shillings in silver, and my knee-buckle; the woman was searched, and her room, and the knee-buckle was found in her box, but no money.</p>
               <p>This was about two o'clock in the morning; where had you been spending your evening, was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to go with this woman? - It was early in the morning, and I did not wish to go to disturb the lodging where I lodged.</p>
               <p>You told us you did not know whether she was a woman of the town, at this time; certainly you could have no doubt? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to say that you did not know it? - Because I had not any connexion with her; I went with her for no other view than to get a bed for a night.</p>
               <p>Have you lived in London long? - Yes, almost all my life-time.</p>
               <p>And you did not know where to get a lodging? - Not that time in the morning, at that part of the town.</p>
               <p>You live in Bloomsbury, and you met her in Holborn, therefore it was not a part of the town you did not know? - I did not know of a lodging to go to, without paying an extravagant price for it.</p>
               <p>You did not know what you was to pay for this? - If it had been extravagant, I should not have gone.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober, you had been drinking nothing at all? - No more than a pint or two of beer.</p>
               <p>This was past two o'clock? - About two, my lord.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking? - From six o'clock, and in that time I might have drank three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>All this at one public-house? - No, not at one; I was at two or three.</p>
               <p>Where was the first? - At six o'clock I went to Cow-lane.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>What did you drink there? - We drank some porter; there were seven in company, and I dare say we did not drink a pint a-piece: I went from thence to a house in Holborn, the Blue-Boar tap; there there were four or five in company, that were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140089"></xptr>neighbours, and I staid there about the same time, about an hour and half: the next house we went to was the French-horn, in Holborn, a little higher up.</p>
               <p>And it was about nine o'clock when you got there? - About nine, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I did not stay there a vast while; I do not think I was there more than half an hour; that was the last house I was in before I met this woman: when I came out, I went along with a friend a little way up Holborn, and left him there in Holborn.</p>
               <p>You began at six in the evening, and staid an hour and half at the first place, and then got on for another hour and half, and then got to the French-horn, and staid there about half an hour; this brings the time, from when you first set out, to nine or ten o'clock; what did you do with yourself from nine or ten o'clock till two in the morning? - I must have staid a considerable time more than that, a considerable time.</p>
               <p>You must have been drinking much more than what you say? - I do not think I had.</p>
               <p>How came you to run from public-house to public-house? - They are customers of mine, and I called in to ask them how they did; I was not all the time in the public-house, because there was the ground of walking.</p>
               <p>The ground is not a great deal, it is only the length of Holborn; and it was past two in the morning? - Not quite two.</p>
               <p>Your information says past two, between two and three; I wonder how you, a decent man, should go so readily with a woman of that description, between two and three in the morning, and apply to her for a lodging? - It was very wrong, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You might have had a lodging at the Blue-boar, or at the French-horn? - I never lodged at the Boar, nor asked them for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Now recollect, do you mean to state to the jury, that, though you had been at these three houses, you was perfectly sober, and had not drank above three pints of beer? - I do.</p>
               <p>When you got to this lodging, you had some suspicion of this woman, and you put your money in that form because you had some suspicion of the person? - I suspected losing my money somehow or other, and I put it into my knee for safety.</p>
               <p>Where was this? - I believe it is called Church-lane, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>How came you to remain there, if you was sober? - Because I was too late to go home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not he swear at first it was three guineas? - I had three guineas in my pocket, but I found one on the top of the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she on the bed with you at any time? - She never was on the bed to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man, or single? - Single.</p>

               <p>What people do you lodge with? - They keep a milk-shop.</p>
               <p>They are up early in the morning? - Yes, as early as four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you go and awake these people? - If I had waited for their hours, they would have been up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness insisted at the justice's that I went to bed with him, which I certainly did; and did not you say, first, that you had lost three guineas and fourteen shillings? - I did at first, but afterwards I did not like to charge her with any more than two guineas and twelve shillings.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house keeper: at past four o'clock these people were brought to the watch-house; the watchman searched the woman, and found a box, and gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140090"></xptr>me; I opened the box with expectation of finding some money, but there was none in; the next morning I went to the justice's, and turned out all the things on a table, and there was a buckle which the prosecutor said was his, and he swore to it. (Produced.) It has been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Holborn exactly at four o'clock in the morning, and the prosecutor came by and asked me if I could get him a lodging; I told him I did not know where to get one, but he had better go to the French-horn; and he said he would not go there, it was so dear; and he took me to this house, because it was cheaper; and he paid a shilling for himself, and I asked him to make me a compliment; he said he would afterwards; I went to bed with him, and was about half an hour on the bed with him; and then I asked him again if he would make me a compliment; he said he would not; then I went down stairs, and told the gentleman down stairs I would not stay, because the man would not make me a compliment; he came down too, and said he had lost his coat; he went up stairs again; he came down again, and said he had found his coat; he went up stairs again, and said I had robbed him of his money; I was searched, and there was nothing found upon me but twopence halfpenny and my box of duplicates; and when I complained for want of my tobacco-box at the justice's, then Mr. Walker took that knee-buckle in his hand, and asked me if I knew that; I told him I did not; it was put into the box, but I know nothing about it.</p>

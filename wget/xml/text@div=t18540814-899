                  </hi>. I am potman at the George the Fourth, Mint-street, Whitechapel.

                  </hi>. I keep the George the Fourth—I recollect receiving a shilling from the last witness about 10 o'clock, on 21st July; I saw directly that it was bad; I put it on a shelf under the counter by itself—I saw the prisoners about three quarters of an hour afterwards—they came in together, and M'Sheen called for a pot of porter; I drew it, and while I drew it, he put down a half crown very quietly—I noticed it was bad, and would not let him have the porter—I told him it was bad, and he said I did not know what good money was—I asked him where he got it; he said he sold his shirt in Petticoat-lane, and got the half crown—I kept it, and sent for a constable, and gave it him—I gave the shilling to the last witness, and he gave it to the policeman—no one could have changed the shilling on the shelf; I was there the whole time.</p>

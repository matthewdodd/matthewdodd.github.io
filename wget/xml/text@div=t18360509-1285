                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information when I was in Shoreditch, on Saturday, the 30th of April, and ran through Magpie-alley, towards Wheeler-street—I there saw the three prisoners in company together, walking very fast—I pursued them-when they got near the bottom of the street they began running—I pursued them through Spitalfields-market, and lost sight of them—I caught sight of them again by the Church, and ran towards them—I took Pearson and Smith, and my brother-officer took Moore—I observed Moore had some<lb></lb>thing under her shawl-we took them into the watch-house, and I said I wished them searched—Moore dropped this piece of print, and this shawl from under a shawl she had on—I said, "That is what I expected"—I took it up—after they were looked up, I inquired in Shoreditch, and found the property belonged to Mr. Webb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. The three prisoners came together to my shop, on Saturday, the 30th of April, at twelve o'clock, to look at printed cottons—Smith bought a dress, and Moore paid sixpence on it—they said they would call again in the afternoon—they were all three in company—they went to the door, returned again, and said they should like to see a shawl; and bought one for the same prisoner—Moore paid sixpence on that—they called again in the afternoon, and Moore wished to see a shawl larger than they had seen in the morning; but she did not like any I showed them—Pearson asked to see some more prints, but did not like them—she at last pur<lb></lb>chased a print—the shawl and print produced are mine—they did not buy them—I missed the shawl a few minutes after they left the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rotherhithe—on Friday, 17th May, about 10.30 p.m., I was with other boys near Mill Pond Bridge and saw the prisoner on the bridge with a baby on her right arm—she took it by the arms and legs and threw it over into the water—the wall is about 4 1/2; feet high—before I could say "Look!" to my mate she fell on the ground and said "Oh, my child is drowned!"—she did not drop it accidentally, she flung it in—I pulled off my coat and was going to jump over, but Shepherd rushed into the water and saved it and handed it to Thomas Smith—the prisoner then ran from the high wall to the low wall and tried to throw herself in over the wall, but some men pulled her back.</p>

I live at George Row, Bermondsey—on 17th May, about 9.30, I heard a scream and shouts—I ran to the Mill Pond and saw the prisoner lying on her back across the kerb—I leaped over the wall of the bridge into the water, fetched a child out of the water, and handed it to Thomas Smith—the water is about 4ft. 6in. deep when it is full, and the wall is about the same height.</p>

I heard screams, ran to the spot, and saw a child in the water—Shepherd jumped in, rescued it, and gave it to me—I took it to a doctor, but he was out, and I ran to the station with it as quick as I could go and gave it to Inspector "White—I then went to the prisoner's house and found her there with a lot more women, one of whom said to her "Here is the man who took the child to the station"—the prisoner asked me whether the child was drowned or not—I said "No, the child is alive"—some of the women told me to say that the child was dead,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector R</hi>). On 17th May, soon after 9.30 p.m., Smith brought a child, which had obviously been in the water, to the station—it was apparently dead—it bore no signs of life whatever—its clothes were wet—I sent for Dr. Browning, and in the meantime stripped the child and practised the rules of the Humane Society, and before the doctor came the child breathed and cried—I went to the prisoner's house and found her in a very excited state, but perfectly sober—I told her that a statement had been made that she. had thrown the child into the water and I should take her in custody for attempting to murder it—she said that she hoped it would die, she intended to kill it and throw her<lb></lb>self in afterwards, and that she would commit suicide at the first oppor<lb></lb>tunity—I therefore had an officer to watch her the whole time she was in custody—when Dr. Browning arrived the child was sent to the Work-house Infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Rotherhithe—on the night of 17th May I was fetched from a house where I was attending to the station, and found there a child about three years old, which had recently been in the water and was partially recovered—if the officers had not actively applied the Humane Society's remedies nobody could have restored it—after treating it so as to produce as complete restoration as possible I sent it to the workhouse and left the station—I was afterwards recalled there and saw the prisoner—she was sober but apparently in a desponding condition—I could not perceive any symptoms of aberration of mind or any traces of insanity—I had known her before and had seen her twice or three times at the police-station, certainly twice—I asked her if she knew what she was charged with; she said yes—I said that as I might have to give evidence in the matter she need not answer any questions I put to her unless she pleased—she had told me that she was charged with attempting to drown her child, and I asked her if the charge was true—she said that it was and that she intended to make away with herself when she got the chance, and had tried to do so, but had been prevented—she also said that she threw the child in because she was in trouble, but she would not tell me what the trouble was.</p>

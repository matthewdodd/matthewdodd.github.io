                  </hi>. On 28th April, I was an errand boy in the service of Mr. Samuel Fouracre, a tailor, of 22, Cranbourne-street—on the after<lb></lb>noon of that day, I was taking a coat, vest, and trousers home to Bullock's auction-rooms in High Holborn for Mr. Sullivan—I was ringing at the street-door bell, and the prisoner came up to me; he asked me if I was waiting to get in, and I said I was—he asked me where I came from—I told</p>

               <p>him "Fouracre's, 22, Cranbourne-street"—he asked me who I wanted—I said, "Mr. Sullivan"—he said, "I am Mr. Sullivan, the clothes belong to me; I have been down to your place, and they told me you had been gone three or four minutes, and I had to run to catch you up; it is lucky I have caught you," or something to that effect—he said, "I will come back to the shop with you"—he came back as far as Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and then he said, "Oh, it is no consequence, you can give me the clothes and tell them to send the invoice before 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, as I shall be off by the train at 10 from Euston-square Station"—I then gave him the clothes—I did so because I thought he was Mr. Sullivan, and believed what he said—I next saw him on Saturday, 13th May, in the Strand, walking along with another man—I saw a policeman and gave him into custody.</p>

             to the Mansion-house on business of my own, and from thence to the Compter; then to a public-house in Honey-lane market, and from thence to the Bull's Head; and from thence I apprehended we were going home. The prisoner and Brooks were with us. We went along a lane, where Brooks catched hold of the other young woman; then I ran from them a great way. I apprehended they were designing to do us some injury. Litchfield ran after me and brought me back by force. I cryed out, and he swore if I spoke he would kill me. He brought me into a field: I saw Warnett and Brooks before me, they were both down in a ditch when he brought me back. Litchfield said, Now, you b - h, go after the other, and d - d me. Before that he had unbuttoned his breeches in the lane, and bid me take hold of what he had. I told him I would do any thing in the world, so that he would let me go. They got out of the ditch, but Brooks threw her in again: then I had got up to them. Litchfield had then hold of me by the arm, pulling me after her. He swore if I did not go along with her, he would cut my throat. I begged of him to let me go home; he swore we should not. I said, Did we think of your using us in this manner when we were in the public house? (meaning at the Bull-head.) He dragged me a great way up the field. It was dark. I said, Could not you as well take us up half the field, as to drag us all this way?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by that?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was so frighted, I did not know what I said. He threw me down upon the haycock: this was a hay field where they had been making hay.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do when he threw you down?</p>
               <p>Speak the truth, nobody will think ill of you for speaking the truth.</p>
               <p>Curtain. He entered my body.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He pulled up my petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches, and entered my body with his private parts, against my will and consent. I cryed out, but he swore if I spoke he would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he threw you down was it before he entered your body?</p>
               <p>Curtain. A good while. The other called to him, and asked if he had f - d me. Litchfield said No. D - n her, she never was f - d before. I cannot. He continued his attempt till I felt him in my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. I struggled, and did all in my power to prevent him, but he kept me down, and tired me till I had no strength. After that we went away, and found assistance from the gentlemen that appeared on the other trial. We craved their assistance, and they took us into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined by the midwife?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was. Mrs. Ham examined me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner attempt your body after this?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He did. But I cannot tell rightly whether he did enter my body a second time or not, I was in such a fright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your story to the gentlemen at the Nag's head the same as here?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. And the same before the justice the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Litchfield in Newgate since?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. The woman where I lodge told me what a dreadful thing it was to have a man hang'd for me: she desired me to go and speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280016"></xptr>Curtain. She never saw him in her life. I went, his wife was there; she said she had been seeking me all the day. I stood just by the gate; she said she would be very glad if I would stay till she came out. He told his wife there is the young woman. I thought I saw him through the rails, but I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's father.</p>
               <p>Curtain. The prisoner's wife got me to some relation, it was not his father. When she begged of me to go, I said, I will not go till my sister knows of it. They said they would give me any thing in the world if I would make it up. I said I would not without my master's consent. I did not know the consequence of it. Mr. Lennell was my master. I lived a little time with Mr. Ryland, a copper-plate printer in the Old Baily, after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through a hay field going to the Bull-head?</p>
               <p>Curtain. Yes. Brooks said that was the pleasantest way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the men play with you upon the hay?</p>
               <p>Curtain. Brooks said he would kiss

             on the hay, and he wanted to kiss me, but I got away from him. I did not tumble on the hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people call to you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. They called to Brooks. Litchfield did not insist upon it so much.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Litchfield behave at the Bull?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He behaved very civilly, for he never offered to kiss my lips there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you said to him, Could not you as well take us up half the field as to drag us all this way?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I thought he wanted to have his will of me, therefore I thought he might as well have his will half the way as to go so far, and I thought we should be nearer to people to hear us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think of that at that time?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the field?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I cannot recollect that; we were in the field an hour, or more, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the field before he entered you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He did that in less than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he tried to persuade you to consent?</p>
               <p>Curtain. He said nothing to me before, but then he swore if I would not let him, he would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I think he was very sober: he threw my hat by, and threw the hay about before he threw me down. I begged of him to go to the other young woman when the other fellow called; he called to Litchfield, and said, Have you done her once? Litchfield said, I have. Brooks said, Then blast your eyes, why don't you f - k her again? When he strewed the hay about, I was standing by the other young woman as she was struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the road?</p>
               <p>Curtain. This was the length of a great field.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not run away?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I was afraid, they had two dogs with them, and I was afraid they would set the dogs at me. He went to hawl Brooks off, and Brooks said, No, blast your eyes, I will stay all night. Upon that Litchfield took hold of him and hawled him off; then she begged of Litchfield to take hold of her; he set her at liberty, and Brooks lay on the ground flat on his back, and did not stir for some time. I was told that I should say I would not hurt a hair of Litchfield's head, but I never said no such thing. I said I should be very sorry a person should be hanged on my account, but if he deserved it, I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have been willing to have made it up, if no harm had come to you?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not declared you spent that afternoon in a very agreeable manner?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I have declared so, only they would not let us go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not declare you had spent the afternoon with as much pleasure as ever you had in your life?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I did. They used us very well till that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said the prisoner had done you no harm, unless you should prove with child?</p>
               <p>Curtain. No. For the midwife told me I had got the foul disease, and I found myself very sore and much hurt.</p>

            . I examined Curtain on Friday the 23d, at the justices request at the rotation. I did not find at that time that there had been any violence offered, for the situation she was in, that attends women, prevented my making observations. I examined her last Wednesday again, I did not find any appearance that gave me room to think she had received any injury. I thought she did not appear to have been used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280017"></xptr> with any violence lately, but the discharge she had before might have taken off the inflammation.</p>

               <p>E. Ham. I will not venture to say she was, or was not I thought there was something of a little venereal complaint: there was something of a running, but I cannot answer what it could be.</p>

            . Last Thursday was a week, I saw Curtain first by the Nag's-head in Hackney road, about the hour of ten in the evening; there were, Mr. Wooden, Mr. Thodey and Mr. Dunkin with me; the last is not here: when we were coming out of the field it was pretty dark, being a wet night, when the girls came to us and begged we would give them a protection: they said they had been cruelly used by a couple of men. Warnett catched hold of me, and Curtain made up to another. Warnett said she had something to say. We did not seem to take much notice of them: we went into the house, and the girls and the two men followed us in. The girls told us they had been ravished in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Curtain say she had been ravished?</p>
               <p>R. Ham. She did; that was, she said, by the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner desired me not to mind them, but said they had lived with them some time. The girls said they had never seen them before that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner mention he had lived with one of them?</p>
               <p>R. Ham. He did. Brooks said he had lived with one seven months. Curtain appeared very much frighted: they both cryed very much, and begged our assistance. There were two dogs with them, one with a collar about his neck, and Mellar upon it. Brooks said the dog was his. They were about the size of a spanniel. The prisoner behaved different from the other: the other said he would not be tied. I attended the justices the next morning Curtain told the same story there as she has now, and as she told us that night.</p>

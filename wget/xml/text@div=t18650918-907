                  </hi>. I am a mariner—on the evening of 26th August, about 10 o'clock, I arrived at London-bridge—I had come from Gloucester from my ship—a man in a light coat was close to an omnibus, and asked me whether he should carry my chest—I went with him to a coffee-house, and had some beer with him there—I then went to a public-house with him, and saw Farrow standing at the bar drinking—Finn came in afterwards—I gave them just what they liked to drink, liquor and beer—Farrow had a pipe, and I asked him to give me a smoke—he gave me the pipe, and said, "You can keep it"—when I had done smoking I put it in my coat-pocket—I am sure I did not return it to him—I saw it next at the police-station; it was taken from him there—the man in the light coat addressed the prisoners by name—he called Finn "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—there was a woman there, but I did not notice her much—I left the public-house nearer 1 than 12, I cannot exactly tell—my purse was all right then—I looked in it a few minutes before we came out of the public-house—I was not intoxicated, and knew everything—we all left together, all who were in the bar, and the woman—they were all together, except one man who stopped outside—four men and a woman were by me, and when I had got a few yards from the house they tackled me by the throat, and a hand was put over my mouth—I struggled, and knocked two of them away—two of them again tackled me by the throat, and one got on my legs, put his hands in my pockets, said, "All right; I have got it," and took out <hi rend="italic">my</hi> purse, containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; also my scarf, and shawl, and the pipe—they all ran away—I also lost my cap, but found it next morning hanging up at the station—I know it by the scratches inside the peak—I slept in the police-station—after the men ran away, I hallooed out, "Police"—I walked down to a policeman, and they had got the two prisoners; the others had gone—I told the policeman to take them in charge, as they were the men who had done it—I was very nearly black in the face.</p>

               <p>not know what time it was due at Paddington—I came to Paddington and took a bus—I had bad one glass of ale when I started from Gloucester—I afterwards bad only three or four glasses of beer and porter—I do not think that would knock a man over very much—I had no spirits—four or five men came out of the public-house together, but I only saw one woman-a woman was charged with the prisoners, but I could not identify her—they all touched me when I was on the ground, and Finn must have been one that helped, because they were all around me—I did say, "I cannot say whether or not Finn touched me," but he must have—he was standing at the bar, but not with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 465). I found this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about sixty or seventy yards from South wark-street, pushed down between the hoarding and the pavement stone—I handed it to Stevens, and the prosecutor identified it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 66). On Saturday morning, 26th or 27th August, I was 60 or 70 yards from Castle-street, and heard a cry of "Police," which appeared to come from Counter-street—before I got there, I was met by a woman named Larson, who was afterwards taken in custody—I spoke to her—she said something and pointed towards London Bridge, which was an opposite direction—I then, heard groans, and saw a man in a light coat and the two prisoners run out of Counter-street—a man in a dark coat ran into the Borough-market, fourteen yards before the other three—the man in the light coat had a dark coat hanging from his hand, he ran towards the Blackfriars-road—he ran past the hoarding, where the cap was afterwards found—I immediately took Finn by the left hand and Farrow by the right—they were running; not very fast, but coming quickly—the woman said, pointing to Farrow, "Let my husband go, he has done nothing"—I said, "Stop a bit, we will see what he has done"—I took them to Counter-street—this was fifteen or sixteen yards from where the prosecutor was lying—he got up, and staggered towards me—he complained of his throat, and was hardly able to speak—he said, "I have been robbed"—I said, "What of?"—he said, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a "purse"—I asked him if he knew the prisoners, he said, "Those are two of them;" he expressed no doubt about them—the cap was given to me—I took it to the station and hung it up—Hall saw it, and recognised it—I found the pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on Farrow—he said, "That is my pipe, I lent it to you in the public-house for a smoke, in the Black Horse"—Hall said, "You did not lend it to me, you gave it to me, and I bad. it on me at the time the robbery was committed"—I found the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open, in Farrow's breast pocket.</p>

There was a man shitting himself, I saw a box open, I asked that man whose it was, he said it was his, but Ellis had the use of it; Ellis said, he had. I took up a parcel, and asked the man if it was his; he said, no, it belonged to Thomas; I asked him, is this your's he said, it was what Lucy brought here; I asked what is in it; he said, I do not know, God knows, for I never opened it; I opened it, and found stockings, pieces of cotton, muslin, and linen, I tied it up again; Mr. Clarke said, he had missed some pillows, and other things; I took a pillow from the bed, and turned it up, it was marked S C; Mr. Clarke said it was his, that it was his pillow-case when he was a batchelor; sometimes after, Mr. Clarke wished to see the pillow, he said, if it is mine, there is a particular stain that I shall know it by, I took it out of the case, there was the stain, and he said, that is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the stain on he pillow? - A. He did not say any thing at all. (They are produced, and deposed to by Mr. and Mrs. Clark).</p>

The things that were in Ellis's room never had been in my master's house, I had just fetched them from Kensington; I desired the maid to take care of them till I came to fetch them, there is a woman here to witness it; my mistress has pawned things for herself and her sister; I have fetched a quartern of gin for her sister; my mistress had thirty-two duplicates in her pocket when I was with her; I had not time to wash all the things, those in the dust-hole were left.</p>

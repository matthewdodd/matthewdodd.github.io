               <p>Prisoner.

I used to play with little Legrove - I saw him on the day he was taken away, in Hill-street, Windmill-street; he had his jacket and trousers on, and the prisoner was leading him - I said to him, "Jemmy, where are you going?" but he made me no answer - the prisoner turned round, and looked very severely in my face; he had a great big coat, of a whiteish colour on, and three capes to it - he had trousers on, with little buttons at the bottom; he was leading the little boy by the hand - they walked away up Windmill-street, and I went to school.</p>

I received information, and had been looking for the prisoner - I found him on the 24th of February, in the custody of Mrs. Legrove, in Long-alley: I asked where he lived - he said at Chingford; I asked if he knew any thing about the charge - he said No, that he had been stopped by the woman before, but the little boy could not swear to him (that was the youngest child); I then took him to the back parlour of the public-house adjoining the office, where there were from a dozen to fourteen persons - I sent for little Armstrong, and told him to go and look in the back parlour, and see if he could pick out any person there who took away little Jemmy Legrove; he went into the room, looked all round, fixed his eyes on the prisoner, and said, "This is the man that took little Jemmy up Hill-street," and he said the coat he had on had three marks on it - when I took the prisoner he had this light coloured great coat on, which has three capes to it; and a pair of overalls, buttoned outside down to the legs - I found on him two knives, one of which I have found a witness who can swear to; I have made inquiry, and found the prisoner had taken off this great coat, and left it at a stall, and that he bought an orange at a stall where there were three women sitting.</p>

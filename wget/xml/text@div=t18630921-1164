                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of Joseph John Smith for four years—on 21st May I moored a barge of his, with a chain to a ring at the wharf—there were two tarpaulins on board, of seven-breadth cloth, and "J. J. Smith, Lambeth," was on them, in red letters, four inches long—I missed the barge, and afterwards found it between Lambeth and Vauxhall bridges, on the Surrey side—my master published a bill, which I posted about—I found the tarpaulins at Northfleet, on 26th August, on board the <hi rend="italic">Owner's Delight</hi>—the prisoner was not there—I found him at Gravesend; his mate went with me—I gave the prisoner in charge—the name was cut out of the tarpaulins; a piece of canvas put in its place, and the two were made into one cloth—the value of them was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-policeman</hi>, 9). I went with Twist to North<lb></lb>fleet, and found the cloth on the quarter-deck—we then went to Gravesend, and met the prisoner in Bath-street, coming out of his own house—I told him he had two tarpaulins on his barge belonging to Mr. Smith—he said, "Yes, I bought them at Hungerford-bridge, and they came next day and wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, as I had them too cheap, and my mate rowed them to the barge, from the barge <hi rend="italic">Joseph</hi>,"that is J.

                  </hi>. I live at Newington Butts, and occupy the front room in the basement—on 14th April, I came home about 1 a.m., and had a conversation with Mr. Bird, standing at the corner of the street—when I got home I found three men in the area, the prisoner was one—I said "What are you doing down here"—a fourth man who was at the top said "We are doing no harm"—they then left—I got a light and found the kitchen window and shutter open which I had left closed between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, and there were matches 'in the area—there was no fastening to the window—I went after the prisoner and saw him near the Elephant and Castle—Mr. Bird called a constable who went after him and brought him back—I did not charge him, as I was frightened because some woman threatened me and I did not go to the station—I am sure the prisoner is the man—nothing was moved at my place, they had no time.</p>

The last witness pointed out some men to me, the prisoner was one of them—they all ran away when I approached—I caught the prisoner, and on the way to the station he threw me down three times—I found on him a knife, a duplicate, a halfpenny, and some matches—I found the window up, but there were no marks on it.</p>

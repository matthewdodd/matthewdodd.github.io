                  </hi>. I am a carter, of 2, Paul's-alley, Red Cross-street. I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased, William Henry Westlake—we went on 23rd June to a public-house in Fann-street—we had a quarrel and went to Holloway to fight—we then came back to Old-street, St. Luke's—Westlake was drunk—I had heard no words between him and the prisoner—I was drunk, and the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—Westlake knocked the prisoner down in Old-street—they might have had words, but I did not hear them—the pri<lb></lb>soner jumped up and knocked Westlake down with his fist; he fell on the pavement—I cannot say where his head went—I helped to pick him up, and took him to a doctor's shop, and from thence to the station—I do not know whether he was sensible, he did not speak—I saw blood about his head—I only saw two blows struck.</p>

I was at Holloway, and came back to Old-street—Westlake made use of some vulgar language, and asked a friend who was walking with them to come away from the party—the prisoner turned round and asked him if our company was not as good as his—an altercation took place, and Westlake kept drawing his hand across the prisoner's face in a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—early on the morning of 24th June, I saw the body of Westlake, and found a punctured wound on the back of the head—it must have been made with some sharp instrument, not with the fist—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday, and inside the skull, beneath the external wound, was a large mass of coagulated blood which compressed the brain and caused death; one of the larger blood-vessels had ruptured with the fall or blow—I saw him at the moment of his death, and then thought there were traces of intoxication, but there were no traces of it at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—death must have resulted from the fall, not from mere intoxication.</p>

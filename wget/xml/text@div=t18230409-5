On Sunday morning, the 9th of March, a little after eleven o'clock, I went out, leaving nobody at home, and taking the key with me - I returned about half-past eleven o'clock the same evening and found the door still locked; I unlocked it and went into the shop - I observed my drawers taken out of their places and put upon the counter. I went and fetched Mr. Spence, my next door neighbour; we got a light at his house, and went into the shop, and found a large screw driver and chisel - we then went up stairs into the sitting room and bed room, and found the boxes broken open, and my clothes all thrown about; I looked into a little box where I kept my money and missed twelve sovereigns, also a great quantity of wearing apparel. We then went down into the kitchen below the shop, and there found Pestell laying asleep against the door; I sent for the watchman, who took him to Islington watch-house, and there found upon him five handkerchiefs, three pair of white cotton stockings, and other things which were mine. I examined the house; they had got in at the front area door by taking out a piece where the bolt went into the post - that door opens into the area, so that they could pull it open; they had another door to enter into the kitchen, a pannel was taken out of that, and the bolts undone, which were bolted before - the shop door was forced also. I missed a quantity of tea, sugar candy, almonds, raisins, rice, and eight waistcoats, worth about 25 s., and other articles as stated in the indictment, worth more than 6 l. together. I had seen the prisoner Pestell several times before - he lived within twenty yards of my house; his father is a gardener. I do not know the other prisoners.</p>

On the 14th I had information, and went down the Hornsey-road, and took Day - I said I came for some property stolen from Mr. Birkenshaw; he said he knew nothing of any property - I took him to Worship-street; he there said if he could get bail he could recover part of the property; that he knew where it was, it was not at a house, but in a field; the Magistrate said he could not have bail, but we might take him down with us, and get the property. Gleed and I went with him down the Hornsey-road, on Saturday, the 15th, Hatchett came out of a gentleman's house with a ladder; Collins my brother officer stopped him till I came up; Day then stopped with me while Hatchett, Gleed, and Collins went some where and brought back two waistcoats.

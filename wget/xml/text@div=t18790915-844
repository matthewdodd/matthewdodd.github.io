He went to tell Mr. Amery, but on seeing him coming out he was afraid, as he had always told him never to leave the pony and trap on any account. He spent the rest of the day searching, and walked about all night as he had no money, and had to pawn his coat next morning to keep himself till Wednesday, when he went home, but his landlord refused to admit him as the police had been after him, and he then gave himself up.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in jewellery and live at Friern Lodge, Peckham Rye—I have known Cohen four or five years, and his father longer, and he bears the general reputation of an honest and respectable young man—I was speaking to him in Houndsditch on Monday, 28th July, between 2 and 3 p.m., and a man whom I knew by sight as a dealer came up and offered a sample of pearl studs, and asked Cohen if he could purchase a large quantity, between 800 or 900 of them—he said at first he did not care for them, they were not the class of goods he cared to purchase, as they were too much trouble to sell—the man mentioned Hackney Road—I fancied a set of the pearl studs and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them from the samples he was submitting—Cohen said he could not buy them by sample and could make him no offer unless he saw the bulk—I left them at the end of Houndsditch and they walked away together—I have carried on business in London as a dealer for 19 or 20 years, and know most of the sale rooms and most of the dealers in the East End—large transactions take place on Sunday mornings at Duke's Place—many dealers are, known by sight to other dealers who do not know their names and addresses, and considerable transactions take place between them—I know between 400 and 500 jewellery dealers and diamond merchants, but do not know the names of 20 of them—in the goods produced there is no intrinsic value</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter, and live at 4, Copeland Terrace, Peckham—I have known Cohen and his father seven or eight years, and during that time his general reputation has been good—on 29th July, about 8.30, I called for the first time at Camden Passage to see his father, and I. saw Cohen there and purchased a small gold Geneva watch, secondhand—he said something and we went together towards Hackney Road—outside a public-house he met a friend who spoke to him on business and upbraided him with being twenty minutes late, and said he was just going away—Cohen said something I did not hear, and I went with them into a house in Elizabeth Street, Hackney Road—I know the house—there were on a small oral table in the front room four brown paper packets—some conver<lb></lb>sation took place about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Cohen said he had made up his mind not to give more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he should like to sea them—I saw money pass, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he looked over the goods and tied them up with a string—they were studs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never spoke to Cohen but twice before—I only went with him to meet his father to buy a chain from him; he told me his father had a chain that would suit, and we called at Elizabeth Street, which was in our way to the City; I told him if I got to the City at 10.30 that would suit me—he said in all probability he might meet his father on the road as he was going to Houndsditch—the man he met is an old man—I never saw Kim before, but should know him—I did not hear his name mentioned or hear him address Cohen by name—I had nothing to do with the matter and was merely waiting in the room—I was first asked to come and give evidence about 10 days ago—I have had no transactions with him since—I remember it was the 29th July, because on 2nd August I began an un<lb></lb>common good week—I told Cohen to tell his father I should have plenty of money coming in next week—I can tell by my memorandum book what other good weeks I had—I did not put down this transaction with Cohen, but speak from memory.</p>

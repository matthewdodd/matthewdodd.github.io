I used to send him to open and shut the shop, and sweep it out; he was suspected of taking money. On the 12th of August I emptied the till, and put 4 l. worth of marked silver in it. I sent all the men out except the apprentice and him. I went out myself, returned in about ten minutes, and asked the prisoner if he had any money in his pocket? He said he had not. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Put down the half crowns that you have taken out of the till." The apprentice counted the money in the till, and missed eight half crowns and 3 s. I told the prisoner to put it all down, which he did - it was the same that I had marked. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. After business was done, my master put 4 l. worth of marked money in the till, leaving me and the prisoner in the house. I went up stairs, and while there I heard the till open; I came down, and sent him for a pint of beer. While he was gone I counted the money, and missed half a crown - he returned. I left him alone, and again heard the till open; I went to look for Mr. Beauchamp, but could not find him - the prisoner wanted to go, but I would not let him; my master came in soon after. I informed him, and he went up to the prisoner, and asked him if he had got any money? He said,</p>
               <p>"No, master;" I missed eight half crowns and 3 s. My master told him to produce them, which he did. I knew them to be the same that were marked.</p>

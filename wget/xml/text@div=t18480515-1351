                  </hi> I keep the White Horse, in Assembly-row, Miles End. The prisoner was my bar-man for seven days—three days before gave him into custody I missed some money from my till—I marked some money, and gave it to Barnes, the policeman—on 4th May I cleared my till of all the silver, and only left some halfpence in it—I went to it about twenty minutes afterwards, and found two sixpences, a marked 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and some silver that was not marked—I cleared the till at five o'clock, I went to it afterwards, and found two marked sixpences and some silver not marked—I then gave the prisoner in charge—I saw him searched—three sixpences were found on him—two of them I had marked myself, and given to Barnes—I told him I suspected he had been robbing me, I should give him in charge—he said he had three sixpences in his pocket—he did not say anything about them in my presence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 256.) I had some marked sixpences from the prosecutor—I think it was on 3rd may, the day previous to this occur<lb></lb>rence—they were marked when he gave them to me, I marked them besides—I gave one to my sister about three o'clock, and one to my wife a few minutes before five, to go to the prosecutor's and purchase some liquor—I afterwards went there—the prisoner was called, and the prosecutor said be had been robbing him—he said he had not—he said he had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his right-hand pocket, and amongest it were the two marked sixpences, which I had given my wife and sister—I asked the prosecutor if he knew them—he said, yes he did—I told the prisoner they were marked, and asked how long he had that money—he said, "I do not know, but some time"—on the way to the station he said, "I remember, it was all through the copper; when Mr. Bradford went to tes he left no coppers in the till, and I gave change, but I afterwards found a five-shilling paper of half<lb></lb>pences."</p>

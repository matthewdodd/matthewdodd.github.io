               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Princes-street, Soho: these buckles Mr. Keating has sworn to, were pledged with me on the 12th of April; I lent six shillings upon them.</p>
               <p>Who brought them to you? - I cannot positively swear; it was one man, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Mayo has been at the shop several times, but whether he is the person that pawned them or no, I cannot positively swear.</p>
               <p>I ask you if you had ever seen the man at your shop before that brought the buckles to you: then you know Mayo? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it Mayo or no? - I cannot positively swear that it was him.</p>
               <p>Was he the man that brought you the buckles or no? - It might for what I know.</p>
               <p>What name were they pawned in? - In the name of Wright; that is a name that he often makes use of.</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop when the man brought the buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And Mayo himself you have often seen before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the person that brought the buckles pawn them in the name of Wright? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was that Wright or was it Mayo? - Him in blue cloaths goes now by the name of Mayo.</p>
               <p>Was that the man? - To the best of my recollection it was.</p>
               <p>Is that prisoner in blue cloaths the person you have often seen at your house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And that is the man that brought these buckles to you? - To the best of my recollection it is.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day did he come? - It was some time in the day, it was not by candle light.</p>
               <p>He had frequently dealt at your shop, had he? - Sometimes, not very often.</p>
               <p>From MAYO. Whether he ever knew me pawn any thing there before? I have fetched things out for people; but I never pawned things there in my life. - He has fetched things out, and I have taken some things in of him before this.</p>

               <p>Mrs. KEATING. These are the buckles I was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Who were they brought by? - They were pledged, as it appeared from a ticket on them and an entry in the day-book, in the name of Standish.</p>
               <p>You did not see them brought to your house, did you? - I took them in myself.</p>

             the postboy came in and called Richardson and Dawson and these three men there, and said his master and mistress were at the play, and that they would return about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who were his master and mistress? - I do not know; and that it was easy to rob them, and he should be very glad if they would rob them, because they kept him out so late of a night.</p>
               <p>Where did you hear this? - At the King's Head, Bear-street, in a back room.</p>
               <p>Did he see you there? - I don't know; I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you drinking with them? - I cannot say that; I was in the room with them; I cannot be sure whether I was drinking with them or no.</p>
               <p>You had often drank there together before, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time was this? - Between six and seven: they all went out in about half an hour; they did not go out all together.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about where they were to meet? - He said they were easy to be robbed down by Bayswater; I heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>Then you heard nothing settled where they were to meet? - No; Richardson and Dawson came back in about an hour afterwards, and they went out again; the others were gone.</p>
               <p>How long did Richardson and Dawson stay? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they go out again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay behind? - Because I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220018"></xptr> had never any notion of doing any thing so bad.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay there? - I used generally to stay there of a night.</p>
               <p>You staid behind, and was much surprized at it? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information immediately? - I told one Mr. Green of it.</p>
               <p>When? - About three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Did not you hear the prisoners, or some of the party, say something in answer to the postilion? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing them in April last? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you positive as to the night? - It was Thursday night, and I believe the eleventh of April; we were at the King's Head in Bear-street drinking in the back room; we had been there some time, and had had two or three pots of beer; we were there about five or six o'clock, and about seven o'clock Robert Leach the postboy came with his post-chaise to the door, and stopped and called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Whose chaise was it? - One Mr. Palmer's in Bond-street; he put two young women out of the chaise, and afterwards came in and called to Richardson and me; Richardson and I went out to him, and the other three came out afterwards; we were going out of the back room to make water; we saw him come into the back room to look for his brother-in-law; the three prisoners followed us to the door; we were drinking the beer: said he, I have set down two gentlemen and a lady at the playhouse, and he should be glad if any one would rob them; that they had got plenty of bit in their pockets, meaning money: he went away directly from Bear-street.</p>
               <p>What was said by the parties? - It was all agreed by Richardson, Standish, Mayo, Humphries, and myself to meet him at Kensington Gravel-pits.</p>
               <p>Did you agree at what time to meet? - No; we were to meet upon the road.</p>
               <p>Where did this conversation pass? - Part at the back-door and part at the fore-door; I went out of the house and came back again; when I came back about eight the three prisoners were gone; I went home and had some victuals, but did not stay above a quarter of an hour; they went off by themselves, and Richardson and I followed them, and upon our way we called at Bruton-street Mews, Berkeley-square, where the post-chaise was put up, and had a glass of gin with the postilion Leach; he told us it was then too soon to go, as he did not go out of town till ten o'clock at night: we went upon the road and met Humphries, Mayo, and Standish by Kensington Gravel-pits at the other other side of the turnpike; the postboy told us he should be there about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you met at Kensington Gravel-pits? - I dare say almost half an hour after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait there? - Almost half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220019"></xptr> an hour; the postboy told us he would be driving very hard, and if we called out stop, he would stop directly; in about half an hour we saw the chaise coming very fast; Richardson called out to him to stop; he stopped directly, and we went up, some on one side the chaise, and some on the other; and one went to the horses heads: we demanded their money.</p>
               <p>Who were in the chaise? - Two young gentlemen and a lady: I got five shillings; Richardson told us he got a guinea and a few shillings; the other three came up and took three pair of shoes and two pair of knee-buckles and a watch; they took the shoes off the lady's feet, and a pair of shoes off the gentlemens feet, and a watch: I called out to Richardson to behave honourable to the lady, upon which he swore he would blow my brains out; they went off directly; they threw away the lady's shoes, but kept the gentlemens shoes; one had the watch and another had a pair of knee-buckles; Mayo had a pair of shoe-buckles, Standish a pair, Humphries a pair,

               <p>When did you take him up? - I took Mayo first; Standish was taken up about a week after; Dawson voluntarily surrendered himself.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you are a constable; what business are you? - A peruke-maker.</p>
               <p>You serve for yourself, and not a substitute? - For myself.</p>
               <p>You are not a runner at an office? - I am a constable; I do not know what you mean by a runner; if I see a thief I will take him, or go any where after one for the good of my country.</p>

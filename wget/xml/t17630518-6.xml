On the 30th of April the prisoner, who lived servant at the White Lion, came to see some silk and ribbons, after she was gone, I missed some ribbon; I found she had given a child about a yard and a half of the same I missed. I charged her with taking it. The constable, in searching her box, found about 6 yards more of it; she would give no account how she came by it.</p>

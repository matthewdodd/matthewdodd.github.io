I was in High-street, Barnet, in the evening of the 16th of July, and the prisoner sent me to get a lodging at the public-house—he had at that time got my things—I went to the public-house for a lodging, and when I came out he was gone—I afterwards found him at another lodging—he had been working with me.</p>

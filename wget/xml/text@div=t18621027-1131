                  </hi>. I am a mat-maker, of 3, Folly-court, Dockhead—in De<lb></lb>cember last, I was in the employment of Mr. Kompster, of Charles-street, a carman and chandler—there was about two tons of rope in his shed, some months before Christmas, which were put in the van—it was not covered</p>

               <p>over—Kempster helped me to remove it to Mr. Learey's, 175, Rotherhithe-street. I believe it is—we left it there, and came away—on 18th February last, I was doing a job for Mr. Kempster, between 8 and 9 in the evening—I took the van out by Mrs. Kempster's directions, and went to the Green Man, Jamaice-level, opposite the London Ropery Company's factory—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Bassett and another man, I do not know whether it was Stokes, came to me—I knew that Bassett was in the employ of the Ropery Company; and in consequence of what he said, I backed into the gates of the Ropery Company, when he opened them, and about two tons of rope were loaded upon my ran, which I took to Mr. Kempster's stables; next morning, in consequence of directions given to me, I went with the van and rope to the George, in the Commercial-road, by my master's directions—some man, who I do not know, came up to me, from a street by the side of the George, and spoke to me, and I followed him with the van to the Stone-stairs, Ratcliff—I do not see him here—he went into a public-house, facing Mr. Willis's, and brought two other men out of there—a man named Gray, and Mr. Bigford, came up, and we all went into Willis's—the man who I had followed, and the young man who belonged to Mr. Willis, came out and took over a ton of the rope out—I then went to Mr. Vane's—Mr. Gray, I think, gave me instructions to do so—the same men went on with me there, and the rest of the rope was delivered there—I then went home to my master, and told him where I had been.</p>

I am a dealer in tar, and live in the Commercial-road—Gray, who was tried here, called on me about 19th February, and I took him and introduced him to Mr. Willis—we first went to the Stone Stairs public-house, to wait till the rope came—the cart came up with the rope, and the carman, and the prisoner—I heard Gray call him Evans—Gray, Evans, and I went into Willis's shop—Gray said to Mr. Willis's foreman, "Here is the rope, Mr. Willis; perhaps you will look at it"—the foreman came to the door, and I went over to the public-house to wait, leaving Gray and Evans there—they came lack after they had done the business, and Gray gave me, I think it was, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said that it was half my commission—he was not alone then; they were both together—I do not know the men who came up with the van—I only noticed one besides Evans.</p>

               <p>to go—he did not answer me—I put that question three times, and he then asked me if I knew the London Ropery Company—I said I knew where their premises were—he said, "It is not so far as that"—we passed a public-house, at the door of which a man was standing, and the prisoner asked that man to get the key, and he brought it, as I suppose, out of the public-house—it turned out to be the key of Kempster's place, where the rope was—one of the two, I can't say which, opened the place—we did not go through the chand<lb></lb>ler's shop to get to where the rope was—I inquired the price of the rope—I think the prisoner said it was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt.—I said that was too much, that I thought 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was sufficient—he said it was cheap at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I did not purchase any—it was really very cheap indeed at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I had some reason to believe whose rope it was when I spoke, and I believed it was stolen, and I endeavoured to bring down the price—it was so cheap, that I thought it was stolen—I believed it was the London Ropery Company's rope—in my belief, that rope was worth between 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I went away, and told Turner my suspicions—I met the prisoner in Billiter-square, in the City, a week or ten days after—he stopped me, and said that he had not disposed of the rope, and if I would induce Messrs.

On 20th February last, I went with a search-warrant to Kempster's premises, 20, Charles-street, Bermondsey—it was a cart-shed, close to a stable, in a court—it was not near a shop—there was no appearance of a rope business being carried on there—I found two coils of rope there, which were afterwards identified by Mr. Hounsell—I did not show them to Mr. Urling Smith—they were also shown to Mr. Spratt, who was with me—it was I who took Kempster in custody—when I saw the rope, I took the person in whose stables I found it, in custody; I took charge of the rope also—after the conviction of Kempster and the others, it was given up to the London Ropery Company—I after<lb></lb>wards apprehended Bassett, and another officer, who was with me, appre<lb></lb>hended Stokes at the same time—I have been seeking the prisoner ever since—I have not a warrant for his apprehension—I apprehended him last Wednesday evening, the 22d—I obtained a certificate of a true bill against him at this Court, and presented it to the Magistrate—I knew where he lived, and went there after him—I employed persons, and had his house watched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were Stokes and Bassett in the employment of the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Stokes was the foreman, and Bassett under-foreman—I have known ever since this occurred where the prisoner lived; Mr. Vare first told me some information connected with, them, and I found out where they lived—I took him at his own house—when I told him the charge, he said, "I will go with you;" that was all—I did not say I had been looking for him—I merely told him what the charge was against him, and that I was going to take him in custody—I think, on going to the station, I told him I had been looking for him, and he said he had been in the country carrying on business as a commission agent, selling manure.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of Prospect-place, Cambridge-heath—I am commissioned to sell rope—I was tried and acquitted—I offered some of this rope for sale, and sold it—I also asked people to buy it in other instances—it was in my hands for sale for a week or two—the prisoner placed it in my hands with samples—I was in the habit of</p>

               <p>meeting persons he was connected with in the guano trade at the Railway Tavern, Fenchurch-street—he said, "I know a house that is temporary difficulties, and can you dispose of some rope; I know that you are a com<lb></lb>mission agent for the sale of rope"—I said, "If you can bring me the samples and the price, I will endeavour to sell it"—he afterwards brought me the samples, and a list of the number of coils, and their sizes—that must have been the early part of the year; February, I think—I told him the market price was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt., cash; and, according to the samples, I thought I could get near that price for staple cordage made from clean hemp, such as the samples were; that I could not attend to it myself exactly, but I would place the samples and the list in a general shipbroker's office named Turner, in Tower-street, to sell, which he agreed to, and I made an arrange<lb></lb>ment with Mr. Turner, who said that he knew a young man from the country who was a good judge of rope; that was Mr. Gilchrist—I told the prisoner if he would meet me at Mr. Turner's office there would be a com<lb></lb>petent judge to look at the rope, and report to Turner if he could sell the rope at the price—I met Gilchrist on Monday morning, by appointment, at Turner's office—the prisoner was downstairs—I do not think he came into the office—the prisoner took us to Kempster's, at Dockhead, where the property was lying—I had not seen or known Kempster before—I saw a quantity of rope there—it lay dormant several days, and, when I saw Evans, he told me that the party belonging to the rope, the ropemaker, had an order come in, and had taken the rope back again to execute the order, and therefore Turner could not sell it, which I communicated to Turner—he brought me some samples again, and said that the house was still in difficulties, and could I dispose of a lot, and he brought a list of the number of coils—I said, "Yes, I would try and do so"—I had got a buyer who would take three or four, or half a dozen coils, but he would not divide the bulk, and the buyer would not take the whole—I said that it was a party he knew very well, named Bigford, a large ship-chandler—he said, "If you can get it sold by a ship-chandler, you shall have all above 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for your profit"—Bigford and I then agreed to see some ship-chandlers—Bigford supplies ship-chandlers with naptha; he introduced it to the ship-chandlers with the understanding that he should have half the commission that I received—Bigford knew the prisoner, and knew the party he was in connexion with in the guano way—Bigford effected a sale with Willis, a ship-chandler, who agreed to take a ton at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt,—I told the prisoner, if he would bring the rope the following morning, according to sample, it could be sold to Willis, and he could take the money—he did so—I first saw the rope at Willis's door in the van—Willis's foreman would only take a portion—he bought about eleven cwt., and this receipt was given, signed by me—the prisoner filled up the body of it while I was calculating what it would come to—I knew no other principal in the transaction—I had never seen the prisoners I was tried with, only this prisoner—excepting the commission, which I shared with Bigford, the prisoner received every farthing of the money—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was left, after having some refreshment—I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I received the other 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

               <p>transported a gang of swindlers, which has caused my misfortune in trade—the payment of Vare was by cheque, and Willis's by notes, and the difference in gold, both of which the prisoner had—I received a subpoena on Saturday to attend this trial, without any previous application being made to me since my trial—I never heard anything against the prisoner's character.</p>

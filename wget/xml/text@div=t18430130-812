                  </hi>. I keep the Duke's Head. On the 23rd of Jan., about half-past six o'clock, I was in the bar—Kelly brought me a keg—I said, "Who took it?"—he said, "Taylor"—I took it from him, and put it behind the bar—there was about a pint of peppermint in it—it was mine—I saw it that evening on a corner of a shelf inside the bar—it could be reached from outside the bar, from the staircase—it had a brass tap to it—I went for a policeman, but could not find one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What did Kelly say to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He at first told me he picked it up off the floor—he then said he took it from underneath your arm—I never saw you till afterwards—I did not go into the tap-room—the other robbery was committed about ten minutes after, and then I hardly knew what I was about—I was busy at the time—there were other people outside the bar, but not inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I was waiting at the bar for a pot of beer, which Mr. Penn was going to draw for a customer—I saw Taylor going in the direction of the door with the keg under his arm—I immediately took it from him, and gave it to Mr. Penn, telling him who I took it from—he was not drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he make any resistance when you attempted to take the keg from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he went away from the bar as soon as I took the keg from him—he might have gone into the tap-room—I saw him again that evening frequently in and out of the tap-room till he was taken—I did not say any more about the keg—I did not molest him—I had nothing to do with it—he did not have any thing to drink that I know of—I cannot say how long he stopped in the tap-room—I received nothing for my services that night, I merely did it out of kindness, Mr. Penn requesting me previous to the robbery being committed—he had a previous knowledge of me—when I took the keg from the prisoner he was in the house going towards the street-door—it was about a quarter of an hoar before the other robbery took place.</p>

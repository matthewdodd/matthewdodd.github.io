               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she ever come to your shop? - Yes, on the 16th of March, between four and five, she came in alone, she asked to look at some neck handkerchiefs, accordingly I shewed her several different pieces, and she objected to the price of them, presently came in some more ladies, and asked to look at some British muslins, and while I turned round to get the muslin, the woman went out of the shop, and said she would call again; when I brought the papers of muslins, I missed a piece of handkerchiefs, I said she had got them, and I run after her immediately, and brought her back, she was, I suppose, about fifty yards on the other side of the way, I took her into the parlour, and sent for a constable, I sent to the Poultry Compter; she laid one piece of handkerchiefs upon the counter, and one she dropped on the floor, I only missed one piece, but she had two, I am sure she had it, I did not see her drop a piece, but I saw her lay this one on the counter.</p>
               <p>Did not you observe where she took that piece from that she put on the counter? - I do not know, she took it from underneath her cloak.</p>
               <p>When you stopped her, did you tell her what you wanted? - No, I told her to come back.</p>
               <p>Had you seen this piece before? - I cannot say with certainty.</p>
               <p>When did you see this piece on the ground, after she was brought into the parlour, or before? - Before she went into the parlour, she went into the parlour directly, I was not there half a minute, I found this piece on the ground just after she came in, and she was then in the shop close by the piece, I believe she went in first, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether the piece was on the ground before she came into the shop, when you went out after her? - No, I am sure it was not, because she was so high up.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of seeing whether it was on the ground when she entered into the shop? - I concluded she dropped it, but I did not see her drop it.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to her about the other piece that she put on the counter? - No, I did not, I sent for a constable directly, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the piece to the parlour? - It was about five yards, our shop is about ten yards long, the pieces I shewed her were close to to the door.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the piece she dropped on the ground? - Three, and there were ten in the other piece.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts on the counter was it that she put the other piece? - Near the other piece.</p>
               <p>Describe to me how she did it? - She took it out from under her cloak, and chucked it down.</p>
               <p>She did it in an open manner, and not slid it down to prevent you from seeing her? - No.</p>
               <p>These pieces, one of which was on the ground, and the other you saw her put on the ground? - I shewed her one, but how she came at the other I do not know; one piece that she stole I shewed her; the first piece, they were my master's property, I have private marks on them.</p>

               <p>Did you see her do that? - I think I saw her take them from between her cloak and the child, but whether she gave them to the boy, or laid them down I cannot tell, the boy took but one piece at first, but when he had her in the parlour he said there was two pieces, I did not observe the piece drop from her, I heard the boy say he had picked up a piece, I do not know what she did with the piece when she took it from between the cloak and the child, she was in the shop when we first went in, she was looking at some handkerchiefs near the door, she went out as soon as we went in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Gray's Inn-lane. I bought this knife of the prisoner some time in Aug.—he after that came to my shop, and just as he was going he turned round, and said, "What have you done with that knife?"—I said, "It is somewhere lying about, I thought of taking it for my own use"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "There has been a bother about it"—he said something else, but I did not hear what—he came twice</p>

               <p>after that when I was not at home—the third time he came I was at home—he brought some wire, and I gave him into custody—he said, "There is no harm in the knife"—I said, "I think there is, by what you said before; you will get me into trouble if this knife should happen to be wrong"—he said, "It is not wrong."</p>

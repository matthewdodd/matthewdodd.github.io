                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Shoreditch—the prisoner was my journeyman for three weeks or a month—I missed a gun which stood behind my shop door—the prisoner brought it into the bakehouse to me, and said it wanted cleaning—he took it away, but I did not tell him to do so—this was about Christmas. On the 9th or 10th of March I wanted it, and missed it—he was at work at another baker's opposite—I went over and asked what he did with it when he had it—he said he laid it on the top of the oven—I asked him to shew me where it was—he went over with me and said, "I laid it here"—it was not there—I said, "You must have taken it away"—he said, "If you think so, call in a policeman"—I afterwards called in a policeman, and went over to his master, who promised to speak to him about it—he said he would produce the gun in four days, but the policeman said he must take him—we found it at his father's—he seemed very partial to a gun—his father lives at Barkingside.</p>

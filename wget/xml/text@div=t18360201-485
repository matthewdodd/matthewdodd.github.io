                  </hi>. I am a seaman. The prisoner was a shipmate of mine on board <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> coming from New York—I joined the ship at New York—the carpenter's name was Shipley—I don't know his Christian names—he shipped as carpenter at New York—the prisoner was a seaman on board—they agreed very well on the voyage—there was no quarrelling or wrangling between them—nor did he quarrell with anybody—we arrived in the docks on Saturday, the 2nd of January—I don't know whether the prisoner or Shipley were on shore that day near dark—we went to supper about six o'clock, after clearing the deck up—we supped in the forecastle—most of the crew were there—there was no quarrell before supper—they appeared to agree very well—the carpenter and the prisoner appeared to me to be sober—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of wearing a belt—he had it on at supper—he kept a sheath-knife in the belt—he was in the habit of wearing it there at all times—he used to eat his supper with it—Antonio said he had spent 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day—Shipley said, "No, you have not spent so much money"—the prisoner called him a liar—the carpenter then put his hand into his pocket, pulled out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said he would bet him that that he had not spent the money—not so much as he said he had—Antonio called him a son of a b—of a liar—the carpenter them struck Antonio with his fist on his breast—Antonio returned the blow—they had two or three blows, fair boxing, and then they clenched—the carpenter, as far as I could see, got the better of Antonio—I did not observe much blood on Antonio at that time—there was a little—they were both bloody, either with the blows or scratches—Antonio</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it considered fair fighting among Americans, to get a man's hand in your mouth, and bite it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If a man stuck his finger into another</p>

               <p>man's mouth, he would give him a <hi rend="italic">nip</hi>—it is not fair to keep a man down after he says he has had enough—after he said he had had enough, the carpenter let him go—he asked him twice if he had had enough, and then let him go—Antonio <hi rend="italic">Sang</hi> out twice, "Let me up" I was examined before the Coroner, and what I said was read over—I put my mark to it—I told the Coroner that the crew said there should be no more fighting that night—it was read over to me—he was cooler after the last blow was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your soleman oath, did not you swear before the Coroner these words, "He never appeared to cool at all, from the time the first blow was struck, but kept cursing and swearing all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I said it was like a flash of lightning—he had nothing in his hand when he was cursing and swearing—he was not severely bitten—he had sore fingers, but no bones hurt—he was knocking his hand against the bulk-head, and the wood, and saying his hand was bit all to pieces—that was after he went to the chest—he was wringing his hand as if in pain, and heaving it about—he did not draw his knife till after the cursing and swearing—he was wringing his hands just before he drew the knife, and said it was bit all to pieces—it was after the carpenter fell that he said, "Take my knife, I will not kill him?"—he said, "Kill or stab," I cannot say which.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were they down, you say they fought at first fairly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The whole of it was between a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, from the begining to the last of it—they had two or three fair blows, and then clenched—they were down on a chest—the carpenter was uppermost—it was not long before the prisoner <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "You have bit my fingers carpenter"—I cannot be certain, whether he said he had bit him, or bit his finger—they had not been down long then—they were holding one another, and scuffing a little—we did not take much notice—they were not fighting, but trying to keep one another down—squeezing and cramming one another—the prisoner's hand was bleeding—it was all bloody—the hand he was wringing about—I could see it when he was flourshing it—the greater part of the crew were Americans—there were a great number of foreigners—I believe in some parts of America, it is considered fair when a man is down, to bite him, or put his eye out—it is so at Kentucky.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Welchman. I was on board <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> from New York to England—I knew the prisoner, and the carpenter—I was present on the Saturday evening in question—about supper time—the first I ob<lb></lb>served was the carpenter asked the prisoner, how much money he had spent that day—he said 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the carpenter held 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his hand, and was going to bet him he did not spend it, for he had not 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to spend—Antonio said he had, and called the carpenter something out of his name—I forget what it was—the carpenter then got up and struck him—that was the first blow between them—they fought for a little white—it was a fair fight—the carpenter had the best of it. he asked Antonio if he had had enough, and he said, "Yes"—I heard Antonio <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "You villain, you are biting my finger"—the fight was over then, and the carpenter had gone aside—Antonio was just by the scuttle—he then said, "You have bit my finger," Or some thing, which I did not exactly notice—the carpenter asked him two or three times whether he had had enough, and he said, "Yes"—they were both on their feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said when he said he had had enough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The carpenter dropped him and went to his supper—they left off—the carpenter went</p>

               <p>and sat on his chest, getting his supper—Antonio was standing between the bits on the scuttle—they were about five feet from one another—An<lb></lb>tonio was cursing and swearing by the scuttle—he was in a great passion at that time, and said he would fight him next morning, or else kill him that night—I cannot say who began the second fight, for I did not notice—I saw them giving blows to one another—I was standing on the chest to get out of the way—they both appeared to be in a passion when the second fight began—Antonio was lying on his back on the chest, and the carpenter had his hand on him, but did not strike him—the carpenter got up and left Antonio, and went and leaned his head on his bed-place, on his arm—Antonio got up and sat a little while on the chest, just the same as if he was considering, and then he got up and stabbed the carpenter—he was considering a very little while, no time I might say—it might be a minute, but I cannot say—the light was very dull, but I saw the knife shining in his hand, and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "The vil<lb></lb>lain has got a knife in his hand"—and before I spoke the word the car<lb></lb>penter was down—I said, "You have stabbed the man"—he said, "No, I have not stabbed him"—I and another man lifted the carpenter up, and overhauled his right breast—the prisoner delivered his knife to Taylor, who put it in his breast, and ran for assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During all this time did the prisoner become cool and calm, or continue in a passion all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He must be cool, when he could sit upon the chest, I consider—he appeared cool enough when he went with the knife—I cannot tell any thing about his passion—he had been in a great passion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not swear before the Coroner that Antonio was in a h—l of a range all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said that he appeared so at the time they were fighting—I dare say I said the whole of the scene did not altogether take eight minutes, but I cannot say exactly—I also said I thought Antonio had not time to cool from the scuffle, that he was in a violent passion all the time, but I cannot speak property—I do not think I told the captain that the carpenter got Antonio down, and laid on him a considerable time, but I cannot say—I do not recollect any thing about it—I do not remember saying, that on the carpenter throwing himself off him, Antonio immediately got up and stabbed him—I will not swear I did not say so—I know Taylor—I do not think I said say thing of the sort to him, or in his hearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a surgeon. I was called in to examine the deceased—I saw him between six or seven o'clock, on Saturday evening, and found him dead—I inserted my finger in the wound, on the left side of the chest, between the fifth and sixth rib; and, on inspecting the body, that wound was found to enter the heart—immediate death would follow on that—a knife was shown to me at the police-office—it had penetrated the right ventricle of the heart—it appeared a wound likely to be occasioned by such an instrument, as the knife pro<lb></lb>duced.</p>

Q.</hi> How was the carpenter dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a seaman's dress—a woollen shirt—I did not observe whether he had a waistcoat—the wound as two or three inches deep—I do not know what clothing the man had on—his breast was bare, when I saw him—I</p>

               <p>examined the prisoner's fingers—there was an injury on two of them, as if they had been bit, or scratched—I should think it would produce very great pain, both at the time and afterwards—there would be a sort of re<lb></lb>action, to cause very great pain—I did not observe that the fingers were swollen—it would cause numbness, and afterwards, by reaction, the pain would increase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) In defending myself from this serious charge, I have no contend against overwhelming diffculties. But, before adverting to those difficulties, I would earnestly implore you to banish from your minds all prejudice arising from the character too generally en<lb></lb>tertained of the dispositions of my countrymen, and not allow that feeling at all to bias your decision. An Englishman can produce his kindred and friends to prove that his actions have ever been controlled by a kind and humane heart; but I stand before you a friendless outcast, far from all friends and kindred, a stranger in a foreign land, and one who, but for the humanity of the most worthy Sheriffs, would have been here without the means of defence. But I feel confident that, after hearing the few remarks which I have to offer, on the cruel treatment I have received from the de<lb></lb>ceased, you my Lords and Gentlemen, will award me justice. I com<lb></lb>menced my career in the Portugese navy; and having faithfully served my country, obtained my discharge. I then entered the merchant ser<lb></lb>vice; and having sailed since then, on board the shipping of almost every country, I about two years since engaged myself in an American ship, called the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi>. of the line of packets, sailing between Liverpool and New York. I remained in this ship for two voyages; and having conducted myself to the satisfaction of my officers, I sailed in another American packet, called the <hi rend="italic">St. Andrew</hi>, on the same station. With her I remained also for two voyages, and then unhappily engaged myself to the packet-shop, <hi rend="italic">The president</hi>. Thus you will see that I have conducted myself to the satisfaction of my superiors. On Saturday, the 16th, we knocked off work about six o'clock, and went into the forcastle to get our supper. In about half an hour, the deceased and I began to joke as to which had spent the money. We continued our joking some time, until the deceased became angry, and some hard words passed between us. He told me that I was a liar; and on my answering him, that I was no liar, he struck me. I returned the blow, and he fell on his chest. I then said I had fought enough, and I did not wish to fight again; but, on ris<lb></lb>ing, he turned his sleeves up, and began to strike me. I returned the blow; he caught my hand, forced my fingers into his mouth, and bit them violently, whilst he heat me with the other hand. I called to him to let go of my fingers, but he still held them fast for some time. I called to him again, and he then released them; but, at the same instant, suddenly seized me by the throat, and <hi rend="italic">pinned</hi> me against the side of the forecastle. He grasped me with such force, that I was almost strangled, and called to him several times, but in vain, to release his hold. I urged him again and again to loose his hold, but he still held fast; and having my ship-knife by my side, (a knife worn by all seamen on board of American ships.) I drew it from the sheath, and was so overcome with rage and pain, that I cannot remember what followed. Gentlemen of the Jury, since then I have never ceased deeply to lament my conduct, and have not had one moment's comfort; for I was on friendly terms with the deceased, and entertained towards him no feelings of malice or revenge. Indeed, we had always been the best of friends; and none of the crew can regret his death so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010103"></xptr>
               <p>deeply as I do. But, Gentlemen, do not, I beseech you, forget, that at this time I was suffering the most brutal treatment from him. I was pinned against the wall, and throttled almost to suffocation; my fingers were nearly bitten off; my check was dragged till the flesh almost gave way; blows were inflicted when I could not defend myself; and yet seven or eight of this American crew, (four of whom are witnesses against me,) calmly witnessed the scene, and refused me their assistance. And here I may be allowed to remark, that, in addition to my other misfortunes, I am unable to express myself intelligibly in the English language, and there<lb></lb>fore liable to be misconstrued or misunderstood. Gentleman, let each of you imagine himself in the midst of foreigners, treated thus brutally, and no one offering the least assistance—aching with pain—sinking almost with suffocation—and yet deserted in this dastardly manner by all his ship<lb></lb>mates; and would there be no palliation, if, in this moment of passion and suffering, you inflicted a fatal wound? I solemnly assure you, that the witnesses against me have misrepresented the facts, and that my statement is true; and yet I can produce before you no evidence to support it; for though there were other persons present, besides those examined, they have all left England, and returned to America.</p>

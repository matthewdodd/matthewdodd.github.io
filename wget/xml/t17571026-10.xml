            . I am servant to Mr. Crofton, a pawnbroker, in the Broad-Way, Black-Friars; the prisoner has used our shop very frequently for these ten years. She brought and pawn'd these books (producing seven books) for a shilling each.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Brooks. They are Common-Prayer-Books.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known her ten years?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No, I have not; but the persons that belong to the shop have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they new or old books?</p>
               <p>Brooks. They are new ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you think they were her own?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I thought she might deal in them very largely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring them all at one time?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; she brought them at several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a bookseller?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she bring them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I can't answer that, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them in?</p>
               <p>Brooks. The person that took them in is gone to sea.</p>

I ask'd him how he came by it, and he told me; but he is here and will give the court an account.</p>

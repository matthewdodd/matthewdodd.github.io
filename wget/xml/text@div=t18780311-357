                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 247). On Sunday, 27th February, I was on duty in the Glenthorn Road—I had gone on duty at 10 o'clock and the prisoner also—my beat was No. 12 and part of 9—while on duty I saw the prisoner at 10.40—I told him that I had seen Langston, Police<lb></lb>constable 161, and he had told me to tell him (the prisoner) that he was to confine himself to 11 beat alone—he said "All right, can you give me a light to my lamp?"—I said "Yes, but I have not any paper"—he said "Have you any matches?"—I said no—he said "Never mind, I have got a piece of paper"—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a pocket book and tore a piece of paper, and I opened my lamp and he lighted his—he then said "I shall take a turn down this turning (meaning Banim Street), as there are several new unfinished houses there, and I have often found men and women asleep in them, and as there are lots of shavings lying about I expect a fire might happen there"—he then left me and went down Banim Street and I went on my beat—about 11.20 I heard there was a fire in Bradmore Street—I saw a fire escape and followed it to 33, Banim Street; I got there about 11.40—I found there had been a fire in that house under the staircase; it was out then—it was an unfinished house—I saw Langston and other constables there, and I saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side—about 4 o'clock in the morning I was in the Glenthorn Road—I saw the prisoner near the Godolphin schools—he told me that he had had another in the Southerton Road, and he said "I am afraid I shall have another in the schools"—I said "Have you seen any one?"—he said "No, I was in the next turning and heard the smash of glass, and running round the place there was a fire"—that referred to Southerton Road—I said "It must be some one invisible"—I left him between the schools and the church—he went in at the small gate leading from Glen<lb></lb>thorn Road to the church grounds—I went once round my beat and about 4.15 or 4.20 I saw him again at the corner of Oxford Road and Glenthorn Road springing his rattle and whistling—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Run for the fire engine, there is a fire in the schools"—I asked him what schools—he said "The Godolphin schools"—I said "It must be a small one, I can neither see fire or smoke"—he said "It is small, but I am afraid it may get larger; run for the fire engine; it is inside the school"—I went to the fire station in Brook Green Road and gave the alarm, and I assisted with the escape, it did not go as far as the schools—I went to the schools by myself—I did not go in—I saw Inspector Skeats there, and he posted me in a field at the back to watch—that was about 4.60—I saw nothing to attract my attention—I went off duty at 6 a.m.—I saw the prisoner about 6.5 in the Grove—he said "Here, I want to speak to you; have you got the money?"—I said "What money?"—he said "The money for calling the fire engine, the turncock, and the fire escape"—I said "No"—he said "There is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. allowed for that, did you spring the rattle at the fire station?"—I said "I did"—he said "There is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. allowed for that"—I said "I am certain we are not allowed to receive it"—he said "Why?"—I said "How about signing your name for it?"—he said "Have it, and sign a wrong name for it; did you go back with the fire escape?"—I said "I did not"—he said "If you had you would have received the money; do as I have done when in the</p>

I believe the number of my lantern was No. 12—I have been in the police over three years—I made a statement about this matter on Tuesday, the 29th—the prisoner assumed that I should get the reward for springing the rattle and calling the engine—I did not see any people about that night—there are many rough people in that neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—men and women do sometimes get into the unfinished houses—the prisoner would have no business whatever in Banim Street, unless there was anything unusual, or he was called there—our lamps often go out and require lighting afresh—I have often given a light to other con<lb></lb>stables and have taken lights from them—it would be the prisoner's duty if he saw a fire on any other beat to give notice of it—there had been a fire the night before at the pavilion in the school-grounds—that is some distance from the brickfields, near the cricketfield—there is a wall between that and the brickfields—I can't say the height of it—the pri<lb></lb>soner said "I suppose <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can get the money when we call for it"—I had done the work and was entitled to the money, if any one was, not the prisoner—he has only been a short time in the force.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 161). On Sunday night, 27th January, I left the police-station with the prisoner—my beat was No. 10 and part of No. 9—about seven minutes to 11 I saw the prisoner in the Church Road, leading out of Banim Street—I said to him "By the acting<lb></lb>sergeant's orders you are to confine yourself to 11 beat, as I have taken the whole of 10"—he said "All right, give me a light for my lamp and I will go back"—I gave him a light with a piece of paper from my own pocket and we parted—he returned the same way as he came, towards Banim Street—I went round my beat—I saw him again about 4.15 a.m., in the Glenthorn Road, springing his rattle, with his light turned on (I had previously heard of the fire at 33, Banim Street)—he said "Make haste down, the schools are on fire"—I went down to the schools, through the wicket gate, and saw the fire blazing in the middle of the new class-rooms—the prisoner joined me near the door and went in with me from the yard—there was no one in the room when we got there, not until the school<lb></lb>master came—with his assistance we extinguished it with water—after it was out the prisoner said a few words to me which I did not understand, and he left the class-room the same way we went in—about three minutes after he had left one of the boys said "Oh, master, the shed is on fire"—we all went out together and found a quantity of shavings on fire in the shed just outside the class-room—a wheelbarrow was turned over on the shavings—I helped to trample out the fire—it was put out—I should judge from the appearance of it that it had only been alight about two minutes, or a minute—it was a regular flare—it is an open shed used by the boys when it is wet—I had not seen any appearance of fire as I entered the class-room with the prisoner—the shed was scorched by the flare—there is a small wall between the yard and the shed, about four or five feet high—there is a gateway in it leading to the class-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in orders, and am head master of the Godolphin Schools, Hammersmith—Lord Ebury is one of the trustees—on 28th January we were building new class-rooms—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct plan of the place—the class-rooms are connected with the dwelling-house by four doors, and there are people living therein—it was proposed to divide the class-rooms by folding doors—there is a com<lb></lb>munication from the class-room into the yard and from the yard into the covered playground—on 28th January, about 4 a.m., I was aroused by a knock at the side door—a communication was made to me and I roused the house—I went into the new wing and there found the prisoner in his uniform at the door opening between the lavatory and the new class<lb></lb>rooms—I only saw one fire, that was in the centre of the nearer class<lb></lb>room to the door through which I entered—there was some match board<lb></lb>ing put together in a sloping direction and that was all on fire—there had been a pile of it against the wall for several days before—the flooring was not fixed, only put down—it appeared that the match boards had been placed there and something set fire to underneath them which was blazing—I said to the prisoner "We had better separate these boards to get at the fire"—he said "No, you had better not, you will cause it to spread"—I at once obeyed him and went and got water from the lavatory and poured it on the fire with the assistance of the boys, and put it out—the joists were burnt—I then noticed a fire in the other class-room, or rather some of the boys were busy about it pouring water over it, and while busy over that one of the boys called out "There is a fire in the shed"—we rushed off to the shed at once—the prisoner was not in the room then, he had gone—I had collected some shavings together in the shed the previous night and put a wheelbarrow over them to prevent their catching fire during the fire in the pavilion—those were on fire, they had not been displaced—they had not been long alight—they were under the barrow where I had placed them—the barrow itself was partly burnt—that fire appeared to have been quite recently lighted—we scattered the shavings, poured water on them, and put the fire out before the firemen came—shortly after the firemen came the prisoner returned; he had been in the class-room while both fires were being put out—I did not notice him go away—he was not in the shed when we were putting that fire out—after that was out I heard of a fire again in Southerton Road—I don't know who said that—I afterwards more closely examined the two class<lb></lb>rooms and found that the joists were burnt in both—the boys are locked in at night—there were no shavings in either of the class-rooms, the floor was quite clear the night before—after the fire I noticed some charred shavings underneath the flooring in both places, under the joists—I had been alarmed about 10 minutes past 11 the night before by a report that the pavilion had been broken into, and about a quarter past 12 I found it was on fire, it was completely destroyed—that was in the cricket<lb></lb>ground on the further side of the playground.</p>

               <p>gave me this written report, it is his writing, signed by him—I saw him on the Tuesday morning, the 29th, about 9.30, at the superintendent's office, Hammersmith—the superintendent said to him "Did you carry lamp 23 on Sunday night?"—he said "Yes"—I took him into custody about 7.45 that evening—I told him he would be charged by order of the Commissioner with feloniously setting fire to the buildings at the Godolphin Schools, &amp;c.—after the charge was taken he said "How are you going to prove these fires to me; I am innocent; I should not care if it was anything I was guilty of."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The report made by the prisoner was put in and real, giving the parti<lb></lb>culars of the fires as described in the evidence</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The lamp was found in an open place where they are put by the men, but there was only this one there—I am positive that I found the saw dust there that morning—I did not give evidence before the Magistrate till the fourth remand—lighting the lamp once would not cause all this litter, lighting it two or three times would—no doubt the men often light their pipes by the lamps—it is contrary to orders, but they do it—I gave no report of my conversation with the prisoner—I made no note of it, I trust to my memory—I gave my evidence nearly a month afterwards—when he spoke of the fire in the shed he said "We put it out"—it is usual for policemen to fix cotton across the windows to see if any one has got in during his absence round his beat—I found some cotton on the window in Southerton Road—the prisoner told me he had done that—I made no report of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Fire Brigade, at Brook Green, Hammersmith—on Saturday, 26th January, about 11.45 p.m., I was called by the prisoner—he was in uniform, with his armlet on—he told me I was to go to a carpenter's workshop alight, near the Godolphin Schools—I questioned him as to what he had seen of it—he said it was well alight—I went and found the shed alight—it was burnt out and had fallen down—on Sunday, 27th January, about 11.51 p.m., I was called by a man named Spring—in consequence of what he said I went to 33, Banim Street, a small private house—I there found a cupboard under the staircase well alight and strangers applying water to it—my impres<lb></lb>sion was that that fire was caused by shavings—I found a quantity partly consumed, and a great quantity had been totally consumed by the appearance of the ashes—I should think that fire had been burning quite 15 minutes—I saw no policeman there when I arrived—the fire was partly put out on my arrival by strangers, but I extinguished it with my hand-pump, and went back to the station—about two o'clock on Monday morning, the 28th, I was called to a fire at 76, Southerton Road, by a stranger—I found that a quantity of shavings and sawdust had been alight all over the flooring in the front room ground floor, and some loose timber was burnt that was standing there—no part of the structure was burnt—the flooring was slightly charred—my opinion was that the fire originated under the window, as the greater quantity of shavings and sawdust appeared to be accumulated there—I arrived there about 2.13—the lower sash glass of the window was completely smashed away—I extinguished the fire by means of buckets—I left there about 2.50—I sa the prisoner there while I was putting the fire out—he did not do anything in putting out the fire in my presence, on my arrival he showed me a light to pull up by—at 4.35 a.m I was called</p>

               <p>to the Godolphin Schools alight by Police-constable Bruce—my opinion was that those two fires had been set on fire—there were two distinct fires, some distance apart—I give the same opinion as to the fire in the shed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner called me to the fire on the 26th—I recevied information from other persons as to the subsequent fires—the prisoner has not been to my station to receive any reward—ours is the station where such an application would be made—the person who gives the alarm of a fire would receive a shilling for it—the prisoner would be the person to receive it for the first fire, but not for the others—I have paid all the other cases except the call to the Godolphin Schools and the Oxford Road—they were calls by police-constables, and they have never been paid—in the other cases they have been paid and I have the receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The practice is to give a shilling for the call, eighteen<lb></lb>pence for assistance with the fire escape, and if life is saved another half crown, which would make five shillings.</p>

The Metropolitan Fire Brigade pays that—the Water Company pays for the call to the turncock—the fee for that is half-a-crown—I pay the rewards myself—if the prisoner had called for the reward to which he was entitled I should have paid him—I have no orders not to pay the police—I pay them as well as others, as long as I get the receipt—there is no reward for springing a rattle; that would be done to assist the man in getting away quickly.</p>

I Live at 59, Hyde Road, and am a lamp<lb></lb>cleaner in the employ of the Metropolitan Police at Hammersmith police-station, to which the prisoner is attached—I cleaned the lamps on the 27th January for the men going on night duty—I cannot say whether lamp No. 23 was amongst them—I placed them in a cupboard which I locked—they were all in proper order—I was afterwards shown lamp No. 23 at the police-court—I did not, to my recollection, on the 27th, leave any lamp in such a condition as I then saw it—I saw some shavings in the lamp—I took the key of the cupboard to the office and left it there.</p>

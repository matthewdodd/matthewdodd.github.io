On 27th January, about 2.30, I was on duty in Cheapside, with Halse and saw the three prisoners go down Friday Street—they went in and out of various warehouses for about an hour—it was Brown who principally went in—they then went to Watling Street—a cart was standing outside No. 48, they all three walked round it, and a boy then came down stairs from a warehouse, and went to the side of the cart—Brown spoke to him, but I do not know what he said—the boy then went up stairs, and Brown immediately went to the side of the cart, took out this bundle of brushes, and threw them into the passage of the warehouse, as though he was delivering them—Wiltshire took them from the passage and gave them to Sullivan, and they went in different directions—I followed Brown and took him in Cheapside—I said "I want you"—he said "What for?"—I said "For stealing a parcel from a cart"—he said "I know nothing about it, you have made a mistake, and if you take me to the station you will hear further of it"—I took him there.</p>

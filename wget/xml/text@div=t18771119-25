On the morning of 17th Octo<lb></lb>ber, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Little Turner Street, where I saw the prisoner and some women standing in the street—I ordered them away—the females went away and the prisoner walked towards me—I thought he was going to speak to me, and when he came near me he struck me a blow with his fist in my chest—I endeavoured to apprehend him, but he ran away—I saw him again in 20 minutes, and I took him into custody—he struck me a blow with his fist in my eye—he was making a second blow at me when I closed with him, and he threw me down and got on the top of me—I managed to get the rattle out of my pocket and sprung it—he tried to get the rattle away from me and the handle broke off in my hand—I tried to get on my feet and he struck me twice with the rattle, inflicting a severe cut on my head—he then tried to strike me two other blows in my face, which I warded off, and he then struck me in the side—I became insensible, and when I recovered the prisoner was gone—he was afterwards apprehended and I identified him.</p>

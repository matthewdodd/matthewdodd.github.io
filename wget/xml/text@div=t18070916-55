               <p>Q. Did you shew her any print. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this gingham any time before they came in the shop. - A. Yes, it was on the counter before they came in; we served Bush with the article they wanted, and they waited for change; I went into Mr. Cook's, a linen draper in the same street for change. After I came back I detected the prisoner Bush with the gingham; after I stopped her I looked down, and the gingham had fell down close to her feet; I looked about, I saw the gingham lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know how it came on the ground. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160046"></xptr>A. No, it was close to Bush's feet; after that Bush went down upon her knees and begged pardon, requested us to let her go, and she would never do so any more. She confessed that she took it. After the constable came, I saw Mr. Cook take a remnant of printed cotton from Bush.</p>
               <p>MR. COOK. Q. You were called in. - A. Yes; I saw the gingham drop on the ground, but I did not see it drop from her; I searched Bush, she endeavoured to take some things out of her pocket; I took the remnant of printed cotton from her, as she was taking it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Bush's Defence. When I was going away the young man told me I had got something that was not my own; I opened the handkerchief and begged his pardon, I said it was a mistake, I took it up with what I had paid for, as they laid together on the counter. One of the gentlemen came and took me, he said I was going to thieve it. This woman is innocent of it.</p>

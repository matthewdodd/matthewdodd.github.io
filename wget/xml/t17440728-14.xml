Mr. Elkins the officer said we must search him, and I found my scarlet coffoy breeches upon him, and my watch was taken upon him there, the knee-buckles were found under the seat.

The tenth of May hearing this person was taken up, I went to the watch-house, when I came there they talked of searching him, the Prisoner put his hand to his fob, and offered to lay something upon the edge of the window; I caught hold of his hand as he was laying the watch down, and took the watch out of his hand: said I, Mr. Goodwin , I believe this is your watch, and Mr. Goodwin claimed it. In searching him I found this key, a pair of scarlet breeches were found upon him, this pair of silver knee-buckles I took from under the seat where he sat, and I fetched one pair of breeches from his house. He said he got in at the window, and went into the room where Mr. Goodwin lay, and took his clothes out; he was up stairs when the gentleman who owns the other watch came into the room, and he sat upon the stairs till they were in bed, and till he heard them both snore, and when he thought they were asleep: he went into the room , and took the things away; he said he tore the shalloon down off the horse in the dye-house, and that it was about one o'clock in the morning when he came out of the house. <rs id="t17440728-14-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

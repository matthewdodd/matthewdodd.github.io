            . The prisoner was in my employ in June last; he left in July, without notice - it was his duty to solicit orders and to receive money, which he was to hand over to me immediately on his return; I never received from him these three sums, from Mr. Woodward - I received this letter from him; I have seen him write, and believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOODWARD. The prisoner called on me for 2l. 3s. 6d.; on Mr. Poole's account, which I paid at the time I received the goods from him; I only recollect one date, which was June 13, when I paid him 2l. 12s. 2d. - I also paid him 1l. 13s., but I cannot tell the day; I am certain I paid them all to him</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150093"></xptr>but 26s. a week to support a wife and six children, and that having lost 10l. of the prosecutor's money, he had appropriated these sums for it, intending to make it up as early as possible.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>SIR, - In consequence of my mind being in the state it has been, by my having received the three sums of Mr. Woodward, which are, 2l. 3s. 6d., 1l. 13s., and 2l. 12s., and Mr. Bird 7s. 6d., in consequence of not being able to make Mr. Woodward's money up, has distressed my mind to the utmost, but I will pay you, if I work day and night; you will prove, on Monday, this is all I have received, when you call on the customers.</p>
               <p>August, 1828.</p>
               <p>MR. POOLE. He has always told me he had only two children, and only one of them is his own; I never heard of the loss of 16l,, till at Marlborough-street, the other day - he never told me he had had this loss; I have no recollection of his paying me 18l. the day before he left, but I will not swear he did not - he was in my service seven or eight months; I had a good character with him.</p>

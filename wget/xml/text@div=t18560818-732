                  </hi>. I live at No. 47, Basinghall-street, and am a journeyman upholsterer. I was in Newgate-street on the night of 8th July—I was spoken to by a woman—she followed me into King Edward-street, where I went down to get out of her way, it being in my way home—she came up to me under pretence of asking for something to drink, and got hold of my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket, with a silver guard chain round my neck—she got the watch out of my pocket, and wrenched it off the ring"—I instantly saw my chain hanging down, and seized the back port of her dress—she made some exclamation, and the prisoner and another man came up—I did not see her take the watch from my pocket, but it was in my pocket the moment before, and I saw the chain hanging down without the watch—I laid hold of her by the back of her dress as she was attempting to make off—she made some exclamation, and the prisoner and another man came up—it appeared to me as if she was calling their attention—it was more like "Oh!" than anything else—when they came np they wanted to know what was the matter—I kept on hallooing, and they tried to get</p>

               <p>between me and the woman—one of them made some expression about my hallooing, and one of them placed his hand round my neck, and tried to choke me—a piece of skin was torn from my neck—directly I got from the men, one of them said to the woman something like "Give it to me"—I still had hold of her dress—immediately I heard that, the prisoner ran off and the other two tried to hold me till the prisoner made his escape—I got away from them, and followed the prisoner—he was not out of my sight—I called out, "Stop thief!" and he was taken into custody just as I turned the corner—I had just turned the corner as the policeman had him—he was taken in Angel-street—I am quite positive he was one of the men—I do not know what became of the other man and woman—this is my watch.</p>

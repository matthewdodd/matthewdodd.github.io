                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Sophia-street, Poplar. On the 2nd of January the prisoner was in my service—I gave him a sove<lb></lb>reign, a half-crown, and four shillings, to go to Ratcliff Mill for half a sack of flour—I usually have my flour from there—I had sent him there once before—he did not return, but was taken into custody six months after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

I know the prisoner—I have seen him several times at Ratcliff Mill—at this distance of time I cannot charge my memory whe<lb></lb>ther he came on the 2nd of January or not—I believe he did not—I have no entry of his coming, and I enter all the goods I deliver—I delivered several parcels of flour that day on account of Mr. Beamont, but I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of August—I said, "Do you know what I want you for?"—he said, "Oh yes, I have been very uneasy in my mind for the last week; I have been expecting it"—as I brought him to the office, he said he had been sliding, and lost the money, and was afraid to go back to his master, and that he left the barrow at the mill.</p>

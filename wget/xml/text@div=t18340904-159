               <p>Q. Have you not said, on a former occasion, that Fry buttoned up his coat, and said he had no objection to fight Compton? A. Yes; he did say so - when he got forty or fifty yards, Compton continued to aggravate him, and Fry then said he would fight him for 5s., and if that would not do, he would put down 10s., he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some more silver; Ward told him to put his money in his pocket, and not think about fighting, and I told them to keep on - and as they were leaving my beat, I told them not to think any thing about fighting, but to go in peace, and the best thing they could do was to go and spend the 5s. - Compton and Davis appeared friendly, and Fry and Ward appeared friendly - they walked together two and two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON. Q. Had you been in the public-house? A. No; I did not hear Compton say he would fight Fry, or any man who took his part, for 5s. - it was not Compton who produced the 5s. - I had known Fry before - I do not know where they went to - Compton was aggravating Fry, and after they got a few yards from my beat, they began again - I called to them to go on - Davis and Ward did what they could to prevent it - Compton would not be pacified, but Fry went on very well - he and Ward kept the middle of the street - the other two were on the pavement.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BALL.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You think he was a quiet, civil man? A. Yes, he was equally the same, drunk or sober - I have never seen him in the habit of getting tipsy - he might take a little drop - I did not see Ball there - Compton did not wait to have a row with me-

             (police-constable G 36). I live in Parr's-place, Goswell-road. About three o'clock on this Sunday morning, I heard an alarm of "Police" as I was on duty in York-street - I went to the spot, and met the three prisoners and another man at the corner of Rahere-street and York-street. Fry and Davis had the deceased on their shoulder - they said, "As you are the first policeman we have met, we will give him in charge to you" - that they had found him drunk lying in the City-road - they were three or four hundred yards from the brick-field, and about a hundred yards from the City-road - I asked if they knew him - they both said they knew nothing of him further than finding him drunk - my brother officer stepped over and assisted them with the deceased off their shoulder, and I went down to the station-house for the stretcher - I came back and put him on it, and Fry and Davis volunteered to assist to carry him down to the station-house. Ward and the other man went away when we put the man on the stretcher - they were in a direction from the brick-field to where I saw them - when the man was placed on the stretcher, my brother officer said he was dead - when Fry and Davis were in the watch-house, they said we had better cut it - they left their address there.</p>

             (police-constable G 177). I was in Macclesfield-street - I heard a cry "Police," and saw several persons with the deceased on their shoulders - I said,"What have you got here?" they said, "We have found this drunken man in the road; we did not like to see him there, as we sometimes get drunk ourselves, so we took him on our backs, to carry him to the first policeman we saw" - I assisted in taking him off their shoulders, and said I thought he was dead - they said they did not know - I sent my brother officer for the stretcher - I again said, "The man is not drunk, he is dead" - Fry answered, "What do you know about it? you are no doctor; you cannot tell a dead man from a drunken one" - I said, "I have seen too many drunken men, not to know whether he is drunk or not" - another officer came up, and I sent for our surgeon - Davis expressed great anxiety to see every attention paid to him, and said, as they had found him in that state, they would not leave him till they had seen him properly attended to- Davis and Fry assisted in taking him to the station-house - the other two men were about twelve yards off, and I called to them not to go away - they followed on for a short distance, and then slipped away - I said to Davis, "Where are your friends gone?" he said, "It is all right, they are coming" - when Fry and Davis got to the station-house, they gave the same account as they had before, and expressed a desire to see him in the morning - his face was perfectly clean - I should think it had been recently washed - his coat was off, hanging by one arm, and one of them had his hat - I did not see the prisoners again till they were at Worship-street.</p>

On that Sunday morning I went to Featherstone-street station-house, about seven o'clock - I then went to Davis, at No. 2, Bath-street - I found him on the bed, and dressed, apparently a little intoxicated - I aroused him up, and asked if he could tell in what part of the City-road he found the deceased - he said he knew nothing about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040084"></xptr>road, or where he was, as he was drunk - I asked where he came from - he said, "Pentonville" - he said he knew nothing about the City-road; but he would go to his friend, Fry, who should come with him and tell - he then sent his wife for some gin, he drank part of it, and threw the rest into the child's face.</p>

Yes; the Saturday night was very wet, it had rained for several hours, and his shoes were covered with dry brick-dust - I gave information to the inspector, and went to Mr. Rhodes's brick-field - I found some foot-marks, as if there had been a great struggle - that was from four to five hundred yards from where the officer met the prisoners - a piece of paper, a pocket-piece, and a halfpenny, were found there - I afterwards went back to the field with the left shoe of the deceased, and it corresponded exactly with some marks in the field - there was a piece of iron tacked on the toe of that shoe - I fitted it in the presence of Bromley, in more than one or two places - I traced the marks from the gate to where the struggle had been, and they appeared to have dragged the body on the toes - I went to Davis's again - we waited till he came home, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When had it rained? A. From nine o'clock at night till two o'clock in the morning - the City-road was flooded - the shoes had dry brick-dust on them, but the brick-ground is naturally dry and his shoes were dry when I went in the morning - no one sent me to Davis, but I wanted to know on what part of my beat it had happened - I do not go further than the bridge, and this happened one hundred yards over the bridge - I was reported for neglect of duty, but my superiors were well satisfied with my conduct - I went before the superintendent - he told me he thought there might be some neglect on my part.</p>

             (police-constable G 145). I live in Taberacle-walk - I went to where Fry lives on the Sunday morning, about eight or nine o'clock - I waited a little while, and saw him - he had a black eye - he came with me voluntarily - I had a young man with me, and he asked particularly whether he was one of the relations of the deceased - I said,"No."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not yourself tell him, if he would tell you the whole truth, it would be of advantage to him? A. No; nothing of the kind, I swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say? A. I said, "If half a dozen people were to come up, and swear you were the man that fought with the deceased, would you call them liars?" - he said, "Mayhap, I might" - I observed to him,"You have got a black eye" - he said, "Yes; I was out taking my drops last night, and got it" - I asked him if he knew Compton - he said, they were shopmen, and he knew him from working him with him occasionally - he was speaking either of Compton or Davis - I found 11s. 6d. on him, and three Union Cards, which I gave him again - Davis asked me how it was likely he should get on - I said I did not know - he then asked for some water - I brought him some, and asked him if he knew any thing about the coins which had been found - he said they had been used in bathing the deceased's temples - he then asked who apprehended Fry - I said, I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you not forget the story you told before the coroner and the magistrate? A. I may not, perhaps, recollect the whole of it - I have stated what I said before the coroner, to the best of my recollection - one of these coins is a pocket piece - I do not know how they could assist in bathing a man's temples - nothing took place between Davis and me, after he said that - I have never detailed a conversation which took place after that - what I said was read over to me, and I signed it - I think there is no conversation stated there which took place between him and me after I spoke about the coin - I might have given him the water after that - he was sober when he talked about the coins being used in bathing the man's temples - I thought they had been used in closing his eyes - something occurred which called me, and I went away.</p>

             (police-serjeant N 9). I live in River-street, Islington. I went to the brick-field - I found a half-penny and a copper coin - I compared the deceased's shoes with the foot marks in the field - they appeared to tally as if he had been in that place - I went to John Davis, and met his wife - I asked her if Davis was come in - she said he was - I went up stairs and found him- I told him I apprehended him on a charge of murder, and cautioned him not to say any thing that would injure himself, as it would be given against him - I asked him if he knew a man named Compton - he said he had a slight knowledge of him - I asked him if he was in the brick-field with him - he said, "You know all about it" - he then said he was very sorry he had told a lie, and he would tell me all about it - he then said, he had been at the Bridcage with the other men, and when they were about to leave, Ward said he would stand a quartern of gin, but the landlord would not draw it - Compton then said, "I am going," and a little man said, "You might have gone before;" that he struck him, and Fry upbraided Davis with it - that they came out to fight, and the watchman prevented them - that Compton then came up to Fry, put himself in a daring attitude, and said, "It was not Davis, it was me," and they then agreed to fight for 5s. - that Fry put down 5s. in Davis's hand, Compton refused to cover it then, but he did in the field, and it was placed in Ward's hand - that they then set to, and in the first round, Compton had considerably the best, but, in coming up the second time, Fry gave him an up hit, and he fell - Fry said, "You don't call that half a round," but he made no answer, and Fry said,"He is done," or "dead" - that they then sat down to consider what they should do with him, and they thought it was best to take him to the public-road, which they did, and he was taken to the station - on the Monday I took Ward in Fryer-street, Vauxhall, about three o'clock in the afternoon- he was on a bed in a back room up stairs - I told him I took him on a charge of murder, and I gave him the same cautions I did to Davis - he did not appear to wish to keep any thing secret - he said he was glad I had come, and he told me nearly the same words that Davis had - he said he gave up the money to Fry, and he took the man to the pool, dipped his silk handkerchief in, and washed him, and endeavoured to restore him, but unsuccessfully.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was Davis gave you the first account? A. Yes; I do not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040085"></xptr>his saying that Fry said he would rather not fight - they both seemed very sorry.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - I examined the body at the work-house - there was an effusion of blood on the membranes of the brain, which was the cause of his death - there was a discolouration on the outside which corresponded with the rupture within - it might have been occasioned by a blow with a fist - the skin was not broken - it is my opinion it was caused by a blow at the back of the ear - any other part of the head would have been more exposed in falling - in other respects the body was healthy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose a man got a blow on the breast, and fell down on a stone? A. That might have occasioned the same appearance - he might have fallen from his own exertions, but most likely in that case the skin would have been broken - it appeared to me to have been effected by a blow under his left ear, from a man's right hand.</p>

               <p>Fry's Defence. The facts have been greatly exaggerated - I took him to the station-house, and particularly requested them to send for a surgeon if there were any thoughts of his dying; and it was not till after he had been left on the cold step of a door for twenty minutes that the stretcher arrived - I asked two policemen to tell me where the surgeon lived, and I would fetch him - they said, "No" - when I got him to the station-house, I said I was very sorry he was dead, and any information I could possibly give, I would come next morning and give - I told them to inquire if he was married - I meant to go, but I was taken - I asked for some beer at the station-house; but one of the policemen said it was too good for a murderer, and if I would confess, it would be better for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Wynne Ellis, and Co. general warehousemen, in St. Paul's Churchyard. Mr. William Abner Vaughan is a customer of theirs—on 9th Oct. the prisoner came to my employers' with a pattern of black velvet, and said he wanted four yards to match it, for Mr. Vaughan, of Aldgate—I had not known the prisoner before, but I knew perfectly who he meant by Mr. Vaughan—he mentioned the price, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I served the four yards of velvet, and gave it to a lad to take down to our entering-room, for the clerk to make the invoice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Mitchell, who are Scotch and Manchester warehousemen, in Friday-street. The prisoner came there on 9th Oct.—I had seen him once before, when he had brought back a lady's robe from Mr. Vaughan's, of Aldgate—he said he wanted a robe the same as Mr. Vaughan had had a few days before from us—I showed him two nearly alike—they were made of linen and woollen, and embroidered—he said he would take the two, as he was not certain which of them would match the one that Mr. Vaughan had at home—I allowed him to take them both—he said he would return one the next day, without Mr. Vaughan would like to keep it for stock—he said they were to be charged to Mr. Vaughan, of Ald<lb></lb>gate—he did not come back the next day—I should not have delivered them to him if he had not represented himself as coming from Mr. Vaughan's—Mr. Vaughan was a customer of our house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Rogers; they are general warehousemen, in Watling-street; Mr. Vaughan was a customer of ours. I remember the prisoner coming on 12th or 13th Oct., about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening—he said he wanted a piece of cloth similar to what he had had a week previous, and he came from Mr. Vaughan's—(I had seen him about a week previously, when he had got some cloth from us for Mr. Vaughan)—I had received information, and I declined to let him have the cloth—I raised an objection as to the light; it being late in the evening, I told him he could not see the colour—he left, and I followed him into Cheap<lb></lb>side, and gave him in charge.</p>

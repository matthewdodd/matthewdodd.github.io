             sworn. - I am a shoemaker, and observed the prisoner, Richardson, between seven and eight o'clock, as I was coming down St. Martin's-lane, as near the prosecutor's window as he could, with his left arm trying to lift up the sash, as I suppose; I went to the end of Moore's-yard, and saw them both at the window afterwards, and then I gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the alarm immediately? - A. Not immediately; I went to the top of Chandos-street, then I returned up St. Martin's-lane; I always suspected the character of Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you stand from them when you saw them trying to lift up the sash? - A. About four doors from them; they were first one and then the other endeavouring to lift up the sash; I shifted my ground, and went facing the shop, and there I saw two of them trying; I am not certain of Clements, but I am certain of Richardson; I went into Mr. Allen's, the last and patten-maker, and gave the alarm; Mr. Allen went to Mr. Wheeler's, and Mr. Wheeler's wife told him the window was broke open, and the property was gone.</p>

             sworn. - On Tuesday, the 28th of February, I was coming down St. Martin's-lane, and saw the two prisoners at the bar at Mr. Wheeler's window; they separated immediately as I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of them at the time? - A. Yes, of Richardson; Clements followed me as far as St. Martin's church; I returned back in the course of twenty minutes, and heard of the robbery; I went to the prisoners, knowing Richardson to be a suspicious character; I took both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Clements's defence. I observed I met this young man as I went into a house in Swallow-street to drink, where Mr. Armstead took me; I was not in St. Martin's-lane that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to the witness. I remained in the shop to take care that the prisoner did not go out while a policeman was sent for—I shut the shop-door—the prisoner tried very much to get out—he offered me a half-crown, told me to take that, and let him go—he said he knew where he took the other—he took hold of me, and tried to get out, and jammed my hand in the door—I bolted the door, and kept him till my brother came back with the policeman.</p>

I was called in by the brother—I saw the prisoner sitting there—I took him—I received this half-crown from Letitia Chesney—I found a good half-crown in the prisoner's right hand waistcoat pocket—he was taken before the Magistrate next morning, and entered into his own recognizance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear on the 17th—on the 17th I went to the Court, but he did not appear—he said he was a carpenter, or a labourer in the employ of Mr. Cubit, and he lived in Mann's cottages, Pimlico—I did not inquire there.</p>

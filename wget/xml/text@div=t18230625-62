On the 9th of June, about ten or half past ten o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came to my shop; he was dressed in a kind of midshipman's jacket, with yellow buttons at the sleeves, and asked if I had got a seaman's chest; I said No - he asked if I had any kind of chest - I said I had; he asked to see it. I took him in and shewed him one, which he agreed to give 12 s. for, but afterwards changed his mind, and asked if I had got a trunk; I then shewed him another trunk - he said he wanted two; the first I shewed him would not do, and the next I sold him for 30 s.; I took him into my little parlour; he said "You know my father very well". I said very probably - he said "You know Miles, my father, very well," I said "Yes; very well." - he then said he had been to the East Indies, that he had a large sum (150 l.) to receive next day, and also shewed me a letter purporting to be for 173 l., and said it was an order, he had from the ship-broker, or merchant's to receive for a brother seaman of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that distinct from the 150 l. - A. Most assuredly - he then pulled a 5 l. note out of his pocket book, and asked me to give him change. I gave him three sovereigns and ten shillings. (Looks at a note,) this is it; I saw him write upon it, "Mr. S. Miles, Clyde, East Indiaman, East India Docks." - he said he should want the trunk taken down to the docks, and could I get him a porter. I got

Stevens came to me and said he had got him. I went there, expecting to see the same man. I think I had some recollection of him before he brought the note - but I am not positive. I did not know that I had ever seen him before, till he mentioned about his father. I had but one candle in the shop, and cannot say whether he wore his hat all the time - he was with me about quarter of an hour - no person come into the shop while he was there - but he had a man with him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Kirkman's-place, Tottenham Court-road. On the 9th of June Davis sent for me to carry the trunk - the person who bought it went with me. I cannot swear that the prisoner was the young man; but believe him to be - he was in Davis's parlour. I first saw him by the door. I was to go with him, and followed him with the trunk below St. Giles's church, opposite the Waterloo public-house; as we went along, he said; I am not going far, and when he came there, he called a coach. I put the trunk in, he gave me 6 d., and said master would pay me the rest, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were only a minute in the shop - A. No; I walked behind him all the way - he said nothing else to me. I had no opportunity of seeing his face.</p>

            . My father keeps a law-stationer's shop, at No. 12, Chancery-lane. I believe the prisoner to be the man (but cannot speak positively) who came at nine o'clock in the evening, of the 31st of May, and said he wanted a warrant of attorney, to secure money - he was dressed like a sailor with naval buttons, and said he wanted to leave some money he had got in a friend's hands, who was to give him a warrant of attorney as security, as he did not wish to spend it. I said he had better go to an attorney with the warrant, he said he was going to one in Red Lion-square; that he was going to sea; he mentioned a sum, which I think was 300 l. I looked at the list and saw the stamp duty was 3 l., gave him a stamp and told him the charge was 3 l. 1 s. 6 s. - he put down a 3 d. note. I asked his address, which he wrote on it that if, (looking at a note,) this is it, here is "Captain Blaye, Clide frigate;" this was written at the time, by the person to whom I gave 1 l. 18 s. 6 d. change. I did not mark it myself till the 5th of June, when I took it to the Bank, to show my father's name upon it, "Mr. T. Steel, No. 12, Chancery-lane, 5th June, 1823," and knew it to be the note the person gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are speaking of what happened three weeks ago - A. Yes. I had no particular reason for taking notice of him - only he gave me a history of what business he wanted it for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at him, and say what you believe - A. I believe him to be the man, but cannot swear to him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Collins, law-stationer, of Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. On Wednesday, the 4th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a warrant of attorney stamp, to receive 170 l., and told me he was second lieutenant on board the Clyde frigate, a 74 - he was dressed in uniform; I took him for a midshipman. We had not got a stamp, but said I would get one for him. I took him to several shops which were shut up - I at last took him to Mr. Houghton's, Chancery-lane; Washington served him. I staid there, and introduced him as coming from the trade; he bought a stamp, which came to 2 l. 0 s. 1 d., with the trade deduction - he paid for it by a note. I accompanied him into Fleet-street, and conversed with him, and am sure he is the man. I knew him six or seven years ago when we were at school together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far does Washington live from your shop - A. About three minutes walk, He was about a quarter of an hour with me. I never had the note - he took it out of his pocket-book, and gave it to Washington. He wore a short jacket without flaps, and had his hat on all the time. I knew then that he was a school-fellow of mine. I asked how he did.</p>

               <p>"Oh, Jack, how do you do?" he said he had been to Bombay, and had just returned. I asked him about the situation he was in, but said nothing about school. I have no doubt of having been at school with him.</p>

On Wednesday, the 4th of June, I saw the prisoner at my shop, about two o'clock in the day - he was dressed in a kind of naval uniform, and said he wished to look at some of my flower baskets; I asked what kind - he ordered six small ones at 1 s., and three at 2 s. each, and then asked the price of a three branch flower-stand; I asked 23 s. for it - he took out a paper and pencil, and began to calculate, and made them 1 l. 15 s., and said it was a good deal of money, could not I take something less for the stand, as he wanted to make a present of it to a friend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250030"></xptr>filled with flowers. I took off 1 s., which he agreed to. I then told him the baskets were not complete, they wanted another coat of paint, and if he would leave his name and address they should be sent home in the evening; he asked for paper, and wrote "Mr. Knight, No. 6, Euston-place, New-road;" this is the paper (looking at it.) I said, "Why I know Mr. Knight, I have done business for him;" "Oh! have you" he said - he then said, "Shall I pay you for them now, or when they are delivered;" I said it was immaterial to me, it would be just as well when they were sent home; he paused for a moment, and at last said, "I may as well pay you now, and then it is done with;" he took out his pocket-book, and took a 5 l. note out. I had no change, and said I would go, and get it, and just as I was going out, he said, "Stop, let me write on it" - he took it, and wrote on it</p>
               <p>"Thompson, ship owner, Rotherhitbe;" this is it (looking at it) - he wrote this before I took it out, and I wrote "Knight, 6, Euston-place, "on it myself. I went to the Adam and Eve, public-house, and got change, and am sure this is the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was his own proposal to write on it - A. It was. He did not say whether it was his own name or the person he took it of. I knew Thompson to be the person he took it of, as he mentioned Knight's name.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gibson. I remember the prisoner being at my master's shop, on the 4th of June, very well. I carried the three flower-pot basket home - I followed him with it; he took me within three doors of No. 6, Euston-place, and then said he did not wish me to carry it any further, he would carry it himself - he took it from me. I left him, and cannot say what he did with it.</p>

            . I live in Euston-place, and know nothing whatever of the prisoner. I never sent him to buy a flower-stand - I understand one was brought to my door. I was not at home, but believe it was not taken in. I had given no direction about it.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live at No. 5, Charlton-place, Islington. I have known the prisoner some years; he came to my house last Friday week, which I think was the 13th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, to purchase a watch; he said he had come from India about a fortnight, in the Clyde Indiaman, and had made a very prosperous voyage; that he had made about 170 l. and was going to Brighton next morning to see his father; that he had booked his place, and wanted a watch. I had none complete; he said he wanted one that evening, and should like to have one of my make, for I had made one for his brother. I said I would endeavour to get him one from some of my friends in Clerkenwell; I went, but did not succeed; I returned, and told him I could not get him one till the morning; that did not seem to suit, and I shewed him some I had in an imperfect state, and said I could complete one in twelve days; he agreed to have it, and took out his pocket book and asked if I could change a note; I asked if it was a large one; he said 5 l.; he took one out; there was a piece torn, but it hung to the end of it; he asked for a pen and ink, and said if I would give him change he would give me 1 l. deposit; he wrote something on the note, and I wrote under it - (looks at the note) - here is my name on this, by which I know it, and I have no doubt of its being the one he gave me; there is a piece torn off the same corner where the piece hung. I do not know what he wrote on it, but he wrote very near the word Bank, and here is "Clyde ship, S. M.," written there. I think I sent my boy to the public-house; he brought me five sovereigns; I gave them to the prisoner, who gave me a sovereigns; I said, "Mr. Miles, you may as well let me have two as I am in a little way, it will be of service." He said he could spare but one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he came you did not know his name - A. Yes; he asked for a pen and ink himself - my boy is not here, he wrote on it before the boy took it, and I wrote on it at the same time, I had no other 5 l. note that day.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told he was in custody at the time you mention - A. I am sure he came on the 13th of June; but may be mistaken, in saying it was Friday week - his brother lived with me nine years ago.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 14th of June, about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner at the Yorkshire Grey, public-house, Brydges-street, Covent-garden, he had gone in there to drink with a young woman. I took him to the watch-house, and returned with the young woman to her lodging, No. 10, Phoenix-alley, Long-acre, and found a trunk, which I brought away afterwards, and shewed it to Davis, there was nothing in it. I saw a sailor's uniform in the room, and various articles of the girls.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, at the Bank, and have been so between twenty-four and twenty-five years, (looking at the note uttered to Davis;) this is forged in every respect - paper, plate, and signature - it is signed</p>
               <p>"J. Robinson;" he was a signer of small notes, but not of 5 l., (the witness examined the other four notes produced, all of which he declared to be forged in every respect. Two were signed "Robinson," and two "H. Whiting," and declared all five to be impressed from the same plate)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many forged notes of late - A. Not a great many. Those I have seen have not all been from one plate. There is a mark in these resembling a water-mark, but it is not one, it is impressed afterwards.</p>

               <p>The prisoner read a long Defence, contending that there was no convincing proof of his knowing the notes to be forged - that sailors often involve themselves in difficulties, which they could not satisfactorily explain, and protesting his innocence.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to MR. WONTNER. Q. Was the prisoner tried here - A. He was tried here once and acquitted. Mr. Recorder particularly expressed that he ought not to have been charged with the offence. He came afterwards to me stating that he had got a ship.</p>

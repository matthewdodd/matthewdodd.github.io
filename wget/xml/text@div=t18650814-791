I live at 15, Church-road, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—on 7th July I went to bed about 11.30—I slept with my wife in the first-floor front room—about half-past 2 I was disturbed by a noise—when I got up at half-past 8 in the morning, I missed several articles of wearing apparel from my bed-room; things we had taken off the previous night—the whole of the house was fastened up, with the exception of the front-bedroom window, which was left open about eighteen</p>

On Friday morning, 7th July, I was on duty in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green—I saw the prisoner and two others coming towards me—I crossed over the road to see if I knew them, and they ran away—I followed the prisoner, took him, and found on him a flannel petticoat, two pairs of drawers, a pair of stockings, and other articles—they were wrapped round his body, inside his coat—I asked him where he got them from—he said he picked them up in the street—I took him to the station—the prosecutor recognised them as his.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a box of candles. - A. Yes, on the 11th of December, in the evening. I saw the box of candles in the shop about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the two prisoners, the man or the woman, in your shop that evening. - A. Yes, the man Kimbling, between seven and eight o'clock he came for a pennyworth of pickled cucumbers. I deal in those things. I served him with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in that part of the shop where the box of candles was. - A. He was further in the shop than that: the box of candles was nearer the door than he was; he was in about the middle of the shop. When I served him he paid me and went out. I saw him go out - he had nothing with him then. I did not miss the candles till nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect seeing it after he had been gone, do you. - A. No, I was in the shop the whole of that evening, and he never came in after that. I left the shop at nine o'clock. I do not know whether the box or candles was there or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that missed the candles. - A. No, I was not; my boy Jones missed it; he is not here; it was missed when I was out. I returned at ten o'clock, and the box was gone. I saw my candles the next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. And the box. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the place where Mead lives. - A. Yes. It is a turning that goes up by the King's Head. On the 12th of December, about four in the afternoon, I went in company with the prosecutor and his man to this house. I saw the woman prisoner, Mead, sitting by the fire; her father was in the room. I asked her if she had any box or parcel left there. She said no I asked her if she had not been offering any candles for sale. She said no. I then asked her if she had no parcel of candles in the house. She said no. I searched, and on a table in the room where she was, near at the back of where she sat, were these candles in this basket, as they are now wrapped over with this blue apron. They have been in Smith's possession ever since. I then left Smith (the man that works for Mr. Pritchard) in the room - told him not to leave it, and, if any body came, not to let them go. I then went to Kimbling's mother's house with the prosecutor. I did not find him. I returned to the house where the candles was, and found Kimbling in Mead's place.</p>

            . Q. You went with the last witness to Mead's place. - A. Yes. I remember his asking Mead about the candles, and her denying it. He found the candles. After Armstrong was gone, in about twenty minutes Kimbling came to the shutters - he attempted to look in, and when I went out to look, he came in, and

             asked him if he had seen his brother Bill. She cried. Kimbling told her not to cry - he did not care any thing about it. When Armstrong came in he took hold of Kimbling, and searched him. He asked him how he came by these candles; he said he was coming home about half past nine last night - he picked them up in Red Lion Passage, and put them into his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the candles then in the room. - A. Yes, and the basket as they are now. Armstrong then took Sarah Mead and Kimbling to Worship-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Armstrong.) You told us when you returned you found Kimbling there. - A. Yes. I searched him, and found nothing but a pair of stockings, which I believe to be his own. He said he had found the candles last night in Red Lion Passage - he gave them to his sister. It is a very muddy place, but the candles were clean.</p>
               <p>- SMITH. I make candles for Mr. Pritchard. - These are the candles found at Mead's. They have been in my possession ever since. I am sure I made them for Mr. Pritchard. They are his property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and carry on business at South Mimms. On Thursday morning, the 25th of Dec, I went to my shop—I observed the door over the slaughter-house and the shop had a piece of board broken off it.</p>

               <p>and the door had been opened—I have to go under a covered way from my house to the slaughter-house—the latch of the slaughter-house had been undone inside, and the door was open—I had observed the door on the Wednesday night at seven o'clock—it was safe and locked up—the loft door was all safe—I locked the shop-door, and put the key into my pocket—the next morning the loft door and the slaughter-house door were open—I had had nothing in the slaughter-house the day before—I had beef, mutton, and pork in my shop—I missed about nine pounds of beef, eight or nine pounds of pork, and two or three pounds of mutton, about twenty pounds altogether, which was all safe at seven o'clock the night before—I went to the police-station, and sergeant Chambers went with me to the house of Mary Roberts on the Thursday morning—I knew her before, and the other two prisoners; they are her sons—we found a piece of beef in an iron pot, partly boiled, and up stairs two pieces of pork in Thomas Roberts's bed—(he lives there with his mother)—I knew the pork to be mine by my own cutting—part of the beef was gone—the officer took Thomas Roberts into custody—he said he did not know any<lb></lb>thing about it, his brother William must have brought it there—I went to the station, and gave charge—I then went to Thomas Roberta's sister's house—I saw a piece of pork there which I knew to be mine—Thomas Roberts had worked at my place—there was a ladder against my loft window, and a piece of the loft window was broken—a person could put their hand in, open the window, and get in there—the loft door was broken, and a person could get into the shop then.</p>

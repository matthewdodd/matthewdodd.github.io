                  </hi>. On 6th April, from information I received, I went with Inspector Potter and other officers to Lichfield-street, St. Martin's-lane, and placed myself in a house which commands a view of Porter-street—the prisoner passed me, and I followed him into West-street—he frequently looked round, and when I was very close to him, he stooped down and then attempted to run away—I seized him by the cuff and collar—he resisted very much, but Inspectors Brennan and Potter came to my assistance—I said to the prisoner, "You are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession, what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—Potter took from his coat this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I opened it and found four small parcels—I said in the prisoner's hearing, "This is bad," he said, "I picked it up, I was going to take it to the station"—I found thirty-four bad shillings.</p>

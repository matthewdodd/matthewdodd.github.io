                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton; the prisoner was in my employ, and lived in the house. About twelve o'clock in the day, on the 5th of August, I was in my shop—I saw the prisoner put his hand into the till, and drop some money into a paper-drawer close to the till—there was a partition in the till, one for halfpence and the other for sil<lb></lb>ver—I did not see what money it was he dropped—he then left the counter, and went to the other end of the shop, to give some instructions for some</p>

               <p>goods to be put into the tray—he turned back, and went to the same drawer where he had dropped the money—he took the money up, twisted it in a piece of paper, and went as if to go into the yard—I followed him—he was just going in at the privy door—I said, "John, you have got what don't be<lb></lb>long to you"—he made no answer—I said, "Give it to me"—I took hold of his hand—he resisted—I called for assistance—he then dropped it into my hand—I unfolded the paper, and in it was a crown-piece—he was taken into my parlour and sat down in the chair—I said, "You are a married man"—he had come to me as a single man—he said, "I am"—I said, "Then you have deceived me from the first; how could you rob me?"—he laid, "Pray forgive me on account of my wife and child."</p>

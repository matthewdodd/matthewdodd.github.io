               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had the persons that you supposed to be the prisoners been about your shop? - They had been an hour or an hour and quarter.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you spoke to them during that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You went out, perhaps, to tell them to get away? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you put out lights in expectation that a felony might be committed, and you would observe them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Pray has it ever happened to you to be in a Court of Justice on such an occasion as this? - No, I never was.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you do not know that there is a reward on the conviction of the offenders? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward on conviction of either or both of these persons? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that it has not been represented to you, that there is a reward, by the officers? - They did not; I will swear it.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that you never heard of any such thing? - I may have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you never heard that there was a reward on conviction of persons who are charged with the crime of burglary? - I never had occasion to inquire into such a thing.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the instructions for the indictment to be for a burglary? - I gave only instructions according to the truth that I know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you lived with Jacobs? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Do you live with him now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that you stood at the end of the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is the end of the counter from the window? - About a yard, or rather better.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before? - Not till they stood about the window.</p>
               <p>Your master went out? - No, not till they broke it; and then he instantly jumped over the counter, and cried out stop thief!</p>

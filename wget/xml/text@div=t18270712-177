On the 4th of June these articles were in the first floor front room, where I lodge - I caught the prisoner in the room at four o'clock in the morning. I do not know how he got in, but I was awoke; and a man who slept with me, was jostling with him - he was at the side of my box, my things were all turned upside down; he said if I would let him go he would make the things all right, which he had taken before. He had got into the house somehow, and broken a hole through the lath and plaster, and unbolted the door; he said he had taken two parcels before, and the watchman had taken one parcel from him. I went and found the watchman had got part of my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you where the watchman was? A. Yes; I believe he bears a good character. I have found all but some glasses.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Messrs. Esdaile's &amp; Co., bankers, in the City - On Saturday, the 7th of December, a person called at the house and presented this draft to me, which I paid - I have no recollection of the prisoner's person - he must have produced a letter - he did not produce it to me - I paid the draft - I never saw the letter - the draft was signed when presented to me - I asked no questions - it was marked with an order to pay it, and I paid it - I did not ask him any questions, but gave him £1.</p>
               <p>JAMES DIGNAM. I am an attorney - the prisoner was in my employ - I remember expecting a letter from Bridport - I did not say anything to the prisoner about it - a person named Hopkins there remitted me £1 a month, in discharge of a debt and costs - I expected it about the 7th of December - I asked the prisoner on the 8th of December if he had received a letter from Bridport - he said he had - I asked where it was - he said he had left it at home; he had forgotten it - I said, "How came you not to leave it with the papers you left at my house last night?" - he said he did not consider it of any consequence - I asked what the letter was about - he said it was from Hopkins about the instalment referring to Messrs. Esdaile - he said he had been to Esdaile's on the 7th, the day the letter was received, and they knew nothing about the subject of the letter - I told him, when he came to the office next day, to bring the letter with him - I did not see him on the following day till about one o'clock; that was the 9th - in the meantime I had made inquiry; and I asked him particularly, if, on the 7th of December, he had received, in consequence of the letter from Hopkins, £1 from Esdaile's - he said he had not - I am positive of that - I asked him the question repeatedly, and he denied it - I then told him, in consequence of the discovery I had made respecting various disbursements which he had made while I was absent from the office, I should give him into the custody of an officer- he seemed confused; and while the lad was gone for the officer (which he was not aware of), he said, "It is no use denying it any longer: I received the £1 from Esdaile's on Saturday last, the 7th" - I am positive he said that in the presence of Mr. Pomeroy, who was there - I had never given him any authority to sign my name to any cheque for the receipt of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to state you never gave him authority to sign your name? A. Yes, certainly, as to notices and briefs and things of that sort, the clerks invariably do it - he had authority, in my absence, to attend to the business, and to transact business in my absence under my directions - my instructions were, not to transact any business without coming to me always and receiving instructions - it was not his habit to open my letters and answer them - I told the lad in the office to tell him not to open my letters - when I took him into custody, I charged him with opening a letter, and receiving, without my sanction, 1l. - I went before a magistrate - we did not follow up that charge - the magistrate recommended me to follow up other charges, and we left this charge until I was advised to proceed on this charge, which was yesterday - we were before this magistrate on the 9th of December; again on the following Monday, and the Monday following that - I did not prefer this charge till I was advised, that in point of form, there was some little difficulty in the other indictments, or else, out of mercy to the prisoner, I did not wish to proceed on this charge - I said, in the first instance, I wished to proceed on the minor charge; but a suggestion having been made that those indictments might be objected to, I was recommended to prefer one for forgery - I am not aware that those charges are bad now - I mean to try them - I consider I was bound to follow the advice of counsel - I made a statement before the magistrate on this charge - it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If I understand you rightly, you say at first you preferred two charges, for minor offences, against the prisoner? A. Yes - I was advised afterwards that the Middlesex bills, found at Clerkenwell, were wrong - the present charge had its foundation in London - I was advised to prefer a bill in London for a distinct offence - the two charges still remain to be decided.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long has the prisoner been in your employment? A. He came to me on the 22d of November- he was not an articles clerk - I gave him 1l. 5s. a week - I was away from the office, from severe illness, from the time he came till this happened - I told him his salary should be increased.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you promise him 30s.? A.Certainly not - he only asked 25s.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STOCK. I am clerk to Mr. Dignam - I received this letter on the 7th of December - there is a shelf in the office on which I used to put the letters - I put that on the shelf - I never received any directions to open them - I told the prisoner he was not to do it - that was in consequence of directions from my master - I remember the prisoner sending me out after I left the letter on the shelf - it was on the shelf when I went out; when I returned from the message he had sent me, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Dignam's a large establishment? - how many clerks are there when the office is full? - they call you Charley in the office? A. Yes; there is nobody besides me and the prisoner in the office - Mr. Dignam was away for two or three weeks - the prisoner did in the office as he was instructed - he went to master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020060"></xptr>mostly every night - he did not know there was a debt due from Hopkins.</p>
               <p>Q.Now will you take your oath you ever saw that letter on the shelf, or did your master tell you to say so? A. I put it on the shelf - Mr. Dignam did not tell me to say that when I went out I left it on the shelf - I think I put it on the shelf about eleven o'clock, and I went out between three and four - Mr. Dignam was at home - he lives at Pimlico - the office is at No. 6, King-street, Holborn; only one letter was on the shelf - I do not know how much money had passed through the prisoner's hands - I received sometimes one thing and sometimes another from him - I had not received so much as 10l. or 15l. in the course of three weeks - I do not know whether he has expended much - I have been two months in the office - the prisoner was not there before me - Mr. Dignam did not come for three weeks - I did not expect that letter from Hopkins - I looked on the shelf to see if the letter was there after the prisoner went out - I did not notice it was gone till he was out and came in again - I told him of it, and he told me he had had it - he did not tell me he had opened it - he did not afterwards produce the letter to Mr. Dignam that I know of - I don't know whether Mr. Dignam settled his account with him before he charged him with this offence.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure he told you he had had the letter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How soon did you tell Mr. Dignam, the prisoner had told you he had had the letter? A.That night - I cannot say how soon it was that Mr. Dignam complained of the prisoner's conduct.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHEPHERD. I am a jeweller. I have seen the prisoner at Mr. Dignam's office, and have seen him write,(looking at the cheque) - the name "James Dignam" to this is a good deal like his handwriting - I believe it to be his - I know Mr. Dignam's handwriting very well - it is not at all like his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Not at all an attempt to imitate his handwriting? A. The I is like his, but the D is not- I have seen the prisoner write frequently at the desk - I called at the prosecutor's office to ask how he was frequently, as he was ill at home, and I might stay there five or ten minutes - I went once or twice to Pimlico - it is my belief that this is the prisoner's handwriting - I speak from the formation of the letter D more particularly.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe it to be his writing? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live at No. 65, Broad-street, City. I was at Mr. Dignam's office on the 9th of December, and remember his speaking to the prisoner about receiving 1l. at Esdaile's - the prisoner at first hesitated and denied it, but afterwards admitted it - he muttered something which I could not understand - Mr. Dignum sent somebody out, and when he came back he said, "Now Mr. Cox, do you mean to say you have not received that money? I have made inquiry and found you have received it" - he then said, that it was no use denying it any longer, that he had received it - I am positive he said that.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HEWSON. I am a policeman, E 5. I took the prisoner up - I said nothing to him then - on my way to the station-house, I said it was a very bad job for him - he said he had admitted about the letter, but he did not think Mr. Dignam would be so hard with him - I did not extort anything from him.(Cheque read.)</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Does the party sign his own name, or in the name of the gentleman the money is to be received for? A. If you brought the letter, I should imagine you to be Mr. Dignam, and expect you to sign the cheque - I would not pay a cheque if I knew a person to put a different name to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In whose handwriting is the body of the cheque? A. A clerk in our country office - the whole of it must have been written at Esdaile's - the cheque was filled up ready for anybody to sign when they apply with the letter, as we had advice to pay the money - I did not see the letter - it was not presented to me - the clerk to whom it was presented is not here.</p>

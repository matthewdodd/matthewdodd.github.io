                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George Crouch, a carrier, of Tudor-street, Blackfriars; Byford was his porter, and Arnold an acquaintance of his. On 21st June I gave Byford seventeen parcels—I called them over him—he entered them himself, and put them into his bag—the consignees have to sign the book—he left me about nine o'clock or a quarter-past, and returned about three—I looked at his book, and found one parcel not receipted for—he said, "I have missed one of the parcels for Green and Banks, of Hatton-garden; have I left it behind me?"—I said no. and be must remain in the place till Mr. Crouch came—he said he had lost the parcel on his way; he did not know how—the parcel was in brown paper—he would know that Green and Banks were jewellers—when we were arranging them in the morning, he said, "Here are two for Green and Banks," and he has entered two.</p>

Mr. Crouch's son, who was with roe, said it was respecting a parcel—he said, "That d----d parcel, I suppose, that Byford lost; it is a d----d fine thing to get into trouble by a parcel that another person lost"—I took him to the station—he said he accompanied Byford to Thavies-inn and Newgate-street; that Byford took three parcels, and went to King-street, Holborn, Warwick-court, and Red-lion-square, I while he remained with the parcels, that he took them out to arrange them, I some charity children and a mob passed, and if he lost the parcel it must I have been then, that when Byford returned he told him he missed one, that I they went to Green and Banks and delivered one, and then went to a beer-shop in Pentonville, and had two games at skittles, which he won sod Byford paid for, and they then went to Finsbury and delivered two parcels, and then returned home.</p>

            , came to me about the middle of last January, the 15th or 16th. He said, he desired the favour of me to let him have the loan of fourteen hundred pounds, that he had occasion for this money, as he had lately made a purchase in Suffolk or Norfolk, to the amount of twelve or fourteen thousand pounds. I told him, that the title deeds of such an estate were a good security, and if he would leave them, that he might have the money. Mr. Perreau said, that could not be, because the purchase-money was to be paid in the country. Then he said, he had got a bond of a gentleman whose name he was not at liberty at that time to mention, but, that if I knew the person, he was sure I could make no objection to it. I said, every thing depends upon the name, for some mens bonds are as good as other mens mortgages. Then he said, he had a house in Harley Street, Cavendish Square, which cost four thousand pounds: and he would leave with me the deeds of that house and the insurance of it, as a security for this fourteen hundred pounds, accordingly he came the next day, and did leave the deeds of the house as a security; and he received the money upon a note promising to assign the deeds, and to do every thing that was necessary: but as he only wanted it for ten days, I only took a note for it, without any further promise: this was about the 15th or 16th of January. I did not see him again till Tuesday the 7th of March. I was acquainted with him before, as an <rs id="t17750531-1-deflabel7" type="occupation">apothecary</rs>

When he came upon the 7th of March, he made an apology for not having kept his word, as to the fourteen hundred pounds, which he borrowed but for about ten days, and he came then to borrow five thousand pounds, out of which he was to pay this fourteen hundred pounds. He then told me, that he had got leave of the gentleman, whose bond he formerly mentioned to give me his name. I asked my brother Robert to come in to consult about the propriety of lending such a sum as that; the prisoner then produced this bond; as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310004"></xptr> we saw it, we both expressed a disbelief of its being Mr. Adair's bond; and asked the prisoner if it was Mr.

He said, yes, it was, and that there could be no doubt about it; for that Arthur Jones, who was the solicitor of Mr. Adair, was a witness, and Start was his servant. I still expressed my doubts about the authenticity of the bond: upon which the prisoner said, Mr. Adair was his particular friend, that there were family connexious between them; that Mr. Adair had money of his in his hands, and that he allowed him interest for it. I understood likewise from him, but I cannot be certain of that particular fact, that the prisoner at that time said, that this bond was given by Mr. Adair to him as the balance of the account subsisting between Mr. Adair and him. Notwithstanding that, we told him that we did not believe it to be the hand-writing of Mr.

               <p>He accordingly took the bond with him and went away: but in about two hours, he returned; my brother was then gone out, and I saw him alone. He told me, what my brother and I had thrown out respecting the signature to the bond, had alarmed him very much, and that he could not be easy in his own mind till he had called upon Mr. Adair, whom he luckily met before he went to take his ride; that he produced the bond to Mr. Adair; and Mr. Adair said, it was his signature, and that he might possibly have altered his hand, from the time we had formerly seen him write; but that we might let him have the five thousand pounds, and that Mr. Adair said, he would pay the bond in May; though in fact, it was not payable till July. Notwithstanding all this, I still had my doubts; I did not express them so strong, but told the prisoner, that he should leave the bond with me, in order to get an assignment of it, which he did, as I was desirous to get possession of the bond, in order to find out whether it was really a good bond or no. The prisoner very readily left the bond with me without any memorandum given by me; and I bid him call the next morning at eleven o'clock. I gave the bond to my clerk. I am certain this (looking upon the bond in question) is the bond I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>My brother shewed the bond to Mr. Stephens of the Admiralty, a friend of Mr. Adair's. Mr. Perreau was to come again the next day; at eleven o'clock my mother and Mr. Stephens went that morning to Mr. Adair's. Mr. Perreau came to our house that morning about eleven o'clock, and my brother and I both expressed our doubts about its being the signature of Mr. Adair; but from what my brother had told me, of his interview with Mr. Adair, I could have no doubt. Mr. Perreau persisted in saying there could be no doubt about it; for that he had a letter from Mr. Adair, that Mr. Adair always wrote to him in a familiar style, and only signed the initial letters of his name. I understood that he received that letter the night before. He only shewed me the initial letters, to prove the intimacy; we said nothing would convince us of this being Mr. Adair's hand, but Mr. Perreau's going with us to Mr. Adair's, which he most readily assented to. Mr. Perreau and I went together in his coach, I had my carriage at the door, but his carriage being up first, he said you had better go in mine, itis the quickest. Mr. Perreau and I went together in the coach, to Mr. Adairs', nobody else was with us; my brother followed us; we found Mr. Adair at home; upon our entrance Mr. Adair took me by the hand, but he made a bow to Mr. Perreau, as a person he had never seen before; I told Mr. Adair, I came to him upon a disagreeable subject, I produced the bond, and asked him whether that was his signature at the bottom of it. He looked at it, and said, no; upon which Mr.

             seemed surprized very much, and said to Mr. Adair, Surely, Sir, you are jocular, I replied it was surely no time for a man to be jocular, when another man's life was at stake, which I then considered to be the case; I asked him, what could all this mean; the person he pretended to be intimate with, did not seem so much as to know him? About that time my brother came in, a great deal of conversation passed backwards and forwards, at last Mr. Perreau said, he had the bond from his sister, Mrs.

I asked him how it was possible for him to say he had received a letter from Mr. Adair, as he pretended, in that familiar stile, from a man he did not so much as know; and I desired to see the letter, which he produced; which letter I thought it very material, as well as the bond, to keep in my possession. We could get nothing from him but that he was an innocent man, and he did not mean to impose upon its, and that his sister could explain all. She did take it upon herself, expressed much regard for

             would you ask this gentleman any questions, or leave it to your council.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I would ask you a few questions, in order perfectly to understand you. The first time that the prisoner came to you with this bond upon your inspection, and your brother's you expressed great doubts of its being Mr. William Adair's.</p>
               <p>Drummond. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose with a degree of positiveness that it was not?</p>
               <p>Drummond. That we had great doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed them over and over?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, over and over again.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed no manner of inclination therefore at that time to advance money upon this bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. None at all, further than telling him to leave the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time he came with the bond, on the 7th of March, you did not desire it to be left?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed no desire then to get possession of the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you perfectly explained to him that you was almost satisfied that it was not Mr. Adair's hand?</p>
               <p>Drummond. We expressed great doubts, there was a delicacy, we did not chuse to say he had brought us a forged bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother with you upon this Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both express your doubts?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay, this first time?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Eight or ten minutes; or a quarter of an hour, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And he returned you that same bond</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call in any body but your brother, when he came the second time with the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Nobody whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed your expression was, that he said, there were family connexions, and he has my money, and pays me interest for it; can you take upon you to say with absolute certainty, whether he said, it was his money Mr. Adair paid interest for, or some of the family's money?</p>
               <p>Drummond. His money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310006"></xptr>Drummond. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take away, the bond that time?</p>
               <p>Drummond. He did the first, time but not the second.</p>
               <p>Q. He readily left the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, without even a memorandum.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any hesitation?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer any excuse not to leave it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He complied with your desire of leaving the bond, as the most innocent man would have done?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, readily.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that he said, he himself had seen Mr. Adair when he was going to ride, or that his sister, or any body else had?</p>
               <p>Drummond. I am perfectly sure, he said, that he himself saw Mr. Adair, that he was in his boots, and he luckily catched him just before he was going to take a ride.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the bond to your clerk after Mr. Perreau was gone?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, to the clerk, or my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When you desired him to come the next day at eleven o'clock, did he readily consent?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Very readily; he supposed, then for what I know, that he was to have the money, for he left the bond in order to have the assignment drawn up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during the times he was at your house, he did not once ask to have the bond away with him?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first shewed you this letter, with Mr. Adair's initials, did you desire to read it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced that letter merely to shew you the initials?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, I did not read it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he still insisted that the name was Mr. Adair's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Drummond. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first proposed to go to Mr. Adair's?</p>
               <p>Drummond. My brother, or I, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was one of you?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, that immediately upon the proposal being made, he most readily consented to it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe in his expression, or countenance, or behaviour, the least reluctance to come into the proposal of going to Mr. Adair?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Not the least; for being convinced in my own mind that it was a forged bond. I looked steadfastly on his countenance, and could not see him alter in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went to Mr. Adair's?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said he carried you in his coach?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, he said that would be the quickest way of going, his coach being first at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Adair had denied that it was his signature, and you requir'd an explanation of the business, he almost immediately said, that his sister,

               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular delay?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, she came as soon as the carriage could well bring her.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said in the gross, that she took it wholly upon herself?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she do that in the presence of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, she said he was totally innocent, and she was the person that forged the bond, and begg'd us for God's sake to have mercy upon an innocent man, to consider his wife and children.</p>

               <p>Q. What was her answer?</p>
               <p>Drummond. My brother said, that it was a masculine hand, and he did not think a woman could write it: she proved it, by taking a bit of paper and shewing us she could write it.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was the same hand?</p>

Oh, said he, there is no doubt but it is his hand, it is witnessed by Mr. Jones, Mr. Adair's solicitor, and his servant. Said I, it is very odd, I have seen his hand formerly, this does not appear to be the least like it. I think, I said to him, if I was to take my oath, I would rather swear it was not his hand-writing. I said, the bond is made payable to you, was you present when it was executed? No, said he, I was not present. I believe my brother then said, come to morrow and we will give you an answer. When Mr. Perreau was gone, I told my brother I had great doubts about the signature, and I thought it would not be amiss to have the bond left with us, as it must be assigned if we advanced any money upon it. I went out with a gentleman who was then waiting for me; I returned in two or three hours, When I came back, I asked my brother if he had sent for the bond; he said Mr. Perreau has been here, and has left the bond. Mr. Perreau came again the next morning for his answer, Mr. Stephens and I had been previously with Mr. Adair, and shewed him the bond. I asked Mr. Perreau if this Mr. Adair was the late agent in Pall-Mall, I said, an elderly gentleman, and described him as well as I could. He said it was. I looked very stedfastly on his countenance, and did not observe it had any effect upon him. I said we have our doubts, and till these doubts are cleared up we can advance no money. I said, the only way of clearing up those doubts would be to go to Mr. Adair, if he had no objection. He said no; he looked at his watch, and said, if he is not gone out. I had not been come from Mr.

At first, she asked to speak with Mr. Adair in a room by himself. Mr. Adair declined that, and said, you are quite a stranger to me, and you can have no conversation with me that may not pass before these gentlemen. I had told him before this, that I would send for a constable directly, and send him before a magistrate if he would not tell his accomplices; for accomplices he must have, if he did not do it himself: then it was that he sent for his sister. She declared, that she forged the bond; that she signed the bond, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310009"></xptr> that the letter was wrote by her. I expressed my doubts upon that, and said, it was so different from a woman's hand, that I did not think her capable of forging it; that nothing would convince me of it but her shewing me upon a piece of paper, that she could write that sort of hand.

               <p>Q. I perceive it bears date to the 25th of January.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I recollect I antidated it to the preceding January, at the request of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had so fill'd it up and anti-dated it, did you give it back to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310010"></xptr>Q. And you never had it from any other hand, or gave it to any other hand but the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it fill'd up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. At my house at Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person present?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, except it was some of my family.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you did it by his direction; you had the directions I believe in writing?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then produce them.</p>
               <p>Wilson. These were the instructions the prisoner gave me: (producing them)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the instructions, or what should be done with them?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He said, Mr. Wilson, I have given you the instructions upon a piece of paper; I desire you will burn it. I told him, there was a minute upon the back of the paper of a petition to the recorder, and I could not burn it then, because of that minute. He desired I would burn it, when I had done with it, and I promised I would; but I put it in my desk and it slipp'd my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no names upon this bond at the time you fill'd it up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. None.</p>
               <p>Q. I see part of these instructions are scor'd through?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that done by?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The prisoner; after I had fill'd up the bond and before he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read what is scor'd through?</p>

               <p>Wilson. Yes. it is

               <p>Adair. She knows a gentleman that I know in the North of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Court. That cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>My lord, it has already been given in evidence, that Mrs. Rudd took it upon herself, and declared the prisoner totally innocent. This letter is exactly to the same purport, and this letter is written, as I understand, the day after she was at Mr. Adair's. The expressions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310011"></xptr> all along go not only to acquit the prisoner of an absolute forgery; but that he was perfectly innocent in the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Can her letter be stronger evidence than her own personal declarations? Both the Mr. Drummonds declare she took it upon herself; that she did it; that the whole was her's; and he was innocent: that is certainly stronger than her writing it down upon a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I am perfectly satisfied with your lordship's declaration.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, If I had been wanting in that fortitude, which is the result of innocence, or had found any hesitation in submitting my proceedings to the strictest scrutiny, I need not at this day have stood before my country, or set my life upon the issue of a legal trial. Supported by the consciousness of my integrity, I have forced that taansaction to light, which might else have been suppressed; and I have voluntarily sought that imprisonment, which guilt never invites, and even innocence has been known to fly from. Ardently looking forward to this hour, as the sure, though painful means of vindicating a character, not distinguished indeed for its importance, but hitherto maintained without a blemish. There are many respectable witnesses at hand, and many more, I persuade myself, would be found if it had been necessary to summon them upon a point of such notoriety, who will inform your lordship and the court, how I have appeared to them to act, what trust has been reposed in me, and what credit I had in their opinions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310012"></xptr> for my diligence, honesty, and punctuality. In truth, my lord, I am bold to say, that few men in my line of life have carried on their business with a fairer character, not many with better success. I have followed no pleasures, nor launched into any expences; there is not a man living who can charge me with neglect or dissipation. The honest profits of my trade have afforded me a comfortable support, and furnished me with the means of maintaining, in a decent sort, a worthy wife and three promising children, upon whom I was labouring to bestow the properest education in my power: in short, we were as happy as affluence and innocence could make us, till this affliction came upon us by surprize, and I was made the dupe of a transaction from whose criminality, I call God, the searcher of all hearts to witness, I am now as free as I was at the day of my birth. - My lords, and gentlemen of the jurymen, men who are unpracticed in deceit, will be apt to credit others for a sincerity; which they themselves possess. The most undersigning characters have at all times been the dupe of craft and subtilty. A plain story, with the indulgence of the court, I will relate, which will furnish strong instances indeed of credulity on one part, which at the same time will exhibit a train of such consummate artifices, that are not to be equalled in all the annals of iniquity, and which might have extorted an equal confidence from a much more enlightened understanding than I can claim.</p>

               <p>"of its being a surgery till the interview</p>
               <p>"with Mr. Adair." - Having stated the above circumstances, the prisoner concluded his defence to the following effect:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have now faithfully laid before you, such circumstances which have occured to my memory, as necessary for your information, in the order as they happened during my acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd, under the character of my brother's wife. Many have been the sufferers by artifices and impostors, but never man appeared, I believe, in this or any other tribunal, upon whom so many engines were set at work to interest his credulity. It will not escape the notice of this splendid court, that my compassion was first engaged by the story of Mrs. Rudd's sufferings, before my belief was invited to her representations. Let me have credit with you for yielding up by pity in the first instance, and you cannot wonder I did not with hold my credulity afterwards. It is in this natural, this necessary consequence, I rest my defence. I was led from error to error by such insensible degrees; that every step I took strengthened my infatuation. When Mr. Drummond first hesitated at the hand writing at the foot of the bond, I tendered in the name of 
               <persName id="t17750531-1-person120">
                  William
                   Adair
               <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="surname" value="Adair"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="given" value="William"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="gender" value="male"></interp>
                  </persName>
            , if it did not so far alarm me as to shake my belief in this artful woman, from whose hands I had received it, let it be considered that I had been prevailed upon to negociate other bonds of this artful woman depositing them in the hands of bankers who had never spied any defect, or raised the least objection. These bonds had been punctually and regularly paid in due time. The letters sent to me, as if from 
               <persName id="t17750531-1-person121">
                  William
                   Adair

                  </persName>
            , critically agreed with the hand-writing of the bond. Mr. Adair did not keep money at Mr. Drummond's: opportunities of comparing his hand writing for many years, had not occured, and the hesitation upon his part, appeared to me no more than the exceptions and I minute precautions of a banker, which could not so suddenly overturn the explicit belief that I had annexed to all that was told me in Harley Street. Can any greater proof be given, than my own proposal to Mr. Drummond of leaving the bond in his hands till he had satisfied his credulity. Can your Lordship, or the gentlemen of the jury for a moment suspect, that any man could be guilty of such a crime, whose proceedings were so fair and open? that single circumstance I am satisfied, will afford my total exculpation. The resort to Mr. Adair was as easy to Mr. Drummond, as to the books in his compting house: it does not come within the bounds of common sense, much less does it fall within the possibility of guilt, that any man living should voluntarily, with his eyes open, take a step so directly and absolutely centering in his certain conviction. But this circumstance, strong as it is, is not all my case. I bless God, the protector of innocence, that in my defence, proofs arise upon proofs, the least of them I trust, will be thought incompatible with guilt: it should seem impossible that a guilty person would propose to Mr. Drummond to retain the bond for the satisfaction of his scruples; but that the same person, should after so long a time for consideration, had passed after my leaving the bond, which was full twenty-four hours, openly and in the face of the day enter the shop of Mr. Drummond, and demand if he had satisfied all his scruples; unless a man from meer desperation had been weary of his life, and fought a dissolution, this I humbly apprehend would be an absolute impossibility; but my lords, and gentlemen of the jury. I had neither in my breast the principle or guilt to commit that high offence against society, which would accompany the act; nor had I that desperate loathing of existence, as should bring a shameful condemnation upon my head: it is true, I have invited this trial, but it is equally true, I have done it in the consciousness of my integrity, because I could not otherwise go through the remainder of my days with comfort and satisfaction, unless I had the verdict of my countrymen for my acquital, and rested my innocence upon the purest testimony I could have on this side the grave. It is plain I had an opportunity of withdrawing myself:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310014"></xptr> how many men are there with the clearest intentions, yet from the apprehensions of being made the talk of the public, and above all, the dread of imprisonment, and the terror of a trial, would have thought themselves happy to have caught at any opportunity of saving themselves from such a series of distress. Greater confidence can no man be in of the integrity of his case, and the justice of his country. When it was found necessary to the designs of Mrs. Rudd, that I and my family should be made the dupe of her connections with the house of Adair; it may well be believed, that nothing but the strongest interdictions would prevent my endeavours to obtain an interview. In fact, this point was laboured with consummate artifice, and nothing less than ruin to my brother and his affairs, was denounced upon my breaking this injunction; it was part of the same error to believe her in this also; a respectable witness has told you, and I do not controvert his evidence, that my confidence in her assertion, and in the testimonials that she exhibited under the hand, as I believed, of Mr. Adair, were such, in my mistaken judgment, as to be equal to the evidence of my own senses, pressed by the forms of business, to say to Mr. Drummond that I had seen Mr. Adair myself, but I neither went to Mr. Adair, nor disclosed those pressing motives which prevented me: no less free to confess my faults, than I am confident to assert my innocence, I seek no paliation for this circumstance, except my temptation and my failings, and I trust it will rather be a matter of surprize, that in the course of a negociation, through the whole of which I was acted upon by the most artful of imposters, that this only deviation was to be found, and yet this very circumstance carries with it a clearer conviction of my being the dupe of Mrs. Rudd's intrigues, than any I have to offer in my defence, and if my subsequent proceedings, and the alacrity I shewed in going with Mr. Drummond to Mr. Adair, together with my conduct before this gentleman, is, as I apprehend it is, absolutely irreconcilable with a conciousness of guilt, the circumstances above mentioned will serve to shew with what a degree of credulity the artifices of Mrs. Rudd had furnished me. - Upon the whole, if in the above detail no circumstances are discovered in which an innocent man, under the like delusion with myself, might not have acted as I have acted, and, at the same time, if there be very many particulars in which no guilty man would have conducted himself as I conducted myself, I should be wanting in respect to your lordships and the jury, if I doubted the justice of their verdict, and which is inseparable from it, my honourable acquital.</p>

             this morning; he by no means would have you do any thing painful to yourself, and if you do not like to apply to Mr. Evans for the money, he desired you would endeavour to get it of Mr. Drummonds, and in order to obviate an objection my brother made to going to Mr. Drummond, Mrs. Rudd said, it was Mr. Adair's desire that he should pay Mr. Drummond the fourteen hundred pounds, for which the papers of my house were mortgaged to Mr. Drummond, out of the five thousand pounds so borrowed. My brother, after a great unwillingness, at last agreed to it, and said he would get a bond filled up. My brother went out in the afternoon, and came in again just as we were at tea; and, in the presence of his wife, the gentleman that assists him in business, and myself, he delivered, her the bond, saying, madam, I have brought you the affair; she took it, put it in her pocket, and no farther conversation passed upon it till Monday the 6th, when I came home and was preparing to go to bed, I saw a letter lying on the table directed to herself; I asked what it was; she said it was the bond Mr. Adair had returned executed for my brother to get the money of Mess. Drummonds. She got up earlier than usual the next morning; she sent for my brother Robert, and gave him the bond, and desired him to go with it to Mess. Drummonds, and endeavour to get the money for Mr. Adair, with the same privacy that he had done upon other occasions. That Mr. Adair was unwilling to have it appear that the money was raised for him, and therefore my brother was desired to lodge the bond with so me confidential friend that would not desire an assignment of it. My brother shewed a vast deal of reluctancy, and said it was a very unpleasant work. And I said, I thought it was so. But as Mr. Drummond had a personal knowledge of Mr. Adair, I thought he could have no objection; upon which he put the bond into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, that your brother believed Mrs. Rudd's representation of her connection with Mr. Adair?</p>
               <p>Perreau. Certainly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you if you believed the same?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever apply to you to get the bond filled up?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she never desire you to apply to a scrivener?</p>
               <p>Perreau. No, but she desired that five thousand pounds might be borrowed upon a bond of seven thousand five hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say, when you was at Mr. Adair's, that you was a perfect stranger to the bond?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I said, I had never seen the bond before, I never had, upon my oath, a perfect knowledge of the bond before I saw it in Mr. Adair's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them, or convey the idea, that you was a perfect stran ger to the whole transaction?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them the story you have told now?</p>
               <p>Perreau. When I came into the room, and saw them in such a state of confusion, I hardly knew what I said, when Mr. Drummond told me it was a forged bond, I was shocked and amazed, knowing it had been managed by Mrs. Rudd. She said, make yourself quiet, your brother is clearly innocent. I told Mr. Drummond, I knew Mrs. Rudd had given a bond to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Drummond that it was that bond?</p>
               <p>Perreau. Mr. Drummond was in that degree of warmth, that I did not know how to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Drummond that the bond was for seven thousand five hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I told Mr. Drummond at that time, that I knew there was a bond given by Mrs. Rudd to my brother, upon which my brother was desired to borrow of him five thousand pounds. Mr. Drummond asked me, if I knew my house was mortgaged to him? I told him it was, and I understood it was to be paid out of this five thousand pounds, if it was borrowed of him.</p>

             ever since I was in business: I believe no man has acted upon better principles either of knowledge or probity in his business; I entertain the very best opinion of him that can be, I did not think him a man capable, or liable to be tempted to such a crime, it is a matter of general surprize to all his medical, and all his other acquaintance. I never saw a man more attentive, more diligent, and seemingly more desirous of doing every thing upon the best principles; I do not know a man I have a better opinion of in private life, he is an honest, decent, well behaved man.</p>

             six or seven years personally, but by character from his first setting out in the world. His general character has been extremely good, I never had any reason to be of a different opinion. I always looked upon him to be an upright honest man; he has been extremely diligent in his business durring the time I have employed him and that has always recommended him to me in my family. I never could, neither do I now think him capable of the crime he is charg'd with.</p>

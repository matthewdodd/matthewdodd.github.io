On 11th April, about a quarter-past nine o'clock at night, I was on duty in the Horseferry-road, Westminster, received information, and saw the prisoner in Medway-street take this pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into a marine-store dealers—there was a person with him who escaped—I followed the prisoner into the shop, and saw the lead in a corner, and the prisoner crouched down in a corner behind a partition close to the lead—I asked what he was going to do with the pipe—he said he knew nothing of it—I took him into custody, and afterwards compared the pipe with some lead left on Mr. Broadwood's premises in the Horseferry-road—the nail-holes and everything fitted.</p>

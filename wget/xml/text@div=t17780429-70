               <p>On the 12th of March, about seven in the evening, I fastened up the shutters of my parlour, as usual; I went into the kitchen to look at the children; then I went out; I locked the street door and the parlour door, and took the keys with me; I was out about twenty minutes. When I returned, I found the shutters of the parlour window open, and the sash thrown up. I looked through, and missed my linen from a chest of drawers in the parlour. Without going into the house, I ran for my husband; we came home together, and then we missed the things mentioned in the indictment. We examined, but could not find how the people got into the house, there was no appearance of any force having been used. I am sure I fastened the door.</p>

               <p>I am a servant at the King of Prussia, a public house; I have seen the prisoner there; I have seen him wear a watch, and wear silver buckles. I remember a man one time (whether the prisoner or no I cannot tell), was standing at the bar talking to my mistress about a silver watch; he asked my mistress to lend some money upon it; this was about two months ago, on a Wednesday or Thursday, about nine at night.</p>

               <p>I had a search warrant against Rust. I went to his house, and said I had a search warrant, and wanted his watch. Rust produced this watch; he said he had it of the prisoner, who was then in the house, and we took him up.</p>

               <p>Rust. The next morning after I took the watch, the prisoner changed the chain and seal, and put it to another watch, which I delivered to White to clean.</p>

               <p>Callam. I know the seal particularly; the impression is a cat; the motto is, Touch not a cat, but a glove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master mariner—I met the prisoners in the evening on the 9th June with others—I am a stranger In London—I had been dining with a friend at the Criterion—I Lost my friend, and was making my way to a cab about 1 a.m. at the Corner below the Criterion Theatre—I had had too much to drink—some women came to speak to me—the prisoners and others came and helped to drive them away—I thanked them, and offered to treat them—they took me to the Savoy Arms, in Savoy Street, Strand, which opened at 2 o'clock—we remained till 3—I treated them a number of times—when I came away they followed me—I said I was tired, and being a stranger would like to go somewhere to lie till the morning, as I had some business to attend to—I am a native of Canada—one of the prisoners said he knew a place at 41, Winchester Street—the cab was ordered to drive there—I did not know that he meant Winchester Street, Pimlico, or that it was so far away—the prisoners knocked at the door, and there was some conversation between Pinner and the woman—Shea was then called out of the cab, then Shea came back to the cab and said, "It is all right;" and we went in—Shea called for two bottles of ale—when I asked whether I could have a room, Shea said, "No, you will have to wait till some one has got up"—the mistress said, "Who will pay for the ale?"—Shea said, "This gentleman will pay for it"—I said, "I will not pay for anything more, I am going out of the house"—Shea gave me a slight push towards the sofa, and said, "Do not be a fool, you are all right"—I began to be alarmed—I took up a carving knife and fork that sere on the table—the prisoners asked me what I was going to do with them—I said, "I am going out of the house, and anybody who stops me will do it at his peril"—no one stopped me, and I walked out of the hall door—when I knew I was safe, I laid the knife and fork down on the slab—the prisoners got their hats and passed me in the hall and</p>

I ran away, and met a constable, and gave him into custody"—I said "That seems most extraordinary, that a man should come behind you without rhyme or reason and assault you in the manner you have described"—he said "He did do so"—I questioned him as to his movements the previous day—he said "I left home at 10 o'clock in the morning, and was at work all day long at Corbett's in Great Charlotte Street, New Cut, Lambeth, I parted with Mr. Corbett at 1 o'clock in the morning at the corner of Lower Marsh, Lambeth, and the Waterloo Road; I came across Hungerford Bridge, went up St. Martin's Lane to a coffee-stall at the corner of Long Acre; I then went to a coffee-stall farther up; I came back, went along Piccadilly to Grosvenor Place, all the time by myself, I went into Buckingham Palace</p>

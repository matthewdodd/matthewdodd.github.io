                  </hi>. I live near Euston Square, and am out of business—on the 18th April I went to Drummond's bank, and received two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, six sovereigns and a half, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, making 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the evening of the 24th April I had 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my person, as I had a sovereign in a leather purse apart from what I had received at Drummond's—I had parted with the half-sovereign and the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and had the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a purse in my left trousers pocket—I had been drinking to a slight extent—I went to the Bay Tree public-house, St. Swithin's Lane, about twenty-five minutes to seven o'clock—no one was with me, but a man accosted me as soon as I entered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190067"></xptr>
               <p>—I do not know whether he entered with me—I called for a glass of half and-half, and the man asked me to give him half a pint of porter—he was in a very distressed state, and I told the barmaid to draw a glass of porter, which I paid for with a sixpence I believe, but was not quite certain—I do not know the man—I had never seen him before—I was about two minutes in the public-house, and the man who I had given the glass of beer to came out with me, and further solicited me to give him some help, as he was so distressed—I was walking towards Cannon Street—I walked away from him; I wanted no further association with him—I crossed from St. Swithin's Lane, just by Bush Lane; I do not know whether I had passed Bush Lane, but it was near that part—I received a violent blow, which cut my eyebrow right across; the scar still remains—it deluged me with blood, and was so extensive that it reached down to my lip, and I have scarcely recovered the feeling of that side of my face up to the present time—I did not stagger or fall, but immediately seized the man, who struck me and received another blow on the other side of my face, which broke my jaw, and so far stunned me that I felt to lose all power, but was not quite deprived of my senses—I was flung immediately on the ground by the man who struck me—I had no power of seeing his face—it was all done very rapidly; it was three or four seconds from the time I received the blow till I was flung down—I felt my purse being removed from my pocket, but cannot say whether that was while I was on the ground—I recollect saying, "That man has robbed men," but whether it was when I was on the ground or when I was lifted up I do not know—I have no recollection for two hours afterwards—I cannot tell whether the blows were struck by a fist or by some weapon—I was laid up for three months from the injury to my jaw—I went next day, ill as I was, with one of the detectives to Drummond's bank—I have seen two notes since, but cannot recognise them, as I do not think there was any mark on them when they were in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Bay Tree, St. Swithin's Lane—on the 24th April a policeman named Wines came to me to make in quiries—I had seen Mr. Caswell at the bar about an hour before that drinking with the prisoner—Mr. Caswell paid for two glasses of beer—I had seen the prisoner several times before, through his serving the house with lemons, and knew him perfectly well—Mr. Caswell was there about five minutes, and the prisoner was with him the whole time; they both went out together—Mr. Caswell was slightly under the influence of liquor—when Wines came to me an hour afterwards I gave him a description of the prisoner and the prosecutor—the prisoner never came with lemons after that night—I next saw him at the Mansion House on Monday, the 5th November—on the evening the prisoner was at the bar with the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On the night of the 24th April I was on duty in plain clothes, and about half-past six or twenty minutes to seven I was about thirty yards from Cannon Street, in St. Swithin's Lane—I had not passed the Bay Tree—St. Swithin's Church was on my left, and the Bay Tree on my right—I met two men walking in the middle of the road, which is very narrow—they were about seventy yards from the Bay Tree when I first saw them, and about eighty yards from where Caswell was knocked down—they passed me and turned to the left—I turned to see in which direction they went, and when they got to the bottom of the lane they turned to the left, eastward—the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's right arm—I know that it was the prisoner, I picked him out from a dozen others—I know his face and person—I had seen him before several times—he is a hawker—I have frequently seen him about the Mansion house and the Bank, hawking lemons and nuts this year—I saw nothing more of them, as the corner hid them from me—I received information about half an hour afterwards and went to the station and described the prisoner—I saw the last witness at the Bay Tree about eight o'clock and received a description from her of the prisoner and prosecutor—she said that she knew the prisoner well—on 6th November I went to Bow Lane Station and picked the prisoner out from a number of others—he was then in custody—I had not seen him since 24th April, though I had searched for him during the first fortnight in the neighbourhood of Petticoat Lane, where he lived, and near the Mansion House, where I had been accustomed to see him—he wore a round hat when I saw him in St. Swithin's Lane, what they call a deerstalker or a <hi rend="italic">Muller cut down</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the same night you went to Miss Fitter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she gave me a very accurate description of the person she believed had been in the house that night—I am quite sure that the person was leading the prosecutor by the arm, but the prosecutor could walk very well without leading—the prisoner was holding his arm for about thirty yards till they turned the corner—it did not strike me that Caswell was very drunk, he could walk very well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You use the expression in your deposition three different times, that he was leading the prosecutor: is that correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not see any difference—he had hold of his arm, and was walking with him, whether it was leading or not—it was not in my mind at that time that he was help<lb></lb>lessly drunk—he was walking straight as a sober man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 94). On the 4th November I took the prisoner in Harrow Alley, Petticoat Lane—I told him the charge; he said, "I know nothing about it; I have been at Liverpool transacting busi<lb></lb>ness for Mr. Isaac Woolf, of Dale Street, Liverpoor"—I know the prisoner, and had been in the habit of seeing him about, daily up to the time of the robbery—I went to the places after the robbery where I had usually seen him, but he was not there—I have seen two notes at the Bank of England, and have made inquiries about them in Petticoat Lane.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MOSELEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 85). I was in Cannon Street, and saw a very old boot in the road near the railway station, and a hat at a little distance from it—I left the hat at the station in the care of the station-sergeant; it was a very old one, one which fitted close to the head like a deerstalker's—the boot was very old, with no heel to it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I saw a very old boot, with no heel, and cut to pieces; I cannot find it or the hat; I have made search for it, and have reason to believe it was swept away with some rubbish when the station was cleaned out; it was a low<lb></lb>crowned felt hat, sometimes they are called deerstalkers and sometimes <hi rend="italic">wideawakes</hi>.</p>

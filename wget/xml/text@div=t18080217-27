               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your house. - A. Yes; on the 28th of last January, between six and seven in the evening, she asked for a single candle, which I gave her, for which she tendered me one shilling; after she was gone I saw it was a bad one; I shewed it to my husband the next morning. I kept it by itself; he requested if she came again, to let him see her; she came again on the 2nd of February in the evening, about the same time, and asked for another candle, for which she gave me a shilling; I then called my husband, I told him that was the woman that gave me the shilling; he said she must be taken in custody; he sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at them shillings, and tell me whether they are counterfeits. - A. They are both very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot tell whether they were made at the same time, - A. That is impossible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shilling she said I gave her she picked it out of a parcel of money, there was not a shilling found on me.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Did you pick that shilling out of a parcel of money. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had it wrapped up in a bit of paper in the parcel of money, you picked it out.</p>
               <p>COURT TO JURY. In order to put a stop to this practice of uttering counterfeit money the legislature thought it was necessary to punish capitally, any such practice after the first conviction. It is well known that it is owing to these people uttering this counterfeit money, that coiners are employed; if there were no utterers of bad money, there would be no coiners. The question for your consideration is, whether the prisoner uttered it with a guilty knowledge; to ascertain that, you must be satisfied with circumstantial proof: it is impossible to have positive proof. When she was convicted at the quarter sessions, the chairman told her the consequence of committing a second offence, with the greatest humanity. It is for your consideration whether you are of opinion, under all these circumstances, that she knew this shilling was a bad one.</p>

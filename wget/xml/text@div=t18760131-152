                  </hi>. I am head warehouseman in the employ of the London and Manchester Plate Glass Company, Whitefriars, and at Manchester—I have known Goodall as a customer for three years—the other two prisoners were warehousemen under me—on 3rd January, about 6 p.m., this invoice was handed in by one of our clerks, it is in Goodall's writing, but it is on one of our bills—here are various widths on it making eight dozen and two plates of glass altogether—on receiving that order I handed out all the goods named on it with the assistance of the two prisoners at the front door and from there they would be lowered into a wooden horse placed there, and I told Goodall that that was all—he stood there and saw them handed out—there were also twenty-eight glass plates there 47 by 37 value about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I counted them carefully—I then went to the bottom of the warehouse to wash previous to going home—I was away about five minutes—I then returned and counted the plates and there were only twenty-four—the prisoners were then loading Goodall's van—I closed the warehouse, communicated with Mr. Clark, and took a cab to Goodall's premises—I waited outside thinking he had not arrived—Mr. Clark went for a constable and I waited outside while they went in—he came out with Goodall—I saw Goodall and an assistant unloading the van—they took the glass into the warehouse at the back and I saw the four plates of glass taken from the top of the van—the plates weighed about 401bs. each.</p>

Mr. Clark was the manager of the concern, he is here—an invoice and receipt were taken from Goodall's pocket after he was given in custody—there is no water at the wharf, but there was previous to the Thames Embankment—the eight dozen plates were small not bigger than this book—I did not see them put into the van—Goodall's is a covered van—a person not engaged in loading it could see what was put into it—I went out ten minutes afterwards and got a cab—it was about 3 miles to Goodall's premises—it was quite dark—Iwas outside when Goodall was brought out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass cutter in the prosecutors' employ—I received instructions from Mr. Clark, and on 3rd January, I was with Deval and George all day, and about 6 o'clock George said "Here is Goodall, as soon as you see a chance slip out as soon as you can"—(I saw Goodall drive his van up about 5.40)—I said "All right," and a few minutes afterwards George said "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> is washing; <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> up"—he meant "Be quick"—I said "Wait a minute I will go and see where <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> is" and went down the warehouse—the van was empty then and while I was down there I saw George take out some plates of glass 47 by 37 inches, I cannot say how many, but I went and said to George "How many have you got on?"—he said "Four"—the small plates which are in the invoice were outside on a place called the horse—I saw Goodall tying the tarpaulin down—the van contains frames which slides in and out on wheels—it is not easy to see what is in it when the tailboard is up, nor what is on the top when the tarpaulin is on—I did not speak to Goodall—I heard Goodall say to George "1 think there is some one dodging about at the top, I will</p>

               <p>go and see," and he went away out of our yard towards the top of the stairs, and I went and spoke to George who told me he had gone up to see whether there was anybody at the top, and then Goodall came up and spoke to George, but I do not know what he said—I asked George and he said that Goodall should say it was all right—I then spoke to Mr. Clark.</p>

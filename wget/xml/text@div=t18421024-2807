I was at the public-house—when I went in the prosecutor and prisoner were having words about a bridle which the prose<lb></lb>cutor stole from his father-in-law—the prisoner was bandying him for that, and the prosecutor was bandying him for committing some assault—during the time the prisoner foamed at the mouth, seemingly with talking the prosecutor put his finger to his mouth or chin very gently, and said, "See, he is foaming like a barber's shaving-pot"—the prisoner said, "Will you do that again?"—the prosecutor put his hand over towards his mouth, but did not touch it again—the prisoner had his hand behind him, in his pocket,' and stabbed him—the prosecutor took his coat off, and I saw his shoulder was cut to the bone—the prisoner sat down, and was putting the knife into his pocket, and when the policeman came he took it from his pocket—before that, when he was told what he had done, he thumped his hand on the table, and said he did not care if he was hung for it.</p>

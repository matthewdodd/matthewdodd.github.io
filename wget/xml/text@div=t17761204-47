               <p>Upon the 29th of October I met Asher in Chiswell-street; we went into a public-house and had a pint of purl; Asher said, do you know one Lavey, I said, I do; said he, do you know his son, I said, I do; said he, he looks like a foolish sort of a fellow, he has got a good deal of money left to him; I think it is pity such a foolish fellow should have so much; I said, I don't think he has all the sense in the world, because a person that I know has a note of his in his hand that he has extorted from him; said he, do you think there is no possibility of doing of him?</p>
               <p>COURT. What did he mean by doing of him? - Out of his money I imagine; I told him the man had a note of his for 50 l. said he, if you can tell who that man is I will give him ten guineas for the note, for I know it is good; said he, he comes of age upon the 21st of November, if I could get two more good fellows as well as myself, I should like to stop him and scamp him of his money; we drank a pot of purl: said he, I live at No. 1, in Christopher's-alley, if you can see this man about the note, and bring him to my house, I will give him ten guineas for it; I am sure the note will be paid; we drank the pot of purl, Asher paid for it.</p>

               <p>I was going from Southampton-court, Queen's-square, to Norton-street, Marybone, on the 7th of December; I went across the fields; four of my acquaintance went with me to see me safe across the fields. They left me in Tottenham-court Road, just above the Tabernacle; I was going along <placeName id="t17810110-7-crimeloc33">London-street</placeName>

When they came up to me, the tall man Larby, held up a knob stick and said stop and deliver your money! I said whatever I have got you shall have; I took eighteen pence out of my breeches pocket, which the short man Dobey took; the sixpence was a counterfeit. Dobey immediately felt at my fob and said where is your watch? I said I had not one. He asked if my buckles in my shoes were silver? I said yes Sir. He then said</p>
               <p>"I will have them." He stopped down and took them out of my shoes. He said have you no more silver about you? I said no; he then said have you no more money? I said only a few half-pence; the tall man did not take the half-pence; the short one said yes, give me them? which I did. Dobey then catched hold of my neck and said is this stock buckle silver? I said no, metal; they then went laughing away towards Tottenham-court Road. I saw them run down John-street, I followed them; when I turned the corner of John-street they were then walking pretty fast; I called out stop thieves! upon which they set off running; there happened to be a watchman at the corner of the street; he swang his rattle, they kept running down Howland-street; I followed them and never lost sight of them but when they turned the corner of Howland-street. I got sight of them again as soon as I turned the corner; they kept running all the way; they ran down to Tottenham-court Road; they crossed the way and then stopped running and walked; and in that time they threw the buckles and the money over the pales as we afterwards found. I clapped my hand upon Larby's breast, he stopped and said indeed I am not the man.</p>
               <p>When he said that had you charged him with any thing? - No; the watchman took them to the watch-house. I saw the buckles after they were found in the road just by the pales; one of them was in

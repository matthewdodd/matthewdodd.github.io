                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Nash, a labourer, and live in Smart's-buildings, Holborn, in the parish of St. Giles's-in-the-fields. The prisoner lodged with me for nine months and a fortnight—four or five months ago, when she left I missed the key of my door, and got another—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 3rd of August, I went out at twelve o'clock at night—I locked the door, returned at half-past two o'clock, and found the door closed to, but not locked—I could push it open—on entering my room I missed a jacket, a pair of trowsers of my husband's, a flannel shirt, a boy's suit, and several other little articles, which have been found—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know all these things—this is the dirty cap which I took off that night—here are several other things I know—I had left them in my room when I went out—I went to the prisoner's room with the officer—I stood outside.</p>

On Sunday rooming, the 4th of August, I went to the prisoner's room by Mrs. Nash's desire, and took her into custody—I searched her room, after taking her to the station-house, and found the things I now produce—I also found this key under the bed sacking, which I found fitted the prosecutor's door—two pinafores and a table-cloth were given to me afterwards by a woman in the house.</p>

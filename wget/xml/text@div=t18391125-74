                  </hi>. I keep a marine-store shop, in Great Saffron-hill. On the 9th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I bought copper—I said, Yes, what sort was it?"—he said he would bring it to me—he came again with part of an ingot, and I took him to the static a-house—he said on the road, that it was his own—I said I was confident it Was not—he said it was, and at last said he worked for a person in St. John-street—he would not tell me who, but at the station-house he said it was for Mr. Pontifex.</p>

I know the piece of copper which Rawley has, it is off the same bar as the piece Bradley the policeman has, but he is not here—I had divided the bar, on the 9th of November—I saw the prisoner there between four and five o'clock—the part the prisoner took is the piece with a flaw—I saw the same copper produced before the Magis<lb></lb>trate by the policeman—it would have to be re-melted.</p>

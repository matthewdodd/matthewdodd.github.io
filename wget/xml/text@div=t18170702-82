            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody at his master's house, searched him, and found a pocket-book in his coat-pocket, which contained several duplicates; one of which applies to the tea-spoon. The prisoner said it was a duplicate of an apron belonging to a young woman; I also found the duplicate of two table-cloths. On the Thursday, I found the bank note under the drawers in the room where I searched him, it was a 2l. note. Mr. Harlow told me the number of it before he saw it. After I had searched the prisoner, I told him he must have done it, and asked him where he had put it; he said he threw it under the drawers while I was searching him.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Dumball; he is a pawnbroker, and lives at Somers Town. I have the two tablecloths and a spoon, pledged at our house. I do not know who pledged them-the duplicates found on the prisoner belong to our house. One table-cloth and a spoon were pledged with us on the 22d of May, for 5s.; the other table-cloth was pledged on the 20th of February, for 2s.2d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you do not know his face at all - A. No; I do not. They were pledged in the name of Roberts - I took them in myself. I do not know that I ever took any other articles in of him.</p>

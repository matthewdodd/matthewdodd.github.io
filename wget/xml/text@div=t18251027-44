            . I took the prisoner. I found nine bottles more at his lodging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been at sea all my life; I was eighteen years in the navy, but the last vessel I was on board of was the Albion steam packet - the mate had beer in some of these bottles to sell to the passengers; the captain said I might bring them on shore to make a shilling or two of. When I got this place I used to take my beer and tea in them, and the bottles found on me were my own. The woman of the house told the officer she knew the bottles had been in the house some time.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MOODY re-examined. Q. Did you hear any thing of this? A. The woman said he had belonged to the Albion steam boat, and had brought some bottles on shore, but the bottles found on him were quite clean.</p>

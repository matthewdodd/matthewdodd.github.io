At 1.30 on the morning of the 4th April, I was passing up Frederick Street—a ory of "Stop thief!" attracted my attention, and I saw three persons running—the prisoner was one of them—they were running down Frederick Street from the direction of the Olive Branch, the prosecutor's—I stopped the prisoner, the others got away; he tried to get out of his coat—I took him back to the Olive Branch and called the prosecutor, who found his back parlour "window had been broken and the shutters were down and placed near the parlour door—the prisoner was charged—he made no remark.</p>

I keep the Olive Branch public-house, No. 223, Gray's Inn Road—on the evening of the 3rd April the back parlour window was closed, and the shutters were put up outside—the curtain was not down—at that time the glass was whole—at 12.30 I last saw it so—at a quarter to 2 o'clock my attention was again called to it and if was then down 14 inches and two squares of glass broken—the prisoner was brought to me by the last witness and charged with attempted burglary.</p>

I lost my hat in the scuffle; one of the men struck me, and told me to go the other way, and not to look back or to follow them. The shortest proposed to kill me; but the tallest, which is the prisoner, opposed it, and said it should not be done. After some time I took courage, and looked round, and saw both of them running towards Grosvenor-gate; I gave information at Sir

               <p>Upon the 9th of February in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner; he was in bed in a room with a woman; in a drawer in that room I found this seal (producing it). I asked the prisoner, if the seal was his? he said he knew nothing at all about it; but in the same drawer there were some regimental cloaths, and these the prisoner owned to be his: I have had the seal ever since.</p>

When Heley shewed me the seal, I said I believed it was mine, and told Heley I had an impression which I had taken from the seal, and that is the same produced. [The seal and impression were produced in court.]</p>

I first stopped the man, whilst I held him, the prisoner took his watch and money; there was a bad half crown and a six-pence amongst it, there was likewise a purse and some half-pence, and there was half a guinea and some silver in that purse. We went through Grosvenor-gate: the prisoner had possession of the watch, it was pawned opposite St. Ann's Church Soho. I stood under the wall till the prisoner came back; he had half a guinea upon the watch. I had one half guinea and the prisoner had the half guinea that was taken from the prosecutor. The prisoner had on a close-bodied brown coat, I am not certain whether he had any great coat on.</p>

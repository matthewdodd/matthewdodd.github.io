               <p>Q. When did you put them there - A. I had aired them on the Sunday and put them in the drawers; I missed a silver hunting watch off the mantle piece, and two silver tea spoons from off the tea board in the buffet.</p>

On the next morning, about six o'clock, I was awoke out of my bed by a knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mrs. Straffing any where - A. No; I went over to her; Mrs. Gardener was with me; I found her in Gardener's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you accompanied her there in your examination - A. Then there is a great error in the deposition; I found her at Gardener's along with the Thames police man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man and his wife there then - A. Yes, they were both present; Mrs. Straffing was crying bitterly for her things, with that I interceded as a neighbour, I said give the poor creature her things, and have done with it; the man said speak to my wife; the prosecutrix promised to forgive them over and over again, she did upon my oath, provided she got the things again; afterwards I took the wife up stairs with the officer and myself into an empty room and spoke to her; I said your sister has promised to forgive all, for God's sake let her have the things again; I prevailed upon her to tell me where the things were, and to let her have them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where - A. I went with the woman; I was brought from one street into another; afterwards I was told it was No. 100, Chapman street, she knocked at the door, no answer was given; she said her mother and father was not up; we waited, and the door was opened; an elderly woman came out, she asked us what induced us to come there so soon; the woman prisoner said we had been out to get some milk; the woman prisoner gave the woman some gin; while the woman was gone she took me into the yard and there I found the watch; it laid by the side of some wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it covered over - A. No; it was within the wood, but very visible; and the two spoons were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not they concealed under the wood - A. They were very plain to be seen, I put them into my coat pocket that I have on now; from there, by her desire, I went to a house in Back Church lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman prisoner go with you - A. Yes; she took me to a house; we went into a two pair of stairs room; a woman was there; she said to the woman give me these bundles, I have got to make up some money for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that woman's name - A. God knows what the woman's name was, I never saw her before; the bundles were brought out; I took the two bundles upon my shoulders and went with them and the woman prisoner to my house; according as I understood the nature of the business between the brother and sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these bundles - A. They were taken by Mrs. Straffing and the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the officer the same bundles that you brought from the woman's house - A. I took the bundles away, and the officer took them; I cannot swear to the bundles. The very identical bundle that was brought from the woman into my parlour the officer had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Were you ever present when any sum of money was proposed by the prosecutrix - A. I can swear upon my oath she said if she had a considerable sum of money she would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoners - A. Between four and five years. Gardener is a worthy honest man as ever the country produced; were I possessed of five hundred pounds I would give it him; I look upon this to be done out of design.</p>
               <p>- MORANT. Q. You are an officer of the Thames police, are you not - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning, in consequence of any application made to you by the prosecutrix, did you go with her and where - A. I went to her house. I examined the back yard, I saw no place where I could find any thing of the robbery having been done, except from the window of the prisoners. I went to Gardener's house, I knocked at the door, he opened it, I told him my business, that the next door neighbour had been robbed, and suspicion fell upon him; the wife was in bed. I asked him if he had any objection to my searching the house; he said none at all; by the time the wife was up I proceeded to search; I found nothing in the house. Cohen came in as a neighbour; he asked me if I would trust the woman with him up stairs, I told him I would; they went up, and they afterwards called for the man; some time elapsed. I was called, I went up stairs, Cohen informed me that they had confessed that they had done the robbery, he asked me if I would trust the woman with him to fetch the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You entrusted the woman with him - A. I did. I kept the man in custody, I wanted to see if I could find where the property was. I followed the woman and Cohen at a distance a little way, the woman prisoner saw me, she told me if I followed them the property should not come forth; I wanted to dog them, to see where the property was. I found I could not get the property any other way. I let the woman prisoner and Cohen go; I was upon the watch, I saw the woman and Cohen come back, Cohen had a bundle on his back; I followed Cohen into his house; the female prisoner was present; I saw a silver watch, two silver spoons, and the things that were contained in the two bundles. I took them directly to Mrs. Straffing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120016"></xptr>see if she could speak to them.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

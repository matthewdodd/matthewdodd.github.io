                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company, and reside at 11, Claremont-terrace, Kentish-town—on the night of the 21st December last, I was in a butcher's shop in Skinner-street, King's cross—whilst there, the prisoner came up to me and asked me if he should get me a cab—I replied that I could get one myself, I was obliged to him—within a minute after that time a cab drew up, and I told the cabman to go to Kentish-town—I had a turkey, two fowls, and a piece of beef with me—I was taken to the Castle at Kentish-town, and got out there—I made a pro<lb></lb>position to the cabman to take me to my residence, about 100 yards further, but he said the road was too bad—I went on by the congregational church, and was met by three men, one of whom made an attempt to get the package from me, but did not succeed—I was knocked down, and the pack<lb></lb>age went out of my hand—I saw three persons by me when I was knocked down—I cried, "Stop thief!"—all I recollect, was seeing the three make an attempt to get possession of the package, and then run away.</p>

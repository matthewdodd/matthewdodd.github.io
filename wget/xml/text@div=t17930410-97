             was coming up the pavement the other way, Myers held up his elbow before Spencer, which touched Spencer's breast, Spencer put his left arm on the arm of Myers, the deceased, to push him out of his way, and he fell down in the street before the off wheel of the dray, with his head about a foot before the wheel of the dray, which was attempted to be stopped by the man who drove the dray, and the wheel went over the upper part of his head, he was taken up, but I ran away after Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. When Myers was walking along the footway was the prisoner running or walking? - They were both walking, and a great number of people were coming along at the same time; Spencer then ran up Bow-street where he was taken; there was nothing said by either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner shoved the deceased's arm on one side? - He did, then Myers was taken to a surgeon and from thence to an Hospital.</p>

               <p>I was at Bow-street, and I heard the cry of stop him, and I ran out of the office and towards Long-acre, and I saw Spencer seemingly the object whom they where running after, and he ran against a man, and that rather stopped him, and I ran and took him; I went the next day to the Hospital and I saw the man; then he was up, and had had his breakfast, and seemingly in a fair way; he wanted me to give him some gin as he was low spirited; I went again the same day to the Hospital and he was in bed, and seemed pretty well composed; I don't know when he died, I believe it was on the 8th of March.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Providence Place, Old Woolwich Road—I know the prisoner—on 4th November I went with him to go to the Thames Embankment to look at some timber which I pointed out to him—I saw him a few days afterwards, and he told me he had bought a lot of the timber in the auction, and wanted a cheque on account—I gave him a crossed cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Mr. Gardiner or bearer—I saw him next day—he said that he had been to Mr. Gar-diner, who he supposed did pot keep a banking acccount as he wanted an open cheque—I destroyed the crossed cheque, and gave him an open one—I saw him next day in the Trafalgar Road, and asked him if he had seen Mr. Gardiner, and paid him the cheque—he said yes, and that he had the eceipt—he fumbled in his pocket, but could not find it—he said, "I have left it at home, you shall have it to-morrow"—I called at his house, but did not see him till 19th November, when I found him at the Ship and Billet, East Greenwich—I said, "You scoundrel, give me the money"—he said, "What money?"—I said, "Give me the money"—he gave a grin, and said that he had spent it—I immediately applied to a Magistrate for a summons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 42, University Street, Tottenham Court Road—the prisoner called at my office—I do not remember on what date—and asked if we had any timber unsold from a sale I had had at the Thames Embankment, on 21st October—I think he men<lb></lb>tioned Mr. Noakes, of Greenwich—I told him I had no timber left for sale—he never showed me a crossed cheque, purporting to come from Mr. Noakes, or any cheque at all—we had nothing to sell, and told him we could not do business with him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to Mr. Gardiner about the timber. He said that he had not got any, but was going to have a sale in a fortnight or three weeks. Mr. Noakes said, "You have had a good deal of trouble, if you think you can get any I will give you money to buy it in your own name." I asked him to give me an open cheque, as I could not get it at Mr. Gardiner's. He said that he had not got an open cheque in the house, but he went and brought one, and gave it to me, and said that I must refund it when I got the goods. He told me to get some timber, and I went into the country. After I returned I met him, and lent him half a crown. I met him again next day, and he asked me to lend him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., saying that that would make half a sovereign. I never saw him again till I met him at the Ship and Billet, when he put himself in a passion, and would not let me speak to him, but fetched a policeman, without ask<lb></lb>ing me whether I had got the money or not. He actually lent me the money to do myself good for the winter, and then gave me in charge for stealing it—if he had asked me for it in a proper form I should have endeavoured to pay him.</p>

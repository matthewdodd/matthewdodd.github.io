On the 9th of November the prisoner and another woman came to our house and called for a pint of beer, I brought it them and they paid me for it. I had been washing my gown, I left it hanging on the back of the chair to dry; I went out of the tap-room into the yard for ten minutes, and when I returned my gown was gone, and the two women was gone; I went to search after them; I found the prisoner in the street, she had my gown on; I brought her back to my mistress's house with the gown on her back; I sent for an officer, he took the gown off.</p>
               <p>JOHN SANKEY PUGH. On the 9th of November I went to Mr. Shury's, the prisoner was in the tap, I took the gown off her back; she said she bought it of another woman for four shillings and sixpence. The gown was wet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the gown of a woman in Golden-lane for four shillings and sixpence; I went home and put the gown on, and when I came out again I met the prosecutrix, she said the gown belonged to her: I said she should have it if it was her's.</p>

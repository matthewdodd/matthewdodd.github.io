I lost a black gelding on the 14th of this instant, out of my stable. He had a white foot, and a spot on his near side. My brother and my son came to London, and found him. I came up and found him in a stable in Bartholomew-close, and I swore to him. The prisoner lived not a mile and a half from my house. He was a journeyman tallow-chandler a little while; since that he has done day-labouring work. He said he bought the horse of one Claringbull, on the Eltham-road. The horse is worth 20 l.</p>
               <p>Street Holding. I am a relation of the prosecutor's. He came to me on the 5th of December, and told me, he had lost his horse. His son and I came up to Smithfield; there I saw the prisoner with the horse. I said to him, Is this your horse? He said, Yes. I said, How old is he? He said nothing. I looked in his mouth, and saw him coming five years old. I had the bill of the marks with me; that mentioned five years old, and the marks answered. Then I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, You shall not go from me, till you give an account how you came by this horse. He said, he bought him that morning, of one Claringbull, at Lusham. I asked, Who saw you buy him? He said, No body. I asked, Where he paid the money? He said upon the road. I sent for a constable, and delivered him into his care. And the next morning I sent for Mr. Collier, who came and swore to the horse.</p>

            . I live at 25, Doyle street, Sloane street, Chelsea; I keep a mangle. On the 26th of November, I had some linen to mangle, for 27 Douglas place; I made a mistake and took them to 28, and on Sunday morning the servant of No, 27 came to me for the cloathes; I said, I had taken them to 28; I immediately went to No. 28. for them; I rung the bell at the gate, the prisoner came; I told her I came for the clothes that I had given to the house maid in a mistake the afternoon before; I begged her to give them to me, that my mother was a very poor woman, that I should have to make them good through my mistake in delivering them wrong. She denied having them, and said, she had delivered them to a girl that described the things in the bundle she gave them to her; she said the woman that mangled for her had sent the little girl for these things; I enquired where this mangle was, she said in George street Union place; I went directly there; I asked the woman if she had sent any girl for the things, she said, no, she had not; I went to the prisoner,

I did; I took the cook and the house maid to Queen-square office, Mrs. Vyse came forward and gave her a good character, therefore I dropped it until I heard she was taken into custody, and as I had not found the clothes, I had to make them good; I got a search warrant, Gillmore the officer searched her box, and found an apron remaining, and a pair of stockings.</p>

            's. On the 23rd of November last we sent a few things to mangle, and on the 24th, Webber brought some mangling home; I asked Webber what the money was, she said three pence, I paid the money; in a short time afterwards, the prisoner came home, she said, they were not our things; the prisoner went to our manglers and told her she had not sent our things, the Mangler delivered up our bundle, she paid her for them. On Saturday morning, a girl came for the things that had been left by mistake, the prisoner asked her what they were; the girl described them, the prisoner delivered them to her: Webber came afterwards, she was told they had been fetched away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you quite sure a girl came to whom this bundle was delivered - A. Yes, I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Gillmoor. This is the apron I found in Morgan's box.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunn. Is that the apron you gave to Webber to mangle - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Webber. This is the apron I received from No, 27.</p>
               <p>Smith. This apron the prisoner lent me, I wore it on August the 20th; I am sure this apron, I saw in the prisoner's possession, long before this took place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you say that before the magistrate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunn. Look at that apron, and describe what you know it by - A. I am positive it is my apron, I darned it here myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Vyse's on the 14th of October, on the 15th, my fellow servant borrowed it of me, I darned the apron myself, my fellow servant saw me darning it, that apron was made out of a petticoat, and one of my gores are in it now.</p>

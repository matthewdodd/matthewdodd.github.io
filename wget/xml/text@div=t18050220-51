             came to my shop to sell some rags; - I am a very ailing person, I was trying to wash a few things; - she said, you do not look capable of washing; she told me she went out to wash, and she would be glad to do it for me; I told her I could not afford to give much, and that if she had nothing to do she might come and do it for me; she washed for me from two o'clock till half past five; she had dinner and tea, and I gave her threepence; she then said to me, I have nothing to do to-morrow, and if you have a mind I will come and iron them for you; she came the next morning between nine and ten o'clock, and continued till half past two; then our sabbath begins. She then said, you do not touch fire on Saturday, if you have a mind I will come and mind your fire; I said she might come; on Friday she stayed with me till very near eleven o'clock, and came on Saturday morning between eight and nine, and continued till half past five o'clock, and then she had her tea, and was going, she said, to a gentlewoman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she paid any thing? - A. No; she said she would come back again at half past ten o'clock, if I would set up so long, and I sat up; I said to my little girl, after she was gone, Betsey, I wish you would get the shift, and I will mend it; she went into the shop, and could not find it; I told her it was very cold, and to get me my shawl, and she could not find the shawl; she said to me, have the other shawl, and when she went to get the other shawl it was gone; I said, it is very odd that what you looked for is gone. I got up in a passion, and looked on the line, and the first thing that I missed was a white bed-gown, and other articles; I know no person was in the place but this woman.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Mrs. Solomon: My mistress hung the shift over the back of the chair when she had done it, and when she told me to get it I could not find it, nor the shawl, and there was another shawl that my mistress lent me when I went to the dispensary with her, and that was gone; I saw the duplicates taken from her at the watch-house by the lantern-bearer, and he gave them to the constable; I was not present when the shawl was taken from her neck. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. You were to pay me half a crown from Thursday to Saturday? - A. No, it does not stand to reason I was to pay you that for two or three hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows; -</p>
               <p>"My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, well knowing that it would not be in my power to speak in this awful place, but relying upon that humanity which is always shewn to a poor prisoner, I humbly lay my case before you, and I humbly hope to shew you that I am as innocent as a child unborn. I went some weeks ago into Mr. Solomon's shop to sell a few bad shillings, for which I got a penny; his wife was washing; she asked me if I knew any person that would wash a few things for her; I told her I went out to wash; I washed her clothes for her, and when I had done Mrs. Solomon begged that I would stay to stir the fire and snuff the candles; I was there on Friday, and staid till eleven o'clock at night; I then went on Saturday morning at eight o'clock, and staid all day. In the evening I told her I wanted to go to St. James's, and I told her I would thank her to pay me, which was half a crown; she promised to pay me half a crown, but told me to call the next day, as the never paid any money on her sabbath; I told her I wanted the money; she told me then to take a shift, which she gave me out of the shop, and to pawn it to pay myself, but I told her it would not pawn for half a crown; she then gave me a shawl, and the other shawl she lent me; I was stopped near a place where I was going to by her husband, and he said I had stole them; I leave it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) Did you tell her to take the shawl and the shift? - A. No, I am certain I did not; I have a little girl that runs of my errands, and she knows I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Robins.) Did you hear any conversation about paying her for the work she had done? - A. My mistress said she would satisfy her when it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200046"></xptr>done, she could not before; she then said it was only a few halfpence; she gave her threepence and a dinner that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she went away - did you hear your mistress say she might take any thing to pay herself? - A. No, I am confident to the contrary.</p>

I went to her and asked what was the matter; she said, I was knocked down and robbed of a bundle of linen; I bid her be quiet, and said I would go and see if I could find any of them; I went and met the last witness.</p>

               <p>Moses came to the office; hearing of the robbery I went to the prisoner's lodgings to apprehend him, and found he had left his lodging. I found him about three weeks after, at a lodging in Chick-lane; when he saw Levi and I come in, he ran and hid himself in the coal-hole; after that, he said if 
we would admit him an evidence, he would confess the whole.</p>

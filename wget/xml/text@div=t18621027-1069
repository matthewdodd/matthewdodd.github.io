I am half-brother to the prisoner, and live at 57, Museum-street, Bloomsbury—on 13th October, about 12 o'clock, I was in George-street, St. Giles's, and met the prisoner there—he fired a pistol at my face—I turned round, staggered for a moment, and fearing he might fire again, I ran away, through Russell-street, into Hanway-street, where we were both stopped—a pistol was taken from him; and I went to the station and charged him, and from there I went to the hospital—I might have been a few yards from the prisoner when he fired—when he was following me I</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William—we live in High Holborn. On the 27th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Rogers came into the shop and requested to see some black handkerchiefs—I showed him some, and he objected to the size—I then showed him some coloured ones—Trott then came in, and asked to see some ribbons, and while showing him some, I heard the drawer in which the handkerchiefs were, drawn towards Rogers—I looked, and was aware I had lost something from it—while I was cutting the ribbon for Trott, Rogers said he would not trouble me, and went out—Trott paid me for the ribbon, and then he went—the box of handkerchiefs was about one yard from Rogers—he could reach it—he was nearer than Trott was to it—the prisoners did not speak to each other while they were in the shop—after they were gone, I looked into the box, and saw the handkerchiefs were disturbed—I could not tell that I had lost one—I have since seen one that I lost from that box—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was brought back by Alderman the officer, on Friday the 30th.</p>

On the 27th of October, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Lamb-street, Spitalfields, in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners walking and talking together—I took the liberty of laying hold of Rogers, and said to him, "What have you about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand into his pocket, and found a bundle of cigars—he said, "I am not going to be searched"—I took him to the station, and found on him five more bundles of cigars—I then took him into the Inspector's room, pulled down his small clothes, and when I polled them up again, this handker<lb></lb>chief was on the ground—I asked if he knew any thing of that—he said, "No, do you want to accuse me of stealing that?"</p>

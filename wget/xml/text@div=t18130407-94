            . Q. I believe you have been for many years an assistant to the solititor of the Mint - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the twenty shillings found on Jackson, and tell me whether they are counterfeit - A. They are all counterfeits, and appear to be of the same sort, they are fresh now, and on the examination they appear never to have been in circulation; they are common metal; they are washed on the surface with a solution of silver; and the other twenty they are of the same description; they appear to be counterfeited in the same way.</p>

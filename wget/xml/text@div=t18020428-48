               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Owen Davis of Hoonslow? - A. I went to sleep there on the 9th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. I did not take particular notice of the day; I went from there to Staines; I arrived at Staines about nine o'clock in the morning, I was going to Chertsey.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way to Chertsey, who did you see? - A. A man jumped over a gate to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. Yes; that was the man. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us if any conversation took place between you? - A. He jumped over the gate, and asked me if I was a Jew; I told him, yes; he asked me whether I would buy some wedge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is wedge? - A.Silver; he pulled out of his pocket a little salt-spoon; I asked him whether he had got any more; he told me, yes, he had got mere in plant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by plant? - A. Hid; I asked him why he would not get it now? he told me no, it would not do now, for there was a man at work very near where the property laid, but he said, if you will meet me between six and seven, upon Staine's-bridge, I will go with you and sell it with you; then I said, suppose I meet you at home at your house? he said, no, it will not do at my house, I am suspected as a suspicious person in the town, and it is very likely I may have my house searched; I told him it was dangerous for him to keep that spoon in his pocket if he was in danger of having his house searched; he immediately took and dug a hole, and put the spoon into the earth, just by the gate where he got over; I walked with him better than half a mile back towards Staines, and told him not to deceive me, but to meet me there at the time; I left him, and wished him good-bye, then I went to the place where he had hid the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you go back to that place? - A. I thought very likely he might meet some body else, and take the spoon out, and sell it; I dug up the spoon, and took it to a very remarkable place where there are three trees, and buried it again very safe; I immediately went straight to Chetrsey; when I came to Chetrsey, I went to an old woman, and enquired for a Justice of the Peace; I went before Mr. Whitaker, the Surry Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then give the same account you have been giving to-day, and afterwards pursue the directions of the Justice? - A. Yes, I told him every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, in consequence of the directions of Mr. Whitaker? - A. I went to Mr. James, the Middlesex Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18020428-48-person341">James</persName>
             that you had before given to Mr. Whitaker? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having given that account, what did you do? - A. Mr. James gave me a shilling to go to a public-house till the time appointed; I went, and the very moment I got to Staines-bridge, the prisoner came up to me, and said, it is rather too soon to go yet, let us wait here a little; He told me, on the very spot where he stood, underneath the Bridge were two watches that he had hid there, that he had got some time back; I asked him if he was ready to go, he said, yes, follow me; I followed him across a field, then he got over a white railing; I saw him stoop down, he took some turf off the ground, and took out a bag; he told me, here it is; I told him, bring it over to me, and as he was getting over, the constable came up to him, and said, you are my prisoner; it was agreed that the constable should be in waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the bag in his hand? - A. Yes; I immediately went over to him, and drew this knife upon him, and told him, if he offered to stir I would cut his head off; I endeavoured to catch hold of the bag, he gave it a bit of a swing, and threw it over into the Thames.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the constable's name Holden? - A. Yes, a little man in a white coat; I saw a boat on the other side, and I called over, over; and then several people came round, one had a gun, and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the boat come over? - A. Yes; and there was a barge coming through the lock, with several people in her, and they came to my assistance; the constable sent him away, and he was taken before Mr. James.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner was apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280036"></xptr>did you hear him say any thing about this? - A. All he said, was, you need not be afraid of me, I shall not run away, I may as well be hanged as shot in the back; when I first saw the prisoner in the morning, he told me there was a quart pot, a pint pot, several table-spoons, several tea-spoons, several tops of pepper-castors, and I believe a pair of tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you where he got these things? - A. He said he had got them not far from the town.</p>
               <p>Q.What town did you understand him to mean? - A.Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mean to sell these things when you should have got them from him? - A. I never meant to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean then? - A. I meant to have him apprehended immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. And with that view you went to the two Justices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the salt-spoon that you dug up? - A. The next morning, after the prisoner was apprehended, I took it out, I found it where I had buried it, the high-constable went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the high-constable? - A. Mr. Slark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adams. Q. What is your name? - A. Barnet Elias.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you another name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were here? - A. I was called here once.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were tried here? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are a hawker and pedlar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of things do you hawk? - A.Shoe-strings, and caps and things.</p>
               <p>Q.Bad shillings -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I object to that.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask such questions, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You know of a reward of sorty pounds, don't you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he tell you how he came by them? - A. He said, he had broke open a house himself, not very far from Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing particular about it? - A. He said it was done the very same morning; he said he broke the window shutters, he wanted to know where I lived, and he would make a gentleman of me in six months; he asked me where I lived, and I told him to ask for the French girl in Tower-court; I did not know-such a place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Stiles.) Q.Were you disturbed in the night at all? - A. I heard a noise, and I pulled my curtain on one side, and I think it was moon-light.</p>

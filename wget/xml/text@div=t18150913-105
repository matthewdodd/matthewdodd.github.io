The prisoner lived with me two years; and, suspecting he had robbed me, I applied to my Lord Mayor for a warrant, to search his lodging, which were in Meeting-house-court. The prisoner was with me at that search, and opened a box by my desire, in which I found six bottles of wine, and various parcels of seed; there was more than twelve pounds altogether; there were some few pound of turnip seed; the cabbage seed cost me four shillings and sixpence a pound; the turnip seed might be worth one shilling; fifteen yards of Osnaburg linen, value fifteen shillings. The prisoner had access to all these things while in my employ. I asked him where he got all these things, and he confessed they were mine, and that he took the wine when Mr. Lucas gave him the cellar key.</p>

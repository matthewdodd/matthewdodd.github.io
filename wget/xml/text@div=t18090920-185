            , The prisoner came into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200082"></xptr>shop for an ounce of cream of tartar, and offered sixpence for it to Swan my apprentice, he put it up to me, I said it was a had one; he put up another and then another, all three which were counterfeits, and afterwards he put up as many as six shillings and sixpence, all counterfeit; I desired Swan to seal it up, and for him to call again on Monday, which he would not do; he had the cream of tartar in his hand; he pulled out twelve shillings. I told Swan to seal the whole up together, as I supposed the whole to be bad; he then was insolent, and appeared as if he was drunk, fell among some bottles of value; I was afraid of their being broken, and when he saw I was determined to send for a constable he attempted to run away.</p>

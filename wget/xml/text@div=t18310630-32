               <p>ROBERT TVRRELL. I am a constable. About a quarter-past nine o'clock I stood at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prisoner in company with another about his own age, following Mr. Biden, and about half way down the church-yard I saw the prisoner attempt his pocket, but he did not succeed - he went a few yards further, and then took the handkerchief from Mr. Biden's pocket; I laid hold of him, took it out of his hand, and his companion ran away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I was passing through St. Paul's church-yard, and saw a boy pick the gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief; I immediately went towards the gentleman intending to inform him, when the boy threw it down - I took it up, and was in the act of giving it to the gentleman, when the officer accused me of taking it; I solemnly protest my innocence.</p>

On Friday, the 3d of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came - I was alone in the shop; he asked me what I would allow him for a seal he had, in exchange for another; he produced a seal on his watch chain. I told him it would not suit us to change, as it was unsaleable; he then went to the shop door, apparently going out, but returned and asked to look at a smaller seal - at that time some ladies were looking at seals; he sat down by my desire, until I could get the seals. I shewed them to him; he selected one for which he was to pay 32 s.; he threw down a card of address, (looks at one) this is it, (read) "

I put it, together with the card into the till, and gave him three sovereigns and 8 s. - he then left the shop, the ladies had left before him. As soon as he left, I took the notes out of the till (not more than two minutes after), there were other notes in a box in the till; that I received from him was separate from any others. I had received no other Bank note before I took it out. I shewed it to a young man named Purdie, our shopman, who was then in the shop. In consequence of what passed between us, I went to the shop door, and saw the prisoner thirty or forty yards off, going towards the City; I overtook him, begged he would excuse me, but he must come back and change the note he had given me; he hesitated, and said he had no more money about him, and that he must go home to his dinner, as it was waiting for him; after a little persuasion, he returned with me. I found Mr. Austin alone in the shop, with the note in his hand - I had left it in the hands of Purdie, I marked it a few minutes after; (looks at one) this is it - it has my initials on the right hand corner - he delivered me the change and the seal.</p>

I attended to them, they did not purchase any thing - the prisoner went out after buying a seal. I heard him ask the price of a seal, the ladies went out before him. On the prisoner going out, Clark shewed me a 5 l. note - I thought it a bad one; he went out after the man, I was out when he returned. I gave the same note to Mr. Austin, about a minute after I had it from Clark. It was not out of my possession till I gave it to Mr. Austin.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Parr of Throgmorton-street. The last witness came for change for a 5 l. note - she did not say from whom she came - I knew she lived at Robinson's (looks at one) this is the note, it has Mr. Robinson, Austin-friars, July 30th. - I gave her a 1 l. note and four sovereigns.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so twenty-three years (looks at the note) this is a forged note - it is neither bank paper or plate; nor is it the signature of W. R. West, there is a cashier of that name, it is something like it, but is not his - the other is forged in every respect; it is signed H. Whiting - there is no such person authorized to sign 5 l. notes; they both appear off the same plate - it is from a plate, the impression of which we have not seen till lately - (note read as in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. EWBANK. Q. At the time the officer shewed me to you, did you say you did not know me - A. I said that was the man that paid me the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>

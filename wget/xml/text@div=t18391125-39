                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live in Little Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the evening of the 12th of November, a few minutes after six o'clock, I was sitting in my kitchen, by the fire-place, with the prisoner's wife, who was living with me—she had separated from her husband, and had lived with me nearly eleven months—I heard a knock at the kitchen door—I said, "Walk in," and the prisoner immediately rushed into the kitchen—Mrs. Levy caught him round the body, to pre<lb></lb>vent his coming in—I attempted to get up from my chair and approach him, and, directly I did so, he struck out his arm, and struck me in the temple with a clasp-knife, which appeared to be ready-drawn for the pur<lb></lb>pose—I had no opportunity of separating him from his wife, for the blow was inflicted the moment I got up—I had not touched him—he struck me over his wife's shoulder—he did it wilfully—it cut me an inch in length, and it bled for about three hours—I was attended by a surgeon—it was rather a deep wound, nearly to the bone—I was ill at the time—I had not been out of bed four hours from an attack of rheumatic fever—I was confined to my house in consequence of the wound—the surgeon attended me a week, both for the fever and the wound—at the time the prisoner struck me he said, "There, you——, take that; and come up stairs, and will give it you again"—he went quietly up stairs, to the iron railing in front of the house—he did not offer to strike me again—there was a light in the kitchen—the prisoner's wife went and fetched a policeman, and I gave him in charge—he had assaulted me before, and was committed from Bow-street on the 20th of August, and cautioned not to molest me again—I suppose it was on account of my living with his wife—she came to live with me voluntarily.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 33.) I took the prisoner into custody—he was standing against the iron railing, outside the prosecutor's house—I saw the prosecutor in the kitchen—he was bleeding from a wound in the forehead—I could not perceive whether it was a deep wound or not from the blood and hair over it—I asked the prisoner no questions—he gave me a knife, and said that was the knife he did it with—it was not bloody—it was a clasp-knife, and was closed—in going along, he said he did it concerning the prosecutor's seducing his wife from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Mr. Holmes enticed my wife away by giving her money—I have been a tenant of his three years and a half—he sent her away while he got me out of the house—he said he would forgive me my rent, and take my things away, if I would go—as soon as he got me away he had my wife and three children back, and they have been living with him ever since—I went by on this day, and heard him playing his fiddle—</p>

               <p>I went down to see if I could get my wife, and, directly 1 went in, he said, "Give me the poker, I will soon drive him up stairs"—my wife said, "Go along up stairs, for God's sake"—they both got hold of me, and pulled me by my collar both ways—I had the knife in my pocket, and I struck him with it.</p>

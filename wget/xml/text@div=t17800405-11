               <p>Mrs. FACEY sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came with another woman into my shop, and asked to look at some lawn. She looked at several pieces. She was a long time stooping down, as if she was buckling her shoe; that raised my suspicion. I saw something about her which made me suspect her. Mr. Cashaw went after her and brought her back. I charged her with stealing something; she denied it. I turned her cloak back, and took the three pieces of lawn from under her arm.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>These pieces of lawn were given to me by the young woman who was in the shop. This gentleman, Mr. Cashaw, saw the young woman give them to me. They charged me, and let her go.</p>
               <p>To Cashaw. How was that? - I called in at Mr. Facey's, and saw Mrs. Facey serving the prisoner and another with some lawn. She was apprehensive when they went out, that they had taken some with them, and desired me to follow them; I did. When they perceived me follow them, one went one way and the other another. The prisoner looking more suspicious than the other, I desired her to go back. I thought she had made a mistake. She went back.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you see the other young woman give the parcel to her, and then stop her and let the other young woman go? - No.</p>

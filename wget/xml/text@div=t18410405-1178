                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Codenham, a porter, and live in Little Wild-street, Drury-lane. On the 24th of March, about three o'clock, I sent my little girl, Mary Ann, to a friend's house in King-street—She had on a tuscan-bonnet—she returned a little after five with<lb></lb>out it—I gave information to the police, but it has not been found—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lavell, a painter, in King-street, Drury-lane. A little before five o'clock, on the 24th of March, I saw the prisoner leading the little girl down King-street—she took it into No. 33—it had a white tuscan bonnet on then, with a piece of blue ribbon—I am sure it was the prosecutor's daughter—I knew the child, and I knew the prisoner before—I afterwards saw the prisoner come through the Sugar Loaf public-house with a white tuscan bonnet with a piece of blue ribbon on it, partly concealed under her shawl—I am sure it was the same bonnet as I had seen on the child—she said to a young person in the parlour, "Here, Jenny, I will give you the bonnet"—she said, "No, I think you have <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> it"—She said, "May the Lord Strike me blind, I had it before I went in for my six months; I left it with a woman named Cooper, and she took the liberty to have it cleaned and altered; I saw it on the child, and I took it off the child's head, and I will give it to you"—directly the prosecutrix came down the street, in<lb></lb>quiring for the bonnet, the girl the prisoner gave it to ran through the Sugar Loaf with it concealed under her arm, and got off with it.</p>

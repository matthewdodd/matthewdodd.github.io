            . I am a constable; on the 14th of August, about three in the afternoon, I saw Cockelwell and Aston in the Poultry, they had something on their shoulders with a blue coat over it; I followed them to the middle of Lombard-street; I took the flap of the coat up, and saw it was lead; I let them go a little farther, then I said where are you going to carry this lead; they said to Aldgate; I said, be sure you carry it there, for if you do not take it to the right place, I shall take you to the Compter, and shewed them my short staff; then they said they had been at work at Mr. Wicks's at Broken-wharf, and they had found it, and it would not come to a pint of beer a man. I desired them to carry it back, they seemed not to be willing; then I said, I shall carry you to the Mansion-house; I got assistance, and put them both in the Compter, and went to Mr. Wicks's the bricklayer, and told him of it; he said he would acquaint the gentleman of it where they were at work; the next morning Mr. Reynolds sent a young man (I suppose his clerk) he desired to have the lead, that he might see if it belonged to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030007"></xptr> I carried it, it appeared to belong to a pump on his premisses; upon our examining it the two men were taken before Sir

            , there one of them confessed that it was Church's coat they had to cover it; Sir William desired Mr. Reynolds and me to go back and bring Church; we saw him facing the Mansion-house, we took and carried him in; I believe Sir William would have admitted one an evidence, but they quarrelled; one said to the other, you did it; the other said, no, you did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Church say?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He denied cutting it off, but did not disown his knowing of it; he said the other two cut it off.</p>

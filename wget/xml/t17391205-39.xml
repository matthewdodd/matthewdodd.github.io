            . I am a Goldsmith: On the 18th of October, about Nine in the Morning, I bought the Spoon of the Prisoner: It was broke in two, just as it is now. I gave him five Shillings and Five-pence an Ounce for it; it came to 10 s. 7d. and I gave him half a Guinea and a Penny. I asked him no Questions, for 'twas broke, and not fit for any Thing, but to melt. I never saw the Prisoner before that time.</p>

            . I am a Servant to Mr. Deane . The Prisoner came to our House, on Wednesday the 17th of October towards Evening, and called for a Drawer. I shewed him into a Room we call the Nag's Head. He bid me bring him half a Pint of Mountain. I drew him the Wine: He drank a a Glass, and then asked me what he had got in the Larder? I told him several different Things, at last he chose a Whiting. It was dressed, but it did not please his Palate, - it was not over and above good, he said; - so he ordered a poached Egg or two, after he had eat about half the Whiting. I was about the House, and was not at the clearing away of the Things, but I can swear the Cup was brought to him with small Beer, and the Spoon, I believe, was carry'd in with the Whiting. When he called to pay, I told him 15 d. He gave me a Guinea, which I changed, and he gave me 3 d. out of 18 d. for myself. When I went in to him, about the Reckoning, I observed him to be writing upon a Piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050019"></xptr> of blotted Paper, and he seemed to lean his Head from me. I won't be too positive to him, but I think: have seen him several Times before. I can swear he had on the same Wig, and as near as I can guess, the same Coat. He was at our House between Five and Ten, and I missed the Things about an Hour and a half after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him whether he is certain he ever saw me before?</p>
               <p>Lord I think I have seen him at the Mitre Tavern, where I served my Time. I told him last Sunday in Newgate, I had seen him there; and he said, to be sure, Sir, you have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him if he was the Person that took the Things away?</p>
               <p>Lord . No: When I took the Reckoning of him the Things were all taken away, and the Table brushed clean. There was nothing then upon it, but a Half-pint Decanter, a Decanter of Water, and a large Water Glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the Person that conveyed the Things away from Mr. Deane's House; and that is the Substance of what I have to say. The Indictment is laid for a Silver Mug, and they swear to a Cup. There, my Lord, is a manifest Distinction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fruchard . Last August was twelve Months, I was in Want of a Book-keeper, and the Prisoner apply'd to me, and told me he came from a Place called Kimlade in Worcestershire , and shew'd me a Recommendatory Letter from a Gentleman of the Law, - one Mr. Massey , of Shessinghurst . I told him, I should be glad to have a Line from that Gentleman, and he accordingly wrote me a Letter, and gave the Prisoner a good Character: So I took him upon Trial, and he behaved with me, in a very decent Manner, and I thought him religious. He continued with me, but a little while, - about six or seven Weeks, for he had wrote an Essay on the Divine Attributes, (which in some Peoples Judgement, was a very good Piece) and other Poetical Pieces; and I found when he should have been about my Books, his Imagination was in the Clouds. This was the only Reason I parted with him. He has received Money for me, and brought it justly to Account. It is a Par-dox to me, that the Author of such Pieces, as he has wrote, should be an Hypocrite. I would have served him since he he went from me, had I not been obliged to tell him; that his Inclination to Poetry would disqualify him from Merchandizing.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Myddleton-square, and am an en<lb></lb>graver. John Walker was in my service as foot-boy, and wore a livery—on the 24th of June, I placed three £10 notes and three £5 notes in a drawer, in my bed-room—I locked the drawer, and went out of town that day—my pupil, George Winter, had a duplicate key of the drawer—I re<lb></lb>turned the following day—the drawer had then been opened, and the notes taken away.</p>

On the 25th of June, between one and two o'clock, Walker and Fletcher came to my shop to purchase a waistcoat—Walker was in livery—they bought the waistcoat, and Walker paid for it with a half-sovereign—there were two watches hung behind my counter—Walker said he should like to purchase them, one for himself and one for his brother—he bought the two for five guineas—he gave me a £10 note—I did not give him change, as I suspected the note—I have not the note now—it was passed two or three days after—the change I have here—Walker said he wanted a coat, and my servant went out to get one, and in the interim, Walker said he must go for his master, Mr. Savory, and he would return in a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, and I have a great coat which I took in of the prisoner at the bar, on the 25th of March near nine o'clock at night; he pawned it for half a crown, he said it was his own; it has been in my possession ever since. (Produced and deposed to by part of the lining of the sleeve being mended.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came out of this yard I owed a little money to my washerwoman, and I went into the stable where the horses stand, and I went in there for my own coat, and I thought that I had it, and owing my washerwoman a little money I carried it to this here pawnbroker, and I did not know but it was my own; I have no witnesses; I have not been brought here only an hour or so.</p>
               <p>Court to Reece. Had he a great coat? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a one as this? - I cannot tell, his horses stood in the same stable, there were twenty horses in that stable.</p>

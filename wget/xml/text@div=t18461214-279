                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Crocus</hi>, which laid at Mill-hole. On the 3rd of Dec. I received 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all in new sovereigns, except four—I went to Mr. Birkett, the Green Dragon, and gave him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I laid all the money down on the counter—I counted out 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Birkett, and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—I put it into my bag, tied it up, put it in my trowsers pocket, and returned at half-past five o'clock to go to New Crane-stairs, to go on board my ship—I met the prisoner Brian close to the landing-place—I went with her to the British Queen public-house in Gravel-lane—we had some gin—I changed a sovereign there—I took it from out of my bag in her presence—I returned the bag into one pocket, and the silver into the other—I went across to Mrs. Freeman's, and saw her—she required 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bed, which the girl paid—I went up stairs, pulled my coat off, went to bed, and fell asleep—Mrs. Freeman did not say anything more to me about money before I went to bed—my bag was in one <hi rend="italic">of my trowser's</hi> pockets, and the silver in the other—I went to sleep with it in that way—I never had my trowsers off, only my hat and coat—when I awoke in the morning I missed my money—I said nothing to Brian about money till the morning—I never saw her any more till the morning—I then said, "Where is the bag?"—she said, "That is all right, Mrs. Freeman has it; do you know what you had in it?"—I said, "Yes, twenty-four sovereigns"—she said, "Oh nonsense, you had but six"—I said, "Oh you villain! you have robbed me"—I put on my coat, and was going to strike her in the bed—she got out, and by that I saw some silver slip from under her pillow—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the pillow back and swept the silver into my hand on the bed, and put it into my pocket—I went down stairs to Mrs. Freeman, and asked for my money—I saw her and her husband run through from one room <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the other—I heard money jingling in the drawer—I said, "Oh you villains! you have my money"—I called out, "Police?" and some persons at the door called out, "Police!"—the police<lb></lb>man came—Mrs. Freeman gave me my bag with six sovereigns in it—I de<lb></lb>livered it <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the policeman—during that time Brian came down stairs and said, "You have not got it all, sir, here is sixpence more; you never paid me anything," and she ran out of the house—I was so agitated at the time that I had not sense to stop her.</p>

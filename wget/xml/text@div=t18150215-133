               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am employed by the Regency Canal Company; I am a <rs id="t18150215-133-deflabel794" type="occupation">miner</rs>

               <p>Q. On the day laid in the indictment, did you watch the prisoner - A. I did not particularly watch him; he left off work about eleven o'clock; I had nothing more for him to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of him afterwards - A. No; I saw the timber that was produced by Parsons, it is very much like our timber.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PARSONS. I am a watchman. On the morning of the 14th of February, about half past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the lane leading from the small-pox hospital to Highgate, he had a piece of timber on his shoulder, and a lanthorn under his arm; I stopped him; I asked him what he had got there; he said, a small piece of timber, that was made no use off; he said, he worked at the Tunnel; I understood him at the Regency Canal; he said, I might have it if I liked; I replied it was no use to me. He offered to give me any thing to release him, I took him to the watchhouse. This is the piece of timber,</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. I am acting manager for the Company. I have the care of these pieces of timber. I believe the piece of timber produced, to be the Company's timber; I cannot swear it.</p>

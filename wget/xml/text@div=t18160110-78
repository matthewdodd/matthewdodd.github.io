            . I keep a shop in Fleet-street. There was an account between Mr. Hopcrot and me, and a ballance due to him of about three guineas. The prisoner called on me to collect this sum, and said he came from Mr. Hopcroft for three pounds, due on a regester stove. I asked him if he had a stamp receipt; he said, no; but if I had a stamp he would write a receipt, and allow me for the stamp. I paid him three one-pound bank notes, and he gave me the halfpence for the stamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint—on 9th November at half-past 8 in the evening, I went to the Carpenters' Arms beer-house, in the New-cut, Lambeth—I saw the male prisoner standing in front of the bar with other men—I pointed him out to Inspector Young, who accompanied me with several others—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Joe</hi>, I have received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint to look after you as an extensive dealer in counterfeit coin; have you any about you?"—he replied, "No"—Young then put his hand into the prisoner's left breeches' pocket, pulled out a packet, and gave it to me—I opened it in his presence and found ten counterfeit florins—I said to the prisoner, "Where do you live I"—he said, "Anywhere"—I said, "Don't trouble yourself; I know where you live"—I put him into a cab and went to 20, America-street, Southwark-bridge-road—when we were at the door—I said to him, "I believe you live here, <hi rend="italic">Joe?"</hi>—he said, Yes; all right, Mr. Brannan"—I went into his front parlour, and found the female prisoner and a little girl—I said to the female prisoner, "Does this man live here?"—she replied, "Yes; he is my husband"—the other officers went into the back parlour, and the first-floor back—I was called up by Inspector Potter, and he gave me two or three little paper packets which I saw him take from the mantel-shelf—there were two crowns, two half-crowns, two florins, and six shillings—he then went to a box which stood by the bed, and handed me out several other packets; three packets containing ten florins each, and five packets containing ten sixpences each, and a little packet con<lb></lb>taining two sixpences, all separately wrapped in paper—he also handed me this bag, containing four pounds and three-quarters weight of white metal—he took that from the box—I also saw him find several watches, a jemmy, and a life-preserver, and other property in the same room—the prisoners were not then present; the female declined to come up, she sent the little girl—I afterwards went down stairs and said to the prisoners, "We have found a number of watches, a large quantity of counterfeit coin, white metal, and other property"—the male prisoner said, "I can account for them watches, and everything you have found in that room—I don't think he has found it convenient to give any account of them since.</p>

I went with the last wit<lb></lb>ness and the prisoner to 20, America-street—the female prisoner was sitting on a chair smoking a long pipe—after searching that room, I said to her, "Which are your bedrooms?"—she said, "The back parlour, and a room on the first-floor"—she went with me to the back parlour; I found nothing there—there was a little girl with her—I then asked</p>

               <p>her to come upstairs to her bedroom—she said, "I shan't go," and sent the little girl with me with a light—I made a search there and found on a shelf three packets which I handed to Mr. Brannan, seven watches, two gold chains, a photograph of the male prisoner, and in a box under the win<lb></lb>dow, I found five other packets, this white metal, and other property, which is all here—I found also some good money in the box; three crown pieces, two half-crowns, and four old penny pieces—on coming down stairs, I told the man that I had found a large quantity of counterfeit coin, watches, and other property—he said, "Didn't you mid any good money?"—I said, "Yes; I found three crown pieces and two half-crowns"—he said, "That is right"—he also asked me how many watches I had found—I told him six—he said, "There ought to be seven"—I afterwards found that there were seven.</p>

               <p>On Monday night the 8th of April, about eight o'clock, the prisoner pushed the shutter of my kitchen window, first one foot then the other, I was looking out of the one pair of stairs window, I saw him come in at the yard, I saw him come to the kitchen window which looks to <placeName id="t17820410-33-crimeloc182">Crown-yard, Cherrytree-alley</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was going home after I had done work, I met an acquaintance, and he asked me to go and do a job, to take a copper out, he thought the funnel must be stopped, I told him I must go back and get my hammer, accordingly I went to get my hammer, and knowing the shutter was but just nailed, it might be the course of a minute or better before I found the hammer, and just as I found it there came a parcel of people hooting and halloing, and a parcel of boys stood on the brick wall, I looked at them some time, after that I came out, and as I was coming on I struck my foot against something which threw the water up; I was at work on the premises, and all our tools were there, I did not think of bringing any body to my character.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was he at work there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Did you know that this was a capital indictment against you? - No, my lord, I understand nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. It is peculiar almost to the crime of burglary, that though no property at all is taken, yet if the house is broke and entered in the night time, with intention to steal or commit any other felony, in that case it is as much a capital offence as if property was stolen.</p>
               <p>Jury. The witness said he never saw him before that night, and then he said he worked there.</p>
               <p>Holmes. He had been at work, not that I saw him, I know there were bricklayers at work, I believe he was one.</p>

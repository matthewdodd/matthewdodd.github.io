            . On the first of March, I was down at the end of Fleet Market, when the Welch gentlemen were going in possession to St. Bride's. I observed the two prisoners were attempting to pick pockets, I kept my eye upon them all the way to Ludgate, and I saw Lane put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand pocket, as he stood to see the procession; and pulled this handkerchief about half way out. The prosecutor turning round, he stood as if unconcerned, gaping about. The prosecutor was earnest in seeing the people come by, then they came close up to him, and surrounded his pocket; then Mullock took his handkerchief quite out, and was putting it into his bosom. They stood together; they immediately made off. I told the gentleman he had lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket, and said, he had, Mr. Kinman seeing it, seized Mullock; I saw him immediately drop the handkerchief; I picked it up; the other ran across the way between two coaches. I seized him, and we took them to the Counter. The prosecutor said, if the handkerchief was his, there was a P on one corner of it, which there was.</p>
               <p>(Produced in Court and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The evidence of Pain was confirmed by Kinman.</p>

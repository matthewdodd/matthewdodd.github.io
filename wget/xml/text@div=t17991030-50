               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You lost one plank of mahogany? - A. Yes, ten feet long, about twenty-four inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. You employ servants in the timber yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or your servants mark your timber? - A. I speak to this from a mark in the grain of the wood, a curve in the grain.</p>
               <p>Q. The next cut to that would of course have the same curve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not your servants have sold that plank from your yard? - A. If they had, it would appear in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. But, in point of fact, might they not have sold that plank? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. No.</p>

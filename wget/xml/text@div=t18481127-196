                  </hi>. I am a colour-manufacturer, of 4, Charles-street, Lam<lb></lb>beth—I have a partner. On 19th Sept. the prisoner called on me, and wished to be shown some samples of colours—I showed him some, and gave him the price for cash—he said, "I am in a very extensive way of business; I want them to reduce to artists' colours; I am an artists' colour-maker; I</p>

I called, and found the house shut up—it was besieged with creditors—I went to Bromley-street, and could not find Turner—I was to call again next day—on 1st Nov. I found the prisoner at 58, Brick-lane—he said, "My name is not Baker, my name is Charles Wat<lb></lb>son; I do not know that I ever saw you before; I have a twin brother, who is so much like me, nobody knows the difference; and you must be careful what you say, or I will make you pay dearly for it"—I said I was certain he was the man—when he saw I was determined, he said, "The whole of it is, I have no money; but if you can take a bill for a month, you may depend on it I will honour it"—I gave him in charge—if I had known he was not an artists' colourman, and did not deal with Barnards', I should not have let him have the goods.</p>

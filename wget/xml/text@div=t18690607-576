               <p>met Ann Smith, and made an inquiry of her—I went with her to the Coach and Hones, near Blackheath Hill—I treated her with some ale—on leaving there we went to the Fountain, Broadway, Deptford, where we had another glass of ale—I saw the prisoner there—the female offered him a glass of ale which I had paid for—I left the Fountain about 1 o'clock, in her company—she took my arm—I believe the prisoner left before us—we walked along for two or three minutes—the prisoner came up with two other men, and said, "What are you doing with my wilful"—he did not wait for an answer, he put his hand round my neck—the other two seized me and threw me down, and after that they kicked me—I had a watch in my pocket, with a gold chain, and two gold keys—the prisoner pulled my watch from inside my waistcoat, with the chain and keys—I had half a sovereign in gold in my pocket, and about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—they took what money I had, and then ran away—the woman stood by, but she did not interfere—I remained on the ground for some time—I was almost insensible—I saw the prisoner the following day at the police-station, with twelve or fifteen others, and I picked him out as the man who attacked me first—I could have picked him out of a thousand—I was as sober as I am now.</p>

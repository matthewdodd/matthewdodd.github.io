                  </hi>. I am watchman to Mr. Arthur McNamara, carrier, of Castle street, Finsbury—I watched the two prisoners on the morning of 28th November—Mackin was in a dark dress—I first saw him about five minutes past 6—he was following two loaded vans of Mr. McNamara's down St Dunstan's-hill, which leads to Billingsgate—he then returned up the hill, and met the third van, which was loaded with herrings—East was driving that van, and I saw him remove himself sideways and shove off the pad—that is a basket of herrings, containing about a hundred or so—Mackin picked it up, and ran alongside of the church, up the steps into Cross-lane—I was following him—he turned round, saw me running after him, and dropped the pad—I picked it up, and lost sight of him—I went to McNa<lb></lb>mara's office, and gave information to the foreman—Mackin was taken in custody by constable 520, about two hours afterwards—I do not know what Mackin is at the market, but I have been engaged to watch him and others—I am quite certain he is the man I saw that morning.</p>

I am traffic manager to Mr. Arthur McNamara—I was with the last witness on the morning of 28th November, and saw Mackin, about five minutes past 6, in Thames-street, at the corner of St. Dunstan's-hill—I did not see him do anything—I saw him pass away, and I went and communicated with Singleton—I recollect East's van driving up—I found one short out of November—I do not know what he fifteen—there ought to have been fifteen pads of herrings in the lot, and there were only fourteen.</p>

On the 17th of August, about two o'clock, I missed these coats and a handkerchief, from behind the door of Mr. Cartwright's house. The handkerchief was in the side pocket of one of the coats. - I saw them again about seven o'clock the same evening; they are my property.</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live in Brunswick-place, near St. John-street-road. I saw the prisoner coming down Market-street on the 17th of August, about three o'clock, with three coats and some keys in his hand; I knew the coats to be Mr. Pennington's, as I had seen him with them - I did not speak, but followed him to Wilderness-row, and took him into a public-house, and sent for an officer. He said a man had employed him to carry them for him to Aldersgate-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I asked him to go with me to the Three Cups inn, to see the person who gave me the coats to carry? Witness. He did say so, and said he was to have the handkerchief for taking the coats.</p>

I met a man in Percival-street, with the rough white coat on, and the others on his arm; he offered me 6 d. to carry them to the Three Cups, Aldersgate-street; I refused - he pulled the handkerchief out of his pocket, and said he would give me that; I consented - he said he should overtake me.</p>

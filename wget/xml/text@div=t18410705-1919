                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Union-street, Hackney-road. On the night of the 26th of June I was in Hackney-road, near St. Tho<lb></lb>mas's-street, a little after ten o'clock—it was not a very clear night, nor yet very dark—I observed a two-wheeled gig coming towards London, and three persons in it—It was drawn by one horse—the prisoner Bryant was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184107050068"></xptr>
               <p>driving, and Nind was on the left-hand side in the gig—Bryant was in the middle, and a person not present was on his right hand—they were coming at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—Bryant sometimes sat for<lb></lb>ward, and sometimes backwards—it was not a very large gig—I saw Nind's hat fall—the gig was pulled up to pick up the hat—somebody walking along picked it up, and gave it to Nind—I was about 200 yards off, on the right-hand side—the gig was going from me—I saw it start again at about the same rate as before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the distance between the hat and gig when it stopped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four yards—they pulled up immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Shortly after they started did you hear a noise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My attention was drawn to a shop window at the time of the accident—I heard a noise, looked round, and a boy bad been run over—this was fifty or a hundred yards after they had started after getting the bat—the gig went on after the accident—I ran after it, and found it stopped by Deering, and the same three persons were in it—Bryant said, "Leave go of the horse, for the horse and chaise are mine"—Deering had hold of the horse at the time—they were detained, and taken back to an apothecary's shop, where the boy was carried.</p>

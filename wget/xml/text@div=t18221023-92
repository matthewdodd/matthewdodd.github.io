On the 4th of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, my coat hung on the cow-house door. I went into my yard, and saw the prisoner taking something up by the door; he came out of the cow-house; I followed and stopped him with a sack under his arm, and asked what he had there; he said nothing but what was his own. I found my coat in it. He said, he was sent for a Mr. Smith's coat. I sent to one Smith who lives near; he had nothing to do with the cow-house.</p>

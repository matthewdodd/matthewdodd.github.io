             The Prisoner was sitting on his Coach-Box in Cornhill, his Coach standing in Rank as usual, when the Deceased came along driving a Whitster's Cart with Linen in it. He could not pass without crossing the Way, and in crossing his Cart-Wheel accidentally brush'd against the hind Wheel of the Prisoner's Coach. The Prisoner damn'd him, came off the Coach-box, and, without any Provocation, struck him three or four Blows, with the last of which he knock'd him down, and he stirred no more.</p>

The Prisoner was sitting on his Coach-box, when the Deceased, with his Cart, cross'd the Way behind him, betwixt his Coach and another, and in passing the Cart Wheel brush'd the hind Wheel of the Prisoner's Coach. The Prisoner came down in a violent Passion, and damning the Deceased, asked him what he meant by it, and struck him 3 or 4 Blows. The Deceas'd held up his Hands, trembling, as if to guard himself, but without once offering to strike the Prisoner, and then turning up the white of his Eyes fell down dead.</p>

The Deceased held up his Hands to save himself, but did not strike one Blow. The Street was pretty clear, and I saw the whole Transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Middleton, Surgeon. At the Desire of some Persons, I open'd the Deceased's Head to see if there was any sign of his receiving his Death by the Fall; but found nothing like it, not the least Mark to give a Suspicion; but on opening the Breast, I found several Contusions in the Thorax, a large Quantity of coagulated Blood, and a great many Vessels broke, which I believe were the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no Malice against the Deceas'd, for I never saw him before. I thought he had broke the Wheel of my Coach; I came down and ask'd him the Reason of it. He gave me gross Language, and struck me first. I drew back, and he follow'd me, and then I made a Stand and struck him again.</p>

            . In crossing the Way, the Cart Wheel hitch'd in, and jamm'd against the Coach-Wheel, and gave it a sort of a Jerk. I saw the Deceased strike, as well as the Prisoner, but don't know how often, or which struck first. But since the Accident, as I was drinking with the Deceased's Brother, he asked me if I would swear that the Deceased struck the Prisoner? I said, Yes; and upon that he gave me a Slap o' the Face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoper. As I was standing at my own Door, I saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner several Blows with as much Vehemence as ever I saw in my Life. The Prisoner retreated, and I thought the Deceased would have been too hard for him, till the last Blow was given, and the Deceased fell over the Channel.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this muslin - A. On Wednesday morning, the 3d of February, about nine o'clock. The prisoner came in and took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. I did. About nine o'clock a young man came into the warehouse; he enquired for a porter's situation. I told him we did not want one. The prisoner came in, and took a bundle of cambric muslin; he ran out with it, and I after him. I pursued the prisoner; he threw the muslins into a box-maker's shop, and when I came back a third person took another bundle of cambric. That man escaped. The prisoner is the man that took the first bundle. I never lost sight of him until he was taken.</p>

            . I am a box-maker. I work at the next door to Mr. Kerry's. I saw the prisoner run by; he threw a parcel into my master's cellar. I looked out, and saw him go up Bucklersbury. The prisoner returned, and run towards the Mansion House. Our apprentice pursued him, and took him in my sight. The young man, Wevill, was not able to pursue him, because there was another person coming out of his house. I saw the prisoner throw the bundle down the cellar, and I saw him taken. He was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I am an apprentice at Hale and Finning's, oliman, in the Poultry. I saw the prisoner throw a parcel out of his arms into the box-maker's cellar. I saw the prisoner run to nearly opposite of our back door, and as soon as the prisoner returned, there was a cry, here is another. I saw the second come out of Mr. Kerry's house. He threw a bundle down in Bucklersbury. I picked it up, and carried it into Mr. Kerry's. I am sure I saw the prisoner throw a bundle down the box-maker's cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it appear that he left that ship - A. Yes. Discharged the 5th of August to the Deptford tender. I have the Deptford tender muster-book: I find him in this book received from the Enterprize the 6th of August, and discharged the same day, and received in the Zealand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him afterwards in the muster-book of the Princess of Orange - A. Yes. This entry shews that he came from the Deptford tender.

He remained on board the Princess of Orange to the 20th of February, when he was discharged and drafted into the Nassau.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the Nassau books - A. February the 21st he was drafted into the Nassau: he there continued to the 6th of May, 1808, and then dies on board the Nassau.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it appear in any of these entries what place this man was a native of; where he was born - A. In Yorkshire; aged twenty-five when he came on board the Nassau. On board the Enterprize it is described, Doncaster, he was born.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. In consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation, I went to the office of Messrs. Grissell and Peto, of York-road, Lambeth, and on Saturday morning, the 24th of Jan., I went with Stevens to the works at the station of the railway at Ponder's-end, which is now about being constructed—I marked every piece of timber that I found on the works—there is a large shed, or warehouse, erected there, and the greatest part of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230073"></xptr>
               <p>the timber was in that shed—I marked from twenty to thirty planks there, from fifteen to twenty feet long—the prisoner James Adams sen., keeps the Railway Tavern public-house, close to these premises—there are some large sticks of timber adjoining the line of the railway on the works—on the night of the 26th of Jan. I was watching from nine till twelve o'clock—between eleven and twelve I saw Arthur Adams come out of the Railway Tavern—he went to a stable on the premises of his brother, James Adams the younger, took a horse out harnessed, took it into a shed, and brought out a cart with the horse—at that time James Adams the younger came out of the tavern and joined him—some conversation took place between them about watering the horse—Arthur then left, and, as he was leaving the horse and cart, James Adams, jan., said to him, "Let us have those deal boards out"—he then put the cart into the shed again, and went into an adjoining building with a candle and lantern, brought out some pieces of wood, and put them into the shed where the cart was placed—Arthur Adams was away at that time—he returned with a pail of water, while James Adams was coming out of the adjoining building with a second bundle of wood—I saw James Adams the elder come out of the Railway at the time that James Adams the younger took the third parcel of wood in the shed—the three prisoners were then altogether in the shed—I then heard a rumbling noise, as if some wood was being put into the cart—the three prisoners came out of the shed together with the cart—they went in front of the Railway Tavern, and there was some conversation, but I do not know what that was—James Adams the elder and Arthur Adams went away with the cart, and James Adams, jun., remained—I gave a signal to a police<lb></lb>officer to stop the cart—I ran on, and got into the cart—I said to James Adams, sen., "What have you got here?"—he made no answer—I com<lb></lb>menced searching the cart, and found in the hind part of it ten pieces of Wood, covered over with sacks, or a horse-cloth, but I did not examine that—it was covered with something—here is one of the ten pieces—it is one that I had marked when it was in the shed that was about being erected on the premises—when I marked it it was from fifteen to twenty feet long—here are two other pieces which are marked—when I marked them they were in the building that is erecting near the line—the shed the timber was taken from that night is at some distance from that building, and is on James Adams the younger's premises—I believe it is a building for the reception of coals—I asked James Adams, sen., where he got this wood from—he said, "From the Railway Tavern"—I took him and Arthur Adams into custody—I returned, and took James Adams, jun.—I told him I had stopped his father and brother with some wood in their possession, and I had come to take him—I searched his house, and found a great quantity of wood, which is here in sacks—I took James Adams, sen., to his house at Cheshunt, and found there a great quantity of wood—as I was conveying James Adams, jun., to the station, he said, "Others ought to be in this as well as me."</p>

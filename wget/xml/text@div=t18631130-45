I took McKenzie on 20th October, at 7 o'clock in the morning, in Allen-street, Camden-town—that is nearly two miles from St. Alban's-place, at the foot of Highgate-hill, where the burglary is said to have been committed—Dunn was with him—I have not a doubt about that, for I spoke to him—McKenzie said that he would sooner die than be taken—I took out my staff, and said that I would split his head—I got assistance—Dunn stepped into the road, and threw the umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at my head, saying, "You may as well take the b—lot"—I took McKenzie to Battersea Police-station, put him in the dock, searched him, and found five silver forks, three silver table-spoons, four dessert-spoons, six tea-spoons, a gravy-spoon, an egg-spoon, two sauce-ladles, a pair of sugar-tongs, a pair of nut-crackers, four pieces of a cruet-stand broken up, a silver thimble and watch, a silver mounted meerschaum pipe, nine sovereigns and a coat—I afterwards went to 7, St. Alban's-villas, and saw marks of corduroy trousers on the water-closet window, which is higher than my head from the ground—it is not possible for a man to get in unassisted—they could get in by one another's shoulders, or a ladder—McKenzie had corduroy trousers on—I saw footmarks on the ground, but there were leaves about, and I could not identify them.</p>

               <p>Alban's-road—on the night of the burglary I fastened up the house at a quarter to 10, leaving the front door on the latch, which could not be opened from the outside without a latch-key—I came down next morning at half-past 6, and found the back door open, and the bottom sash of the water-closet window—it was always left open a little at the top, and was so when I went to bed—there is quite sufficient room between the bars for a person to get in—I found the front door fast as it had been over night.</p>

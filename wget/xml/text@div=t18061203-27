               <p>Q. Tell us the nature of your business - A. The men put the bread on the counter, whoever is behind the counter; me, my daughter, or my wife, we count the bread and write it down on the slate, exactly as we give them; the slate is cleaned every morning, and every morning a fresh account, there is a grove cut in the slate for each journeyman with their names to it. Then he takes them out and delivers them to the customers; after he has counted them over and put them in the basket, and he says all his right.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any bread being put down for Mr. Barret on that day. - A. There was no bread put down to Mr. Barret on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any bread delivered by the prisoner to Mr. Barret, on that day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your books here. - A. Yes, my daughter keeps the books.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You only enter upon your slate the number of each accompt of loaves that are delivered to your journeymen, the whole quantity delivered to each man, then he is to account for each loaf; when he comes back the loaves are called over, and put down in the bread book, and the slate, and the books are examined and called over to see if they tally. - A. Yes, which we did on that day.</p>
               <p>MISS BATH. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is that the book which you keep, and is that your hand writing - A. This is the book for the cash.</p>
               <p>Q. You take all accounts from the prisoner, does there appear upon that book any entry of a loaf sold to Mr. Barret on the 27th of October. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it have been the duty of the prisoner to have given you that account on the 27th of October; and should you have wrote it, if it had been so. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive all the account from the prisoner of all the bread that was taken out on the 27th of October. - A. Yes, all that was on the slate, it is my general practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Dismiss from your mind what your general practice is, and refer to what you did on the 27th. In the first place let me look at that hand writing, on that day; at what time did you receive the account from the prisoner. - A. I did not receive the account from him on the Monday, he had gone out and got tipsy; on Tuesday morning he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has the misfortune, I believe, not to be able to read nor write. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the account that he gave you therefore of course must be from his own memory. - A. Yes; I am very particular in taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. He being tipsy on the Monday, he gave you the account on the morning after the delivery; in the book it appears that he has received payment for about ten or eleven loaves; there appears to be about thirty-one; delivered when he gives you the account, you call over the names, he says I gave three to one person, two to another, and one to such a one, and so all down the list as the names are called over; he tells you the number of loaves to each person, and then he states from what person he received money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He gave you the account on Tuesday when he was sober. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a very correct man. - A. Yes, or else we should have suspected him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, independent of the cash book, whether on the 27th he ever said to you of having delivered a loaf to Mr. Barret. - A. I know he never did.</p>
               <p>Court On Tuesday his account of the loaves delivered on the Monday appeared correct, what he had accounted of, having disposed of to different customers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To those who had paid him, and to those who had them on account. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this account agreed with the slate. - A. Yes, exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call over the name of Barret. - A. Yes, he answered, none.</p>

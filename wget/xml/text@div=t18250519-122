               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was the coach coming in one direction, and the man in another? A. He was crossing; he had an opportunity of seeing the coach some time, but he was an old man. There are five large gas-lights in the dials, which makes it very light - you could see to pick up a pin. I heard nothing said before the Magistrate about it being moon-light. He arose off his seat, sat down, and went on - he would have escaped if he could; he saw what he had done - I do not mean to say that he saw the man.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Bloomsbury-market. I was in the street, heard a coach coming behind me, and an alarm given, but could not distinguish any particular words; I looked round, saw the coach coming towards me at a fast trot, and the deceased on the ground - it was not coming at an uncommon pace; the streets are well lighted: if the coachman was sober and attentive it was quite light enough for him to see a man before his horses. When I first saw the coach he appeared to be in the act of pulling up, and just at that moment he arose, and looked over to where the deceased lay - the wheel had not then gone over him; instead of keeping the reins tight he loosened them; the horses went on, and the wheel went over the man's body; I did not hear him call out to the man: I did not see him attempt to whip his horses - he only loosened the reins, but when he found the coach had gone over him he whipped them, not to be detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At that time of night a man might drive fast at less danger? A. Yes. The street was thin of people; another man was on the box, but the prisoner had the reins.</p>

            . I was in Seven-dials on this night - I heard a screaming, and saw the prisoner get up, and look over his box. I went up to the deceased, who I knew before; he was a sober man, and was sixty-three years old; I had seen him that night a little after ten o'clock, at his daughter's - he was sober. When I got to him the blood was trickling down his face - he never spoke; we took him to a surgeon's in St. Martin's-lane, and then to the Hospital, where he died on the Thursday - he was not at all deaf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know where he was after ten o'clock? A. No. He was not infirm.</p>

            . I am the deceased's daughter; he had been out of work, and was at my house at half-past ten o'clock; he said he was going to look for work, and was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he occasionally drank a little? A. Yes; he said as he laid on the bed that he called out to the coachman.</p>
               <p>MR. TUSON. I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. The deceased was brought there a little after twelve o'clock; I found the wheel of the carriage had passed over his body, and fractured several ribs; he had a wound on each temple: I have no doubt of his dying from that injury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I pulled up as soon as I could; I had a young horse on the off side, which had not been at work for some time. I did not see the man till I was right on him - the wheel went over his body before I could pull up.</p>

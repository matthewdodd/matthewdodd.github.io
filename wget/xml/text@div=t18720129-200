                  </hi>. I am a messenger, of 8, Museum Street—on Sunday night, 7th January, about 5.30, after my tea-time, I was walking along Broad Street, Bloomsbury—I just looked behind me, on my right-hand side, and I saw a young man running as fast as he could by me—he turned sharp round to the left, and tripped me up, and got hold of my watch-chain—he pulled at it, and got it out, and it fell on the kerb-stone—he did nothing to me but pulling at the chain—he tripped me up with his foot, and I fell down on my knee—he ran away—I did not see him again till I saw him at the station—I believe the prisoner to be the person—I saw the side of his face, it was light enough to see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not a very dark night—we were not far from a lamp-post—I had been drinking nothing stronger than tea—this occurred just at the bottom of George Street, on the pavement, near the corner—I said before the Magistrate "I believe the prisoner is the man, but I can't swear it"—I say so now, I only saw the side of his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live at 5, High Street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury—about 5.30, on this evening, I was passing along Bloomsbury—I did not see the prosecutor until he fell on my side—I did not see what caused him to fall—I was looking on the ground at the time—I picked him up, and he said "My watch!" at the same time someone suddenly ran round the corner very quickly—I believe the prisoner to be the man, but I should not like to swear to him, it was done so instantaneously, and he ran round the corner so quickly that I had not a first class view of him—I gave a description of the person to the police—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the police-yard, mixed with eight or nine others, and I picked him out and said I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe him to be the man now, by his appearance and dress—it happened close to the corner, within a foot—I looked straight at him—it did not take a quarter of a second—his back was to<lb></lb>wards me as he ran away—I caught a little view of his face, not a good one, it was in the twilight, not pitch dark—I described him as about 5 ft. 7 in. in height, about eighteen years of age, and dressed in a light coat and black hat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 2). On Sunday night, 7th January, about 5.30, I received information and a description of a man from Mr. Mew, in consequence of which, on the evening of the 8th, I went to No. 3, Church Lane—on entering the house, several persons in the lane called out loudly "Johnny, Johnny"—I went up stairs to a room on the first floor, where the prisoner resided—I found the door open—hearing a noise further up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290014"></xptr>
               <p>stairs, I went up to the second landing, and saw the prisoner crawling through the window—I was unable to get hold of him—I then returned to the street, placed a constable outside, and entered the house No. 5—on going up stairs I heard a scramble before me, and the door close—I entered the top room, and there I found the prisoner—I said "I want you for attempting to steal an old gentleman's watch, in Broad Street, last evening—he said "Me, sir, he is mistaken"—I took him to the station, and placed him in the yard with seven or eight others—I then sent for Mr. Mew, and told him he was going to see some men—after looking at them he pointed out the prisoner, and said he believed he was the one—that was after looking at them a second or so—I found on the prisoner this paper, showing that he had enlisted in the Royal Artillery on that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mew said before he saw the prisoner that he should know him by his dress and age—I don't think he mentioned his face.</p>

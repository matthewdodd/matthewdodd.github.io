On Tuesday night last I went to the stable to feed a horse; I saw a light there - a man ran into the necessary, and either the prisoner or his companion blew out the light; I said I had not got the key of the stable; I turned back and locked the outer door, and said to my fellow-servant, there is somebody in the stable - he said "Mind the place, and I will call my master." I went back, and saw the prisoner and his companion come out of the stable. I said "What do you want there," and tried to stop the prisoner, who got by my companion, but he afterwards pursued and took him in Bow-street - I am quite positive of his person; I went on to the stable, and missed my jacket and overalls, which I wore there at four o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner about eight o'clock last Tuesday night - I found on him eight keys, and two of them locked the stable door - I found one picklock key, a phosphorus box, and this sack.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man, - we got into conversation; he went to the stable and unlocked the door; he said "Just put these keys into your pocket;" he staid some time and I went in; I had not been there long when I heard a noise, - he put the light out, and as soon as this gentlemen was gone he opened the door - I was agitated and ran away.</p>

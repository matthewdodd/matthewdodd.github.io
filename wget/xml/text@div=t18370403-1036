                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Duff, who keeps the Eagle tavern, Camden Town. On the 27th of February, Donovan came for half a pint of porter—my little girl served him—he paid her sixpence—she put it into my hand—I saw it was bad, and asked why he brought such a bad six pence—he said he did not know it was bad, and asked me to let him look at it again—I marked it with my teeth, and gave it him back—about this time I saw Cooke, and in consequence of what I said to him, he went to watch the prisoner.</p>

I happened to be near the Eagle tavern—I saw Donovan go in and come out—Mrs. Duff spoke to me—I followed Donovan to Prebend-street—I saw the other prisoner in that street, and Collinder, who was with me, watched them over the canal bridge—something passed between them—the woman seemed to offer her hand to the man, with something in it—I saw the man turn bad and go into the Fortune of War—I saw him come out—I re<lb></lb>mained</p>

I was with Cooke out<lb></lb>side the Eagle—I saw the prisoners together in Prebend-street—I saw them exchange something from one to another, about thirty or forty yank from the Fortune of War—it seemed that each handed something to the other—I believe the man went into the Fortune of War—I saw him com<lb></lb>ing towards it, but I went to the back of the house, to see whether he tamed up Pratt-street—I went into the Fortune of War, and went after the pri soners—I saw them in company together about three or four yards past Target Cottage, which is Mr. Norcutt's—the man turned back again—I then went into the shop, and communicated with Cooke—I afterwards saw the police-constable take the woman.</p>

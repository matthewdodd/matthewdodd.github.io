                  </hi>. I am porter to Williams and Hatton, shawl-merchants, Regent-circus, Oxford-street; the prisoner was in their employ also. On the 23rd of May, in consequence of suspicion that I entertained, I marked half-a-crown and placed it at the bottom of the partition that inclosed the desk—I placed it on the floor at ten o'clock, and a book was covered over it—I came home at eleven, and went down stairs—I came up stairs again, about a quarter-past eleven, I found the half-crown was gone—the next morn<lb></lb>ing, about half-past six, I informed my employer—the policeman was sent for, and the prisoner given into custody.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of May, at half-past seven o'clock, I was called to Williams and Hatton's shop—they gave the prisoner into custody—I asked if he had any money about him—he said, "No"—I asked if he had in his boxes—he said, "Not a farthing"—I found on his person two keys, and 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I kept the keys till his boxes were brought in from below—I unlocked them—on the top of the first box, after removing a coat, I found this canvas bag, containing two half-crowns, and one shilling—the prisoner asked if I was going to open them—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I don't wish them opened, because there are things there which I don't wish any one to see"—one of the half-crowns is marked—I showed it to the prisoner, and he said he received it the night before about eleven o'clock of a man named George, in Shepherd's-market, in pay<lb></lb>ment for a pair of white trowsers—the boxes contained some very good clothing.</p>

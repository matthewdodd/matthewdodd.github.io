On the 26th of February we changed barracks from Knightsbridge; we were going to the Savoy barracks. I gave a man of the name of Glaney three pints of beer to carry my box to the Savoy; my box contained a regimental coat, a shirt, jacket, and a pair of stockings. About two in the afternoon he put my box down at the White-hart public-house door, Drury-lane. I went in to drink with him. Upon my coming out I missed the box. My box was found the next morning.</p>

            . I belong to the Lyceum theatre. I live in Crown-court, Russell-street. On the 26th of February, a little after eleven o'clock at night, I was going home in this court; I saw a box at the door of a house; I took it home, and gave information to the watchman. On the next day in Brydges-street I saw the owner. I took him to my lodgings and gave him the box.</p>

            . I am a Fishmonger in White-hart-yard, Drury-lane. On the 26th of February, between five and six in the afternoon, I returned home; I was informed that the drummer had lost all his clothes. From information I ran down the street, and saw the prisoner with two drummers jackets in her apron; she was so intoxicated I could get no answer from her. I took the jackets out of her apron, and took them to the public-house in White-hart-yard. I knew the woman by being about the neighbourhood. When I left the woman the drummer boy came up.</p>
               <p>The property produced and indentified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I am charged with. I met a woman, she gave me a glass of gin, and I happened to be in liquor. This woman said, take these things in your lap and I will be after you. I fell down, and was not able to get up again till Mr. Jones came up to me. As for the box, I never saw it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

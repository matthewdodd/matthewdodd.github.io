            . I am a fisherman, and live at Twickenham. I was coming from Teddington church towards Twickenham, and saw a chaise-cart and horse; when it came by me, the horse, I think, took fright at the white tomb stones - I cannot say the prisoner was the driver; he came by me, and hit the horse over the head or neck, by the side of the church, after he had passed the church: I only saw him strike the horse once - he was then two hundred and fifty yards, or more from where the accident happened; he was about twenty yards behind me when I first saw him, and just level with me when he hit the horse - he had got hold of the reins as light as he could hold them.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was then he struck the horse? A. Yes; the horse was going as hard as it could, and he was stopping it as much as he could; I walked on and heard a woman scream out - there were two women there; I ran to the place as fast as I could -

             the horse back before I got up, and came to where the body lay: I lifted the man up, and said he was dead - he said,"Is he by G-d?" I then took him further, put him under the pales, and then none of us could see the prisoner and the cart - it was dark; there were pales on each side, and high trees and wood before us; we could not see his face: I said, "D-n you, you have killed a man" - he then said he was sorry for it, or something, I could not exactly hear what; he asked Turner if he would go up to the village for a doctor to come and take him away - Turner said he could not, for he wanted to get home; the prisoner then asked me - I refused, but gave no reason; I might say he would kill me as well as the man, but they bothered me so before the Grand Jury, I did not know what I said: I do not know whether I said why I would not go - he turned his horse round, and said if we would not go with him, he must be off; I cannot exactly tell what he said - I believe he said he must go, or something, but I really forget his words; it was that he should go and would not stay - that he would be d-d, or something; he would go and seek redress.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150065"></xptr>Q.Who was to seek redress? A. He did not say; I would tell you what it was, if I could think of it - it was if we would not go, he was off, or something; he had asked us to get into the cart, and go with him for a doctor - we refused: I told him he would kill me, or something of that kind - he then went off; I forget what he said - he said we might seek redress, and then we might kiss his *** and be d - d; he went away towards Twickenham, and I went towards Teddington, for a doctor; I have not spoken to the prisoner since - I saw him on the steps of this Court, but no where else; I have not conversed with anybody about this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it a clear or a dark night? A. Quite dark: I never saw the prisoner before - there is an awkward turning by Teddington church, and there are white tomb-stones close to the road; this is not the first horse I have seen startled by them - there are some poles project on the opposite side; he had passed them - he struck the horse to right it back into the road; it was before apparently going out of the road: he did not strike till the horse shyed, and he was pulling it in as hard as he could up to the time I heard the woman scream - the accident happened in a darker part of the road; he could not have seen the man in the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe at what place the man was going before the horse shyed? A. Just at a trot, not very fast.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did it appear to you that he was driving furiously, or endeavouring to recover his horse? A. I think it was to recover it - he was not driving furiously; he was on his right side: the body lay on the left hand, very near the footpath - his feet were about a yard from the path, and his head in the road; the road is about seven feet wide; he was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the prisoner used these abusive terms, you had used abusive language to him? A. I did; it was in answer to our observations; he appeared irritated at what we said; he had asked us both to go for a doctor.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were near the church when he struck the horse? A. Yes; I could see before he started that he was pulling in his horse, and he kept on that way as far as I could see, which was not all the way; the man's head was crushed.</p>

            . I was walking by the deceased, and saw a cart coming; he was crossing the road - the cart came up, and the horse knocked him down; it was galloping very fast: there is a bend in the road; the driver stopped the horse immediately, and turned it back again; I told him he had done murder, and not to ride over the man again: he said the man was not dead yet; two men came up: one of them lifted him up out of the road against the pales; the man in the cart asked them to go with him for assistance - the man said he would not trust himself with him, (he did not say why) he would go himself; he then turned round his cart, and said, "You may seek for recompense, and be d - d, and catch me if you can;" I was much frightened, and did not hear the men say any thing to him before that; the deceased's wife asked his name, but none of us could tell; he was gone then: no questions were put to him about his name - he said nothing about it: I live at Kingston, and went home with my children, who were with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course the people there saw you with your children? A. Yes; I had one in my arms, and one by my side: I took care of the man while they went to look for help; my husband works at the wire business; I sell matches about, but do not beg: when the cart turned back, it appeared to be going very near the spot where the man lay; I told him not to run over him again - it was in the clearest part of the road; there are no trees there, but little pales - they are not high: it was not so late as half-past five o'clock, for I asked the time afterwards; I had a drab cloak on that night, and here it is - I wore it here; I had not heard it mentioned that a person there had a drab cloak on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any other cloak? No- I have no knowledge of the prisoner; I did not hear the other witnesses examined.</p>

            . I am a malster, and live at Teddington. I came up about two minutes after this accident happened; I cannot swear the prisoner is the man who was in the cart: it had gone by me at a great rate before the accident, just on this side Teddington church, galloping as fast as it could - I did not see the driver flog the horse- I did not see him till after he had passed the tombstones; I heard a woman halloo out - they said "For God's sake, Sir, come along as fast as you can;" when I got up, I saw the poor man lying in the road; King came up - we lifted him up, and sat him on the path with his back against the pales; then the prisoner, if it was him, said "Let us proceed to get some assistance - one of you go along with me;" King said "I will see you d - d first - I will not go with you; you will serve me the same," or something: when he found neither of us would go, he turned his horse and said, "Do your best and worst - catch me if you can:" I heard no more ill language; I left the poor man in care of the women, and went away, for I was hurt at seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear King use any bad language to the man? A. What I have said: it was just getting dusk: it appeared to me that the horse had taken fright, and started - there is a sharpish turning by the church-yard, and some white tomb-stones come almost flush on the road, at the corner, and are likely to alarm a shy horse on a dark night; the man seemed to be holding the reins tight: there are several trees on each side, which make it darker.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Carey-street, and am a traveller. On the 19th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in St. James's Park, be<lb></lb>tween Buckingham Palace, and St. James's Palace—there was a man and woman going towards the railings—my attention was attracted to them—a man then came and stood some distance before me, and stared me in the face for about two minutes—the prisoner then came up to me, and said something, but I do not know what—the man then walked away—the prisoner stood quite close to me, and I heard my watch chain snap—I missed my watch from my chain, and accused the prisoner—she gave me my watch instantly, and begged of me to let her go—I called the police—she ran away, and I after her—she went by the Duke of Sutherland's, and into Cleveland-row—I there caught her—she got from my grasp, and got to Pall-Mail—I still followed her on to Crown-court—I did not lose sight of her—a crowd stopped her—the policeman came up—this is my watch—the guard was round my neck—the watch was attached to the swivel, and the ring was cut away.</p>

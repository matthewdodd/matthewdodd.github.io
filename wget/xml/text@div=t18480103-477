                  </hi>. I am a coal-dealer, and live at 4, Great Peter-street, minster—the prisoner is my wife, and lived with me. On the afternoon of 27th Dec. she left home about two o'clock, and returned between eleven and twelve, in liquor—she began with a deal of low blackguard language—I had said nothing to occasion that—there was a quart pewter-pot on the table—she took it up, and struck me on the front part of the head with it—there is a mark there—it bled a great deal, I dare say not less than a quart—my son was in the room, he took the pot from her—I was almost stupid—I went out and called a policeman—I was taken to the hospital, and my head was dressed—I was quite sober—I am quite sure it was the prisoner that struck me—it was not mu son—he is about thirty—he is not quite right in his intellect—I had not struck the prisoner either before or after she struck me, to my knowledge—no doubt I was a little in fault as well as her—I perhaps used language; I do not exactly know, I was stupified—I am sure I did not use abusive language to her or strike her before she struck me—this is the pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. William Hoole and John Lockyer, who keep a coke-warehouse at St. James's Clerkenwell. On the 3rd of April the prisoner came there—I know him—he used to come from Mr. Dundley's, who were customers of ours—he asked me for 2cwt. of iron—I said we had only a hundred weight and a half—he took one bundle of half a cwt. away form the shop, and put it on a truck by the door—as we were going over to the warehouse to fetch some more I asked him whether it was for Mr. Dudley—he said, "Yes"—he had 1 cwt. from the warehouse—he took one bundle away form the warehouse, and afterwards went over to the shop—I followed him, and met him coming out at the door—he said, "It is all right, but I had better go back to fetch an order"—another party took the iron away on the truck—I cannot say whether the prisoner went with him or not, but the pri<lb></lb>soner put it on the truck</p>

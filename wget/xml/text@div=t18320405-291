I am eleven years old; I live with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050117"></xptr>my father and mother, in Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane - I go to school and to church.

               <p>Levy. He said at the examination he would not swear we were the persons, as he only saw the back of them. Witness. No, I did not; I said it was these men - I saw both their faces; I did not go to the prosecutor at first, because I thought I would see where the prisoners went.</p>

               <p>"What shall we look at?" She replied,</p>
               <p>"Some gown pieces." I showed them some; they fixed on one, and told me to cut seven yards off it. Weldon paid me 1 s. deposit, and told me to put it by; she said she was going a little further, and should bring a person with her to look at it, and then speak about a shawl - they were in the shop about half an hour; they returned in about half an hour, and Weldon asked to look at a shawl; I brought them seven to look at; while I was showing them, a lady came in and stood near the shawls, and while I was serving that lady, I saw Weldon put her arm under one shawl which she had spread over the rest, and draw another towards her - Mitchell was sitting by her side; I saw Mitchell jog Weldon with her foot, she did not then take the shawl; the lady went out, and I went to finish serving them. I saw Weldon draw a shawl towards her; Mitchell took it, and concealed it under her clothes; they then asked the price of one; I asked them 20 s., they offered me 18 s., I said I would take 19 s.; I wrapped it up, and counted the shawls over before them; there were then only six; I said there was one missing. Mitchell then got up and said I should search her, and so did the other. I said I knew Mitchell had got it; that I saw Weldon take it, and I would send for an officer. I went round the counter, and beckoned an opposite neighbour to send for an officer - and when I returned, the shawl was laying behind the counter, tumbled, and in different folds to what we fold them; I said one of them had thrown it there; they said they had not; I said I had seen the whole, and would send for an officer; the shawl was lying further from the window than I was; an officer was coming by, and a neighbour called him in; I gave them in charge. Mitchell offered me five shillings not to let her go before a magistrate. I said, I would not compromise the matter. She then offered to pay for the shawl, and Weldon said she would pay for the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not one of these women married? A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed a jog of the foot, while you were serving the lady? A. Yes, and saw her put the shawl under her clothes. These shawls were lying on the counter, and there is a space between where they laid, and the shelves; on my oath, the shawl was not behind the counter before I went round.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it was not there before you served them? A. No, I unpacked seven to shew them; I do not know whether there is a bell in the shop; I have been there seven months.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070038"></xptr>Q. And upon your oath, cannot you tell whether there is a bell in the shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what part of her clothes, did the woman conceal the shaw? A. I do not know; it is a good size.</p>
               <p>Q. Must it not have taken some time for her to conceal it? A. No, but a short time.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Paul, Shadwell. I took the prisoners into custody on the 14th of March; I heard Mitchell say to the last witness, that she would give him five shillings not to send her before the magistrate; and she would have the shawl; Weldon said she would have the gown piece; I took them to the watch-house and searched them; I found on Mitchell, eight shillings and some copper - but nothing on Weldon - nor any goods on them; this is the shawl which was given me by the last witness; I understand that Mitchell, is a married woman with a family - her husband is a respectable man.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WELDON'S Defence. I had nine shillings in my pocket when I went to Mrs. Mitchell's house, and asked her to take care of it till Saturday; I then asked her to go with me to buy a dark gown - we went to the shop - I chose the gown, and left one shilling till I came back; I said to Mrs. Mitchell</p>
               <p>"Would you have this gown?" and I asked her to lend me two shillings, which she did - the gentleman never searched us; nor offered to do so - he said there was no occasion to do so; Mrs. Mitchell offered the officer half a crown to go to her husband; he took the half crown, but did not go.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIRD re-examined. Q. Did this woman send you to her husband? A. Yes, she did - and gave me half-crown for going; I took the money and gave it her back again - she gave me her proper direction; I walked, I suppose, twelve miles for her.</p>
               <p>MITCHELL'S Defence. I took no shawl. I took up my clothes and said, you may search me if you please - but he said,</p>
               <p>"I will not search you - but you b - ch, you shan't run away;" that was the word he said at the door - he sent for an officer, but the officer did not search me; I had 14 s. 9 d. in my pocket - I offered him five shillings not to let me go before a magistrate; and gave him my husband's direction.</p>

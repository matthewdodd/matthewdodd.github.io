               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you known Bonus any time? - I should believe he had been about a year and a half clerk to Mr. Payne.</p>

               <p>Did you make any observation at that time respecting them? - Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Had they any receipt on them? - They had not.</p>

               <p>Did you recommend to him to do any thing with them? - The person who brings them to me to be marked for payment of course carries them afterwards to the treasurer of the customs for payment; this is one of them that I marked.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you made any order on the teller for the payment of a debenture on the 2d of June last? - I did, in consequence of Mr. Mills having marked it; this is one of those that I made the order for; I am clerk under the receiver general.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You seeing what Mr. Mills had done, that was the foundation upon which you made the order? - I could make it no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was the debenture in the condition it is now when you made the order? - I cannot say that, I looked only at what Mr. Mills had done, and I examined it to see that the commissioners names were to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had it the acquittance of the merchant? - Yes, it had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You looked principally to Mills having done right? - No, I looked to several parts; I looked to the commissioners hands, and whether the indorsement corresponded to the commissioners order, seeing that I deemed it all right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But do you pay upon it without an acquittance purporting to be the acquittance of the person receiving the draw-back?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You ask no questions about that, you look at the instrument, if the instrument appears to be regular you then make your order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you take it to be perfect, or ever pay it unless there is an acquittance? - I always ask them to witness it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you, at the time when these debentures were tendered to you for your order, enter into any conversation with the person that produced it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Smith's receipt upon it before you made the order yourself? - Certainly, the acquittance was upon it or else I should never make an order; I make the person who brings it witness it; I was certainly satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you a recollection whether you did or did not more particularly inspect this than the other forty-three? - I looked at them all to see whether they were properly indorsed by the merchant.</p>

               <p>Do you know at what time the prisoner went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are in the house of Messrs. Payne? - I am.</p>
               <p>What time did the prisoner go away? - He was not there after the 30th of July; I did not see him till he was taken, that was in the New Prison; I believe it was about the beginning of September.</p>
               <p>First, as to the hand writing of Mr. Smith, can you only say that it is not like the hand writing of Mr. Smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Bonus was in confidential service with Mr. Payne at this time. - He was his <rs id="t17921031-56-deflabel333" type="occupation">collecting clerk</rs>

               <p>He had the care of many debentures before, and of course of that debenture? - He had.</p>
               <p>He was not called upon to account particularly for this money? - It was always customary that that very day he should come down and make his receipts in our cask books; it is generally known the day he goes there for that purpose, there is no entry in the book; these debentures were in his custody, and he took them himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He was till the end of July in the constant habit of making his appearance? - Yes, there was no particular absence.</p>
               <p>A large sum of money appears to have been paid on these debentures together; does not the house look out for it? - It is a custom to leave it to the settling clerk to get up these debentures, and he applies to Mr. Costin; it is Mr. Bonus's business to look out for the first day in which they might be paid.</p>
               <p>Is it not likewise the custom of the partners to see when the day arrives to receive 1000 l? - No, Sir, the prisoner was the person; it was altogether intrusted to him to do.</p>
               <p>From the commencement of June to the end of July was no enquiry made about these debentures? - That was entirely out of my department; I do not know that any application was made to me.</p>

               <p>Do you think the word Bonus is not his writing? - I do not think that it is, I do not upon my word; it is not so fair a hand as he usually wrote; I never saw him write on parchment, or any of his writing on parchment.</p>

               <p>I knew Mr. Bonus at school, and have known him all that time; I was in the habits of intimacy with him, and I always found his connections were extremely respectable, and himself always regarded; he bore the general character of an honest man; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his hand writing lately.</p>
               <p>Will you be so good to look at that and tell us whether, in your judgment, that is the hand writing of Mr. Bonus? - I do not believe it is, from his general method of signing his name, it was much smaller, and the letters more regular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Not like what you have seen written on paper for honest purposes? - All his purposes were honest that I was concerned with him in.</p>
               <p>Did he use to write the Christian name at length? - Yes, but here it is not at length.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four more witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

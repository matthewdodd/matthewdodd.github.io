Last Friday I was standing at Mr. Day's counting house, at the corner of Love-lane, Eastcheap—I saw the prisoner on the other side of the way take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—I went over and accused him of it, and when I said that, the prisoner said that I tried to rob him of a handkerchief—the police<lb></lb>man came up, and he said he could not settle it; we must go to the station and settle it—the prisoner had the handkerchief on his left side, between his coat and waistcoat—in going along to the station he told me there were</p>

I was on duty in Eastcheap—the last witness called me—he had the prisoner by the collar, and he said he saw him take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—the handker<lb></lb>chief was then in the prisoner's breast between his coat and his waistcoat—when the witness said he had seen the prisoner take the handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, the prisoner turned round and gave the witness in charge for trying to take a handkerchief from him—I took them both down to the station—the prisoner said he lived at No. 3, Coppice-court—I went there, and could not find him.</p>

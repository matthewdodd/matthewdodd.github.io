               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say, that man is so out of his senses, as not to know what he does? - A. Upon my oath, I have seen him in that situation; I have offered his wife a guinea to ask advice for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. A merchant.</p>

               <p>I am a merchant; I have know the prisoner nine years, and upwards, he was always a very honest, fair-dealing, upright man; about a month, or three weeks past, on a Friday, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner and his wife, and a whole mob round him; I went down to see what it was, he wanted to go to Tower-hill to drown himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say this man is so insane that he does not know other people's property from his own? - A. He is very often out of his senses, the whole neighbourhood know it.</p>
               <p>Court. No felon could ever be convicted if such evidence was to be admitted.(The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

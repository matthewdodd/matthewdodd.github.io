            . I am an officer of Bristol. On the 1st of February, about seven in the evening, I apprehended the prisoners at the Three Kings; Oliver was in the parlour - the other two were in the stable, feeding the horses, which were much out of condition, as if they had been rode very hard indeed - Bristol is one hundred and twenty miles from town; the mail arrives about half-past nine in the morning; we have several day coaches come to Bristol - one leaves at seven o'clock in the morning, and gets there at nine at night - Grant saw the horses, and claimed the geldings; Mr. Maides, of Smithfield, came on the Thursday, and another person claimed two more.</p>

On Monday, the 29th of January, I was at the Duke of Wellington with a few friends, and saw Oliver come in - I was in-doors, and did not see whether any body was with him - he said he was tired, and very cold - I asked him to take a glass of ale, which he refused, saying he would have something to eat first - I went home to supper, and returned about half-past eight; Oliver was still there, and had just finished his supper; I went into the tap-room, and staid about an hour - he was in the bar - I went and bade him good night before I left; Simmonds and Giles were bargaining about some dung that evening.</p>

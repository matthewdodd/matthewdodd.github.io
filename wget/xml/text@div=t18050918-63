             took the watch out of my pocket, she said she wanted to see what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she would do with it? - A. She said she would pawn it; I said she should not, she did pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her take the watch out of your pocket, did you take it from her? - A. No, she went out of doors with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run after her? - A. No, I did not think she would pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring you back the money? - A. No, I never saw a farthing of the money; she came back again, and I left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her what she had done with your watch? - A. Yes; she said she had pawned it for ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all pretty good friends? - A. Yes; I went and got the money for some straw that I had sold, and was going home; I was quite sober when I went into their room, and I was quite drunk when I came out, and went to Mr. Randell's, Dean street, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive your money? - A. Yes, of Mr. Randell, in Dean-street, Westminster; he paid me three pounds sixteen shillings and sixpence; he gave me fifteen shillings in halfpence, one shilling and sixpence in silver, and three one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having received that you went on home? - A. Yes, and the girls overtook me in Tothill-street, they went a little way along the Park with me; after they parted from me, I missed the money out of the crown of my hat; then I looked after them, and they were gone out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any body touch your hat while you were with the girls? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- CREEDLAND sworn. - I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of August, did you search the prisoners? - A.Yes; I found nothing but a duplicate of the watch. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Downing's defence. The prosecutor was unloading a cart of straw, he asked me if I would come down and let him in, as I was looking out of my window; I said, yes, if he would give me some money; I came down and let him in, he sent for both beer and gin; he stopped and spent what money he had in his pocket, he said he should like to have something more to eat and drink; he asked me to pawn his watch; I said I would, if he would give me leave; he gave it me to pawn, saying, get me two pounds on it, I said, it will not fetch one quarter of the money; I pawned it for ten shillings, I told the pawnbroker that the person that belonged to it would fetch it out again; I took the prosecutor the duplicate and the money; he gave me some of it, and staid and spent the remainder. He went his way to go home, this young woman and I were going to St. James's market, we lit of him again; we told him, as far as we were going, we would accompany him. We left him and went through Spring-garden gate, and he went towards Kensington; I never saw any more of him till Sunday morning, he came to us then, and said where is my watch? I told him I had pawned it for him; I said, here is the ticket; he said, as you pawned it, I will leave the duplicate with you till I get the money, I shall come to Mr. Randell's before long, and you shall fetch it out; I never saw any thing of the money that he said he lost.</p>
               <p>Price did not say any thing in her defence</p>

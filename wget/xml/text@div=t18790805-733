                  </hi>, M. R.C. S. I am assistant to Dr. Kennedy, of Balham Street, Plaistow—I was called to the police-station on Saturday night, or early on Sunday morning, 12th July, and found Clark suffering from two semi-lacerated wounds on the left side of the head above the ear, with jagged edges and swelling and one or two other bruises—the wounds could be produced by a semi-blunt instrument as a piece of wood coming to a point—that would account for the tumefaction—with a sharp instrument it would have been a clean cut—I dressed, it and advised him to become a patient of the hospital—the wouuds were dangerous, as there is great liability to erysipelas in all scalp wounds in people of advanced years who drink—the caudal covering of the bone was not penetrated—I have not examined his head since, I should think by this time it is healed—he was semi-conscious from the effects of the blow—I did not notice the state of his eyes—it was not produced by a knife edge—the wounds might probably be caused by the sharp edge of the woodwork of the bannisters or by a projecting Wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were two distinct wounds on the bead in the same direction, like repetitions of a blow.</p>

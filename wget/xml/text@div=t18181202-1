I lost two silver spoons, worth 1 l., which had been used the day before - I found them in the possession of Needham. He gave them to me - I produce them - they are mine, and have my initials on them - they are worth 20 s. I saw the window fastened in the course of the day.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 25th of May, about half-past five o'clock, I was passing the prosecutor's house - the kitchen window was then fast. I saw through the railings that there were two silver spoons, in some dirty dishes there; about a quarter of an hour after, I found the staple drawn, and the window forced open - the spoons were gone. Before this I had met the prisoner and another boy coming down the lane, about twenty paces from the prosecutor's house - coming towards it - I said nothing to them. When I found the window broken open, I suspected them. I went in pursuit, and overtook the prisoner in Golden-square, I took him to the watch-house, and found two silver table-spoons on him, which were delivered to Needham.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you see the spoons - A. It is a wooden flap with bars to it - I saw them through the bars.</p>

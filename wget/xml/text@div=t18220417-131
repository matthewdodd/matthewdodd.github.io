            . I am servant to Mr. Dart, who lives next door to the East India House. On Thursday night, the 4th of April, I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and slept down stairs; after I had been asleep, I heard a noise at the area window opposite my bed, it was shut close down when I went to bed; I first heard the noise about half-past twelve, and rose up in bed, but could see nothing, and thought it must be the cats, and about one o'clock I heard a noise again; I rose up again and saw a man on his hands and knees getting in at the window, which was pushed up, the window ledge is two feet two inches broad; he was in all but his feet; I called out Haloo! what is the matter; his answer was,</p>
               <p>"I will let you know what is the matter;" I jumped out of bed, and he retreated; I ran up stairs and alarmed the house, master came down, the man was then gone. The window is about five feet from the bottom of the area. We got two men to assist us, and searched the inside of the house, but could find nobody. We immediately searched the area, looked in the coal cellar, at the left hand was the prisoner standing up with his face close against the wall. We asked how he came there; he said he had no business. I asked how he came in; he said he let himself down at the corner of the area. I am sure it was the same voice as answered me, and said</p>
               <p>"I'll let you know."</p>

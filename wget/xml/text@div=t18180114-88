On the 6th of January the prisoner was at my house; I had to send a person 7l.10s. in change for a cheque. There was four 1l. and one 2l. notes, and 30s. in silver; I put it in my desk, at the farther end of the bar, about nine o'clock in the evening, and missed it about half-past ten; the next day I accused the prisoner with stealing it, and the day after I took him before a magistrate - He was bailed until that day week, during which time he came to my house frequently, as usual; I took a shilling of him the day after, which, I am sure, was one of those I put with the other money-there is a mark like the letter Y on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There were a great many people in the house. There was raffle there. I had not marked the shilling.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 6th of January the prisoner was at our house - He was in the bar that night. I gave my husband 20s. to make up some change (looking at the shilling), I will swear this shilling was one of those I gave him - I had had it a week. The prisoner used to go into the bar sometimes. I always left some person in the bar when I left it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was nearly an hour in the bar after I gave the cheque.</p>

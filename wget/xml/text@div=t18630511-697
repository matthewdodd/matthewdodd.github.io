                  </hi>. I am a gasfitter and bell-hanger, and when this occurred was living at 27, Thomas-street—on 7th April, about half-past 12, or a quarter to 1 at night, I was at the the corner of Broad-street, St. Giles', with my wife and another couple—we were just coming home from Green<lb></lb>wich—we were just turning round the corner when my wife was struck with an umbrella—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—I said, "What did you strike my wife for?"—he said nothing, but gave me a blow in the face, which knocked me down—there were several more men and women with him—when I was on the ground the prisoner and others kicked me several times, and then they all ran away—the prisoner ran away with my hat when he heard my wife scream—he took it from my head—my two friends were on before us, about 100 or 150 yards—they came back when they heard the screams—I got up and looked for my wife—the prisoner then came back when he saw us all quiet, and said he would go and fetch me my cap if I would give him sixpence—I told him I would give him a shilling if he would bring it to me—I knew at that time that he was the man who had struck me, and knocked me down—while he was gone for my cap the policeman came up, and when the prisoner brought the cap back I gave him in charge—nothing else was stolen from me—my wife's brooch and hair-net were taken at the same time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I was with him on 7th April—I had hold of his arm, and we were just turning the corner when I was struck a very severe blow across the face with an old umbrella by a female—my husband asked the parties what they did it for, and he was struck and knocked down directly by the prisoner—while he was on the ground he was kicked very severely by several men, and this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was taken from him by the prisoner—somehow they dropped the cap—I picked it up once, and the woman attacked me, and it was taken from me—I don't know who by—they scratched my face and tore my dress all over—I have it on now—they took my brooch and my hair-net—my clothes were nearly dragged off me, and my hair pulled out—there were about nine of them—we were walking along very quietly, making our way to Oxford-street.</p>

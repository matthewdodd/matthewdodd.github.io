                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard. About nine o'clock on the 22nd of September I was walking through Leadenhall-street—I felt a tug at my coat pocket—I looked over my left boulder, and saw my handkerchief passing from my pocket—I had a lady on my left arm, and I saw the handkerchief passing behind her—the prisoner was endeavouring to pass by the side of the lady—I reached across, and seized him—the handkerchief was then on the ground—I did not see any person but him near it—I held him—he said it was not him that took it—he said, "Here is your handkerchief," and kicked the hand<lb></lb>kerchief to some other boys—the other boys took it up and said, "Here is your handkerchief"—I said, "Thank you," but still held the prisoner—he seized me by the collar, got from me, and ran off—I pursued, and he ran into a policeman's arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had been to the Docks, and was passing this gentleman,—he turned and took me by the collar, and two lads were there—one took the handkerchief up, and gave it to him—he said, "Here is your handker<lb></lb>chief," and the gentleman took it out of his hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was no one on the side that he and the handkerchief were—the others were on the other side of me.</p>

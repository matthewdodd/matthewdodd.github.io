                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my son; we are shipwrights, and live in Mill-street, Bermondsey. I know the prisoners well—on the 8th of May I was entering my yard, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, and saw Hutchins just leaving the yard—he was against the yard gate—he had three or four sheets of metal in his arms—he ran away—the other prisoner was about two yards from him—it was of no use my fol<lb></lb>lowing them—I just went out at the gate—I could not get an officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hutchins. Q.</hi> Why did you not stop me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wish I could, but you was off too quick—you had three sheets of metal, and went off with it—it was Munster patent metal—it is used instead of copper, and had been in the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him with any other metal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know whether any other was taken of my own knowledge—this metal is composed of a portion of copper, zinc, and some other things—the dif<lb></lb>ference of the price between this and copper is 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hutchins. Q.</hi> Was your property weighed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the weight is about 6 1/2lbs. a sheet—you were sideways toward me—you had not the jacket on that you have now—I called to you, and you ran away—my gate is open all day long.</p>

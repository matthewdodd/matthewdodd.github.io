I am the wife of William Tomkins, of 10, Cottage-place, Ship-court, that is about eight or nine doors from Mrs. Dalton's, round the corner—on Monday afternoon, 16th April, about a quarter past 1, I met the prisoner—she asked me for a few lucifers, and she asked me what I and Mrs. Dalton were speaking about on Saturday night—I told her I had</p>

I live at 7, Ship-court, Westminster—on Monday afternoon, 10th April, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Fire!" in Mrs. Dalton's room—I went and broke the window open, and got in, and found the bed on fire—the blanket was burnt or burning—I put it out—the bedstead was alight—I do not think there was any fire in the room—I did not take notice of it, I was confused with the smoke—the bedstead was on one side of the fire, placed about two feet from it—it was a turn-up bed<lb></lb>stead—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw her amongst the crowd when I came out.</p>

               <p>afternoon, 16th April, about half-past 1 o'clock, I was called there—I went into Mrs. Dalton's room, and found the bed very much burnt, also the blanket and the bedstead, and the tick was burnt, and a portion of the flock also—the fire was out when I got there—I found some cinders inside the bed—I produce a portion of them—there was a little fire in the grate, but it was nearly out—I compared the cinders I found in the bed with those in the grate, and they were of the same character—it was what is called cannel coal or coke—it might have been coke from the factory, such as they hawk about the streets—I should think the grate was about two feet, or from that to three feet, from the bed—Mrs. Dalton gave the prisoner into my custody for setting fire to the place—I asked her what she had done with the matches that she had borrowed of Mrs. Tomkins—she said, "I lit my fire with them"—I said, "Come and show me your fire"—I went with her to her room, just opposite, and found the fire laid but not lighted—I said, "You have not used the matches to light your fire; what have you done with them?"—she said, "Oh, I took them into Mrs. Holland's"—I went to Mrs. Holland's room, which is over Mrs. Dalton's, and said, "Where are they?"—she said, "I laid them on the table"—I said, "There are no matches here"—she looked round and saw some on the mantelpiece in a box—the box was nearly full—I said, "Are these the matches Mrs. Tom<lb></lb>kins gave you?"—she said, "Oh no, these are not the ones"—I said, "Well where are they then?"—she said, "In my confusion I do not know what I have done with them"—she was examined at the station, and the female searcher produced 14 matches with blue tips—I picked up two matches in Mrs. Dalton's room, and they were similar ones—one of them had been burnt.</p>

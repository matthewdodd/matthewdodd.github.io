                  </hi>. I live in Baker's-buildings, Liverpool-street—the prisoner came to lodge there about fourteen months ago. I was in the Hospital at the time the lodging was taken—it was taken of my wife, who is now ill in bed, and my daughter—a man lived with the prisoner, who was called Walters—they lived as man and wife—they left about the 7th of January, in the night—I did not go into the room till I had them taken—I then found the room was stripped entirely—I missed the articles stated, which had been let for their use—the looking-glass I have received again from the pawnbroker—the prisoner was apprehended on the 7th of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, and at what time, come to your shop - A. On the 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. Yes, she was in the service of Mr. Cock, a customer of mine. On the 18th of December, about noon, she came; she said, she wanted a large turkey for her master to make a present, and she was going to take it down to the Custom-house to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known her to be actually in the service of Mr. Cock - A. I cannot say. She had left him for a twelve month, as they tell me. I supposed her to be Mr. Cock's <rs id="t18130113-108-deflabel652" type="occupation">servant</rs>

She came the next day for a turkey, two fowls, and four pounds of butter. I delivered that to her, as I thought for Mr. Cock. She came in the evening of the same day for a goose and two rabbits. When she went out of the shop, my man said she was a little drunk. I did not see her afterwards, until I saw her before the magistrate, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Cock since - A. I do not know that I ever saw him in my life. I never knew him. His servant came and paid for what he had.</p>

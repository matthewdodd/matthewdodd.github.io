                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Chalk, a butcher, in Tothill-street, Westminster. On the 17th of November the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a pound of sausages—I weighed them, and she gave me a half-crown—I told her it was bad—she said a young man gave it her, and she went out of the shop—I kept the half-crown, and the sausages—when my husband came home I showed him the half-crown, and then put it on a shelf; and next day I chopped it, with a bad five-shilling-piece and some shillings, but no other half-crown—on the 3rd of December I was in the shop, when the prisoner came in again and asked for half a pound of sausages, which my husband weighed her—I recognised her, and told my husband of it. I am quite certain she is the person who brought the half-crown.</p>

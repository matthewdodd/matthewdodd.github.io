                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Cayley, 43, Pall Mall—I sleep in the basement of the house—on the morning of the 10th January I heard a noise—I went to the front door, and sent a little boy for a con<lb></lb>stable—I then got another constable—I told one to stand at the front door—I went to the back with the other—I then called a Captain McNeal—we examined the back part of the premises, and found the back window open, but the shutters fastened from the inside—the constable forced an entry into the shop—you can't get in the shop from the house—there is a separate entrance—when we got in I found the prisoner crouched down behind the counter—I heard a blow struck and a cry from the prisoner—I think he said, "I am killed"—I found a screwdriver, a knife, a piece of stone to whet knives upon, a bottle with some oil, and a dark lantern—I also found a twelve-foot ladder in the shop.</p>

About twenty-fire minutes to seven I was called to 43, Pall Mall—I found the back parlour had been broken into; the window had been bored about with an auger—I placed a ladder across the area to the window, and pushed the shutters, and they came open—I saw the prisoner in the room and struck him at once—he had something in his hand—we expected to see three or four more; that is what made me hit him on the head—I took him into custody—at the station he pretended to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. About a quarter-past six I was coming down Pall Mall. Two men were standing in front of Mrs. Cayley's door. They asked me if I would carry a parcel, and told me to wait a minute. I waited, they struck a light, I heard a noise, they got into the house and opened the door for me. I went in, and they told me to stop, they would be back directly. I stayed there half an hour, and the policeman opened the shutters, ran in, and struck me on the head. I have been under the doctor ever since. He pulled me down to the station half dead from loss of blood. I don't think I should have stopped there if I was going to do anything wrong.</p>

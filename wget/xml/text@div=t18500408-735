                  </hi>. I am manager of the business of Mrs. Martha Phillips, a tea-dealer. The prisoner was in my employ—it was his duty to receive moneys and to account to me the following morning, and to enter any sums of money he received in the waybill—if he received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 19th Feb. from Mrs. Morgan he has not paid it to me, or any money from Miss Brew—on 5th March here appears on the waybill 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of an amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him what date Miss Brew's account was for, as I could not find it in the book—he said he did not notice, but it was the whole account, and that was all he received—I said I could not find it, and made a minute of it on the waybill, and wished him to go to Miss Brew's, and see what the date of the bill was—he made two or three excuses, that she was engaged or out—I afterwards went, found he had had the money, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He said this was an entire account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did—this is the way-bill of 5th March—this is my writing on it, "Not</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Larby a person introduced by the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had given him instructions that no bill should be taken—the amount of the bill was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought it to me the morning after he took it, and I refused to take it—he then produced the money—he received a com<lb></lb>mission on all the customers he introduced—there would be certain names and amounts on the waybills before he took them out, all those that were to be paid on that day or the day following—if money was received in addition to those amounts, it would be his duty to put them at the bottom of the way-bill—both those accounts of Morgan and Brew's should have been added at the bottom of the waybill—three or four amounts would be the average that would be added to the waybill every day.</p>

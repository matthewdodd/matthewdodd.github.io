                  </hi>. I keep the Three Compasses, in the Wandswortn-road. Wright has been my barman nine weeks—while he was there I found I was doing worse than I had been for a considerable time before, and in con<lb></lb>sequence I employed Spice and Gibbs to watch the premises, and gave them directions—on 28th June, I came home about half-past nine o'clock, and found the prisoners in custody, and I charged them with stealing money from the till—I had noticed Davis come to the bar three or four times a day—I never saw any one but Wright serve her.</p>

In consequence of directions from Mr. Plowman, I watched the premises—at eight o'clock I stood at Vauxhall turnpike-gate—Davis was pointed out to me, and I saw her go into Mr. Plowman's—she stopped there a minute of two, returned, and I followed her to her lodging, 44, George-street—I then returned to the gate again—about ten minutes past nine she came through the gate again, and went to Mr. Plowman's again—I and Gibbs followed her in, and I called for a pint of half-and-half—she called for half a quartern of gin, and put a bottle on the counter—Wright served her, and I saw her put down a shilling from between her finger and thumb—he took it, went to the till, was there a short time, and then put some money into her right hand—she had no money in her hand at the time; I was standing at her right side, close over her shoulder—as soon as she turned round I caught hold of her, told her we were police-constables, and wanted to know what she had—she resisted, and tried to bite my hand—we at last got the money from her—there were two shillings, one</p>

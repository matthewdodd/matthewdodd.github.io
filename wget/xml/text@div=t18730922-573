                  </hi>. I am a barrister of the Temple and Recorder of Margate—I produce an order of reference, dated 22nd February—I took the arbitration on the same day, in one of the rooms of the Guildhall—Mr. George Francis, barrister, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in that action, and he called the prisoner as a witness—he was duly sworn—the first meeting was on 22nd February, and that is the date of the order.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness read the following portions of his notes of the examination of the prisoner, applicable to the assignments of perjury.</hi>—"I paid the men with my own money, if it was not it was some I borrowed from my sister. The defendant never paid me money, but he gave me money on account of labour. I have seen this book before, only once, in Mr. Wood's office; it was not shown to me every week while the work was going on, and the men's wages entered in it. I have seen entries made in a book of the wages of the men, but not in this book. I will swear that this is not the book. When I took the contract I did not ask Mr. Fuller to order the materials in my name that I might stand better with my creditors. On 10th July I left my book and bills with Mr. Fuller. The book was 12 inches long and 5 wide, marble-coloured sides and black back. Fuller did not take the money out of his pocket to pay Pitt. I paid the money out of my own pocket, and Mr. Pitt handed me the receipt. I paid Rosling's account of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I got that note from Mr. Fuller; I believe Mr. Fuller gave me that note; it was not given to me for—the pur<lb></lb>pose of paying Rosling; I told Fuller I was desirous of paying Rosling; it might have been the same morning that I had the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. That 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to me was a note paid for the labour account, it was not given to me for any timber account.")—Those assignments which I have read were unquestion<lb></lb>ably material to the issue that was before me—the first question before me was whether Fuller or Isaacs paid those different accounts, and the labour account, and whether Isaacs paid them with his own money, or money sup<lb></lb>plied by Fuller—it was also material whether he had left the different bills and the account-book at Fuller's house—I produce the award which has been produced, it was against the prisoner on all points, and he was ordered to pay the costs—the award was for the defendant.</p>

I am Mr. Fuller's niece—I was living with him in Decem<lb></lb>ber, 1870, at the White Hart Shades, Reigate—when he wished to build a public-house he had a conversation with Isaacs more than once—Isaacg asked Mr. Fuller to employ him—the first conversation was when the ground was bought, at the end of November, I think—Mr. Fuller said that he did not mind employing him, and paying him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—Isaacs was to employ the men, and Mr. Fuller, was to give him money to pay them—I remember Isaacs asking Mr. Fuller to allow him to buy the things in his own name, so that at any time when he had a job of his own he could get credit—that was the second conversation—he came every Saturday afternoon to our private house for the money, which was regularly paid him, and in the evening he came again with some pieces of paper, and I saw Mr. Fuller make entries in a book in Isaacs' presence, who saw the book every Saturday night—the last time he came to the house was on 26th June—he never left an account-book or any books at our house—I Was present when he came down one evening and asked for the money to pay Mr. Rosling, and Mrs. Fuller gave him a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Mr. Fuller then went with him—it is not true that, at any time, he put any papers or account-books on the table at our house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was on a Monday that he last came to our house, and he was to bring the bills to Mrs. Fuller on the Tuesday—my uncle asked Isaacs about the use of his shop and tools—I may have said before the Arbitrator that all this took place on one occasion, I don't know—I say that Isaacs was never at our house after 26th June—I will swear that he was not there as late as 10th July—I will swear that I did not open the door to him on 10th July, nor did he come in and talk to my uncle and aunt, nor did I draw some ale for him, nor did he bring some accounts and leave them at the house.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>Fuller and Isaacs, between a fortnight and three weeks after Isaacs left—on the morning of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> I saw Beale leave Mr. Fuller's premises shortly after breakfast—he returned shortly afterwards, and Isaacs came very quickly almost upon his heels—Isaacs asked where Mr. Fuller was—I said "Up stairs"—I always received my wages from Isaacs—he used to have a book before him when he paid the wages, and his son was generally by his side—the gold and silver was arranged in two plates on a bench, and he used to hand us the money—on every occasion he paid I saw him enter the amounts in the book—Whye was called <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Whye, and sometimes Old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—it was arranged that Mr. Fuller should send for Mr. Isaacs to dispute certain items in the bill—we were to be called into the room up stairs, and Elsey was to put his hand behind him and turn the key of the door—it was to dispute certain facts—Mr. Fuller had a bill before him relating to building materials and scaffolding—after Isaacs discharged us on the Saturday, Fuller told us to come on Monday after breakfast and he would engage us—we went on Monday, and during that day Mr. Fuller's pro<lb></lb>perty was fetched away from Isaacs's premises, but I did not go there—after we had done at night Mr. Fuller gave us something to drink and began telling us a great deal about Isaacs, and tried to impress upon us that he had been trying to take our bread out of our mouths, and trying to create an ill-feeling between us and Isaacs—I then said to Mr. Fuller, "If such is the case you had better ask where the pair of sashes are"—he asked what I meant; I said "A pair which were made in mistake and left behind on the premises"—next morning Mr. Fuller spoke to me about the sashes and said that he should go and fetch them—he brought them to me next morning and asked me if those were the sashes—I said yes as near as I could tell, and during the week he was continually asking us if we knew of any<lb></lb>thing which was left, and he led us to believe that there were things belonging to Isaacs, and to dispute those facts we were to be locked in a room face to face with Isaacs—the sashes for one of the window frames of Mr. Fuller's house were made on Isaacs's premises and were left behind—I had not seen them and Mr. Fuller led us to believe that Mr. Isaacs had been robbing him—I cannot say whether that was so—the men who made the sashes made one pair too many—when Mr. Fuller brought them down he said "Are these the sashes?"—I said "Where did you get them?"—he said "I went and asked Mr. Isaacs for them"—he put them outside the gate and I brought them away—I believe Elsey is dead—Mr. Isaacs engaged me and paid me, I looked upon Mr. Isaacs as my master—I was two hours in the room when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was, there was a great deal of abuse—Mr. Fuller accused Isaacs of robbing him, and said "I have got your books and I don't care a damn"—just before last Christmas I was sent for to Fuller's house, he said that Isaacs had entered an action against him in the Queen's Bench and he should require me as a witness—I said "I had rather not have anything to do with it"—he said that he should subpoena me—I said "If either of you bring me into it I shall speak the truth"—I was not subpœnaed by Fuller—one Friday night I met Fuller and Whye—Fuller said "Whye, here is Ambrose, now tell old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> all that has passed between you and Isaacs—Fuller then said "You will acknowledge to Isaacs that you knew the door was going to be locked"—I said "Yes"—he said "Did you see me lock the door?"—I said "How could I when you stood on the other side of the room?"—he said "What do you think old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> will swear to?"—I said "I don't know"—he said "Old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> will swear that the lock was out of</p>

               <p>repair, and that he had to take it up to the shop"—Bill said "Yes, I will," and he said "Go and get yourself a drop of ale, and I will come back directly"—I felt disgusted, because I knew it was a most bare-faced lie, and I went home—early in July I saw Fuller again, going into Reigate with Henry Marks—he said "Halloa, Heather, how are you?"—I said "Pretty well"—he came and walked by my side and turned round suddenly and said that I would swear to some of the most bare-faced lies a man had ever uttered—he accused me of being a liar—I said "Mr. Fuller, you know too well the truth of what I swore to"—he said "You swore that I brought you those sashes"—I said "You did, Mr. Fuller"—he called me all the liars he could lay his tongue to, and I said "Mr. Fuller, as long as I have breath in my body or a leg to stand on, I will stand to what I have said."</p>

On the 31st of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, I marked twelve shillings and four sixpences, and put them in the till, went out, leaving him alone, returned in half an hour, and missed four marked shillings, and one sixpence. I desired to see his money, he produced four or five shillings, and I found two of my marked ones among them. He said he had them a week or ten days. I am confident I had marked them that day. I told him four shillings were gone. He said he gave a customer two in change for a half-a-crown. I never marked money before.</p>

            . I came into the prosecutor's shop while he was charging the prisoner with the robbery. The prisoner said it was his own. Arnett said he marked it an hour before. The prisoner said he had them in his pocket eight or ten days. I said that was impossible, for the mark was quite fresh.</p>

I keep the counter at the Pimlico Post-office Buckingham Gate—on the afternoon of 2nd April I saw the prisoner come in, he asked for some stamps and the assistant counterman called to me to come and weigh a coin which I saw was too large and too light to be a sovereign—after it was weighed I told the prisoner that it was a bad sovereign—he said "It is not"—I said "It is"—I tried to break it but did not succeed—I asked him where he got it—he said that he took it for a debt—asked him for the stamps emdash he said that he would give them em to me if I would give him the money—it was a very busy day—I told him I would not give it to him, but I would give him a piece of it, and if he made any disturbance I would send for a policeman and give him in charge—I sent for the postmaster and gave him the coin—I did not mark it, but I can swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 6, Howland-street, Fitz<lb></lb>roy-square—five or six weeks after Christmas, I took a room in the house of the two defendants, No. 17, Clare-court, Drury-lane, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; my daughter was with me—I made the bargain with both the defendants together, at a shop where they sold clothes, in Drury-lane—Mrs. Burnstein took me into the shop—I made the bargain at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week with her, and she took me back to where her husband was—he closed the bargain, and I took it from the Friday—it was there explained again, and they both accepted me—my daughter was with me—I took it on Wednesday, and moved the goods in on Friday—I and my daughter were present when they were moved in—there were seventeen chairs, a pianoforte, seven tables, and a great many other things—the pianoforte would not go up stairs, because the staircase was too narrow—the room was an attic—I saw the things there from time to time for some weeks—there was only a latch to the door, and when I took the room on the Wednesday, I was promised a lock by Mr. and Mrs. Burnstein—I complained to Mrs. Burnstein on the Friday that it was not done, and she said that she had been so busy she had not had time, but it should be done—I last saw the goods there about 24th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200106"></xptr>
               <p>May; they were all safe then—I have spoken to Mrs. Burnstein about the lock half a dozen times, pretty well every time I have been there, and she always said that I was very troublesome, and rather rude in complaining about the lock, and that the things were as safe as if they were under my own eye, for she never went to the top of the house—I said that she might change her servants, and they might not all be honest, but a lock was never put on—about 26th May, I ascertained from my daughter that the things were gone—I went to the house the very next morning, and it was shut up; I could not get in—I went to No. 31, Lambeth-walk—I first went into the shop, and asked the workmen for Mrs. Isaacs, which was the name over the door; she was called down, and the female prisoner came into the parlour—I asked her what made her husband move my things away so far from my residence; the answer was that she had not gone to Australia, that my things were perfectly safe, and I should have them—I said, "Will you please to write a letter?" she said that she could not, because her husband had gone out to buy a horse—I had not said anything about Australia—we asked at what time her husband would be home; she said that it might be five minutes and it might be an hour—I said, "We may meet him"—we went out and met him in the street—I said, "Mr. Burn-stein, if you please I want my furniture; I have seen your wife, she says that she cannot give them up till you come home"—he said, "I do not know you, I have just come from abroad, I never saw you before"—I thought I had really made a mistake, but I watched him into his house; the house which I had been into—when he got in he called, "Jane;" his wife came down, they talked together for a few moments, and I then went in and said, "I hope you will excuse me, but the time gets on, and I have a great many things to move"—the answer was, "What things, we have no things"—I said, "You said I should have them as soon as your husband came in;" she said, "I certainly had a few things which I bought and paid for"—I said, "Bought and paid for! did you ever pay me one farthing?" she said, "No, but the last payment I made was to your daughter, and that was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I never before heard that she had paid my daughter anything—I said that I would bring my daughter on the next day; I did so, and saw Mrs. Burnstein—she said, "I have nothing to say, I have bought the things and paid for them, and if you talk for a fortnight I will say no more"—I had a policeman ready, and as I was rushing up stairs to see if she had the things in the house, she said that she would break my neck if I went up—I went up and said, "That is mine, and that is mine"—the bed was not there then, but when we went the last time there was a bed brought back—I only saw a small portion of the things; I did not see the pianoforte.</p>

I was with her, and assisted in removing the things to No. 17, Clare-court—we asked Mrs. Burnstein how it was that the lock was not done—she said that it should be done—there was a little common latch, just enough to fasten the door—the very last time I was there, which was three days previous to the removal, I asked Mrs. Burnstein if she would make up the account of rent, because we should like to pay her—she said that it was no difference; it could go on for six months, as her rent was paid up to that time—I went there again, three days after they removed, the neigh<lb></lb>bours said it was, and found the house shut up—that must have been 1st or 2nd June—I made inquiries in the neighbourhood, and went and told my mother that they were gone—I did not go with her to the house next day;</p>

            . On the 2d of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I picked the prisoner up by Westminster-abbey; she asked me to go home with her, I said, I had no objection. We went to No. 8, <placeName id="t18210912-173-crimeloc1014">Pye-street</placeName>

I staid there about three hours; she called me - I said I was not going to get up - she left the room. I awoke afterwards, and missed my money from my coat pocket - I gave her 2 s. - I was sober - I live at Knightsbridge. I found I was locked in the room, and could not get out for near an hour, when a girl let me out. I told the landlord of it - he made very light of it. I stopped there till eight o'clock. When I was going out, she came up the street as drunk as possible. I told her I should get a constable - I fetched one, and we met her coming out of the house. I am sure she is the woman, nobody but her was in the room.</p>

            . Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday, the prosecutor fetched me to Pye-street. I saw the prisoner coming out of the house; he said she was the woman. I took her, and found one shilling and some halfpence on her; he said he could swear to one penny piece among them.</p>
               <p>JOB MULCOCK. I know this penny-piece was in my pocket.</p>

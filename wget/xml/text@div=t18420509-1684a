                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Greenwich. On the 10th of January last I was married to the prisoner by license at Stoke Damerel Church, Devonshire. I lived with my mother up to that time at Stoke Damerel—she is a pensioner's wife—lived with the prisoner a week, and then some other woman came and claimed him—I had no money—he con<lb></lb>ducted himself well—it is I that prosecute.</p>

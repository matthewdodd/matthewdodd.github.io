            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of May last, in Bread-street, Cheapside; I told him I wanted him for a robbery - he said he knew nothing of it, and was willing to go any where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I am a weaver by trade. -About four years ago I was a journeyman, and by dint of industry saved a small sum of money, when I set up some looms, and became a small master for myself; as I had not a very extensive connexion, I was obliged to let my goods go to any person that was recommended to me, and by that means I used to sell many silk dresses, and at times I was obliged to barter for other commodities. A Mr. Rogers came to me, who lived in Quaker-street, Spitalfields, and offered to dispose of a silk dress for me, if I had one by me, and as he had done so before, I let him have one, but could not let it go under 1l. 16s., as there were twelve yards at 3s. per yard, and he said he would try and get it for me, as he supposed I had no objection to barter - I said No, providing the goods suited me; I accordingly let him have the dress, making him promise to return it or the money at night, as I was very short of business, it being on the decline at that time - he took it, and in the afternoon returned, said he had sold the dress, and the woman that he sold it to said she had not sufficient money to pay for it, unless he took something in exchange, and he promised to do so, when she showed him several things that was of no use to me; she at length showed him a watch, and wanted 1l. for it, but he objected to allow her so much, as it had no case, but offered to allow her 16s., when the bargain was made, and he brought me the watch and 1l. in money, making together the 1l. 16s. I have a family of four young children, and my wife is expected to be confined with a fifth daily; I was only away fifteen months - I went to Braintree because I could not maintain my wife and family; Tyrrell has known me eighteen or nineteen years.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I have known him about seventeen years - he was a weaver; I always considered him honest till this occurred.</p>

            . I am constable of Bromley. On the 9th of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was sent for to the Bird in Hand, and took the prisoner into custody - the landlord gave me a bundle in the prisoner's presence, which he said he left there, the prisoner acknowledged it - it contained three pair of stockings, a pair of gloves, and other things. He gave no account of them.</p>

            . I keep the Bird in Hand. On the 9th of August, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came with two bundles, he sat down in the taproom, and had some beer; in about an hour and a half he asked if he might leave the bundles while he went down to Bow He returned in about two hours, and took one away; returned afterwards, and sold a pair of sheets out of the other bundle to a man for 9 s. In the course of the afternoon I had information, and gave him in charge with the other bundle.</p>

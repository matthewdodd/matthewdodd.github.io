On Saturday morning, 21st June, I was on duty on Old Oak Common, near Acton—I saw a fire on the, common, and the prisoner by it—to go to it, I had to go down a valley, and up a hill, and when I got to the top of the hill I found a bag and a sheep skin—I then saw another fire in the hedge, and found this tin lid and the remains of a pewter pot in it—I saw the prisoner watching through the, hedge—I stood some minutes, and he saw me, and put on his hat, and went away—I went and took him, and brought him back to the fire—I asked him if he knew anything about the things—he said, "No"—I took him across the common, and gave him to another officer—I said that I was not satisfied, and we went back to where I saw the prisoner first and found the carcase</p>

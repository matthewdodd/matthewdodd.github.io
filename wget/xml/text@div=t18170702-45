On Saturday, the 14th of June, I went to the church in the evening, and left all safe. I keep one key, the curate and sexton have each a key. I went to it again the next morning (Sunday), at half-past nine o'clock, and found the vestry window opened - A pain of glass had been taken out close to the latch, apparently for the purpose of admitting a hand to open it. The iron chest had been forced. I missed seven 1d. loaves, and a pair of black buckles out of the closet over the chest, which had also been forced open-they were my property. I missed two black scarfs out of another chest, belonging to the Rev. Mr. Greenlaw, the lecturer, and a quantity of prayer-books belonging to different persons, and a latin bible, in four volumes.</p>

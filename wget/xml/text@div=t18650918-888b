                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Brown and Sons, 81, High-street, Birmingham—in January of the present year I was in London, managing the business of a person named Benjamin Nicholl in Oxford-street; he was brother-in-law to the prisoner Kelly—I knew a person of the name of Farnham in London in the early part of this year—I have seen him at my shop, 144, Oxford-street—I have seen him with Kelly very often—I know his handwriting—the acceptance to this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Farn<lb></lb>ham's handwriting, and also the signature to this agreement—I never saw Farnham at No. 2, Pancras-lane—I had a conversation with Nicholl in the presence of Kelly about a person named Brewer, who was going to take an office in Pancras-lane, No. 2, I believe—Nicholl said that Mr. Brewer was in their employ in Dean-street, and that he was a worthy and respectable man, and if any inquiries should be made, he should feel obliged if I would state that to any person who might call to make inquiries about him—he said that reference was given to Burgess and Co.—I forget whether it was Nicholl or Kelly said that.</p>

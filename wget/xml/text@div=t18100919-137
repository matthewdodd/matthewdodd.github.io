            . I am a servant to Mr. Teague, keeper of the Compter. In consequence of what Abel told me I met the prisoner in the passage, going out into the street, I told them they must go back with me to Mr. Wright, who was then asleep; I saw him laying on the bench with his right hand breeches pocket completely turned out; I perceived Bailey wish to get rid of something out of her hand, I seized her hand and took out of her hand a one pound bank note, and a one pound Braintree note. I then awoke Mr. Wright and asked him if he had lost any thing, he put his hand in his pocket which had been turned out and said he had been robbed; he described the notes which I had taken from Bailey's hand, Bailey acknowledged that she had taken one note out of his pocket, but the other he gave her; Mr. Wright said, no; I sent for an officer.</p>

My brother keeps the Brown Bear public-house, South-wark Bridge Road—I assist him—on 21st February, about 10.10 in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for three halfpennyworth of hot gin and water, and dropped a sixpence out of his right hand on the counter, to pay for it—I tried it, bent it, and found it bad, and said so—he took it up in his left hand and dropped another out of his right—I told him that was bad also, and I should give him in charge—I sent for a constable, who searched him in the bar—I thought I saw something in his mouth, and suggested we should go into the room to search him—the constable searched him in my presence, but found nothing—I gave the second sixpence to the constable—the prisoner said he had doubts about the sixpence, he was a poor man, and he wanted to get rid of it.</p>

            . I live facing Mr. Fielder's house. On the evening of the 15th of October last, I was at my window between six and seven o'clock; I saw three men walking to and again by Mr. Fielder's house, it was shut up; the lamps were lighted; I saw the men by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark - A. It was not a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light of day remaining when you saw these men - A. Very little; it was getting dark; these men went away and came at different times, the party did.</p>
               <p>Q. How often may you have seen these men pass the door - A. I cannot exactly say; about half a dozen times. They came past and picked up something out of the kennel, one of them did, and throwed it at the kitchen window shutters; two of them came up and one went close to the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. What became of the third - A. I do not know; two of the men came up; one of the men went close to the door and the other, and the other staid behind; they parted again, and the same man who had gone close to the door came up again and went close to the door; he went away again. I went down to Mrs. Dobbings, that lives in my house, I desired her to put out her candle and look out of the window.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house that that Mrs. Greenwell lodges, opposite of Mr. Fielder's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on Monday evening, the 15th of October, Mrs. Greenwell coming down to your room - A. Yes; my candle had been alight above a quarter of an hour; Mrs. Greenwell desired me to put out the candle, I did; I got up and tore my curtain away, and locked through the window, I saw three men walking to and fro Mr. Fielder's door. I did not continue two minutes at my window before I went down stairs; I went to Mr. Brodie's the confectioners in Portland-road, next door to Mr. Fielder's.</p>
               <p>Q. You made some enquiries when you got there - did any body come in while you were there - A. Yes; one of the men that were standing at the corner of the street, he came into the shop, and bought a halfpenny bun.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you say in Mrs. Brodie's shop - A. About three minutes; then I went to Mr. Flatt's next door to Mr. Fielder's; I made some communication to Mr. Flatt. In consequence of what I told him he and I went to Mr. Fielder's door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were at Mr. Fielder's door was it light or dark - A. It wanted about ten minutes to seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. What makes you say ten minutes to seven o'clock - A. That is the time it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any watch or clock - A. No, I had not. It was a little before seven when I went to Mr. Fielder's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Not speaking by any watch or clock - A. I know it was so by the time of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the opinion you form from the darkness or light - A. From the darkness; the lamps were all lit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Now I will ask you whether, supposing the lamps had not been lighted, could you have distinguished the features of any person you met in the street - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mr. Flatt went to Mr. Fielder' what did you do then - A. I knocked very loud at the door, three men rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock more than once - A. I knocked a loud knock, and Mr. Flatt rung the bell before they rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut or open when you knocked at it - A. Shut; I am quite sure of that; three men rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their opening the door - A. Yes, the same as if I was to take hold of the spring lock, and open it myself; I heard the door open. I hit the door such a knock, almost enough to break it open.</p>
               <p>COURT. So that if the door had been open when you knocked you must have perceived it open - A. Yes. There came three men out, the first man had got a bundle, I took it from him, he ran away, and another was behind him, he ran away, and the third, he went to run away, and Mr. Flatt laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that did you - A. Yes. He got away from Mr. Flatt I believe, I did not see that; I afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310016"></xptr>went to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the door of the house when these men rushed out - A. Two men went and took care of the house. One of the men was Mr. Muffin, they went in of their own accord to take care of the house untill the maid came home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What are you - A. I take in washing; I live in the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You were busy this night I suppose - A. I was not very busy. It was Monday night, I sat sewing.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you lighted the candle - A. Yes, it was too dark to see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. It was too dark to see any thing, and that was the reason you had lighted the candle to enable you to see to sew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By your age I should suppose your eye-sight is not very good - A. Yes, my eyes are pretty good.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen no clock, you only guess it was near seven o'clock - You say when you were in the street by the light you could not see the features of any persons face, any other person younger with a better eye-sight might.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say your eye-sight is pretty good - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You took hold of the bundle, and he ran away - A. Yes; he was the first that came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw any other number of men come out - A. Yes, I saw them all three.</p>
               <p>Q. You were engaged in taking this man, you also saw the two others - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. What is become of the bundle - A. I have got it here; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mrs. Greenwell. What became of you after you desired Mrs. Dobbing's to put out her light - A. I went up to my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for desiring her to put out her candle - A. I thought they had noticed me; my fire gave a great light, and I damped it. I did not wish to be observed by them; I did not go out to give any information.</p>
               <p>MR. FLATT. I am a cheesemonger living in Clipstone-street; I live next door to Mr. Fielder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness, Mrs. Dobbings coming to you on the evening of the 15th of October - A. Yes, very near seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with any accuracy about the time - A. I cannot say I took any particular notice, it was about that time; it was before seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop an open shop to the street - A. The shop and door is open to the street; the candles had been lighted in my shop about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information from Mrs. Dobbings did you go out - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out with her was there any remains of twy-light left - A. I did not perceive any; the lamps were all lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lamps had been out do you think you could have discovered the face of any man that passed - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did you go when you went out with Mrs. Dobbing's - A. To Mr. Fielder's door; his door is up one step a large flag-stone; we went to the door; Mrs. Dobbings and me said to ourselves, is the maid at home? She knocked and rang the bell; she gave a loud knock and I rang sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the door was shut or open when Mrs. Dobbings knocked - A. It was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mrs. Dobbings knocking and you ringing, as you described, what happened - A. Three men came out almost instantly; one followed the other as fast as they could, one after the other; I heard the door open and three men came out; two men went off; I catched the third man as he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation whether any thing was done to the two first men - A. No, I cannot say I did; I saw the bundle in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken from the first man - A. I cannot say I did, I was looking at the last man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any bundle with the first man - A. Yes, I did; I did not see what became of that bundle. I catched hold of the third man, he got away from me, I pursued him instantly, he took up Portland-street; Clipstone-street, runs into Portland-street, he took to the left of Portland-street, from Mr. Fielder's. I followed him from fifty to a hundred yards more or less, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that came out of the house that you followed over out of your sight when you followed him - A. No, he ran and I followed him, he fell down a little way up in Portland-street; from the corner he fell, and I fell over him; I was close to his heels, I catched him by the collar and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now who is the man that you catched by the collar and secured - A. The prisoner at the bar,</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. A carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night of the 15th of October - A. Very well, I was going up Clipstone-street. When I got opposite of Mr. Fielder's door, I saw Mr. Flatt, and the prisoner at the bar turning from the flag stones into the street. Mr. Flatt, holloed out, stop thief. I instantly run after the prisoner, and Mr. Flatt not being more than three yards distance from him, I saw the prisoner fall, and Mr. Flatt fell on him, I caught the prisoner by the collar before he arose from the ground, and while running before, the prisoner fell, I heard something fall upon the stones, it made a great sound; immediately the prisoner got up he dropped some skeleton keys, I heard him drop it at his heels. When I had got hold of his collar, they were picked up, before we stirred from the place; they were shewed me after they were picked up; I saw them picked up, and saw what they were at the time, they were skeleton keys, we returned to Mr. Fielder's door, and then we went to the watch-house. As we were going across Portland-place, the prisoner made a stop, he got his hand away from the person of the other side; he dropped another key, I saw the key lay on the stones before it was picked up and heard it fall. In Welbeck-street we were joined by the constable Howard, I delivered the prisoner up to him, he was taken to the watch-house and searched in my presence. I saw the constable take some more keys out of his pocket, and a phial of phosphorus, I believe was taken out of his hand, I did not see that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Perhaps you knew the prisoner in Portland-road - A. No; when I got to the watch-house I said, I had seen his face somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. In Portland-road could you see one man's face from the other - A. Yes, when I was laying hold of him, I could see his face the lamps were pretty well lit up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any more than these last two witnesses have mentioned - A. No, I observed nothing until I heard the cry of stop thief. I run out of my shop immediately, and when I came up, Mr. Flatt had hold of the prisoner, I saw his hand against his coat pocket when he was standing at Mr. Fielder's door, I said, he was pulling something out of his pocket and the moment I observed it and spoke there was something dropped, I picked it up it was this key; then I desired one of my men to lay hold of his arm to prevent him from putting his hand into his pocket, I walked by the side of him down to the watch-house. In going across Woburn-place, another key dropped, I heard it drop, a person picked it up and gave it me momently. I was going along, I heard Howard speak, I knew him and called Howard, he came I saw him searched by Howard, he took a bottle out of his hand some halfpence and silver, and I saw two bags taken out of his pocket with keys in them.</p>

I joined them in Welbeck-street, I took hold of the prisoner and led him to the watch-house, I gave them strict charge not to let him put his hand into his pockets; I perceived him put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and take out this bottle of phosphorus, and out of the same pocket I took out these matches; I took the bottle out of his hand. In his left hand inside coat pocket, I took these six skeleton keys, they were in this bag they are keys for inside doors, I have unlocked several of Mr. Fielder's doors with them. In his outside coat pocket I found this bag and two more keys they are larger skeleton keys; I searched his breeches pocket, I found four dollars, five shillings in silver, and eight pennyworth of halfpence. I went the next morning and opened Mr. Fielder's door with one of these two keys that I took from his outside pocket, this is the key, it locked and unlocked it. I tried two of the small keys which unlocked the bed room doors. After he was secured in the watch-house, I went back with Vaughan this crow was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house did you observe any place forced - A. I did. I believe they call it the book case in the parlour that apparently had been forced with a crow and likewise a store place in the kitchen where they keep soap that had been forced the same way, and in the two pair of stairs back room there was a chest of drawers attempted but not broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did different places in the house exhibit to you that persons had been there endeavouring to break the place open - A. Yes.</p>

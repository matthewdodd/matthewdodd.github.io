I am single, and live at No. 45, King Street, Snow Hill On the 29th of July, I was in Gravel Lane, Southwark, about half past 11 o'clock in the evening—I was going along, and these persons attacked me, Margaret and her mother Johanna, came behind me and dragged off my bonnet and shawl, and knocked me down in the street—they attempted to tear my dress off—I trying to keep it on, they tore the sleeve off—they took my petticoat off, and beat and bruised me very much—I laid hold of Margaret, who had held her hand over my mouth to prevent my crying out—I tried to rise, but Johanna knelt on my chest, and prevented me—I thought to detain Margaret till the police<lb></lb>man came, but while holding her, Mary Ann, I believe, or some one like her, I do not swear to her, but a person who resembled her, came up and kicked me, and bit me, and struck me—I was obliged to let Margaret go—they all got away, and took my bonnet and shawl, and petticoat, my latch key, and bedroom key, a pair of gloves, a pocket handkerchief, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I followed them a few steps—they all ran up a yard—I told the police<lb></lb>man the yard that they ran up—there were some flowers in my bonnet.</p>

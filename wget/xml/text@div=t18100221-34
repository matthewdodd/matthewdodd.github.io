On the 15th of this month, the two prisoners came into my shop together; they asked to look at some prints. We shewed different patterns to Barnett; the other was standing in the middle of the shop. Barnett bought three yards and a half of printed cotton; she was to give eighteen-pence a yard for it; she had it put by for her, and gave one shilling in part of payment. There was one pattern in particular shewed her she said she would not have it a gift. The prisoner Larkin was looking at some buttons, and asking the price of them; she said she would call the next morning; then they went away together. After they were gone, we missed the same pattern that Barnett said she would not have it a gift.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it after they were gone - A. About an hour, there were twenty-five yards of it; it was lying on the counter while Barnett was there; she pushed it of one side with her hand. About an hour after they were gone, we wanted that same piece to shew to a customer; then we found it was gone. I have not found the whole twenty-five yards; it was cut in pieces; I can only swear it is exactly the same pattern.</p>
               <p>- HARRIS. I am an apprentice to Mr. Hill, pawnbroker. On Thursday evening the prisoner Larkin pawned about seven yards of print for 7 s.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended both the prisoners on Friday evening last at the Crown public house, Pie-street, Westminster. Larkin and her husband were sitting together; Larkin asked me if I was looking after him; I told him no, I was looking for the woman sitting by the side of him; I did not know it was his wife at the time. Barnett came in; I said here they are both. They both asked me what I wanted with them; I said if they would go to their lodgings, I would tell them; they both lodged in one house, about three doors off. We went to their lodgings. I asked Larkin, if she did not recollect being at a linen-draper's shop the night before in Tothil-street; she said she had never been in any linen-draper's shop in Tothill-street; I then said, yes you were: and you, Barnet, bought a piece of cotton for which you paid a shilling off; and Larkin had pawned it at Mr. Hill's; she said no, she had not; I said I should take her to Mr. Hill's, and if they did not know her, I should give her no further trouble. She then said she pawned a bit of cotton at Mr. Hill's that the other young woman had given her; I searched Larkin's apartment, and found nothing. Larkin lived in the parlour below, and Barnett up stairs over the parlour, and as soon as Barnett got into her room, I saw her catch this piece of cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210020"></xptr>up; she endeavoured to push it under the bed; I told her this was what I wanted, and I should detain them both. I took it from her; I have had it ever since the next morning; I discovered a piece of the same pattern at Graham and Stocks, pawnbrokers in Stratton-ground. The piece of cotton I took from Barnett was about a yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Emma-street, Hackney—at 1 o'clock on New Year's morning, I heard a noise at the back of my house; I laid in bed a little longer, and then I heard another noise—I got out of bed, and saw a man walking up the yard—he went up as far as the parlour-window, struck a lucifer-match, got the window open, put a bar in at the window, forced the shutter, and got in—I was on the floor above him, nearly opposite—I could see him as I lifted up my window—as soon as I saw who he was, I asked him what he did there—I said, "You thief; you have broken into the house"—he said, looking up at me, "What are you doing up there t"—I said, "I will let you know in half a minute"—he then turned himself round, jumped out of the window again, and made his escape out of the yard gates—that man was the prisoner—I had not known him before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 201). On this night I heard a cry of "Police!" in Emma-street, Hackney, and saw the prisoner running from the back premises of 33, Emma-street, from the yard-gates—he ran a few steps in a stooping position—he then saw me, and walked quietly till I met him—I said, "What is the matter there?"—he said, "I think you are wanted round the corner"—I said, "I think you are wanted round the corner; you had better go back with me"—he resisted, but I took him back—I saw the last witness—he opened the door, and identified the prisoner as being the man who had been in the house—I went to the back, and found this iron bar on the back window-ledge, and a candle lying by the side—the window and shutters were open—the wicket-gate was broken all to pieces—the prisoner said at the police-court:" They can't do anything with us, for we have not stolen anything"—I did not see any one else with him.</p>

I reside at this house that was broken into—about 1 on this morning I was disturbed—I looked out of the window, and heard the lodger ask who was there, and the man ask him what he wanted there—he then disappeared, and I could not get a correct view of his face—I was over the parlour-window, and he was at the side of it—I could not identify the prisoner.</p>

               <p>RATCLIFF LUZMORE. On the 28th of December, about nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18210110-32-crimeloc186">Lemon-row, near White-chapel</placeName>

               <p>"Halloo! don't be frightened, I won't hurt you." He then caught me round the waist, threw me down, and snatched at my watch. I called out - the metal chain broke; it was picked up afterwards, and given to me at the watch-house - he took the chain and ran away. I saw him in custody a quarter of an hour afterwards. There were gas-lights ten yards off. I fell on my back, he stood over me - I am positive he is the man. I had passed the prisoner and three men, who were standing at a public-house door, just under a gaslight, before he stopped me. I am certain of him.</p>

            . On the 2d of December I was coming out of my door in Lemon-row about nine o'clock, and heard the cry of Murder and Stop thief! I saw the prosecutor getting up from the ground, and the prisoner three or four yards off, running away, nobody else was near - I pursued and took him; he fell down. I did not see him do anything.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry, saw the prisoner running, and Bland following him - I seized him. I saw another man run from a shop in the court. I searched the prisoner about ten minutes after, but found nothing on him - a gentleman gave the prosecutor the chain.</p>

On the 27th of January I was very ill, and was up stairs between twelve and one o'clock - I heard a huzzaing, and some person crying out, "Shoes and boots." I looked out at the window, and saw nearly two hundred persons round the house - they kept on crying out, and looking up to me; the prisoners said, "Halloo, mistress, for your shoes and boots;" my shop-window is glazed, and is a plain window - I saw the persons carrying the boots and shoes from my window; I then went down, and the people ran away - there was a great deal of noise and hallooing - one of the party had a flag, and I followed it; I had seen my son go out to try to save a few of the goods - he was struck several times, and had a black eye; I cannot speak to the persons of the prisoners - I lost nine pairs of shoes, two pairs of boots, and an odd boot; I have since seen one of the pairs of shoes, and the odd boot - they were part of the property stolen by the mob.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was in Rosemary-lane; I saw the mob at the prosecutrix's door- I saw Berry take a pair of shoes from her window; he put them under his jacket, and went among the mob - they went on to Ratcliff-cross, and he went with them; I attempted to get among the mob to get him out, but I was beat back twice - I followed them till I got further assistance; I came up and took Berry at Ratcliff-cross, but nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>MARY WHITE. I know this odd boot to be one of those taken from my shop, on the 27th of January, and those shoes are mine which were taken from Ferguson - they had been in my shop that day.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I had the shoes in my hand, which I had picked up in the crowd; I made no resistance - I know the prosecutrix's son was not touched by me, nor any of the mob, that I know of; the officer heard the people say that I picked them up - the word had been mentioned in the Asylum that we would all go to the Admiralty to try to get a ship, and as we came back there was a great loud hallooing; I saw the shoes, and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Ferguson's Defence. I picked up the shoes in the middle of the highway; I was out carrying the flag at the time they were taken - I had not had it five minutes when I was taken; I had a very bad pair of shoes on, and when I took these up I put them on my feet and my old pair in my breast.</p>
               <p>Bond's Defence. On the day before, while I was at the Asylum, a person asked me if I could write; I said Yes - I put down the names of about a dozen who were going to the Admiralty, in the morning, to see if we could get a ship - we went in the morning; they said they could do nothing for us, but told us to go down to Portsmouth or Plymouth; we then came back, and I was taken at Ratcliff-cross.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. I was in a public-house close by the docks - a man came, and asked me if I would go to the Admiralty; as they came back there were several persons pulling down things in Ratcliff-highway - when I got to the cross a person said, "Were you not in the mob?" I said, Yes - he said, "If you go to Denmark-street, the Magistrate will do something for you;" I went there, and then Asher said, "I think I can swear to you;" I had not followed them to the Admiralty - my name is not down.</p>
               <p>JOHN ASHER. I followed him from the highway to Ratcliff-cross - I should have taken him in the highway, but I was driven back by the mob; I am quite clear he is the man I saw take the shoes - I followed him till I got assistance, and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Sergeant's Inn, Fleet-street. The prisoner was in my service last May—I missed a variety of articles—a girl was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to assist the prisoner—in consequence of my loss, I mentioned the circumstances to the prisoner about a month ago—she said she dare say that the girl had put them away, or taken them home to clean—from that time I desired the girl should come no more—last Sunday week I spoke to the prisoner again—I said the things were not produced—I insisted upon having them produced, and said it was all nonsense about their being put away—she then said they were pawned, and produced ten or a dozen duplicates, and said the others were at Mr. Cottrell's—I took these into my possessions—I took her into custody lost Monday—I went to Cottrell's and one of him young men delivered up about thirty things before Sir Chapman Marshall, at Guildhall, I recognised them as what I had lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not take them with the intention of stealing them—I meant to take them out again as soon as possible—I did not know that there was any thing lost—you said, if I gave up the tickets, and you found the things were not lost, you would forgive me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; I said it would be better for her to give the whole history of what she had pawned—she had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, coals and candles—her husband is a respectable man. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS WILLIAM GRATTAN</hi>. I am servant to Mr. Cottrell, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Shoe-lane. I have a piece of carpet, a pair of candlesticks and snuffers and tray, some spoons and other things, pawned by the prisoner at different times—on the 31st of October, the 2nd of December, and at other times—I knew the prisoner—she pawned them in her own name, as living in water-lane—I took in most of these things—I enquired if they were her own property—she said they were her own, several times—she de<lb></lb>cribed her husband as keeping a house in Water-lane—I considered she kept a lodging-house—I have a great many other things.</p>

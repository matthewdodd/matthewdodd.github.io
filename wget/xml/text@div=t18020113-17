             and myself; Mr. Davies and I had the contract together for rebuilding and repairing a large house at Stoke, near Cobham, four miles below Esher; he then went away towards London, for I was anxious to find out where he was going with it; there was about a hundred and a half in one parcel, and about a hundred and a quarter in the other; I followed the cart towards London, and about five o'clock in the evening I went to a house in Crown-street, St. Giles's, and in a fore room of the first floor, I found my servant, James Barry, and Bridget Reading, with one of the bags of lead upon the floor; the other was still in the cart, which was then standing at the door; I had sent a person, of the name of Stapp, to give notice at Bow-street, and they had got there before me; my servant seemed to be quite at home in this house, and though he was in so much affiction, he called for something to drink, as though it was his own home; the prisoner's daughter, about twelve years old, went and fetched him some beer, by the prisoner's desire; there were several articles lying upon the floor, which were not my property; there was a ladle for melting lead or folder; I know the lead to be my property, having been previously marked by both of us at the building.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Evans. I keep the silk department—this roller is one of ours—it is a roller on which the silk was rolled up—we missed silk of this description—the prisoner frequented our shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When will you undertake to state that you saw that green silk on this roller? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the beginning of April—this writting on the roller is a private mark of mine—it means 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made it when the silk came into our possession—I do not know how many people sell silk at our shop—there are two generally, except they are engaged. and then other persons serve—there are about twenty shopmen there altogether—when silks are sold the blocks are put under the counter—they are some—times given away to persons who buy silks, but not very often—I have been with Mr. Evans about nine months—when the prisoner began to come to the shop she came every day or every other day—she always bought and paid for things—I told the magistrate that she came at times when we were not engaged, and I generally served her—she might have come thirty or forty times there before she was taken—I generally served her—I serve any one who comes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been in any difficulty about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There certainly was a statement made by the prisoner to Mr. Evans about this—I was not charged before the magistrate with having participated in this offence, but Mr. Evans informed me of it on the day the prisoner was taken, which was on a Wednesday, about a month ago—I do not know where she was taken—I was not present—during the nine months I was serving Mr. Evans, I had missed some of his goods, and I told him of it—I said nothing about losing any goods with respect to the prisoner—I had no reason to suspect her—I never knew her to buy more than two yards of silk at a time—I never saw her buy this—the roller, silk and all, were missed altogether sometime in the beginning of May, or the latter end of April—she might come eight or nine times to the shop after it was missed, before she was taken—none of the other shopmen who sell silk are here—I never sus<lb></lb>pected the prisoner—she was first suspected about two months ago, or rather more—she came two or three times after that—nothing was said to her about it—she was watched her the last time she came—nothing was taken then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that a person could take silk on such on such a roller as this without your seeing her at times when you were not engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do—she wore a clock, but she must have got the silk off the counter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183607040078"></xptr>
               <p>first—there are persons on both sides in the shop—she generally came early in the morning—there would perhaps he more men then than custom<lb></lb>ers, but there might not be more behind the counter—some of the men are window dressing at that time, and some decorating the shop—I do not see that at that time it would be more likely we should detect a thief than in the middle of the day, when the shop was full of customers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the busy time of the shop comes, are the young men behind the counters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, attending to the customers, and at that time some of them would be near me—the prisoner wore a dark plaid merino cloak—I have seen the cloak since—I had not the least notion who it was that was stealing the goods which from time to time were missing—I regularly informed my master when I missed them—the prisoner usually purchased from one yard and a half to two yards and a half—I have never been to her lodgings or visited her in any way—when I served her she generally asked for coloured silk—when I was serving her I sometimes had to go to some distance and was away from fie to ten minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever ask her that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; it is a general custom in the trade to ask if they are near neighbours—that was the question I put to her—I had no other reason for asking her—the last time she was in the house Mr. Evans said he rather suspected her from coming so often to the house, and I asked her if she could let me have some of her cards, as most likely I could send her some customers—I never knew her name—she said she would let me have a card next time she came—I did not ask for her card before I had this conversation with Mr. Evans—I swear I had no other motive for asking her where she lived but the usual custom of the trade, I never asked her but twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper and silk-mercer, I live in Tot<lb></lb>tenham Court-road. I employed a police-officer to watch, and after some things that took place, I found the prisoner at Mr. Smith's, a pawnbroker in Edgware-road—I asked her what quantity of silk she had robbed me of—she said she had not robbed me—I put the question frequently to her,—I said, "I am certain you have, tell me what quantity you have taken, and where you have pawned them"—I put the question frequently to her, and then she asked me very knowingly, would I promise to forgive her, and she would tell me all about it—I told her I would not promise any thing—I could not promise any thing—from my frequently putting the same question she begged me to shop a little while, and she said the silk she had was given her by a fair young man—I said, "What was his name"—she again said would I forgive her—I said no, I would not—she said, "I know you cannot do any thing to me without I tell you all"—I told her I could not promise any thing, I would not forgive her—in going out she caught me again, and said they were given her by a fair young man, and his name was Mr. Beamand—she did not give any reason why he should give her silks—I then went after the inspector whom I had employed, I think six weeks previous to this and brought him up and gave her in charge I asked her had she given Mr. Beamand any money for the property he had given her—she said, yes she had given sums she had given was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Beam and had several times told me he had missed silks.</p>

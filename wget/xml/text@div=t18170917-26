            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of September I was in Leadenhall-street. About a quarter after nine o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief; I ran up and met the prisoner running towards me in the road; I tried to lay hold of him, he struck me on the head, I struck him on the back and seized him. Just as as I had got hold of him a person came behind and struck me on the nose - I kept my hold; while I was in the act of striking the man the prisoner got away. I pursued, he knocked down a boy-he was stopped. I never lost sight of him. About a quarter before ten o'clock I picked up a broken seal, and the next morning I found the ring near the spot where the robbery was committed.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Christopher Wawn, on board the brig Cumberland. I was in charge of the ship's boat on the 9th of January, at the back of the <placeName id="t18330214-41-crimeloc243">Half Moon public-house, close to the river side, at Wapping</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it not a dark evening? A. Yes; I had not property fastened my boat, the painter was put the through the rails, and she had drifted to a barge about ten yards lower down; when I returned they were taking the candles - I could distinguish their persons; I have always given the same account - I was toying a little in the wash-house with the servant maid of the Half Moon, but I did not know her name; that was before I got the candles - I cannot tell what time I took the candles on board; I did not say I could not tell who took the candles.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Poland Street—on Good Friday I went to Hackney; about seven o'clock that evening I was in the White Lion, standing in front of the bar, I had just put down my glass, and I felt somebody put their hand on my shoulder—I turned and saw Beach with my watch in both his hands; I seized him by the throat, and my arms were pinioned from behind—I tried to take hold of the watch with my left hand, and saw him wrench it off the chain and pass it to some other person—several hands were held out—I could not see the exact hand that took it—I saw Mullineux</p>

               <p>there, and I saw his hand out with others—I held Beach, he bit my finger and struck me over the head.</p>

On Good Friday evening I was in the White Lion—I saw the prosecutor there and the prisoners—I saw Beach put his hand to Mr. Copelin's waistcoat pocket and take his watch—I saw Mr. Copelin catch hold of him—Beach put the watch down by his right into Mullineux's hand, and Mullineux made a rush and got out of the door—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

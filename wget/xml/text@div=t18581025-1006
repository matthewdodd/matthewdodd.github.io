                  </hi>. In May last I was on a visit to a friend of the name of Tritton, who lives at Amersham Park—on returning home I missed a box of jewellery containing twelve articles—Ellen Newson was a servant at my friend's house—I returned to my friend's house four months afterwards—I found she had left—in consequence of some information I went to her house with two policemen—that is about 300 yards from where Mr. Tritton resides; it is called Kent-terrace—I found her there—the policemen searched her box in my presence—there was found in it a gold chain and two lockets, and a cornelian cross with part of the gold top missing—she was taken to the station—whilst I was at the station some other things were brought, which I identified.</p>

I went with the last witness to Ellen Newson—in consequence of something that had been said I after<lb></lb>wards went to the house of the mother, Sarah Newson—I saw the mother there—I asked her if she had a daughter living at Kent-terrace—she said she had not—I said, "Are you sure?"—she said she had a daughter living somewhere in Deptford, but she did not know where—I said, "Have you</p>

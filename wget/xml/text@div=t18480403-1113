                  </hi> I am a rope-maker at Emmett-street, Poplar. The prisoner was in my service—I had been bottling some wine—I heard some one in my cellar, went down, and saw the prisoner come out trying to hide something—I followed her through the kitchen to a come at the side of the house, and told my wife to search her while I examined the wine—ones bottle had been taken, and two empty ones taken out and filled—I went in to the kitchen—the prisoner was there—I accused her o f stealing some wine—she said she had taken it because she had not sufficient beer—my wife demanded the key of the closet—she said, "Mistress, You will find nothing but three bottles of wine"—she gave her the key from her bosom—we went to the water<lb></lb>closet, and found four bottles of wine, two corked and one temporarily corked—I said I should send for the police and search her boxes—she said I should not, without a search-warrant—I went up with her, and the policeman searched her boxes and found one bottle of brandy, two of rum, one of claret and eight of Madeira—she said she and her fellow-servant took them—I</p>

               <p>Court. So then, as you was a Servant in the House, you could go and see what Money he had at any Time? Why, this Gentleman was out it seems every Day, and he always left the Key of his Escrutore in the Window.</p>
               <p>Price. My Lord, he locks up his Room.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, Child, if he always locks up his Room, how do you know that he use to leave the Key of his Escrutore in the Room?</p>

            . My Lord, I have lived in this House, that is, Mrs Rawlins's, since March last, this Woman that keeps the House, is a very unfortunate Woman, and often out of her Senses, and often intoxicated with Liquor; she has often pressed me to buy her Goods, I always refused, and said I would not do it unless she would bring her Friends; her Sister in Tavistock street with her Friends, they desired I would take these Goods into my own Hands. I have advanced some little Matters from Time to Time merely out of Compassion to her, and I have supported her from my own Table. About the 22d of October, a Lawyer and the Prisoner (Goff) comes to the House, pretending to have an Execution; the Lawyer comes bullying into the the House, Sir, says he, if you will give me to much Money, you shall have these Goods, for I have an Execution, and I have brought an Appraiser. Though he had no Execution, yet be disturbed and frightened us; he rushes in with these Prisoners, and demands the Goods away; he came in in the most audacious Manner with inexcreable Oaths, the Woman, Mrs Rawlins, comes to me and says, for the Sake of God release me out of the Hands of these Villains! He says to her, You old B - h I spoke to God Almighty this Morning, and he said he never made you. I never heard such Profaneness in all my Life; at last, Sir, says he, pay me 20 l. and you shall have the Goods; upon this the Woman begged and prayed, and said, these are a Pack of Thieves and Rogues; says she, for God's Sake take the Goods, and pay their Demands; I paid him five Guineas, and Goff (the Prisoner) started up and said, I must have three Guineas, she owes me three Guineas in going of Errands for her, &amp;c. She hauls out and said, he is a Rogue, and has lived upon me, and I do not owe him any thing. After the Lawyer had made a Bill of Sale to me, and I had paid Part of the Money, we went abroad to spend the Day; upon our Return, Goff and Oldfield (the Prisoners) had taken Possession of the House, and swearing I should not come in, unless I would pay them 15 l. I applied to the Civil Magistrate, I got a Warrant; the Constable said, you had as good go to the Officer of the Guard, and get a File of Musqueteers, which I did, and forced open the Street door, and these two Fellows (the Prisoners) bounced out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050039"></xptr> my Bed, I went up Stairs, and I saw Mr Storaca's Door broke open, and he said he had lost six Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. to - . Are you an Attorney?</p>
               <p>- . Yes; Mr M Allester sent for me, in order to advise with me what to do upon the Lawyer's coming in the Manner he has represented it; I, in the first Place, advised him to have nothing to do with it. but Mrs Rawlins advised him to take it upon himself; upon which there was an Agreement made: But besides the Money that the Lawyer had paid on Mrs Rawlins's Account, he set up another Demand for Business done. I asked him for a Bill, but he said he would lump it, and did behave, I must own, in a most extraordinary Way that ever I saw in my Life. At the same Time these Things were executed, the Key was delivered by the Lawyer to Mr Mc Allester, by Mrs Rawlins's Direction.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Lawyer. How came all this seizing of Goods?</p>
               <p>Lawyer. Mrs Rawlins applied to me some Time before October last, in order to sue Mr Mc Allester and Storaca, she said she was in barbarous Hands, several Times she had applied to Mr Mc Allester, and he said he could not pay her. This Mr Mc Allester pretends to say, that he is an Attorney, I said to him, do not enter into a Law-suit; I sent to him to come to me, he came to my Apartment, and he said to me, pray do not distress me; I said any Time before Term would do for me. Says Mrs Rawlins, I am very uneasy Mc Allester shuffles with me, I am under some Danger of their moving some of their Goods, and it appeared that they had moved off some of them; upon that, the Goods were to be appraised, and I was to advance some Money to pay her Landlord; upon that, the 17th of October, they were appraised ( Mr Mc Allester thinking himself greatly injured, that he should lose his Character in England, as well as he had in Ireland) the Landlord came and seized on Saturday Night, this Mr Goff, the Prisoner at the Bar, was sent to me by the Direction of Mrs Rawlins, and told me the Goods were seized; accordingly, on the Evening of that Day, on the 19th I believe it was, I paid the Rent and Charges of that Distress, which came to 14 l. 7 s. 10 d. besides other Charges, as eating and drinking at the Hollander, Carlisle street; accordingly I paid it, and took the Men out of the Possession. Mrs Rawlins came to me the Monday following, says she, Mr Mc Allester has not paid me; I wrote a Letter to him, and told him if he did not pay the Money, I would sue him; then he told me he had a Receipt in full of Mrs Rawlins, I went and asked Mrs Rawlins, and she said she did not give him a Receipt in full; I said, knowing the Person, it might be of bad Consequences and Arrest, Mrs Rawlins said he has paid me but one Guinea, and I have not given him a Receipt in full.</p>
               <p>Court. I want to know why the 22d of October, when you was to receive the Money for the Arrest, you put these People into Possession? Why, after this Agreement that was made, did these two Men go in and nail up the Doors again? To this there was no satisfactory Answer given. This Gentleman hath said a very strange Expression against this poor Woman. You seem, Sir, to have great Choice of Words, I desire you would not make use of such any more. It is grieving to see such Oppression to those that cannot help themselves. Whether Mc Allester or the Lawyer was most her Friend, or whether it would not have been better for her if she had not been acquainted with either of them. And here is two poor Fellows at the Bar, now stand tried for their Lives, when this House was in a Tumult for a Week together, and no Evidence brought against them.</p>

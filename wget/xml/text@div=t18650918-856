                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 696). On 19th August, about a quarter past one in the morning, I was on duty in Broad-street, Ratcliff—I saw the prisoner lying against a door, apparently asleep—I saw a common clasp knife lying by his side, shut—I took hold of his arm and asked him to get up—he said b——if he would—I then said, "What does this knife mean lying by your side?"—he said, "b——what is that to you"—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Get</hi> up and <hi rend="italic">go away home</hi>, you might get robbed"—he then got up and crossed over the road, and then swore again—I found it was no use talking to him any longer, and I said, "If you don't go away now, I shall take you into custody"—he said b——if he would—I then took him into custody—he commenced kicking and struggling—I seized him by the collar—he said several times, "You b——will you let go?"—I said, "No, you are in my custody; I shan't leave you now till I get you to the station"—we then proceeded on for some considerable distance, when all of a sudden he said, "Now you b——will you let me go," and struck me with his right fist on the left side of my head, and knocked me down—I pulled him down on me, and held him till Sharp and Sergeant Procter came to my assistance—I felt as if I was stunned by the blow and the blood flew all down my neck—Procter said to me, "Go to the station, you are stabbed"—I saw Sharp endeavour to take the knife out of the prisoner's hand (it was the same knife that I had seen lying on the pavement)—it was shut, he could not open the prisoner's hand to get it, and was obliged to hit him across the hand with his staff—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) there is blood on it now—I went to the station and had my wound dressed—I have been under the doctor's hands ever since, and have not done a day's duty—the prisoner was drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you first saw him he was lying asleep, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Apparently asleep; it did not take much to wake him—his eyes were closed—I touched him by the arm and he awoke directly—I have since heard that he is a sailor—we are not allowed to let persons sleep in the street at that hour of <hi rend="italic">the night</hi>—I should not have taken him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the station, if he had got up and gone away—I did not notice that his pockets had been turned inside out—he said at the station that he had been robbed—no money was found on him—I saw him put the knife in his pocket after he got up and crossed the road—I did not see him take it out again—when the constable took it from him it was shut—he did not say, "I have been robbed, and you must be a set of roguish b——s"—he did not accuse me of putting <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands into his pockets—I did not whistle <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the other con-stable, or spring my rattle, he came up a turning opposite—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner by the arm to secure him—I did not give him the professional twist—I know what you mean—I did not twist his arm round mine—he did not say, "Let go my arm, you are breaking it"—nor, "If you don't let go I will strike you"—I fell with the blow, and he fell with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 306). On the morning of 19th August, I was on duty in Broad-street, Ratcliff, and saw the prisoner in Stretch's custody—I went to his assistance, turned my light on, and asked what was the matter—Stretch said he had found him asleep, and asked him to get up and he would not, and he said he would take him to the station—whilst I had my light on, he said to me, "You are the b——as robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd"——Sergeant Procter came up a few minutes afterwards and said I had better go to the station with him, and I walked a few yards behind him—we had got above one hundred, or one hundred and twenty yards, when I observed him and Stretch having a struggle on the ground—I ran up and saw the prisoner swing his arm round and make a blow with his right hand—Procter came up and said, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I tried to get it from him, but could not, and I drew my staff and hit him three times across the knuckles—the knife dropped on the ground and I picked it up—I saw blood follow the blow he made, it smothered my coat all over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he swung his arm round, do you mean that he swung it backwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he flung it round and caught Stretch across his face in the side of the ear—he did not say that I or Stretch had put our hands in his pockets—a gentleman who lived close by came to the police-court that same morning who had picked up a purse with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, near the spot, and the prisoner claimed it—I was not above six or seven yards behind the prisoner and Stretch all the way to the station—Stretch' bad hold of his left arm—I took another knife from the prisoner's pocket, and he said, "That was not the knife that did it"—I stated that before the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 10, Commercial-place—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 19th August I examined the constable—I found an incised wound on the left side of the left ear, commencing immediately above the external opening of the ear and passing over the cartilage of the ear, nearly dividing the lobe, taking a downward course in a line with the angle of the lower jaw—the wound was fully two inches in length, and half an inch deep—it was within an ace of the large vessels—it was a serious wound.</p>

             brought in the prisoner about half past six in the evening, with a piece of print, saying, that piece of print had been stolen out of our house a few minutes before that; it was printed cotton.</p>

            . I am a broker. On the 15th of November, I saw the prisoner in company with two others, near Great Turnstile; they were endeavouring to commit a robbery at the corner of Turnstile; it was very dark. They throwed open the door of a shop, at the corner of Great Turnstile; the prisoner was engaged in endeavouring to get a silk shawl out of the shop; his head was just within the door. This was not Mr. Johnson's house. He was prevented, they came, and shut the door immediately. These three boys then went on, until they came to Mr. Johnson's door; when I placed myself on the right hand side of the way. They were about the door for a quarter of an hour; they were endeavouring to take the prints from out of the shop, and at the moment a waggon passed by, which hindered me from seeing whether they took any thing; before that, I took particular notice of the linen, where it was placed, and at the moment the waggon was gone by, I noticed a piece of print was missing. I still kept my station, and I missed one of the lads. In about five minutes after that, the prisoner went into the shop, as if he was going to purchase a print, laying hold of the print, and looking at it, and at the same time he laid hold of it he brought it out of the shop; I immediately then run over the way, and went to lay hold of the prisoner, when he dropped the print; he had it in his hand, in the street; I saw him drop it. He run about ten yards. he was never out of my sight; I then laid hold of him, brought him back to the spot where he had dropped the print; I picked up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010008"></xptr>print, and took the prisoner into the shop; Mr. Johnson said, it was his print. I then conveyed the prisoner to Bow-street office. This is the printed cotton; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Johnson. Look at that printed cotton - A. Yes; it has our shop mark; I am positive it is mine and my partner's property; there is about twenty-one yards of printed cotton at two shillings and three-pence a yard; the value of it is about two pound four shillings. They took two pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. About this time who else was in the shop - A. Two customers, the boy, and myself; the shop-man was gone up to tea: the boy was in the back shop; at the moment he was clearing the goods out of the back shop into the front shop. I never knew it was lost until Vaughn brought it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Barron's-buildings, "Waterloo-road—I know the three prisoners. Some days before 18th March I was applied toby a man named Askew—I received a sample of wool from him—I showedthat sample to Fletcher two or three days prior to 18th March—I cannotstate where it was—I think it was in the Borough—I told him I had a quan<lb></lb>tityof wool for sale, and asked if he would sell it—(I had been in prisonbefore; I am not aware that Fletcher knew that)—he said he could get ridof it—I did not tell him how much there was—I told him the parties wanteda shilling a pound for it—he told me he would give me an answer in thecourse of a day or two—he agreed to give a shilling a pound, and I was tolet the parties know that I could have that—I met Askew and told him Icould have a shilling a pound for the wool—I met Qaaife and Gooding in the Borough, on 18th March, at half-past seven or eight o'clock in the morning—there were two more persons with them, but Fletcher was not there—wetried to hire a cart in the Borough, but did not succeed—we then went on to Thames-street—we did not hire one there—I then stopped a cart on London-bridge—Quaife was with me, and another man who is not in custody got intothe cart, and went away with the carman, down Arthur-street—Fletcher was withus when we tried to hire a cart in Thames-street, but not being able to do so, he went on to the Minories—he said, if we got the wool, it was to be broughtover to the Tower-hill end of the Minories, and he would meet us, and hewas to pay a certain sum of money, at a shilling a pound, into Quaife's hand, assoon as he delivered the wool—after the cart was hired, which was driven bya lad named Spence, it went down Arthur-street—I lost sight of it there—Idid not see where it went—I did not direct where it was to go—it went into Upper Thames-street—that was in a direction towards Lawrence Pountney-lane—I placed myself at the corner of Arthur-street, in Upper Thames-street, on the opposite side to Lawrence Pountney-lane—I could see the corner of it—Gooding was about Mile's-lane—I did not see Quaife after the cart washired—I left him on London-bridge, perhaps thirty or forty yards from Mile's-lane—a person standing at the foot of London-bridge can see Mile's-lane—I stood where I was, for about five minutes; I then saw the cart, witha bag of wool in it, coming out of either Lawrence Pountney-lane or Duck's-foot-lane—it went up Arthur-street again, towards the Minories—I went upthe steps and saw the cart again—I could not see any one following it—whenwe got to the Minories I saw two persons, who are not in custody, and Quaifeand Gooding—I had not seen Gooding from the time I saw him standing at Mile's-lane till I got to the Minories—we waited there with the cart fortwenty minutes or half an hour, and then Fletcher arrived—the carman foundfault with our detaining him, and I told Fletcher of it—the Minories was theplace where Fletcher was to be prepared to pay the money to Quaife, and hewas not prepared—I told Fletcher he had better warehouse the wool, and seeafter Paying for it as soon as he could—he took the cart away to a streetwhich I do not know the name of, in New Commercial-street—he drew thecart into a gateway, and there deposited the wool—I did not go into thegateway—the money was not then forthcoming, and some of the party wentover to Fletcher to know when it would be paid for, Quaife then went, I</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Trinity-square. Between two and threeo'clock, on Saturday, 18th March, I saw Webb, Quaife, and Fletcher, in Trinity-square—they were disputing about a bag of wool—Fletcher called meand said, "I want you concerning a bag of wool," or "a bale of wool"—hesaid, "These two," pointing to Webb and Quaife, "have <hi rend="italic">done me</hi> out of my <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi> "—I said, "What is it all about; tell me, and I will see what I cando?"—I said to Quaife, "Do you know anything about it?"—he said, "No"—I turned to Webb, and said, "Do you know anything about it?"—he said, "That is my business, not yours"—I said, "I think it is a little my busi<lb></lb>ness; I should like to know a little more about it"—I said, "If you will nottell me, I shall not interfere;" and I walked a little way, and Fletcher said, "Come along; I think we can find where the wool came from"—we wentthrough Tower-street, into Thames-street, and into Old Swan-lane—Fletchersaid, "That is where the cart went down"—I went to all the warehousesthere, but I could not find anything of any wool being taken that morning—Isaid, "We will go and see if we can find where the wool went to"—we wentto a street out of Commercial-street, to a house kept by Adams—we saw Mrs. Adams—she said, "The wool is gone; the same party that brought ittook it away; if you had left a note with me not to let anybody have itbesides you, it should not have gone away"—Fletcher went and picked out Adams' boy—he asked him who took the wool away—he said, "The sametwo chat brought it, and two boys."</p>

               <p>were these—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—" <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner Fletcher</hi>. When you met with me, and brought this sample to me, you brought twosamples" of wool, a coarse sample of four sacks, and this sample, did you not?Did you say that the bag of wool laid in the Borough when you left thesample, and that it could be seen and sent to any place in England? On the Saturday morning you have been speaking of as the day the wool was to bedelivered, did you order me to meet you at Arthur-street about eight o'clock?Did you bring a person and introduce him as the owner of the wool at thattime in Arthur-street? Did you not also bring another person shortly afterto me, who you said was the proprietor of the wool? At that time, did I notfell you that I had sold the wool to a person of the name of Harris, and ifyou did not let it be, as Saturday was the Jews' Sabbath, there would be somedelay in the delivery of the wool? Did you send a party (one of them two) along with me to Mr. Harris, to receive the money for the wool? At thetime you have been speaking of, the wool being in the Minories, did you notsend these two men with me, and the stouter man of the two was to receivethe money? After the time you have been speaking of, as having been to-Myer's and seen the wool disposed of, did you not come down with the stoutgentleman into Trinity-square? Did you not say when you came there thatit had been a very unfortunate piece of business; that the wool had gone in thesame channel that a whole sheet had gone before? Did I not then call anofficer who was passing by, and the stout man and you ran away immediately, an officer of the name of Childs? Did you go with the cart to Adams' yard?Did you send the two men with the cart to unload it there? What did youmean when you said the wool was two hours in my possession? Have youmet with the fourth person, because there were four persons when you werein the Minories? Have you met with the person in the chequered short coatwhom you represented as the real owner of the wool? Was he there a shorttime with you?</p>

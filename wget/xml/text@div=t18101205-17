               <p>Q. Had you seen the shop window and the shop shutters on the over night - A. To the best of my knowledge I had, I generally shut up the shop window shutters myself.</p>

Two pair of leather breeches, I missed what I saw afterwards, four pair of kerseymere breeches, one pair of nankeen, two pair of striped trowsers, and one red jacket.

They went from towards Phillip's house, to 21, Gerrard-street, and there we apprehended Jones, the other men got off. We took Jones to St. James's watchhouse, before the constable of the night; Jones was charged and put into confinement; he was searched, a seal and six shillings was found upon him. We went on our duty again, we found that Mr. Phillips's was broken open. We looked at Mr. Phillips's house at two o'clock, Phillips's house was all safe then, the shutters were safe and the bar across outside.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned, in what condition did you find Phillips's house then - A. We found the shutter was wrenched from the other adjoining shutter, and the glass was broken, to appearance not cut; we found several pieces of broken glass both inside and outside, we could perceive, by the broken pane of glass that there was something gone out of it. We alarmed Mr. Phillips, he came to us; one of the St. Ann's men came up, and said, he had one of the party, that was Prescott; Phillips was by at the time, Phillips and I went with that man, we saw Prescott.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at two o'clock all was safe at Phillips's - A. Before the clock struck two, and after I returned from apprehending Jones, I found it was broken open.</p>

Yes, I am quite sure of Jones, I knew him to be a bad character, I had seen him in a public-house in Frith-street; I can take upon me to say, that I saw all these three young men, they seemed to be intoxicated in liquor, they were locked armed. Watchman, said they, will you give us something to drink; no, said I, I have got nothing to give you to drink, nor do I know where there is any. They said, if you will come along with us to the watering house, we will give you something to drink; I want none, said I, I have a person to call up that is going in the country, I cannot go with you. I went to the corner of Dean-street, where my stand is.</p>

I could if it was moonlight, it was a moonlight night; so Prescott came up to me alone, he said, watchman, what o'clock is it; I said, almost three; I got up and went towards Upper King-street, he went away down Gerrard-street; I saw him go into another street, and went down George-yard, there are carts there, and a great many premises backwards; out of George-yard he went into Princess-street, where Phillips lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you followed Prescott down into Princes-street - A. Yes; he crossed over the way to Phillips's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You represent Prescott to be alone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into Princes-street did you see him join any one - A. No, I saw him go up to Phillips's door, and there he appeared to be talking to some people; I could hear them talk, but not distinguish what they said; I heard a wrench of a shutter or a door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at the time tell who they were - A. I could not, I did not go nigh them expecting them to be bad people.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you could hear them wrenching of something - A. Yes, Prescot said, coming across the street, all is well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him cross the street - A. Yes, I was in the yard at the time that he crossed the street, and said this. When he came out and crossed the Dean-street, I followed him and sprang my rattle, and my partner, his name is Daniel, he and I took him and brought him to St. Ann's watchhouse, and there he had no name, nor would he tell where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the talking of people, can you take upon you to say how many people there might be - A. No, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You began to say that you knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050012"></xptr>Jones, he was a bad character, do you know there is a reward for a burglary - A. No, not to my knowledge, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in London - A. Twenty-six or twenty-seven years, but part of that time I have been abroad, not all that time in London.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that Prescott accosted you, asked you what the hour was, after you had observed what he and the other men were about. You say you retired after you had seen the men to the place where you were accustomed to stand - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you would have us understand, Prescott accosted you, and asked what the hour was - Yes, about six or seven minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard a wrenching, you and another watchman were watching, was not there some watchmen in that neighbourhood near you - A. There was one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you communicated to the officer of the night, that there were some thieves about - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you supposed that these people were about something mischievous and bad - A. I had no suspicion at the time, until after he had passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were behind a cart did not you then suspect that something was going wrong - A. I did not suspect particularly then.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people going along Princes-street - A. I could hear the noise of more than one or two, the street was very quiet except these people.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Prescott you had never seen before that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said it was a dark night - A. It was not a very dark night, nor very moon light.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be moonlight, was it moonlight or not - A. It might be moonlight, and it might be a dark cloudy night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not assign it as a reason that you could not see down the street - A. I could see best part of the street down.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer to my Lord was, that if it was a moonlight night you could see down the street - A. I was not in the street, I was in the mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Prescott that night was a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have us believe that you saw him near Phillips's house - A. I saw him different times.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought these men were doing something that was wrong why did you not take them - A. In the first place they were six in number, we did not like to attack them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that Prescott was one of the men that went to Phillips's house - A. I did not say that.</p>

            . I was constable of the night of the 21st, Hopkins and Jones they were brought before me, they were searched, a seal was found upon Jones, that I returned to him; Ford and M'Carty came together, bringing in Hopkins; they produced a bundle, I have taken care of it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. No implements of any sort were found upon them - A. No one at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The property is mine some are marked and some are not.</p>
               <p>Hopkins' Defence. I was passing from my lodging in Compton-street to go to the Jews Harp, I dle, I saw this bundle, I picked it up; I was stopped by the watchman, he asked me if I had got my master's things; I said it is of no consequence to you; he said, I should go the watchhouse; I said if I am to go to the watchhouse you shall carry the things.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was taken to the watchhouse before the circumstance happened; the watchman looked at Mr. Phillips's house before he took me, if you observed that.</p>
               <p>Murphy. I apprehended Jones near upon three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prescott's Defence. The night I was taken I had been to the play at Astley's in Wych-street, I happened to stop with some girls, and the time I got home it was half past twelve, I knocked, I could not get in: coming up Macclesfield-street I stopped to make water, he sprang the rattle; I went over to him, he said, keep off; I went over again.</p>
               <p>Scott. My attention was taken to Hopkins's right hand which was bloody, as if it had been cut with glass. There were two gentlemen who followed him into the watchhouse, who directed my attention to his hand, I did not observe it myself.</p>
               <p>Hopkins. I shewed my hand before the magistrate, there was no cut, only a scratch of a pin on my finger, and no mark of any cut at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Scott. What part of his hand was cut - A. At the two extremities, there were more than that.</p>
               <p>Prescott called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jones called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hopkins called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Some of the property you had seen in the house the day before the burglary was committed, had not you - A. Some of it.</p>

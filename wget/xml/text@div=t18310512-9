            . I am a gardener, and live at Ball's-pond. On the 11th of April I was at work very near Mr. Stephens' house, and saw the two prisoners, about ten o'clock in the morning; Crockwell had two or three apples in his hand - they were going towards Kingsland; I saw Crockwell go into the front court of Mr. Stephens' house, and come out again - he went in and came out three different times, and then the gave the apples to Tinney - he had only three apples that I saw; Tinney then went in with the apples, and came out of the fore court in about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120010"></xptr>five minutes, with a pair of drab trousers under his arm - they had white buttons at the bottom of them; I was too far off to see the house - my nephew, who is ill, and unable to attend, went to the house, and gave an alarm; they were pursued - that is all I saw: I am quite certain of them both - I never had a doubt of them.</p>
               <p>MARY INKSON. I am servant to Mr. John Stephens, who lives at No. 2, <placeName id="t18310512-9-crimeloc55">Brunswick-place, Ball's-pond</placeName>

On the 11th of April I was at home, and went up stairs about ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning, I left the kitchen window shut down - it is a sash window, and looks into the fore-court; I cannot say whether it was fastened - it was shut close down, and the street door was shut; there is a flight of steps to the door -I do not know how the gate of the fore-court was; there was no window or door open leading to the front yard - I remained up stairs ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when a man rang the bell; I came down, and he gave me information; I found the kitchen window half way open - I should think it would not admit a man's body - I think it must have been pulled partly down after him; I missed a pair of drab trousers, with white buttons, off a hamper on the left-hand side of the kitchen - I missed nothing else then; the prisoner Tinney was taken - he was searched at the station-house, in my presence, but nothing was found; while he was being searched four tea-spoons and a mustard-spoon were brought to the station, and I knew them to be Mr. Stephens' - I had put the tea-spoons into them kitchen-closet, on the left-hand side of the fire-place, the last thing before I went up stairs; the closet was shut, but not locked - the mustard-spoon was in another closet on the other side of the kitchen - I had seen that at supper time the night before; the trousers were worth about 10s., and the spoons 30s. - there is no place they could have got in at but the window, which I am sure was shut down when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAZIER. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a porter. On the 11th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock in the morning, I had just left my door, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw the two prisoner running from Ball's-pond-road towards Kingsland-road, in a direction from Mr. Stephens' house - they were about three hundred yards from the house; I ran into the road, and ran after them to Kingsland-road - one turned to the right, and Crockwell to the left; I caught him - I did not see him do any thing: I did not understand the person who was in pursuit - I thought he said he did not want the boy, and I let go of him to follow the other.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUMPSTEAD. I live in Kingsland. On the 11th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was standing at my door, and heard a call of Stop thief! I saw Tinney running, and pursued him till he was taken - he ran down Rosemary-place, away from Kingsland, and from Mr. Stephens' house; I called a witness, who took him, and delivered him to me - I gave him to the Policeman; after he was taken I received information - I had seen him lift his hand up, as if to throw something over Mr. Skinner's garden wall, in consequence of which I searched over the wall, and found five silver spoons, just opposite where he appeared to throw them, and about two yards from the wall - I gave them to Clark, the Policeman; the mustard-spoon had mustard quite wet on it - the others were teaspoons.</p>

            . I live at Kingsland. I heard a cry of Stop thief! about eleven o'clock on the 11th of April, at Dalston - I turned round, and saw Tinney running; I went back to meet him - he turned the corner of Crosby-place, which leads to Dalston-lane, and before I overtook him, I saw him throw a quantity of tea-spoons over the garden wall - I overtook him, and detained him till Bumpstead came up; I gave him into his charge - the spoons were found on the spot I pointed out.</p>
               <p>MATILDA HARRIS. I live with my aunt Scraggs, and am the daughter of Mr. Harris. On the Monday in question I saw a pair of trousers in the area of No. 5, Elizabeth-terrace, Ball's-pond; I took them up, and showed them to my aunt - she beckoned to Mr. Millichap; they were drab trousers, with white buttons.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MILLICHAP. I am a Policeman. I took Tinney into custody about eleven o'clock in the morning - I took him to the station; I found 2 1/2d. on him, a latch-key, and four apples.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS PROTHEROE. I am a Policeman. I apprehended Crockwell by Shoreditch church, on the 11th of April, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I asked if he had been up to Kingsland that morning; he said he had not.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLARK. I am a Policeman. I produce four tea-spoons and a mustard-spoon, delivered to me by Bumpstead.</p>
               <p>MARY INKSON. I know these spoons very well to be Mr. Stephens' - they were in the cupboard at ten o'clock that morning; these trousers are also his, and were on the hamper - they were found about twenty houses from ours, and in a direction towards Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Tinney's Defence. I know nothing of Crockwell - he was never in my company; I was selling apples in the street, and the Policeman ran and took me.</p>
               <p>Crockwell's Defence. I had been to Tottenham to see my sister; I staid there all night - I was coming down Kingsland: I heard a cry of Stop thief! they were pursuing another lad - a gentleman took me; a person said it was not me, it was another lad, and he let me go - when I got home my master sent me for a bushel of peas; as I returned, the Policeman took me - they asked the gentlemen if it was me; they said they did not know, but I was as much like him as two peas.</p>

               <p>JAMES WARBOYS. I never had a doubt about him.</p>

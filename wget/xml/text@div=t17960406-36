               <p>Mr. Knatchbull. I have not the least doubt in the world of these being my property, they have my crest; I never missed them, we were a great deal out of town, and always keep a certain quantity of plate out for constant use.</p>
               <p>Q. You trusted to Greary, your butler? - A. Yes. Prisoner's defence. I received these things from Geary, he told me Mr. Knatchbull wanted money, and as he knew I was in the habit of pawning plate for a gentleman that I lived with, he asked me to pawn it; he thought if he went himself to the pawn-brokers, he should be stopped; I never brought a bit of plate out of Mr. Knatchbull's house, they were all brought to my lodging by Geary; I did not suppose I should be brought into trouble for this, I did it very honestly.</p>

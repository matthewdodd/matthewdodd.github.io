            . The prisoner and I were partners together, in buying and selling cloaths. I was with child, and not able to go about the streets on my business, so I nursed a woman in the house where the prisoner and I lived. When I dropped partnership with the prisoner I had six shillings of my own, and at the christening I had three shillings given me, which nine shillings I had laid upon a chest of drawers in the room where the woman lay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put into any thing?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, it lay loose upon the drawer; I put it there in the afternoon, and I missed it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when it was taken away?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I was up and down stairs, nursing the woman; it is a publick-house, and there was no servant to attend business but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been in that room the day you lost it, can you tell?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. She had been there backwards and forwards all day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed your money, what did you do?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I fell a crying. I was not able to pursue her, for I was delivered in three days after; I was obliged to go into the Lying-in-Hospital. After I got up I went to the prisoner, and asked her to give me some relief, and help me to some of my money. She said, call upon me next week, and I will give you six pence or a shilling. I called, but she would not give me a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she acknowledge she had taken your nine shillings?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. Yes; there are witnesses enough of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with it?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. She said she had drank seven shillings of it the very same night that she took it away. I took her before justice Welch, before whom she acknowledged that she took it away.</p>

               <p>My husband is on board one of his majesty's ships, serving his country. I hope you will take compassion on me, and give me till to-morrow to produce my witnesses. She and I were partners. I gave her eleven pence a day when I earned twenty-two pence, at the time she was not a nurse keeping. She said she would never come against me, and I gave her a crown in her hand in the Round-house, besides a leg of mutton.</p>

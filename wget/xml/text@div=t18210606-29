I went to Mrs. Butler, on the 15th of May, for the dirty linen; the prisoner brought down only one shirt - after I left, she followed me to my house, and said she had given me less shirts than she ought to have done, but she would bring them next morning, or that night. I told her her mistress had mentioned something about a new shirt - she said she had spilt some ink on it, but she would get it out, and bring it.</p>

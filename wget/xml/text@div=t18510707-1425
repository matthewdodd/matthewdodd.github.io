                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William M'Culloch, we are wholesale druggists, at 95, Bishopsgate-street Within. The prisoner has been for some time in our service, as clerk and town-traveller—it was his duty to-collect moneys—in the course of his duty he would receive moneys from Mr. Eddy and Mr. Bates—if he received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 4th Feb., and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 26th May, it would be his duty to pay it to me the same evening, or next morning—that would be his duty in all cases—it was his duty to pay money to me—when I was at home I was cashier—Mr. M'Culloch was in Yorkshire, on 4th Feb.—he returned about eight days afterwards—it was the prisoner's duty to enter in the day-book, the moneys he received—this is the day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are entries in it on 4th Feb., in the prisoner's writing, of moneys received by him, but no entry of the two sums in ques<lb></lb>tion—he usually made out a list of the amounts he received for my con<lb></lb>venience—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the list which he handed to me on 4th Feb.—this corresponds with the entries in the day-book—there is no account there of the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 15th June he called on me between 4 and 5 o'clock, with Mr. Cort, who stated they had come on very unpleasant business—I asked what the unpleasant business was—I cannot recollect the words he used, but, in effect, that he was sorry to say Mr. Young had received moneys and not accounted for them, and that he had advised him to come to me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070003"></xptr>
               <p>explain all, and make a clean breast of it—I immediately declined entering into any particulars, or having anything to do with them, and told them they had better see Mr. M'Culloch, my partner, as I was going out of town that even<lb></lb>ning. Mr. M'Culloch is now in Scotland, on business—some days after, I received this paper which is in the prisoner's writing, fro Mr. M'Culloch, and he made a communication to me at the same time—here is the name of Mr. Eddy, but no sum against it—(<hi rend="italic">the following items were read from this paper: "Tuesday, Eddy paid to Christmas;" "Monday, bates paid to Christmas</hi>:")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did Mr. M'Culloch return? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a week or eight days after 4th Feb.—I went out of town myself about a week after, and was away several days—I was in town in the day, and away in the evening—I left Euston-square by the five o'clock train, on 15th June—I left Mr. M'Culloch in town—I was away about three days—I have been in the firm since March, 1845—I do not know how long Mr. M'Culloch has been, I have known him in it about ten years—the prisoner has been employed by the firm thirteen years, with the exception of an interval of a few months when he left, he afterwards returned—he has been town-traveller more than four years—thousands of pounds pass through his hinds every year—he had 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year since he has been town-traveller, and his coach-hire, and omni<lb></lb>bus hire was allowed him—he had no perquisites—there are no other entries of moneys received on this list—there are entries in the day-book of orders as well as payments—it was his duty to enter payments in the day-book—all amounts he received, art, or ought to be, entered in this way in the day-book—I keep the cash-book—it is here—the cash is entered by me when I receive it, in the cash-book, and then put into the ledger from the day-book—these two sums have not been entered by me in the cash-book—I think when the prisoner first came into our employ he had 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but I cannot positively recollect—Mr. M'Culloch left town on Thursday, 3rd July—he was aware this trial was coming on—he was at the Mansion-house on Wednesday, but was not examined—that was the second hearing—the Alderman did not remand this case from the first bearing, expressly that Mr. M'Culloch should appear and give evidence—I cannot undertake to say that the Alderman did not say that Mr. M'Culloch ought to be in attendance on the next occasion, but my impression is he did not—Mr. M'Culloch's name was mentioned—I believe Mr. Cort went to Mr. M'Culloch when I referred him, but not the prisoner—that was on Sunday afternoon, 15th June—the prisoner was taken on the Tuesday-week after—I swear this "4, 2, 51," has not been written here since—I should net like to pledge my oath that it was there when I first saw it, but I believe it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose figures are they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Young's—Mr. M'Culloch was at the Mansion-house on the last examination, because I told him I thought he had better go—he gave no evidence—the entries in the ledger are made by the ledger-clerk, from the day-book, and are then checked by the cash-book, which I keep—when I am absent Mr. M'Culloch receives money, but not when I am there—he has received money, and handed it to me if I have not been in the counting-house at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Wheatsheaf. I remember the prisoner being in my house on 18th March, about half past 5 o'clock—I did not see him served—I saw the half crown was bad which Barton brought in—I gave it to the constable—when Barton gave it me. I went into the bar, saw the prisoner, and asked him where he took it—he said, "Of Mr. James, in High—street, Marylebonne"—he went out at one door and I at the other—I stood, and saw him look back several times, till he got to a mews, which he went down—I went down a street on this side of the mews, and ran and caught sight of him—he ran down several streets, and with a good deal of dodging I caught him, and brought him back to the house—I then asked him where he took the half crown; he said, "Of Mr. Williams"—I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—he had gone one third of a mile when I came up to him—I lost sight of him when he turned the corner of the mews, but, with that exception, I kept sight of him all the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you say that your barmaid brought you the half crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, into the bar parlour where I was at tea—I am sure you said you took it of Mr. James, and when you said the second time you took it of Mr. Williams, I said, "Just now it was Mr. James;" and you said that it was Mr. James Williams—when you left the house you walked fast—when you got to the corner of the mews you ran fast enough—I believe my wife entered the bar at the time I was keeping you there—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber that she made any remark about the half crown—I was at the door, outside, keeping you in—she might have said, "I don't believe the young man knew it was bad; don't be hard with him; don't give him into cus<lb></lb>tody;" and I might have made the reply, "Mind your own business; I shall do as I please"—I was partly out of the door, I do not remember it—I believe you took out the change, and laid it on the counter—I do not remember that you offered to be searched, or that I made any remark as to not pressing the charge, or giving you into custody, or that you said that you were willing to be searched there and then, in my presence, and beg me not to give you in charge, as you had not long got your discharge from the army, and it would be the means of destroying your character—I said, "I will wait till the policeman comes, and he will search you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the prisoner had offered to be searched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said, "I will wait till the policeman comes, and see if he knows you, and if he does not know you, I will not lock you up." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not—the policeman did not search you in my house—I did not take a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece the day previous—we had detected a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060017"></xptr>
               <p>piece and a half crown the day before that—I believe I did say while you had the glass of ale in your hand, that I had a great mind to give you into custody, as I had taken a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece the day before, and the next one that came I would give him into custody—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was offered me; I did not take it—you left something in a glass—I do not know whether it was beer or ale.</p>

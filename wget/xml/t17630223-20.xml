The prisoner and her husband were taken up on suspicion, they lived in the same house, she is sister to Mr. Kilpin; she told her sister where the notes were paid away, one I found accordingly at Mrs. Triquets, a Silversmith, in the Strand. The prisoner at the bar told me she had taken the two notes from me before I went for it; and said, nobody was concerned with her in it: the other note she owned she had paid away to Mr. Sharp, a Linnen-draper, in Cheapside. I went there, he said he had had it changed; I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230018"></xptr> that, by tracing it in the hands of Mr. Roaper in St. Martin's Lane. I cannot be so positive as to the particulars of that note; I cannot say that was mine, any further than the prisoner told me it was one of mine.</p>
               <p>Magdalen Triquet. I keep a silversmith's shop in the Strand. I believe the prisoner is the person that came to my shop to buy some spoons, and changed this bank note. ( A note produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor as one of the two be lost) this note never was out of my hands but one day; my eldest son, that lives in Craven-Street, changed it for smaller notes. When the prosecutor came for it, I sent my youngest son, that lives with me, to his brother for it.</p>

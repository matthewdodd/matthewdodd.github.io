               <p>On Thursday the 24th of July last, I had been to do the business of the county at the Sessions, at the County Hall at Clerkenwell-green; I am <rs id="t17831029-1-viclabel4" type="occupation">in the commission of the peace for this county</rs>

He answered pretty quick, give me your money, or I will blow your brains out; he took my purse with five guineas in gold in it, the purse was green and red silk; he then said give me your watch; the prisoner at the bar came up on the other side of my chariot, and he spoke rather sharper, give me your watch, he said, and be quick; the prisoner was one of the two men that came up, he was on the right side of my chariot close to my chariot; on the broadside of the glass, he had no disguise at all on his face, neither of the men had any disguise, I had the opportunity of looking at him and his horse, it seemed to me to be a dark bay or chesnut, and I believe it was cropt, I could not tell whether it was a horse or a mare; he took my watch, it was silver gilt, and the seals to it were gold, a gilt metal chain, a key and a hook to hang it to the head of the bed; when they had robbed me and took my watch in that manner, they turned round to go back again towards London; as he came I looked out of my chariot, and I called out to the best of my knowledge, and he said, you, Sir, he spoke in a feigned voice, what do you want; I said if you will leave my watch, where I can come at it in London, I will pay you for it, or give you something for it, or to that effect; he said I will advertise it in the Chronicle.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say that yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that is the man? - I am certain sure the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the watch advertised? - Yes, it was advertised by Sir Sampson Wright, the prisoner was not taken on my account, he was taken on another account, my watch was never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What time was this? - Eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was it not a dark evening? - No, quite light, the sun shone.</p>
               <p>Was not you considerably intimidated? - To be sure I was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - If I did it is more then I can say.</p>
               <p>Because your recollection of him seems to be pretty strong? - I think he gave me a good deal of reason to remember him.</p>
               <p>But you was exceedingly frightened? - If I had I could not have asked him for my watch, I was more frightened afterwards.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before did you? - I will not take upon myself to say any thing to that.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you take notice of the man? - Yes, one was shortish one, and two came first and the one came at last; he who came at last went the first away, the other staid about five minutes after; they came towards London, it was about seven o'clock, and they went towards London.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What time was you robbed? - It was rather turned of eight, it struck eight when I was at the Old Hatch: there is one matter that I have omitted, that is the colour apparently of his coat, it appeared to me to be blue.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. What time was it when they went away? - About seven.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. There was another man convicted last sessions who was on the left hand of you, and he says that you swore when that man was convicted, that your notice and attention was particularly fixed on that man, and that you could say nothing to the other man, whom you now say is the prisoner, and should not know him again? - No, I did not say I should not know him again; my attention was fixed on Sharman at first, but my attention was fixed on that man the prisoner, when he said give your watch to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You hear Gentlemen what Mr. Fellows says, he says when this man demanded his watch his attention was fixed on him then.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any other observation, Sir, that you would make before the sessions paper comes? - None at present, my Lord.</p>
               <p>A sessions paper of the first part of last sessions handed to the Judge.</p>

             being inconsistent with what he has said now; I have read the sessions paper, and though the Prisoner says that the Prosecutor swore that he could not speak to the man that came up on the right hand side and should not know him (which he now says is the Prisoner) yet you have heard the sessions paper read, which does not agree with the Prisoner's account, and Mr. Fellows has been asked, and he says positively he did not say that he could not swear to that man, but that his attention was then particularly fixed on the man that came up first to him; but, says he, when the other man came to take my watch from me, I attended to him; and he does most positively swear now his situation was such, that he can as positively swear to that man as the other; another thing is every material, you see the prosecutor was not called upon then to swear particularly to the other man, he had not seen the other man at that time, he was not taken: therefore it is almost improbable to think that the Court would be asking him as to the other man, nor does it appear that Mr. Fellows has sworn at all inconsistently; that he was robbed, seems to be exceedingly plain, you have heard his evidence, he seems to speak very correctly, though at the same time very positively; and he swears positively to the person of the prisoner; you observe he was robbed between the eight and nine mile stone, taking it from London, he was going to Uxbridge, and he tells you the men met him and they passed him: then you have in confirmation of that the evidence of two people, that three men, though not ascertained, were at Hillington, at seven o'clock, the hostler does not confirm any description of the men or the horses, nor does the woman, but she says two of them came in together, one did not come in then, but they all went out together; as to this third man there is no traces whatever, nor is it material, he was not concerned in the robbery, but it confirms that there were two men, one speaks to a blue coat; the coachman swears his master Mr. Baine was robbed, and the time of the robbery, and the circumstances of the robbery are for you to weigh; he swears however, his master was robbed about forty or fifty yards from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290007"></xptr> ten mile stone from London, that as nigh as he could guess to the time, it was between eight and nine; Mr. Fellows swore they methim, and passed him, and then turned back again, now that there was a robbery committed by two men, corresponds within a few minutes, or within a quarter of an hour to the time that Mr. Fellows was robbed; these are the circumstances for your consideration, Mr. Fellows swore positively to the men: he has had every caution given, and he himself is a magistrate; you are therefore to weigh his testimony from his positive oath, and from these circumstances that confirm it of two men being there at, the time; sorry I am to make the observation that there is not a creature to shew where this prisoner was at the time; I wish I could make any observation in his favor, but the circumstances that are against him are equally my duty to observe to you; you are to say upon your consciences, whether you think him guilty or not, and if you think him so, you will say so, if not you will acquit him.</p>

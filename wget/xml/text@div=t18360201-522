                  </hi>. I live in Carey, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and am an appraiser, I was walking with a female in Southampton-row, Blooms<lb></lb>bury on the 26th of January—she had been drinking with me in the course of the evening, and fell down—I do not know how she came to fall—the liquor might take effect upon her in a short time—she received a severe injury—I got her up—the prisoner stepped up, and offered her kind assistance to take this woman towards my place, and after getting her home, and getting a bottle of vinegar, and bathing her face, and all that, she requested me to allow her to sit there till the morning, after I had given her a cup of tea, which was all that I had to give her—I did not wish either of them there—it was about half-past twelve o'clock when the accident occurred—I allowed the woman, and the prisoner to sit there—in the morning, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the back part of the prisoner, going out of the parlour door with the black coat and trowsers which I had worn the day before, the prisoner went with her—I did not see her carrying them away, but I saw her go—I got up the moment I saw the door shut, but could not find my trowsers, I went into the back room to get a pair—the sick person staid there till the next evening—I missed a mustard-pot cover, a handkerchief, and the other things stated—this hand<lb></lb>cover is mine.</p>

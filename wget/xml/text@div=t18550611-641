                  </hi>. On 6th Jan., the prisoner opened an account, No. 123291, and deposited 1., I received it; and the depositor's book ready prepared with the name and the amount received—I passed it on to Mr. Lewis, and he would pass it to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner again I on Saturday evening, 3rd March, he then produced the book to me in its present state, with these entries in it of July 7th, Nov. 9th and 19th—he and said he had come to give notice to withdraw the money—I immediately saw I that these entries were not in the handwriting of any officer in the Institu<lb></lb>tion—we have no manager named Jones—I took the prisoner to Mr. Boodle, with the book, after comparing it with the ledger.</p>

                  </hi>. On 3rd March, Mr. Olive came to me with the pri<lb></lb>soner; this book was presented at the same time—on examining it I dis<lb></lb>covered that the entries of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th July; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 9th Nov.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 19th Nov.; and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Dec, were fictitious entries; they are all forgeries—the second entry is, I think, an imitation of Mr. Lewis's writing, but it is not his; the next is in the name of Jones, and the last also; we have no mana<lb></lb>ger of that name, and the other is in the name of Wills or Wells; we have no officer of that name—they are not at all like the writing of any regular I clerk—I inquired of the prisoner whether he had ever trusted this book into the hands of any other person—he said, "No"—I asked whether he had paid those sums himself—he said he had—I inquired how much he claimed of the institution; he said 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was come to give notice for that amount—I asked if he was the depositor; he said, "Yes"—I then said it would be necessary to detain him to have the matter inquired into; I begged he would recollect himself, whether he had ever sent any money by any other person—he said he had sent some by his father—I said that I would content myself by keeping the book, if he or his father would attend before the managers on the Monday—he said they would come—neither of them did.</p>

               <p>he said nothing about his mother or mother in law—the board of managers decided upon prosecuting within a fortnight, but he could not be found for a long time—the person who gave the book to the prisoner is not here—each deposit book goes through three hands before it is issued—the prisoner was there about ten minutes on 3rd March—it was about 8 o'clock—he did not seem to have been drinking; there were not many persons in the room.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of the Foundling estate. On Friday, the 7th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Guildford-street, going towards Speldburst-street, with a stick in his hand, driving two oxen; I asked him if he was gone back to Lindus, his old master; he said No; I said"Whose beasts are those?" he said his own. On the Sunday following he came to the watch-house to bring a young man his breakfast; I said "Why Jem, you are getting on in the world, if those beasts are yours that I saw you with on Friday morning;" he said "Yes, people thought he was getting down in the world, but they were mistaken."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What hour was this? A. About a quarter past six - he had lived in the neighbourhood - I have seen him driving beasts before.</p>

On the 6th of April, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to the shop and, in my presence, said to my brother, that he thought he should buy two beasts at Smithfield the following morning, and asked if he could kill them in his slaughter-house; my brother said he could, and next morning, about half-past six, he knocked at the door - I opened it to him - he told me he had put two beasts in the pound, and could I let him into the slaughter-house to kill them - I did so - I saw one of them before it was killed - it was a brown one; I did not notice any mark - I saw him kill it - I do not know who killed the other - there was a person assisting him - the skins of the beast were taken away by Benbow, Mr. Beby's man, on the same evening; the carcases went away early on the Saturday morning - there was no other beast slaughtered at out house that day; I do not know who took the carcases away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have slaughtered beasts of all colours at your slaughter-house, I suppose? A.

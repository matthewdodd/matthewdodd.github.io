            . On Saturday December 15. I lost from my Door, a Copper-bottom of an Hundred and odd Pounds Weight in the Evening; and I sent among the Trade, to desire it might be stopp'd, if it should be offer'd to sale. On Monday the 17th of December, about 7 in the Evening a Messenger came from Houndsditch, to let me know he believ'd he could give me Information about my Goods. Upon this I went to Mr. Simms, a Founder, in Houndsditch, and found about a third Part of the Copper-bottom in the Scales, in Order to be weigh'd and sold. Mr. Simms's Servants imagin'd it was mine, so they delay'd paying for it, and sent for me. My Servants, as well as I, being positive to the Goods, Mr. Simms told me he had order'd Mr. Peartree (who brought it) to call again for the Money, and if we would go to a publick House, he would send for us when he came.

            ) went accordingly, to an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood; and about 8 o'Clock, we were all sent for; we asked him how he came by the Goods? He said, he had them from the Prisoner Maxwell, and that Maxwell told him, he had stole it from a Brasier's Shop, in Woodstreet, and had brought it to him (Peartree) on Saturday in the Evening. I told Peartree, it was not in the same Shape, when it was stole. He said, no; it was a whole Bottom when he receiv'd it from Maxwell, but in Order to disguise it, he had cut it to Pieces, and had carried 2 thirds of it to one Trench, a Founder at the 5 Bells in Old-Bedlam, and had said them to him, for 10 Pence Half-penny a Pound. Upon this Information from Peartree , I got a Search-Warrant, and went next Morning to French, who deliver'd me 70 lb. and a half of my Copper. On Thursday Evening Maxwell (as I was inform'd) brought a Barrel of Raisins to Peartree's House, and he was then taken. I was not present at that Time, but I was with him the next Morning before the Lord-Mayor, and heard him desire to be made an Evidence, for others he said were concern'd with him. He (Maxwell) acknowledg'd that he stole the Goods, one Burton (not taken) lent him a Hand up with it, to carry it off.

            . I saw Money paid by my Mastes Peartree to Maxwell; and He gave Barton half of it. I can't tell the Day of the Month, nor how much Money was paid; but I heard Peartree tell them, he had but 8 Pence a Pound; and some Money (out of this) he allow'd for the Wast of the Copper. I remember this was the same Night that Peartree was stopp'd at Mr. Simm's Peartree is a Brass-Founder himself. - The common Price of Copper is about 10 d. 11 d. or 11 Pence Half-penny per Pound; according to it's Goodness. - The Value of this Copper (I believe) was about 10 Pence Half-penny, or 11 d. a Pound: But as there were some Nails in it. I reckon they made it a Half penny a Pound worse. I did not see the Goods brought in; but I saw the Money paid to Maxwell, by Peartree; and Maxwell told him, he brought it out of Woodstreet; I knew not whose the Goods were, at that Time; but I have since found, they were Mr. Weale's in Woodstreet.</p>

             and I, went thither, and my Master (Weale) follow'd. As soon as we saw the Copper, we knew it to be my Master's. Mr Simms's People told us the Man who brought it, was to come again for the Money, and they desired us to go and wait at an Alehouse, 'till he came. We went to a publick House; and one of Mr. Simms's Men came to us, about 8 o'Clock, and told us the Man was come for the Money. We went directly to Mr. Simms's and found Peartree, the Prisoner, and Part of the Copper, which we had lost, in the Scale. I said my Hand upon it, and claim'd it for my Master. Peartree stood on my right Hand, and said he belong'd to it. Then, says I, I will take Care of you, and the Copper too. This is the Copper, and I swear 'tis Part of my Master's Bottom, which he lost. The Prisoner said, he had it from Maxwell, for 8 d. a Pound, and own'd he had sold 70 th and a half to one Trench in Old Bedlam, and that he knew it to be stolen, at the same Time he sold it. I heard him own this, and that he had cut it to Pieces to raise Money on it, to pay the Rogues, Maxwell and Burton. Between one Tradesman and another, the Copper is worth 11 d.

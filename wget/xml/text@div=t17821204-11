               <p>Did they both come in together? - Pearson came in first, and Booker followed him; I did not shut the door between them, I held the door while they both came in: Pearson was a considerable time getting out his money, and the other was trying to get out; the latch was small, and fixed pretty high, and he could not find it: when I had taken Pearson's money, Booker was got on the outside of the door on the step; I turned round and looked at the glass case, and saw it a little way open, and missed two gold watches; I then went to my master who was in the parlour next to the shop, cleaning himself; I told him to come out and look at his glass case, and I went out and shut the door after me, and followed the two prisoners out of the shop, I saw them running down St. Dunstan's hill, I cried out Stop thief! when they got to the end of Cross-lane, I thought Pearson was going down the hill, and Booker going to him down Cross-lane; but I cried Stop thief! and they both seemed flurried, and they ran from the top of St. Dunstan's hill, and both turned up Harp-lane, and when they were got about forty yards up, I catched hold of Booker by the collar, and brought him home to my master's shop; he made no resistance, only he asked me what I wanted, I did not satisfy him; when he came there, he said nothing; I did not see him searched.</p>

               <p>You saw the man after he was stopped? - Yes my Lord.</p>
               <p>Immediately after? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was the man that was stopped the same man that dropped the watches? - Yes, the man that was taken, was the second man that run.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body running after him? - Yes, Field was the man that run after him, and likewise Mr. House's young man.</p>
               <p>Then it was Mr. House's young man that stopped him? - I cannot say, he was in custody when I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the watches to? - I carried them to Mr. House, and gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Were the watches the same that the prisoner dropped? - They were, one was out of the outside case, and the other was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bateman. Did you ever lose sight of Booker before you stopped him? - No, only turning the corner, not three seconds; I am sure he was the same man.</p>

               <p>I am a deputy corn meter; I was coming from my business the 22d of November, the Friday, soon after three in the afternoon, the two prisoners run past me very fast; Bateman called out Stop thief! this was in Cross lane; I turned round and pursued them up Harp-lane; the one I remarked to be lame, which was Booker, he could not run so fast as the other; I said to Bateman stop him, and I will pursue the other; he stopped him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040015"></xptr> in Harp-lane; I lost sight of Pearson at the end of Harp-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him drop any thing? - No my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>What became of the other man? - The other man run over into Mercer's court; I said, when I heard the people say he was run there, that I should take him for he could not escape there being no thoroughfare; I took him there, coming back again; I said this is the man, I am sure he has passed me before, I took him by the collar, says he what is the matter; Hollandly came up to me and said he had picked up the two watches, and shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the man you met coming out of the court, was the same man that run past, and that you pursued? - Yes my Lord, I am very sure of his person, he had the same coat that he has on now; but I am positive to his person; both of them.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing? - Nothing, only desired they might not be dragged along the street to the Compter; it being so late in the afternoon they were not searched; they made no defence, nor were they asked any questions.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the watches dropped? - I saw them picked up.</p>
               <p>Court to Bateman. The prisoner Pearson was out of your sight before he was brought back? - Yes a considerable time, three or four minutes.</p>

               <p>I went into this gentleman's shop for a watch glass; I asked him to fit a glass, he did, which was a little time about; I recollected the key was broke, I asked him if he had one, he said he believed he had, and I recollected I had one at home; I paid him six-pence and went out: afterwards I heard somebody halloo out, Stop thief! I went as well as the rest of the people, and I went up this court, I thought I saw somebody run up this court; I asked what was the matter, Field said you know, and took me to the watchmaker's, they told me I was concerned in stealing the two watches as they believed; so I went to the Compter before the Lord Mayor, there this young fellow said I was innocent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Riley, a shoemaker in High-street, Shoreditch. On Monday the 22nd of May, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop—Johnson asked to try on a pair of Adelaide boots, and while I was looking for a pair, I turned round and kept my eye on them, but before I could reach a pair, I saw a vacancy in the window—they immediately rose from their seats, and said they were going a little further, and would call as they came back</p>

               <p>—I said, "Stop, let me see what you have got"—I saw Smith patting something under her shawl—I pulled one boot from under her shawl—they both immediately rushed to the door—I laid hold of them, and Smith left her shawl in my hand—they both got away—I called "Stop thief," and Johnson was brought back—I am quite certain of them both—I found the other boot under a chair near the door, where Smith would pass to go out.</p>

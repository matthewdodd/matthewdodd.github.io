On Sunday evening, the 16th of September, I left the house about a quarter before six o'clock, and left nobody there - the shop was shut - I locked the street-door myself - the whole house is mine - I am the landlord. I returned about twenty minutes after seven o'clock with my wife. I applied the key of the street-door, to unlock it, and found it made no impression on the lock. I instantly tried the handle of the latch, and pushed the door open - it was shut close too and latched, but not then locked. I did not examine the lock at that moment. I heard a noise in the house, apparently at the foot of the stairs, and immediately exclaimed "Good God, there are thieves in the house!" I called out Thieves! and at that instant two men rushed out past me. I made a blow at one of them with my umbrella, and got hold of him, but he got away - they both ran away. I pursued them both down Princes-street, calling Stop thieves! but returned immediately, got a light, and observed that the door leading to the parlour at the foot of the stairs, and which leads into the shop, had been burst open. I found the desk in the shop in confusion - I had left it shut but not locked. I missed a metal watch case out of the window, and a gold key. I have seen the watch-case since. I cannot speak to the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your private residence? A. My family reside in Rup ert-street; I have my meals there, but I sleep at the shop in Princes-street.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went out with him on Sunday night, and came home with him. I saw him try the door - he opened it, and called Thieves! and almost instantly two men came rushing out of the house; the first who rushed out, attempted to strike Mr. Wood with a crow-bar, but I put up my hand, and held the bar tight; he tried to wrench it out of my hand, but I held it so fast he could not get it - he left it in my hand, and got away. Another came out, and I tried to catch hold of him. I knocked off his hat in trying to get hold of him - I picked it up, and in it was a large bag; the constable has got the hat and crow-bar. I cannot say whether the prisoner is either of those persons - he is like the second man - he is not the one who made the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after this did you see the prisoner at the watch-house? A. It might be about an hour or an hour and a quarter, for I went home to recover myself from the fright. When he was shown to me, among others, I said "They have none of them their hats on, and I cannot say without;" all their hats were then put on, and I could not swear to the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Little Argyle-street, Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday evening last, I was near the prosecutor's shop - I saw him and his wife go to the shop door. I was about ten yards from them - I heard a cry of Stop thieves! saw a scuffle at the door, and instantly saw the prisoner bolt from the door and run down Princes-street. I pursued him, came up to him very soon, and caught hold of him, but I could not hold him - he ran swifily; he continued to run down Princes-street. I followed him, calling Stop thief! till he came into Panton-street - he turned into Panton-street; a person there attempted to sieze him, but they both fell, and I instantly secured the prisoner. I had not lost sight of him for an instant from the time I saw him bolt from the door, till I took him - he had no hat on. I brought him back into Princes-street - a watchman came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at the watch-house that you would not swear to the prisoner's person? A. I did not; I said I would swear he was the person who escaped from the house. I was not three yards behind him when he turned into Panton-street; I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Three Fox-court, Long-lane, Smithfield, and am married. On Sunday last, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Princes-street - I heard the cry of Stop thief! I immediately turned round, and got into the road, out of the way. I saw the prisoner as he passed me - he crossed the road as I stood in the middle of the road; he had no hat on; I saw him put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, puil something out, and drop it. I immediately ran and picked it up - it was the watch-case; as soon as I stooped to pick it up, Alcock, the watchman, came up and caught hold of me; I gave itto him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. No; I was certainly rather frightened; but I took particular notice of him, and can swear to him; I was not so much frightened when in the middle of the road as before, as I thought I was then out of the way of the mob; he passed me very quick, but I saw him coming all the way down the pavement.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. James'. On Sunday last, between twenty and twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Coventry-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I crossed over into Princes-street; and some way down Princes-street I saw a great crowd assembled; I got into the centre of it, and heard people say that woman had a watch; I went and demanded it from her, but she would not then give it me; I desired the people to bring her to the watch-house. I then turned from that woman to the prisoner, who was in Mr. Smith's custody; he gave him to me, and told me to take particular care of his hands, for he was dropping something; the prisoner could hear that; I then brought him along Coventry-street; on the way to the watch-house he dropped a key, which I picked up; I took him along Titchbourn-street, into the Horse Shoe public-house, searched him there, and found another key in his coat-pocket; also a candle, a silk handkerchief, two half-crowns, and 6d.; and as I was going along, there was as many as nineteen keys given me by different people, who kept picking them up; the woman gave me the watch-case in the public-house, where I searched the prisoner - I then brought him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge; he said the key I found in his pocket was the key of his own street door; the Magistrate told me to give it to an officer; here is the key I picked up in the street; I call it a skeleton key - I gave up the nineteen keys at the office - I cannot say they dropped from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the persons here who gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130070"></xptr>you those keys? A. No; the one found in his pocket was a common one.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James, Westminster. I received charge of the prisoner on Sunday evening last, with a number of pick lock keys, which I produce - a crow-bar was given to me afterwards, also a hat and bag from Mr. Laing, whom Mrs. Wood took me to- I tried the crow-bar, and found it exactly corresponds with the marks on Mr. Wood's inner door; one of the keys opens his street door.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOD. I delivered the hat, bag, and crow-bar to Mr. Laing - that is the hat and bag I can swear; the hat was put on him at the watch-house, but the lining was out all but one stitch.</p>

            . The hat fitted him, in my opinion - he pulled it over his face, and said it would not; but the lining was then torn out - part of the lock of the inner door was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. This watch-case is mine, and had been in my possession for the last two or three years. I left it hanging on a watch-house in the window on the Saturday evening - it is worth 2s.; it was not attached to a watch - the key was worth 8s.; that has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is more than a watch-case? A. It is a case, and there is a dial and glass in it, but there are no works.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in an ale-house in Leicester-fields. I had occasion to go to Chelsea; I came through Sidney's-alley; and, being rather late, ran violently down the street; another man ran in the same direction - I did not see whether he was without a hat - as I turned into Panton-street, I ran into the arms of a man, and we both went down; Mr. Smith came up in eight or ten minutes, and took me by the collar. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

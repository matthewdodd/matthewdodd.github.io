                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Printing House-lane, Blackfrin—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—on 30th Sept, 1 returned to my room between 11 and 12 o'clock, and found the prisoner there—I locked the door after me, went to the side of the bed, hung my; coat and waistcoat on the bed post, and was in the act of looking for a candle—I said to the prisoner, "Wheeler, will you get into bed?"—he said nothing, but went to the further corner of the room, came hack, and with some sharp instrument inflicted two wounds on my right leg, and two on my right arm, saying, "There, take that"—when I spoke to him he was lying across the bed—I saw nothing in his hand—I rushed to the door unlocked it, ran down stairs, and called for assistance—the prisoner followed me, and sat on the stairs, and while they were looking for a towel he said "What have I done?"—I was faint from loss of blood, and went to the hospital—I never had aay quarrel with him—to the best of my belief he was drunk; he appeared so—when I returned from the hospital I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's. On 9th Sept. Coulson was brought there—I found a wound of five inches is extent and two inches deep on his right arm, and a superficial wound about two inches lower, and on the right leg a wound four inches in extent, and on the same leg another wound of four inches in extent—they were clean cuts, and appeared to be inflicted by a sharp instrument—if a knife had done it, I think there must have been blood on it, but in drawing it out it might be cleaned by the clothes.</p>

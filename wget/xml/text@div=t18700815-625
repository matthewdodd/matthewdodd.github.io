I am shopman to Thomas Bates, 141, King's Road, Chelsea—I know the prisoner as having worked at another shop belonging to Mr. Bates—on 25th July he came into my shop and had beef and bread, and afterwards asked me to give him two shillings for a two shilling piece—he said he was getting on very well in the world, and making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a day—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of bad coins, saying "That is well got up?"—I said "This is a very bad game to be at"—I remarked about the badness of the coins—he said "They are pretty tidy, we buy them for fourpence each"—he said he traveled about to Ports<lb></lb>mouth, Margate, &amp;c.; that he never went twice to the same town, that he and his companions had passed thirty at Barnes's, in the Haymarket, and that when they went their rounds the one who went into the shops only took one bad coin with him, so that if caught no more would be found on him; and the one who remained outside kept all the base money—all the coins he had in his hand corresponded with the one he threw down to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Long-lane, Bermondsey. The prisoner was in my service—when he took goods out, if he received money, it was his duty to bring it home, to me—on the 2nd of April I sent a leg of mutton to Mr. Castles by the prisoner—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never accounted to me for it—on the 4th of April I sent some veal, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he has never accounted for that—on the 17th of April I sent part of a shoulder of mutton, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I never received that.</p>

I reside at 30, Miter Street, Webber Street, Waterloo Road—between 11 and 1 o'clock on the 20th of November, I was in the Westminster Road, walking towards home, when I was suddenly attacked by the prisoner and some others—I was knocked down by a blow on the jaw, and my watch and chain was dragged from my trowsers pocket—I had put them there for safety—my trowsers were torn open from the knee—I held the prisoner, and in the struggle he got away and ran across the road, and, in less than a minute, a constable brought him back to me—I did not lose sight of him—I had never seen him before—the value of the watch and chain was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was on duty in the West<lb></lb>minster Road on this night, and was standing opposite St. Paul's Church, near Tower Street—I saw the prosecutor with his hands in his trowsers pocket, and three men following him—the prisoner was one, and he struck the prosecutor a violent blow on the face which knocked him down—the other two men stooped down and fumbled about the prosecutor—the prisoner then ran across the road—I laid hold of him and said "Halloa, what's your game?"—he said, "Nothing, master"—I said, "What did you knock that man down for?—he said, "It is not me, you have made a mistake"—I said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. In March, last year, I kept a small shop in Free-school-street—a man came into my shop to buy some peppermint-drops—I did not know him at that time—he was dressed as a livery servant—I have seen him since—his name is Barnet Magnus—while he was in the shop, the prisoner came to the door, and offered Magnus 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for some coats—when Magnus came in, he asked for an ounce of peppermint-drops which I served him with—he began to say his master had died, and he had brought these coats to dispose of for the butler—he had them tied up in a bundle—I had not seen them—he told me they were in the bundle, and asked me to allow him to leave them in the parlour—I said, "Yet, you can leave them, but it is strange"—he said, "My good lady, I have met a Jew in the Kent-road, and I really cannot get rid of him," and if I would be so kind as to allow him, he would take them into the parlour; and with that, he walked out of the shop into the parlour—I had not seen the prisoner at that time—Magnus went to the window, which is acrow the room, and began taking out the clothes, and showing them to me—I then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183504060213"></xptr>
               <p>saw that they were coats—he then asked me if I would buy those coats—I told him, no, that I could sell him coats—he said, "My good lady, you can just look at them; I just want you to look at them; that is all"—I said, "Yes, I see them, they are all very well"—he tied them up again—I turned round, and Abrahams was inside the parlour, at the door—I had not seen him before—(I have not the slightest doubt of his being the man—I afterwards saw him in Newgate, and was requested to point out the man—I stood on a form, and was told to stand there till I could see him, and I saw him corat out of a door, and I said, "That is the man"—I am sure he is the man)—while Magnus was showing me the coats, he said they were worth 15 guineas; that was before the prisoner came in; and he said it after<lb></lb>ward too—he said the Jew had offered him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—when I saw the prisoner at the room-door, I said to him, "My good man, what do you want here?"—he said, "My good lady, I hope no offence, I have come to know if the man will take the money for these clothes"—I said, "My good man, what do you want here? I know nothing of you; I wish you would leave my place"—he said, "My good lady, excuse me, but it is a good offer; the coats are worth fifteen guineas"—he said they would fetch him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a sale, and that he kept a shop at the top of the Kent-road—I said, "Well, I know nothing about it"—he said, "My good lady, I have a wife and ten children; I am a respectable man, and keep a respectable shop"—Magnus had gone out at this time—the prisoner asked if I would buy the coats—I said no, I would not—he said, if I would not buy the coats, would I pay the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would leave me a deposit, that he should return the money in less than half an hour—I said I would have nothing to do with it, for I did not know that the coats were not stolen; and then in came Magnus back again—the prisoner wished then to know if I was going to pay this money—I said so, I would have nothing to do with it—he said he knew that the coats could not be stolen—that he knew where the livery servant lived—that he knew Magnus as a livery servant in the Kent-road—he did not call him Magnus, he said he knew that man to be a livery servant, and to live in the Kent-road—there was no other man there at the time—he said he knew that his master had died—he pressed me to advance the money, finding I would not buy them—I then took four sovereigns out of my pocket, and laid them on the table—I took them up again and put them into my pocket, and said, "No, I will have nothing to do with you; go out of my place"—I then went to go to the door to call Susan, who was then living with me, to get rid of these men—Abrahams caught hold of one of my bands, and violently held me, and pushed me by the stomach as I was calling Susan—I said, "You will please to unloose me, and not hold me," and then he did unloose me, but he would not let me go into my shop—I felt frightened, and thought, somehow or other, if I did not give the money, it would be forcibly taken from me; they haviig asked me before that, if I had got 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked, why they should ask me that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did he prevent you? going out of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He laid hold of me, and pressed me violently—I was very ill at the time—the other man stood at the window—I was frightened, being alone—I then laid the seven sovereigns down—Susan did not come near me—Abrahams said, "We want no Susan here, my good lady, come, make haste and give me the money; make haste that I may be gone"—Magnus came and took the sovereigns up off the table—Abrahams was standing next the door—he never moved from the door—he could not shut it, as there was a great mat</p>

               <p>—he had a clothes-bag on his shoulder—he was near enough to see Mag<lb></lb>nus take up the sovereigns—he said, "Pay him, my good lady, pay the man; I will give you a deposit, and will bring you the money in less than half an hour; you are doing a deed of charity"—after Magnus took up the sovereigns, he took the coats up, and laid them on a chair—he said, "Shall I leave them in this handkerchief?"—I said, "I do not know; if you know the man"—he said, "Oh, I will take the handkerchief," Abrahams gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they both went off together, leaving the coats on the chair—neither of them ever returned—they never came to my house again—about a month afterwards, I was walking out; a man, dressed not as a livery servant, came up, and asked me how I did—I turned round, and said, "Why you are the man that had my money"—it was Magnus—he said, "No, my good lady, you are quite mistaken; I keep a respectable tin and brazier's shop in Petticoat-lane"—he showed me a card with a name on it—I said, "I do not want the card; I want my money"—he said, "Will you come and have something to drink?"—I said, "No, you had my money, that is what I want"—I looked for a policeman, but could not see one, and he made his escape—I was walking down the Borough three or four months afterwards with my sister; I had got a little before her; I turned round, and saw Magnus speaking to my sister—I stopped, and asked her what he was saying to her—she said he was asking who I was, what I was, and where I lived—I told her to have nothing to do with him, for he was the man who had my money—he said, "Woman, you have accused me of that before; I am not the man"—he said, "Will you not come and have some drink?" I said, "No, it is my money, and not drink I want"—I could not get a policeman, and he went away—about six or seven weeks ago, I met him again in Fenchurch-street, while the prisoner was in New<lb></lb>gate for another offence, I was walking with my brother; I said, "Here is that Barnet Magnus"—on which he said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Never mind how I do, I am very ill, but I will do you; Mr. Abrahams is now in Newgate, and I shall <hi rend="italic">intercede</hi> about the money you had of mine"—he called me a fool and an ass; said I was drunk, and a mad wo<lb></lb>man—he abused me very much—I was not able to give him in charge—I was ill, and was led in the street by my brother—I could not walk alone—it was on a Sunday—he said, "This is the third time you have charged me with this"—I said, "You are the man"—he was not dressed as a livery servant, but I was sure he was the man—I was not able to give him in charge, and he got away—I saw Abrahams after that—I had met him be<lb></lb>fore that on Holborn-hill, and given him in custody—I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Old Nicholl-street, Bethnal-green—the house, No. 1, Maidstone-place, belongs to my mother, Maria Louisa Cowles—she is a widow—she does not live in the house—there are four rooms in it, which are let out in separate tenements—there is one passage to them—a person named Mills occupies the front parlour—the prisoner lived with us for six years, in a house in Shepherd's-court, opposite, which belongs to my mother also. On Wednesday, the 2nd of June, between one and two o'clock in the day, I went into Mr. Mills' room and missed a pair of sheets, which were my mother's property, from the bed—Mr. Mills had the use and care of them, they are not here—between five and six o'clock in the afternoon I supplied the bed with other sheets, I saw them safe be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock, and fastened the room with a padlock—the prisoner Griffin held the light for me—I came away between eleven and</p>

               <p>twelve o'clock the same night—in consequence of something I heard, I went into the room again, found the door open, the padlock on the floor, with the hasp of the lock on it, and the bed stripped—my mother sent for a policeman—I went to Shepherd's-court, where the prisoners lived, and in a water-closet there found a sheet, pillow-case, bolster, and apron—I did not see the apron when I was in the room, the pillow-case and everything else was there—these are the things which were found in the water-closet—they are my mother's property, and were let to Mr. Mills with the house—I found Griffin behind the door of another house, in the court, and Cole in a nook a little farther on—I and the constable spoke to them, then went to the station, gave inform<lb></lb>ation, and afterwards heard that Griffin was taken—I saw Cole taken, and went with him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant's clerk, and reside at Walthamstow—on 24th April, about 11.20, I was near the Mansion House—there was a great crowd there, and which ever way I turned I saw the prisoner before me, pushing heavily against my chest—I then felt someone's hand in my pocket, and turning sharply round, I saw the prisoner's hand leaving my right-hand trowsers pocket—my purse., containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in my pocket at that time, and when I put my hand in again, it was gone—my watch-chain was hanging from my waistcoat, minus the watch—I immediately followed the prisoner, and caught him; he struggled a great deal, and I was hustled at the same time by several others, and was obliged to leave go—I went after him again, and caught him by the back of his coat, and the piece came out in my hand—I then raised a cry of "Stop thief!" and followed him as well as I was able, and I saw him taken by a constable—this is my purse—I saw it next at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was the evening of the illuminations, and there were some at the Mansion House, but I did not go to see them—there was. a considerable crowd—the prisoner appeared to be pushed against me, and held there—I said before he was 'flung on to me by some other men—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

On 29th April I was on duty at the Mansion House at 11 o'clock—I saw Rouquette there and the prisoner—about 11.20 I heard Rouquette call out "Hold him!"—I looked into the crowd, and I saw the prisoner, bent double, making his way from the crowd with his coat torn—I immediately jumped into the crowd, and caught hold of him by the sleeve—the cloth came away in my hand, and he went through the crowd—another constable came up, and we caught him, and Rouquette came up and said "That is the man who had my watch and purse"—he made no answer—I found this silver knife on him.</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and followed Wright—we started from the European, and when we got by the front door of the Equitable Life Office, Wright had hold of the prisoner—he struggled very violently, and lost the sleeve of his coat in the struggle—other constables came up, and he was taken to the station—this purse was picked up where the struggle took place, and it contained stamps bearing Rouquette's employer's name—I showed it to Rouquette, and he identified it.</p>

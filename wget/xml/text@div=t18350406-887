                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Moss, of 27, Charles-street, Berkeley-square. On the 22nd of March, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was returning from a walk—I did not leave home till late—I do not always walk out so late, but I had been in-doors all day—I am a footman—I am still in the same place—I was perfectly sober—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Windmill-street, Coventry-street, Haymarket—my attention was attracted by a man in the street—whether he was drunk or shamming I do not know, but I went up and spoke to him—he was taken away by a policeman, and after that, there was standing by me, the prisoner, another man, and two girls—both the men were stran<lb></lb>gers to me—the girls asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some drink—they were strangers—I had not spoken to them—I said I had no money, or I would—that was to get rid of them—the prisoner offered in a very kind manner to give me a glass of ale if I would accept it—I accepted the offer—we were to go to the nearest public-house—we went on—several were shut—the prisoner asked his companion if he did not know a house that was open where he could get it—he made some answer which I did not understand—</p>

               <p>we went as far as Long-acre, near Mercer-street, and crossed over into a street which leads to Queen-street, Seven-dials—on the way there, the prisoner and the other man were talking about policemen, and the conversation ended by the prisoner saying, "How can a fellow help himself, when they (meaning the policeman) take him in this way?"—he then put his hand inside mycravat, put his knuckles to my windpipe, and pressed me against the wall forcibly—I could not call for help—he held my head up by his upper knuckles and my chin and jaw—he then put his left hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took my watch out—made a snatch at the guard—he let go of my neck and ran away—he had forcibly thrust me against the wall as I have described before he took the watch—the watch-guard broke by his pulling it—he got posses<lb></lb>sion of the watch and chain and ran away—I immediately pursued him, call<lb></lb>ing "Stop thief," till I got into Neale's-passage, more than one hundred yards—he there tried to get into a doorway on the left of the passage—it was quite dark there—I knew he was there, by his hard breathing—I was afraid to touch him, being afraid of him—I called the police, who came di<lb></lb>rectly from Great St. Andrew's-street, and the prisoner was taken into custo<lb></lb>dy—he immediately threw out his hand, and the watch went against the wall opposite—I heard the glass fall out on some shavings—one of the officers picked up the watch—it is mine—the policeman kept him—I have not a doubt of his person—I was nineteen years old last June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 22nd of March, I was in Great St. Andrew's-street, St. Giles—I went up Neale's-passage, on hearing the cry of "Police"—when I got there, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and the prosecutor standing up—the prisoner stood with his back against the wall—the prosecutor seeing me said, "This man has robbed me of my watch"—I then seized the prisoner by the collar on the right side—my sergeant turned on his light—somebody said, "He has thrown the watch away"—I turned down and found the watch about a yard from his feet with the guard-chain broken—I took him to the station-house—this is the watch.</p>

               <p>CHARLES LUPPIND sworn. - I live at No. 6, Berwick-street, Soho: On the 25th of May, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner came into my auction-rooms, walked up and down several times, as I was standing at the door, and went out; I had a suspicion he had taken something, and followed him to the corner of Dean-street and Compton-street; Blackman, the officer, was passing by, and I told him I suspected that man; I had frequently seen him at the rooms before; Blackman laid hold of him, and took two pair of stockings from under his coat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These stock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060007"></xptr>ings were sent to your rooms to be sold? - A. Yes, that morning, my man had ticketed them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BLACKMAN sworn. - I am an officer; I searched the prisoner the corner of Dean-street and Compton-street, and found these two pair of stockings under his coat (producing them); I found two hundred and one duplicates upon him.</p>

               <p>JAMES DUNNAGE sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Luppino; these are his stockings; I marked the lot upon them; it is my writing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.When had you had a sale before? - A. That day week.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear you had not sold these stockings that day week with the ticket upon them? - A. I am sure they were taken out of the rooms that night.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called Mr. Galabin, Bridge-master, and one other witness, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

On the 3d of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the middle part of the warehouse, I had been putting goods away; I was looking towards the door, I saw some person with their hat upon their head going out of the warehouse; I went towards the door and the dog barked. When I came out I saw the prisoner running into Goldsmith-street, he had a piece of white goods under his left arm; I followed him; I overtook him in Wood-street with the bundle under his arm; I looked at the bundle and thought it was my master's property; I took him and asked him who gave it him, he said some man had given it him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the goods was your master's - A. Yes, it was a piece of callico; I took the prisoner back and the goods, and then I went for the constable.</p>

No, I saw a person in the shop with his hat on. He told the warehouseman when I brought him back that he picked it up in the street by the door.</p>

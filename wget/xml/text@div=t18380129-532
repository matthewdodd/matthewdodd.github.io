                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Henry Hyland Newington—he keeps a china-shop at No. 24, Whitechapel. On the 13th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was outside the door—the plates were outside—I was serving a lady with a dish—the plates were put on a shutter—the prisoner lifted the plates off, and the things jerked—I looked, and saw the prisoner walking off with the plates—I went and caught him at the second door, and asked what he was going to do—he made no answer—we got to the second shop, and he tried to throw them down—I caught them, and he got away, but was brought back in ten minutes after—I am sure that he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. I was on duty about a quarter after seven o'clock on Saturday, the 13th of January, in Aldgate—a boy came to me, and said a man there had stolen some plates—I laid hold of the prisoner, and asked the boy where the shop was—he took me there, and the last witness was at the door—I asked him if he had lost any plates—he said, "Yes, and that is the man that stole them," and then Mr. Newington gave charge of him—I then took him, and locked him up, and turned him over to the county policeman, the offence not being in the City.</p>

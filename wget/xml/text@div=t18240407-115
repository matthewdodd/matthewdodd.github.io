            . I am a book-binder. About the latter end of January, I met the prisoner near East Smithfield. I had known him four or five years, living with Messrs. Jones and Wiggin's, wholesale stationers, of Leadenhall-street; he said</p>

               <p>"I said</p>

               <p>"No, I buy it whole and cut it out," he said he should have something else for me another time; I said he could let me see it, and about a week after he brought me a sheet of paper, and said he had two reams of it at 18 s. I asked what was the trade price, he said he believed it was 28 s. 6 d. I took the sample sheet to Mr. Wiggin's, who gave me money to buy it; he called in an hour for an answer - I told him to bring it to the

            . I am a wholesale stationer, and live at Aldgate; two parcels of paper were sent to me by Mercury; they are these which are now produced; the prisoner had been five years in our service, and left three months ago.

I kept it in my possession till it was taken to the Mansion-house; we traced it to Mr. Gye's.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of March, I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. GYE. I can swear to this paper being ours', all except one ream which I will not be positive of. I believe the cartridge paper to be mine; we lost it from our warehouse in Pudding-lane; we lost thirty or forty reams. A man was convicted here of stealing it - I do not know the prisoner, we found the warehouse unlocked about a week before; the door was broken open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not recognise any of this paper. I shewed Mercury samples of paper which I received from a person in bad circumstances, who was in the paper line.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Watts, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road. On the 18th of November, Stokes came and brought a piece of cotton to pledge—I asked if she was sixteen years old, she said, "Yes"—I said I doubted it, and asked whose it was—she said her mother, Mary Ann Smith's, who lived in Batty-street, Commercial-road, on the left-hand side—Perry was at this time outside, singing a song—I sent for a policeman, who took both the prisoners.</p>

I was sent for—both the prisoners were in the shop then—they said they were sisters, that their mother sent them with it, and they lived in Batty-street—I took them there, and then they said they did not live there, but a woman gave it to them to pawn—I took them to the station, and then they said they lived in Houndsditch—I inquired, and found the prosecutor, who said the prisoners had been at his shop that day, and bought a pair of stockings—I asked if he had lost any cotton, he said he did not know that he had—he went to the station, and owned the cotton—I asked Stokes if that was the shop she took it out of—she said, "Yes."</p>

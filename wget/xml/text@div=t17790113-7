               <p>I was coming along the Poultry on Saturday evening the 2d of January, between the hours of five and seven, it was dark. I saw the two prisoners looking in at Mr. Darvin's window; they were together in company.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Darvin's an open shop? - There were windows; it was not open as some are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130011"></xptr> without glass. I saw the little one, Cowen, take something out of a window that appeared to be broken. I went over the way on purpose to watch them; it was taken out at different times; I could not see what it was as his back was to me. Whatever he took out he gave to the other man; they went backwards and forwards to the window. I watched them about twenty minutes or half an hour. I went and got a constable and we secured them. The stockings were found upon Denham.</p>
               <p>Cowen. He says he was gone half an hour for a constable? - He is pretty right; I was a good while gone for a constable. I went to Watling-street, and the constable was not at home. I returned and found them still stealing, and then went to Sir Robert Ladbroke's for a constable, and when I returned I found them still stealing.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of January, about seven in the evening, Mr. Orme, the constable, came to my house to borrow a staff; I lent him one, and went with him to assist him; when I came to the prosecutor's house, my brother had just taken Cowen. I searched him; there was nothing found upon him; then Denham was brought in by Orme and Dunnington. I was going to search him, but before he was searched he dropped the stockings by the counter.</p>
               <p>DENHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was coming by the Compter, I heard a cry of stop thief! Some people running along dropped the things; I took them up, and put them in my pocket; I did not know who they belonged to. I advertised for the person; the advertisement is in to day's paper.</p>
               <p>COWEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They took me to this man's house and searched me, but found nothing upon me; presently they brought in Denham; I knew nothing of him; I never saw him in my life before. If the man saw me taking them out of the window at several times, why did not he take me in the fact, or with some of the goods upon me at last?</p>

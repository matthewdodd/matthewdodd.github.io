                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, Wellington-place, Old Ford, and am station clerk at the Brick-lane station of the Eastern Coun<lb></lb>ties Railway. The prisoner was in the Company's employment as carman—it was his duty to take back empty packages, to receive the porterage on them, and to account to me the same evening, or next day, for the moneys that he received—on 31st March, he took out seven empty packages to deliver at Mr. Myers' of No. 6, Great Prescott-street, the porterage on which was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he had this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him, it is his delivery sheet—his duty was to receive the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which would be endorsed on the sheet by our clerk—the prisoner had not to enter it anywhere—on 16th April, he took out nine empty packages, the porterage on which amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he did not account to me for that, nor for the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 31st March; he brought back the bills to me, and said that he had not received the money.</p>

D." is the signature of the recipient—I believe that these in the same bill were all delivered on the same day, March 31st—these other packages were delivered by somebody else—the bill has not been used by two carmen, but it has been pasted on since, for economy—I should think that we did not make the mistake of giving the paper to the wrong man, because here is his sig<lb></lb>nature to it—this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is another bill which he took out on that day—the entry was made by myself on 31st March—1 keep this book myself; it is to enter in the totals of all sheets which the prisoner takes out; it is for him alone, as long as he keeps the book—this column is a reference to my cash book, to show that I have paid the money in, which he pays to me—he pays me at night, if he gets home in time; if not he pays me next day—he generally gets home about 8 or 9 o'clock at night, and sometimes earlier—he is out every day in the week with empty packages—our clerk, Mr. Milton, makes out the bills that are given to him—no responsible person goes with him, a boy goes with him—the prisoner has been in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company about twelve months; I have been so about 9 years—there are several sums entered here since 31st March down to 18th April.</p>

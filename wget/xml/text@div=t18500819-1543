                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Evans, of Red Lion-street, Rich-mond. On 15th July I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, leaving my husband up in the front room, which is on the same floor—I was awoke by a pressure on the bed—there was a candle on the mantel-shelf, and I saw a man take a pair of boots from a nail at the side of the bed—it was the prisoner—I had not known him before—I jumped out of bed, and called out, "George, a man has taken your boots away"—the prisoner ran, and tried to get out of the window, by which he had entered—I caught him by the trowsers, and be dropped the boots on the chair, and my husband pursued him—the window had been closed, but not fastened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not go there to steal; I had been in the habit of going to see some girls who used to live next door, and I went in there by mistake; I was very tipsy. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did notice whether he was tipsy or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to sleep in the chair when my wife went to bed—I was awoke by her calling out, and found the prisoner coming out of the bedroom into the room where I was sitting—I asked what business he had there—he said, "All right, Mr. Norman"—(I know a man of that name)—I opened the door, to see whether any one was outside, and be <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> away—I knew him very well, and did not trouble myself to go after him then; but I never knew him come up the yard to any girls, and the girls had been gone six weeks before this—he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

Mrs. Evans made a complaint to me in the morning, and showed me a cap—I have seen the prisoner wear a similar one—in consequence of that, I went in search of him, and found him in the tap-room at the Northumberland Arms, at Kew, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's—I told him he was charged with breaking into the house of Mr. Evans—he said he knew nothing about it—I examined the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house, and found the entrance had been made at the window.</p>

On the 6th of May, at night, I met the prisoner in King William-street, and walked with her down into Thamessstrcet and Monument-yard—I was stopping there talking to her—she ran away all on a sudden—I directly felt in the breast pocket of my coat, and missed my watch—I pursued her, and was stopped by a man—I struck him on the arm, and got from him—the policeman joined me in pursuit, and took her—on returning up King's Head-court I observed something glitter on the ground, and found it was the case of my watch—the policejman brought up a light, and found the watch itself there—the prisoner had passed over that spot.</p>

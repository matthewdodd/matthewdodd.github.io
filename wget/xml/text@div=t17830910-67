               <p>I am the officer that apprehended her, Mr. Lee gave me information on Tuesday night, the second of this month, and I searched the prisoner's room, by the bedside I found this watch.</p>

               <p>I have no friend, nor council, I have nobody to call but my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gregory. I am very ready to give her every advantage of a good character, she lived at our house two years and four months, and never forfeited her character before.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to their being stolen out of the dwelling house, there is no circumstance to bring that home to the prisoner, but what arises from the probability of these being shop goods, and in that case that they must be stolen out of the house, unless they were purchased by somebody, which does not appear to be the case.</p>
               <p>Jury to Gregory. We wish to know whether the prisoner had access to the warehouse? - The ware-house was not locked, it communicates to the dwelling house by two doors, which are never fastened day or night, but we have a watchman sits up all night, and goes his round from the warehouse to the compting-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. She might go to it as he is often absent? - This was done on the Sunday morning, I believe she has acknowledged it.</p>

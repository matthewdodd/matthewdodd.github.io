I was on duty in Little Russell-street, Covent-garden—my attention was drawn to a crowd of persons leaving the Theatre—I saw the prisoner and watched him—he drew something white from a gentleman's pocket—I do not know who the gentleman was—I caught the prisoner directly, and he threw this white handkerchief behind him—he resisted very violently—while I was taking him to the station-house he threw this other handkerchief down in the road.</p>

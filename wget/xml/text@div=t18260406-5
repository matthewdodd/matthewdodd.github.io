On the 3d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with my wife, leaving Ann Thomas, my servant, in charge of the house. We returned about three o'clock in the morning, and found the watchman at the door - he informed me the house had been broken open.</p>
               <p>ANN THOMAS. I am servant to Mr. Hart. I sat up in the front kitchen for my master and mistress till nearly 2 o'clock in the morning, with a light; there is only one window to the kitchen, and that was hasped, and the shutter was closed, and fastened with a wooden bar; it is an inside shutter, lined with tin - I fastened it about eight o'clock; I bolted and locked the front door about ten. I went up stairs to lay down about two, keeping the candle a light; I thought I heard a knock at the front door - I went down, and found the door as I had left it - I opened it, looked about, and saw nobody; I bolted it again, then went to the back parlour door, which I had left nearly closed, and found it wide open - I went into the back parlour; and as I opened the door, between that and the front parlour, this man stood facing me behind the door; he had no light - I had a candle in my hand; I asked what he did there - he said,"I beg your pardon." I asked again what he wanted there; he said nothing more; I shut the door between the two parlours, went about half way up stairs, and cried out, "Murder!" he rushed out of the parlour, and ran down the kitchen stairs; I followed him - he jumped out of the kitchen window, which was then open - it looks into the area - I had left it shut and fastened. I went to the street door, and called the watchman; while I was speaking to him, another watchman and the constable of the night brought the prisoner along; I knew him again, and am sure of his person - I saw sufficient of him in the parlour to know him; they took him away: one of the watchmen remained at the door till they returned; I went into the back parlour, and found a small trinket box was taken off the mantel-piece, and put on a chair, and opened; I had seen it on the shelf before I went up stairs; I missed from it my mistress's scent-box, attached to a chain, seals, and key, also two brooches, and another seal; I had put them into the box that afternoon, after mistress left - a gold pin was also taken from the box. A box of papers had been opned, and the papers strewed about the table. I went into the front parlour, and missed two silver thimbles out of a cotton box on the table, and master's spectacles from the table drawer; the time-piece was taken off the mantel-piece, but not gone. I found a gownpiece taken out of the cupboard, and laid on the same table. I then went into the front kitchen, and found the shutter bar gone, part of the shutter broken away, and a pane of glass was broken near the hasp, which was broken off, and the sash up. I found a pair of men's shoes on the floor of the back kitchen. Price took charge of them. - I found the bar in the coal-hole.</p>

            . I am supervisor of the watch of Islington. About ten minutes past three o'clock on this morning I saw the last witness open the prosecutor's door, with a candle in her hand - she looked into the street, and shut the door again; I heard her two or three minutes afterwards, crying Murder! and saw the prisoner come out of the kitchen window, and over the palisades - I was then within two or three yards of the palisades; I and Haslop pursued, and took him, without losing sight of him; we brought him back to Hart's; the servant said she could swear to him, and we took him to the watch-house. I searched, and found on him two silver thimbles,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060005"></xptr>a gold pin, a small seal, a child's coral, and three kuives. I then went back to Mr. Hart's, and saw the shoes found in the back kitchen - he had no shoes on when I took him. I examined the window - a pane of glass was broken, so that they could reach the hasp, and throw up the window, then break a piece off the shutter, and lift the bar up. I took the shoes to the watch-house - the prisoner said, "Those are my shoes;" I gave them to him, and he put them on; we then searched him again, and found a gold chain, seals, and key. I took him in Cross-street, and as I returned from the watch-house the first time, between the house and the spot where I took him, I found a phosphorus box and matches.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. After Price searched him his coat was thrown on the ground - he had taken it off himself, but I do not know who threw it down - I afterwards examined the pockets, and found a pair of spectacles and case; he was put into the cage; I searched him there again, and in his mouth I found six shillings and two six pences, and tied under his garter I found a gold chain, with a seal, two keys, and a scent-box, in the shape of a watch attached to it.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night of the 5th of May I was on duty near Kensington church; Young was on the opposite side of the way, and about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in company with another; it had then been day-light above an hour; they were coming towards Kensington, in a direction from Hammersmith - the two prisoners had nothing that I knew of at the time; the other man, who has escaped, was carrying a bundle under his left arm; they were all three in a line together, in conversation - I saw them a great distance before I came up to them; I did not know them before; when I saw them there was a watchman named Wilkinson on the side of them - I told him something; he is not here - I called to Young, with a low whistle, but before he came to me the prisoners and the other man came up to me; all three were together; the man who carried the bundle was on the left, Backstay in the middle, and Hayes outside - I saw them all three look down, as if they had done something - I collared the man who had the bundle, and said, "What have you got here?" I said this in the prisoners' hearing - I was answered by Haines, "Grub," which means victuals; the man said, "Bread and cheese;" I said, "That be d - d," and threw the bundle down on the ground - I felt what was in it - I immediately collared Backstay with my left hand, and the man who had the bundle with my right; the handkerchief came off that man's neck - I immediately laid hold of his coat; he got away, but before that Haines ran away; my partner and a watchman who is not here, ran after him, - I was left with Backstay, and the one who is absent - Backstay said, "What do you collar me for? I have got nothing;" he shook about a good deal, and up with his fist and struck me on my left side; he ran away, and made his escape - I turned round to see that he did not take the bundle which laid on the ground - I cried loudly for help - I turned my face to the man who had the bundle as quick as I could, to hold him, and thought I would draw my cutlass, but could not get it out, before I received a slap in the face; he knocked me down on the ground, then put his foot on my breast, and kept kicking me - I held his coat fight, till he slipped it off - I was then left with hat, handkerchief, dark lantern, and coat, and the bundle which contained Mr. Prince's property, all of which came from the man who escaped; my partner returned with Haines, who they had taken - I stood by while he was secured, and then went in search of the other two men, taking the bundle with me - I produced the same bundle afterwards before the Justice at Queen-square; it contained the same things - I am quite sure of both the prisoners' persons; they were full ten minutes in my presence during the scuffle; I saw Haines again the same night; he was taken and brought back - I saw Backstay again on the 14th; I have never had a doubt of his identity - I did not know the officer who apprehended him, and never saw him before in my life - I went in before the Magistrate and said, another man was taken; the officer came up, and said, "Is your name Warren?" I said Yes; he said, "Is this the man?" I said it was - I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The scuffle lasted altogether ten minutes? A. From the first of my seeing them, till they got away - it was after Haines got away, that the man who escaped, put his foot on my breast and treated me as I have described; I should think that lasted five or six minutes; Haines ran away almost directly - I looked at the two men who were loose from me; I never saw either of them before to my knowledge; I am a patrol on the Hammersmith-road - I saw them two miles and a half, or rather better, from Mr. Prince's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You state you were about six minutes on the ground, being kicked by the man who got away? A. Not kicked all that time - I was holding him and scuffling - Backstay had escaped about two minutes before that; he struck me the first blow, but did not knock me down - I was not on the ground six minutes, but was scuffling; I swear Backstay is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think you stated that the place you met them was in the direct road from Hammersmith to London? A. It was. I took Wilkinson to Queen-square, but he was not bound over.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Camden-hill, Kensington. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, near four o'clock, I heard a watchman's rattle spring, and saw a man come running up the New-road, Camden-hill, towards me, in a direction from Kensington church, towards the Uxbridge-road - I saw a watchman and patrol in pursuit of him; there was nobody else near the place; the watchman sprung his rattle, and the patrol hallooed Stop thief! the prisoner Hames came up to me - I told him he must stop; I took him by the collar, and held him till Young, the patrol, came up - I delivered him to him; the spot where something has been found, was pointed out to me, by two boys, Boult and Leeson, about a week after; I took him about forty yards farther, but he would have passed that spot, and I saw him make a stop - it was some time before I heard of any thing having been found; I then got them, and they both pointed out the spot to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose they are here? A. Yes - I think it was a full week afterwards that they pointed it out; it was in the exact road the prisoner had run - it is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310042"></xptr>foot-path leading from Kensington-road to Uxbridge-road; it is a public-road.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday morning, the 6th of May, I was in Kensington, and heard a whistle from Warren, which first called my attention - I turned round, and saw three men coming in a direction from Hammersmith, towards London; one of the three had a bundle on his left arm - I have heard part of Warren's evidence - I came up, and saw him collar two of them, which was the one who had the bundle, and the other was Backstay; I am quite sure of his person; my attention was particularly attracted to him; when I came up I looked him in the face some time - he stood nearest to me - the third man, which was Haines, ran away; I followed him - he ran towards Hammersmith, and turned up a lane called Camden-hill, and about twenty or thirty yards after he entered the lane he made a stop - I observed him put his hand under his coat, as though he was feeling for something - he started and ran again; I saw Hall, the watchman, coming down the lane, and called to him to stop him - he did so; when I came up he gave him up to me; I took him back to the place where I had left Warren, and found the two prisoners, whom I had left him with had escaped. I then handcuffed Haines; I had not lost sight of him at all, and am sure he is the man - nobody was running before me, in the same direction; the other watchman followed me in the pursuit; Boult and another boy pointed out a spot to me - it is the same spot as where Haines stopped and did something under his clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you did not lose sight of Haines till he was taken; how was it that you before said your attention was principally directed to Backstay? A. After he ran away, I said I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long were you with Backstay? A. I might be looking at him for about a minute and a half or so; I saw him again on the 17th of May.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him on the 17th of May, or to this moment, had you any doubt of his identity? A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOULT. I live at Thornton-street, Kensington. On Tuesday, the 8th of May, I was on Camden-hill with Leeson, and found a crow-bar, and Leeson found a cornelian stone - we found them both in the ditch, by mere accident; I gave them to Warren afterwards; we were playing, lost our ball, and went into the ditch to look for it; I pointed out the place to Hall first, and then to Young; it was about a day or two after, I cannot exactly say; I showed them the very same place, as near as I can tell - it might differ a yard or a foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this a public place? A. No, Sir; it is a footpath, but no thoroughfare for carriages; a good many people may pass there - it leads to Camden-hill, from the New-road - it is a short cut- I did not put any mark on the spot, but knew it by the stump of a tree; it was about a yard from the stump.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the place much frequented, compared to the many people who go on the highway? A. Very few people go that way.</p>

            . I live at Thornton-mews, Kensington. I was at play with Boult on the 8th of May, in the fields adjoining the New-road, Kensington. Boult found a crow-bar, and I found a cornelian stone in the lane, in a ditch, by the footpath - Boult pointed the place out aftwerwards. I was not present then; he went with me, and pointed it out to Hall, the watchman; we showed him the place as near as we could judge; it was within three or four feet of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make a mark on the spot? A. No - it was guess work; I pointed it out to Hall the same afternoon, and so did Boult.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why, you was not with him? A. Yes, when he pointed it out to Hall - it was the same afternoon as we found the things.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was not two or three days after? A. No; I am not quite certain that it was the same afternoon, but think so - I think I pointed it out on the Saturday too, we pointed it out to Hall twice; he was at work on the road on Saturday, and we were there; it was on Tuesday we found the things, and I am not certain whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday that we pointed it out to him first; I showed it him again about three days after - it is a public thoroughfare for foot-passengers - a great many people come down that way from Kensington gravel-pits, but not so many as go along the carriage-road.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure you pointed out the same place to Hall? A. Yes; There is a bit of wood put up there to keep the bank up, close to where the crow-bar was, and some lilac there.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL here stated he had received information that Warren, the officer, had been talking with the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any body been speaking to you about any thing? A. An elderly man asked me if I picked up any thing; he said nothing about what I was to say.</p>

            . I produced the bundle containing the property - I have had it ever since - I have also the cornelian stone and the crow-bar - they have been in my custody ever since I received them from the boys - here is the coat which came off the man who escaped.</p>

               <p>MR. PRINCE. The property in this bundle is mine - and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310043"></xptr>was stolen that night - I know them again - they were in the trays which I found in the kennel - the value of the property here is about 7l. or 8l. at the lowest - I should give 7l. to buy them - this cornelian stone is mine, and part of the property stolen that night.</p>


               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They seem small articles? A. Yes; I do not over value them; I have a clock in my house, which I looked at when I was awoke - it was exactly four.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 10, Little Falcon-court, Borough - I go out to washing and charing - Backstay lodged with me for seven months; I recollect Saturday, the 5th of May - he lodged with me then - he came home on that Saturday, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, and went to bed at a quarter-past twelve - he supped at home - it is my custom to take away his candle - I did so that night, at one o'clock - he was then in bed - I sat up that night to finish my ironing, till about twenty minutes past four in the morning - he could not have gone out without coming through my apartment - he never went out till I called him up in the morning at half-past eight o'clock - he was in bed when I called him - he was very well in health; he breakfasted and dined at my house, and went out at nine in the evening - he did not go out before, because it rained, or he was going to his father's; he was very regular in his habits, and never out after ten o'clock - he often went to his father's, sometimes for three days at a stretch, when he had no work; he did not go to see his father that night because it rained so hard - he was only out from nine to ten - he bore a very honest character, and worked hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What impresses it on your mind that it was the 5th of May that he came home before twelve o'clock? A. Why, I left him to keep my place while I went home with my work, which I frequently did - I have no other reason for remembering it, only he came home late; I asked where he had been; he said he had just left a friend twenty minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for knowing it was the 5th of May? A. I read in the newspaper, when I had it with a pint of beer, what a burglary had been done on the 6th, and I was certain the young man was at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you read it in the paper? A. On the Wednesday; I have said all I know, and can say no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at that person (Warren), and tell me if you ever saw him before? A. No, sir, I do not know that I ever saw him in my life, till I saw him here - I swear I never spoke to him - I know Grossmith by seeing him about, but he never had me in any trouble; Falcon-court is close to what is called the Mint, but it is not in it. My husband's name is Samuel - he lives with me, and was at home on this night in bed and asleep by ten o'clock; he slept in the same room as the prisoner, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the 5th of May particularly well? A. I do not remember it particularly, no more than when Grossmith and them came - I do not remember any thing more; I did not read any thing about Backstay in the papers - I read that a burglary had been done.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you said you recollected Backstay was at home on that day? A. No, nothing particular about that day - I heard him say his father lived at Greenwich - I was never at the house - I cannot say where he was on the following Saturday - I know he was at home at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Saturday following? A. I do not pay attention to the day of the month - I know it is June, but cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear where he was on Saturday, the 12th? A. No, I cannot indeed - I will not swear he was at home at ten o'clock - he was not at home all - I thought he was gone to his parents - I did not know he was going - he was not at home on the Friday - I do not think he was at home on Thursday - he left me on Wednesday I think; it was Wednesday evening when I came home from work, that I read the paper - he went away that day - I had been out to work at five o'clock that morning, and did not see him after that - Grossmith only called at my house once - he did not inquire about Backstay - he said nothing - he walked in and walked out - that was on Thursday; I have another lodger, who has been ten years with me, and an old gentleman - nobody else, except my family - I left my husband at home this morning - he is very well - there is nobody here but me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard of Backstay being in custody, did you go to Queen-square? A. I was sent for and went. but was not called upon - some young man came, and said Backstay wanted me; I do not recollect when that was - I did not want to go - I am no relation of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect what you are saying; on your oath, did you or not, when at Queen-square Office, talk to Warren? A. No, I do not know that I spoke to him, on my oath, if I was to die this minute, I do not know that I ever saw the man before to-day with my eyes. I will not swear that I did not talk to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you was Backstay's mother? A. No, I never did; I never owned that I was Backstay's mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You never owned it; is it true then? A. No; my name is Walter; I am sure I did not say so - his mother was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him if he was a father himself; if he was a parent of children? A. No, I did not - I never said such a word, I will take my oath; nor did I say, "If you are a father, be lenient with this young man;" or any thing of the sort - I never spoke to him; he said the other day, "D - n the woman, what business has she here at all?" he said that outside the door several times - a great many people outside heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Warren to be as lenient as possible, because Backstay had been led away by bad people? A. No, I did not; I never said I was his mother, nor any thing to that effect - I had two young women and a young man with me - one of them was his fellow-servant; they are not here; I was not at Queen-square above five minutes, and came away directly when I saw him handcuffed; I was not near the place; I did not go inside no further than the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the officer, or any one there, that you knew he could not he guilty of any such thing, for he was at home at your house all night? A. No. I never said such a word - if Warren will take his oath that way, it is very false - it is a pity he should have his way just as he likes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310044"></xptr>JOHN WARREN. On the 21st of May, when Backstay was under examination at Queen-square, I saw Mrs. Walter there, in the yard - Backstay was in the strong-room; she asked if I was a father, and if I would he lenient to Backstay, for he had been led away by bad company; and in answer to a question of mine, she said she was his mother - a young woman was with her, in a black beaver bonnet; she was quite a girl, not old enough to pass as Backstay's mother - I am sure Walter is the woman who said this to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was this in the yard of Queen-square Office? A. It was; it is a large yard - I saw only four persons besides themselves, and a boy there - she came aside to me, and dropped a curtsey when she spoke - I never saw her before - I had a red waistcoat on; I suppose she knew me by that - I was coming out of the gate - she said, "Are you the officer who apprehended Benjamin Backstay?" I said, "No, but I am the officer that lost him; I can swear to him" - she said, "I suppose you have got children of your own;" I said, "I have; are you his mother?" she said, "Yes I am, be as easy as you can, for he has been led away by bad company." I walked away, and left her - I had only one conversation with her; as I came out of the office into the yard, she met me full butt, and curtsied; there was only a girl with her, a boy, two soldiers, and another in the yard; that young woman has been here all the Session; I believe she is a witness for the prisoners - nobody is here to support my evidence.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did either the boy, the soldiers, or the other person hear a word of the conversation? A. No; nor did the young girl.</p>

               <p>Before Mr. Recorder.</p>
               <p>1081. REBECCA SMITH was indicted for stealing, on the 26th of May, 2 fur tippets, value 4l., the goods of James Salthouse, in his dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILLS. I am shopman to James Salthouse, a linen-draper, of Goswell-road, On the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for Mr. Salthouse - she was informed he was expected in, in half an hour; she went away, and returned in half an hour - I said he had not returned, and asked if she would leave any message for him - she said she supposed I could do as well - that she wanted to select half a dozen fur tippets. She looked at some and came again about twelve - o'clock; she had then selected half a dozen, which I told her the price of; she said she would go and fetch the money - and as she left one of the shopmen came round and asked if I knew what tippets I had on the counter - I counted them, and found one of a particular sort wanting - which I am certain was in the shop when she was there - I went out, and in about a quarter of an hour found her at Northampton-square, and desired her to walk back - she said she would, and did so. I told her I pretty well knew what she had got about her - she said she had no doubt but I did - and begged me to let her go; when she got to the shop she delivered up two tippets which had been shown to her - they might cost about 3l. 10s. I am certain I saw them both when she was with me the last time. I did not know her before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you saw both when she was there, how is it you only missed one? A. I only counted one sort, and missing one, I went after her directly. I counted them all after she left in the morning.</p>

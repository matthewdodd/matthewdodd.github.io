                  </hi>. I have been living with the prisoner for about a year and a half at Twickenham, at No. 1, Drew's-cottages—I left him on Friday, 12th May, and came to London to see my brother—I went back to Twicken<lb></lb>ham on the Monday following; I saw the prisoner, and had some conversa<lb></lb>tion with him—I saw him again on the Tuesday—and on Wednesday he asked me when I was coming for my things—at first I declined calling—he said, "Why not say when you will come, and I will leave the key, so that you can let yourself in n—I said I would come on Friday night—we walked up the Hanworth-road together, and went into the Five Oaks, and had some refreshment—he was perfectly sober then—I went to his house at 3 o'clock on the Saturday morning—I found the key, and let myself in—when I went into his room he was in bed—I said, "Asleep, John?"—he said, "Hollo, girl, how long have you been here?"—I said, I have only just come in"—I asked if he had been at the fair—he said, "No, but I heard of you last night—I said, "Yes, I was there"—I laid down on the side of his bed—I did not take my clothes off; I remained there about three-quarters of an hour; I went to sleep very slightly—towards morning I said, "Well, I shall go now, John, before people are about;" and all of a sudden I felt a pressure on my throat—I saw a spot of blood on his shirt—I gave his arm a push, and saw a razor fall from his hand, and the blood was streaming down off me—I said, "Good God, John, go and fetch a doctor"—he said, "I will, girl"—I took up my dress, and pressed it tightly to my throat, and whilst he was putting on his trousers I ran out of the house—the doctor attended to me, and is attending me now—while he was in prison, the prisoner wrote me a letter—this is it—I believe it to be his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This being read ex<lb></lb>pressed sorrow for having committed such a deed, which would never have happened if he had been sober</hi>).

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Twickenham—I was called to see the prosecutrix on the morning of the 27th May—she was lying on her back outside the door of her house, with a large pool of blood by her side—there was an incised wound across her throat, five inches long, which wounded the windpipe—I applied ligatures, and stitched up the wound, and had her carried up to bed—I attended her for three weeks or a month—she was in very great danger.</p>

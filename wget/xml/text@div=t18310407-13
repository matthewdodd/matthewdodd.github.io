             DE CHAMPEMONT. I am the wife of Alphouse Joseph Marie Morel de Champemont. In 1824 I and my family had occasion to leave town - we lived at <placeName id="t18310407-13-crimeloc89">No. 17, Edward-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310407-13-crimeloc89" type="placeName" value="No. 17, Edward-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any doubt of the watch? A.None.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bilborough, a pawnbroker, in South Audley-street. The gold watch which I produced I received in pawn from the prisoner on the 6th of May, 1829, with two chains, two seals, and a key - I lent 10l. on the whole, and on the 1st of September, 1830, the time for redeeming it having gone by, it was renewed by the prisoner; I am certain of him - I would advance 5l. on the gold watch alone; I might have been induced to have lent 6l. on it - I think it would be worth 10l. to a wearer; I could have sold the watch for 6l. or 7l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There is great caprice in buying things of this kind? A.Things do not always fetch their value - I should not have liked to have sold the watch for 5l.; the maker's name would justify the value - the value depends on the gold and the works.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Suppose that were sent to a pawnbroker's auctioneer to be sold with other condemned pledges, what sum should you have restricted it to be sold at? A. I should not have liked to let it be sold for less than 6l.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PACKER. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a pair of gold handled scissors, which were pawned on the 20th of July last, for 5s., and I believe by the prisoner, in the name of John Broach - I have a doubt about him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERY. I am an officer of Queen-square. In consequence of information obtained from different prosecutors, I went to the prisoner's house, and found there a small miniature and a pair of steel spring scissors; the prosecutrix was with me - she pointed the scissors out, and claimed them; the miniature might be called a brooch - I found that in the little back parlour on the ground floor; I found the duplicate of the gold watch produced by Neate; when I apprehended the prisoner I asked him to what watch the duplicate belonged; he said it was his father's watch.</p>

            . While the prosecutrix was out of town I was at the house; the prisoner was in the habit of coming there from Mr. Byewater's, and seeing the furniture put up and down, he went into the different rooms without being watched during all the time the family were absent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell what year it was? A.1724 - I have got it down; it was 1804 - no, 1824.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent; I never was near the house during the time this lady says she lost her property - Mr. Byewater, in whose employ I was, never did a single job for her during that time; he was not employed that year - the lady employed another person at that time; when she left the house, the room she says she lost the property from, was left open, for the purpose, as I understood, of having a conservatory added to the end of it, and a number of persons must have been employed there - I never saw that conservatory, except from the next house; there was a very curious circumstance happened about a year before 1824 - a certain gentleman, who lived in that house, had this lady's keys; the witness, who has just left, could have answered to that - the gentleman had access to every thing in the house, I suppose, for he carried a very large bunch of keys about with him, and one night in particular he happened to fall into company with a woman in the street, (it is a matter of newspaper history,) she either robbed him, or he said she robbed him of a gold watch - he made a noise about it in the street, and the watchman took her into custody and requested him to leave his address to answer the charge the next day - the gentleman scribbled out something, but instead of leaving that he gave his real name and address at this lady's house, and next morning, when applied to by the officer, he said he never lost his watch, and had never met a woman that night - the fact is, my house is open to every body, and it is a wonder they did not swear to my chairs and tables.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to the PROSECUTRIX. Q. At the time you went out of town were you married to the present prosecutor? A. Yes.</p>

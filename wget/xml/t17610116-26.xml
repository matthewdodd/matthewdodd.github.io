            . The prisoner took a lodging room of me, at two shillings a week. I have known her six years.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come to live in her lodging?</p>
               <p>Lynn. She came about four months ago. I lost out of a chest in my own dwelling room, a pair of sheets, a callico one, a silk gown, and a diaper table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose out of the prisoner's lodging room?</p>
               <p>Lynn. I lost a large bible, and the curtains from her bed, and a saucepan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with them again?</p>
               <p>Lynn. I found them again, by the prisoner's own confession.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she confess it?</p>
               <p>Lynn. I cannot say the time, it was some time ago; I believe about a fortnight ago, I am under a great deal of confusion, my wife lies bed-rid, and I have no-body but myself to attend her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say she had done with them?</p>
               <p>Lynn. She said, she had pawned my bible and the gown for six shillings. I do not remember what she said she pawned the other things for. [The curtains, bible, callica-sheet, gown and saucepan, produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashberner. I have known the prisoner upwards of half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Ashberner. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bedford-street, Bedford-row. These things here produced, were brought by the prisoner at the bar, and pawned at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend upon them, and when were they brought?</p>
               <p>Ashberner. The gown was brought on the twenty-second of November, and pawned for seven shillings, the sheet the twenty-fourth for four shillings, the curtains the nineteenth of December for three shillings, the bible the twenty-fourth for three shillings; the saucepan the twenty-third for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her whose property they were?</p>
               <p>Ashberner. I did. She assured me that they were her own. She had been at our shop to pawn things before, and frequently redeemed them.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor agreed with me; I was to pay the money at so much a we, and I was to fetch them again, and was going for the things when I was taken up. She gave me so long a time to get them again.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you agree she should get them again, and so to forgive her?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife make such an agreement?</p>

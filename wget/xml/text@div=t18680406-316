I keep a stationer's shop, at 101, Houndsditch—on 20th March, the last witness gave me the florin—I was busy, and had not time to mark it—I was not quite sure whether it was good or bad, but in the evening I found it was bad—on the following Monday, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came in for half a gross of song books, they come to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a florin, a sixpence, and a three penny-piece—I tried the florin at once, it was bad—I gave him in charge—he was taxed with the previous occasion, and said that it was a half-crown—I had not noticed him in the shop before.</p>

               <p>Whits Smith. I was officer of the night, going up Old street last Sunday morning about two o'clock, one of the watchmen said to me, there is a thief just come out of the garden (which is called Rus in Urbe garden) the place where the prosecutor has a garden; he was running along with a tea-kettle in one hand and a tea chest in the other, and all the things mentioned, upon him: I bid the watchman run after him, I having a prisoner there; he flung down the things and ran into Bunhill-Row, through the alleys into White cross-street, there he was taken, he was searched and the cups and saucers taken out of his pocket, he said, he found the things in the road, at last he owned he and two more took them out of one of the summer houses.</p>

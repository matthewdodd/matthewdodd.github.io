I had never seen the prisoner till she applied to me for the place of a <rs id="t18181028-98-deflabel572" type="occupation">cook</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18181028-98-defend723 t18181028-98-deflabel572"></join>. She produced a written character to me. I made further application to a man named Fuller, who drove the Waltham coach, to whom she referred me. She came on the 4th of September, and brought no trunk, saying, she came from Waltham, and as soon as she got a little settled, she should send for her clothes. I repeatedly told her to go for her clothes. At the end of a fortnight she went out, at my request, to fetch them. She returned at half-past eleven o'clock at night without them, as she said the person where she had been to fetch them was out. I expressed my disapprobation at it. She said, "Do not say anything to me about it; I am so hurt at the person's being out, that I have cried all the way home." Next day I told her I insisted on her fetching them, as I did not like her to be wearing her fellow-servant's clothes. In the evening I asked why she did not go and fetch them, as I did not like her to come home so late as she did last night. She said"I am going for good then." I asked what she meant by that? She said she had taken it into her head, and she would go that evening. I asked her reasons for going away in that manner? In a short time she went away. I owed her some wages; she did not apply for them. I did not see her afterwards till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. While she was in your service, had you in your possession two 5l. notes - A. Yes; they were in a pocketbook in my bed-room drawer. I saw them safe on the 7th and 8th of September. She left me on the 22d. I had not taken them out. It was separate from all other money, as it belonged to some money, I being executrix to my father. I never had any dealings with Griffiths or Dutton. I marked the notes, and should know them again. - (Looking at two.)-These are them. I searched, and missed them the evening she went away. She was taken three or four days after.</p>

I wrote on it. - (Looks at one.)-This is it. She said her name was Beresford, and she lived at No. 7, Poland-street. It was the evening before she left her place. I gave my boy the note, to get change at Mr. Vipond's. He returned for me to put a name on it. I put the name on it she gave me.</p>

               <p>MRS. YOUNG. The notes are both mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take them. I told Dutton I had a 5l. note in my box, and as soon as I could get it I would pay her. I received the notes of Mrs. Parker, for my wages. I left her in August, and paid Dutton before I went to the service of the prosecutrix. I did not rob her.</p>
               <p>DUTTON re-examined. She often told me she had a 5l. note in her box, and would pay me. She afterwards brought the 5l. note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman to Mr. Richardson, who keeps a wholesale warehouse in Freeman's-court, Cornhill. On the 24th of August I saw the prisoner in a public-house in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I left the house, and in my road home went into another house, and she followed me in—I called for a pint of porter and a small quantity of spirits, and changed half a crown to pay for it—believe she drank part of it—I then fell asleep—I had my watch and seals all safe when I went into the public-house—I slept about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—the landlady awoke me, and I found my watch</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was going up Brick-lane on the 24th of August, and met the prosecutor—I went to the house where he had been drinking—the landlady described the prisoner to me, and I found her in a public-house about an hour after—she denied the charge—I found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver on her, and afterwards found the watch in pawn.</p>

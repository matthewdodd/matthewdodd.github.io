                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Caslon and another—he is a letter-founder. The prisoner was his journeyman—on the 19th of May I saw him take the type metal from where he worked, put it into his pockets, and go down stairs—I suspected him—I saw him put some in front of him on his bench, then take it off, wrap it up in a piece of paper, and put it into his pocket—he went down some time after, but, seeing me follow him, he came up again, and staid there a few minutes—he then went down stairs again, and went out of the house—I followed, and kept close up to him, till we got to the corner of Whitecross-street, which was not far—I then gave him into custody, and the officer found the property upon him in my presence—this is it.</p>

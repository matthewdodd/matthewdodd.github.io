                  </hi>. I am a stone mason—on 11th June, about 4 p.m., I met the prisoners near Victoria Station, and got into conversation with them—I took them into a public-house and gave them some beer—I was the worse for drink, but not drunk—I told them I was going to see my son in Wilton Place—they offered to go and fetch him for me, and left the public-house for a short time—I then walked towards Victoria Station again, and they came and said, "Your son is waiting for you"—I went with them towards Orchard Street—they walked one on each side of me; I had my left hand in my pocket, where I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Fuller tried to pull my hand out of my pocket, and I was thrown on the pavement, but he did not succeed in getting my hand from my pocket—my money was in my hand—he tried to get his hand past mine into my pocket—Richardson still stuck to me—I saw a constable approaching; Fuller started to run—the constable gave chase to him and took him.</p>

I left home about 7.10 in the morning-—I had been in Old Kent Road on business—I got near Victoria Station between 2 and 3; it may have been as early as 1 o'clock—I don't recollect having been in company with any women—there was nothing particular about my clothes except that one of my drawers was over the top of my boot, in consequence of a button coming off; my drawers were not down; I may have said at the police-court that they were—I have ascertained since that my son was at Ascot that day, but I did not know it then—I am married; my wife is living—I did not tell the prisoners that I should like to go to my son instead of going home to my wife, that she should not know that I had been with some women—I believe I said at the police-court that Fuller partially succeeded in getting his hand into my pocket; he could not get it in because there was not room for our two hands—I was not incapable; I was quite capable of stopping their robbing <hi rend="italic">of me</hi>—I did not fall down; they threw me down—I don't know that there was a cab stand at the corner of Orchard Street—I heard the prisoners make statements before the Magis<lb></lb>trate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer—I saw Miles in Orchard Street with the prisoners, about 5.15 p.m., standing still on the pavement; they com<lb></lb>menced scuffling, and Miles fell, and got up and said in their presences that they were trying to rob him—I saw one of them in the act of forcing his hand into Miles's trousers pocket, but I cannot say which of them—I told the constables so—Fuller walked away a few yards along the pavement and commenced running, and the constable took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. Miles was not very drunk; I believe he knew what he was about—it did not appear to me that the man was trying to get Miles's hand out of his pocket to walk along with him—I did any at the police-court I had no suspicion until the man got up—whatever I saw done was not sufficient to make me think he was trying to rob the prosecutor—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners touched him when he was on the ground; it was before he fell that one of the prisoners triad to put his hand into his pocket—I did not see him try to do so a second time—he got up, I believe, without their touching him—Richardson stood perfectly still and Fuller walked along Orchard Street a few yards, and then ran off the pavement; he ran about 20 yards before he was stopped.</p>

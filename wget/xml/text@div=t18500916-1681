                  </hi>. I live at Kennington—the prisoner lived in my service for a month. On 1st Sept. I missed three shifts, three yards of linen cloth, a table-cloth, window blinds, and other things, out of a box at the top of the house, which was kept locked—I am not aware that the prisoner had the key—I locked the keys up when I went out—the things were safe on the Sunday—I called the prisoner up-stairs to overlook the things in the box, to see that I had not overlooked them—they were not there—I told her she must have taken them, and if she would tell me where they were I would forgive her, but she would not—she went down into the coal-cellar—I went after her, and found the things I had missed, in her dirty apron—she was in the kitchen when I brought them out, and she begged me to forgive her—that was about two hours after I had told her I would forgive her—I gave her in charge—there is three yards of this linen; it is new—the prisoner had no business to go to that box at all—this is my property.</p>

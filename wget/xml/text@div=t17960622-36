               <p>On Sunday the 5th of this month, about four in the afternoon, I was going through Bridge-street, Blackfriars; at the end of Earl-street, I saw three men in very close conversation together, their heads were very close; I had a suspicion they were upon no good purposes, that induced me to watch, I believe, the space of three quarters of an hour; I saw Graves go several times to the door of Mr. Hood's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Hood's house? - A. The second door in <placeName id="t17960622-36-crimeloc197">Earl-street, towards Blackfriars</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time passed from Graves's going in to that other person getting in? - A. About a minute; he had about fifteen yards to walk; the prisoner White came, and took a direction nearly opposite the house in the livery-stable gateway; I walked past the gateway to a street beyond it; I stood there, and could see the door, though White in the gateway could not see me; I observed the name of Hood on some premises opposite; I went and rang at the gate, and asked if those were Mr. Hood's premises; the porter came over, and remained with me on the opposite side of the street; when I supposed they had been in a quarter of an hour, I left the porter, and went to Mr. Eddington's, a coal-merchant at the next door; I knocked at the door; the maid came; I asked if any of the family were at home; she said there were not; I went in, and looked out at the stair-case window to see if they could get away backwards; I saw they could not; I then directed the porter to go and ring the bell of the door; the instant he rung the bell, White came out of the livery-stables yard; I came out on the front of the pavement, and could see White's attention; I saw his eyes directed to the man ringing the bell, on the instant of his ringing the bell; he mended his pace to a walk, and then to a walk and run, with eye over his shoulder at the man; I followed him, and caught him with my hands by the collar, and told him he was my prisoner, and endeavoured to force him back to Mr. Hood's house; a number of people came round, and I begged their assistance; somebody came out of Mr. Eddington's, and said they were going out backwards over their tiles; I ran down Mr. Yelloway's yard, and Graves was going from the head of one of the lighters, appearing as if he had hurt himself; there being a distance between the wharf and the lighter, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220057"></xptr>round a plank and cried stop thief, he mended his pace, and ran up the stone steps into Chatham-square; about thirty feet from the top of the steps, there were a parcel of bricks, a number of people were coming, the prisoner got as far as the bricks, and was surrounded immediately, and secured; I took him round to Mr. Hood's door, where the spectator's had got the other prisoner; as I was taking Graves to prison, going through a court, I had hold of him, he made against the wall, as if he meant to drop something, I clapped my head over him, and he struck me in the face with a little crow, and dropped it immediately; I took the crow and put it against his face, and told him I would push it into his head if he did not go quietly; I took him to Newgate, and found nothing upon him but a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A carpenter and builder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Mr.Hood's house afterwards? - A. Yes; after I had secured the prisoner, I returned to the house, that was about a quarter after five; I sent a man to Blackheath, where I understood the family were, and Mr. Hood came immediately to town; I remained in the house till he came, and finding a number of drawers broke open, I compared this crow to the marks of violence on the drawers, and it exactly fitted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (White's Counsel.)</p>
               <p>Q. White was never in the house at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in his house in Blackfriars on the 5th of June? - A. I was; I went out between half past two and three o'clock, I left the house secure, the door was double-locked, and the key was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the house? - A. No; I returned between six and seven, I found the people about the door, the lock had been picked and broke open; I opened the door with the key, the gentlemen were all in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look over the house to see if any thing was taken away? - A. I looked over the things up stairs, and found every thing secure as I left it; three table-spoons, and three tea-spoons, that I had left in a small closet in the kitchen, when I returned, were tied up in a silk handkerchief on the kitchen-table. Mr. Hood's bureaus were all broke open, and his watch was taken out; I believe it to be a walking watch, a pedometer, I did not know he had such a watch in his possession; the constable has the spoons to produce.</p>

In Mr. Hood's dressing-room; I saw the drawers had been wrenched open; in a chair, I saw this timepiece, lying in a basket of linen, (produces it); I turned my head to the right hand, and there was another chair, and a bag with picklock keys in it, and a pair of gloves at the top of it, (producing them.)</p>

               <p>Q. Which is the man? - A. That is the man(pointing to Graves); he seemed very innocent at the time; Fielder came up, and I gave him into his charge, he is not the man that came over the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt as to either of the prisoners, are they the men? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. Q. Have you any means of knowing that man but by his being a swarthy man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man that got over the gate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Graves's defence. I was standing on this lighter, several people ran up stairs, and I ran up stairs, there was a cry of stop thief, and they laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>White's defence. I live over the water, I was coming over Blackfriar's-bridge; I met two persons, one was a man I had let a shop to, I stopped and talked to them some time; I went towards St. Paul's, and then came back to Earl-street, to go home; I went into the gate-way to make water, and this man came and laid hold of me; he said, I must go no further, I was his prisoner; I said, I did not know what he stopped me for, I would go with him any where; a great number of people came about, and they took me to the Compter.</p>
               <p>For the Prosecution.</p>

               <p>I went upon the bridge, upon the craft, between four and five o'clock, to see if I could get a boat to have a ride; as I was coming back, I saw these two men coming over a gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the men you saw jump over the gate? - A. Graves and another.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose gate did they jump over? - A. Mr. Eddington's; he clapped his hand on my shoulder(I thought he would have pushed me over board), and said, damn the boy, what do you do here; he ran up the stairs; I heard a gentleman cry,"stop thief;" I ran up the stairs, and the coal-porter had hold of him; I was going to take hold of him, he put his hand in his pocket, and said, let me go, and I will give you a shilling or two.</p>

On the Wednesday following, the 27th of April, the prisoner offered me the duplicate of a silver watch for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered him half-a-crown for it—he said he would not sell it for that—I asked him twice whose it was, and he said it was his own—I went to Mr. Mills—he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I would not pay that for it.</p>

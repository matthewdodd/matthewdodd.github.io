               <p>Court. The other did not offer to do as he bid him? - I cannot say what the other had in his heart; but there was a drove of cattle coming by at the time, he took my bundle and my money, and the little one rummaged my pockets, and took my handkerchief; the bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment, then they quitted me, I jumped up, and pursued them directly, and the drover assisted me, and we took Edson in the Ditch; he made a spring over the ditch, and jumped into a pond, he had the shirt; Spong got off at that time, he was taken in two hours after; the prisoner Edson sent to a girl that he kept, and by her information we found Spong, he lodged on Saffron-hill. The things I found on Edson were all mine; the shirt was by him, he laid on his face over the ditch; and I found this at the place where they knocked me down, he said he was the wrong person, he knew nothing about it, when he came into the Bull, he said where you got me, you'll find the rest of the things;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230027"></xptr> they went back and looked, and got the bundle out of the pond and his hat.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any promises of favour made to him, if he would discover where the things were, or where his accomplice was? - He said he knew nothing about them, he was not the same person, but when he saw they were going to look for the things; he said where you found me you will find the others, they brought my coat and waistcoat, and two pair of stockings and a handkerchief; that was all the rest of the things.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Highgate with a drove of cattle, and these two prisoners ran past me, Edson was first, and the prosecutor came up immediately after, and said I have been robbed by those two men, we pursued them, and found Edson in the ditch; the other man turned again and treatened to blow my brains out as soon as ever I took hold of Edson; he was over the ditch, Edson on one side, and he on the other; Spong got off.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in the ditch where Edson first lay? - A shirt and a piece linen.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of view had you of Spong the other prisoner? - As he run past me, and as he turned again, threatening to blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Was it late? - It was break of day, I had a full prospect of him when he turned again, he was only the other side of the ditch, I am sure he is the man; I described Spong before I saw him again; I went with Mr. Warrington to look for the things, and we found a hat and a coat in a pond, and a pair of stockings between the hedge and the pond.</p>
               <p>How far is the hedge from the pond? - About fourscore yards from the pond, they were laying in the field near there, we returned the things to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the things you gave the prosecutor when you returned the same things that you found, as you have described? - Yes, Sir, a waistcoat and another pair of stockings I found on the causeway.</p>

             I did not swear positively to him at first, because I was timersome, I never was in such an affair before, being before so many gentlemen; but afterwards I recollected he was the same person.</p>
               <p>Then you had some little doubt when you was before the Justice, whether he was the same man or not? - Not in she least, when I came to see him.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - Never before, I had no doubt in the least when I came to see him, I knew directly they were the same persons.</p>
               <p>Court. You had some doubt, but was made surer by looking at him afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What Justice were they carried before? - Justice Blackborrow.</p>
               <p>(The Court ordered Dinmore and Redgrave to leave the Court till they were called.)</p>
               <p>Court to Parrott. After you were first examined at the Justice's, and did not positively swear to the man; had the Justice's people any conversation with you afterwards? - They told me to find him out among a number of people.</p>
               <p>When did you look at him afterward to be more sure? - In the space of five minutes.</p>
               <p>During that time, and in the room, what conversation had you about the prisoner with Redgrave and Dinmore? - They said nothing to me, only they asked me if I knew the prisoner, and I said it was the same person.</p>
               <p>At the time they told you there was a reward of forty pounds, if the men were convicted? - Nothing at all, nobody told me any such thing.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first know there was a reward? - I never knew any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230028"></xptr>You know it now? - I do not know any thing at all about it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to my house the 13th of this month, I keep the Bull at Holloway, they called me up, and Joe said, he had been robbed, and Parrott and I went to look for the things.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear the little prisoner say any thing about the things before you went out? - Not a word about any thing where they were, he denied being the person, I went with Parrott with his direction, but I did not hear Edson say a word about where the things were, I found the hat and the coat in the pond, and this handkerchief, and a pair of stockings just over a ditch where the prisoner had made an escape over.</p>
               <p>Court to Parrott. Before you went out to look for the things, did you hear Edson say any thing about them? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Shuker. Are you positive that Edson told you that you would find the things where you found him? - He said to me and a Sailor, that is a waiter at Mr. Warrington's, says he, if you look where you found me you will find the things.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long were the two prisoners with you to the time they left you? - The time, I suppose, could not be above two minutes, it was just break of day.</p>
               <p>Then there was but a bad light? - I could see to pick up a pin, it was quite light, I was quite sober, I am sure of the persons of both the prisoners, I am equally sure of Spong, as of the other, if I had seen him among a thousand I should have had no doubt.</p>

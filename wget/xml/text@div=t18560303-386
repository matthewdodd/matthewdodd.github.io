                  </hi>. I am single. On 7th of Feb. last, I was on a visit to my brother, Mr. Armstrong, in Lorimer-road, Newington—the prisoner and her husband resideoin the same house—Mr. Rider is a commercial clerk—the deceased child, Frank Withers Rider, was about seven weeks old—about 10 o'clock on the Thursday morning, I was down stairs in the kitchen—my sister-in-law, Mrs. Armstrong, called to me from the room up stairs, occupied as a sit<lb></lb>ting-room and kitchen by Mr. and Mrs. Rider—I did not go up immediately, and she called a second time, and I then went up and found Mrs. Armstrong and the prisoner—Mrs. Armstrong said in her presence, "This woman has drowned her child, go and find it I"—I went into the prisoner's bed room which is up a few steps and looked in the bed—the child was not there, I returned and said the child was not in the bed—Mrs. Rider said, "You will, find it in a pan in the bed room with a board over it, I put it in"—I returned to the bed room, pushed the board on one side, and saw the infant in the pan—the pan was full of water, the child was with its head downwards on its face and knees—the body was wholly under water—it did not move at all—the prisoner was not in the room at that time, Mrs. Armstrong had taken her down stairs into her own room—I immediately went for medical advice—before I went I saw the prisoner down stairs—she was in a most excited state, quite frantic—she had been confined about seven weeks before—she had been very unsettled in her mind since the first week—this was her first child—she had twice attempted to drown herself, once on New Year's day and again on the Saturday preceding the 7th of Feb.—Dr. Wood at<lb></lb>tended her in her confinement, and saw her several times afterwards—he had given the family directions to watch her—about half an hour before Mrs. Armstrong called me up, I heard the prisoner singing to the child—it was undressed when I found it in the pan, I think it only had a piece of flannel round the waist—she had begun to dress it—there was an unusual calmness in the tone of her voice—both Mr. Rider and my brother were out that day—Dr. Wood gave directions that we should watch her, because he said her brain was affected from a nervous fever, arising from her confinement—I do not think the pan in which the child was found was the pan in which it was washed, but I do not know—she has always been of very temperate habits and exceedingly well conducted.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 22, Union-street, Southwark. I attended the prisoner in her confinement—I had known her casually for some years, but intimately for seven or eight months—she was confined on 18th Dec.—it was a fair confinement, a very good time—she went on very favourably until I discontinued my attendance—I left her well, seven or eight days after her confinement—on 2nd Jan. I was again seat for to see her—I found her in a very excited state, suffering from nervous fever, low fever—I treated her for that—I attended her for eight or ten days, and left her comparatively well—she got gradually better from the time I saw her until I discontinued my attendance—I did not see her again till 3rd Feb., some few days before this occurred—she was then in much a similar way, in an excited state, suffering from nervous fever—that would undoubtedly affect her mind—I advised the family to keep a watch on her—she required looking to, and not to be left alone.</p>

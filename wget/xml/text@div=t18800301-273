I am a labourer, and live at 2, Brooks Cottages, Hendon—I know the prisoner by sight, and by passing the time of day—on 27th January, between 10.30 and 11, I was walking down the Denmark Road and saw the prisoner and the deceased coming round the corner on the kerb—as they came round the woman fell over into the gutter, and the prisoner knelt down on her shoulders with her head between his legs, and he was striking her all up the front part of her as hard as he could, all up the belly—I saw him strike three or four blows—I did not then know that he had a knife in his hand, I saw it after—I then ran up to him and caught hold of him and pulled him off her by his collar—he made a strike at me and said "I will serve you the same, you b—, if you interfere with me"—I then stepped on the kerb away from him, and he stood on his legs and hit the knife right into her ear—several people had come up by then—he pulled her head and shoulders right up off the ground by the knife and shook the head three times to get out the knife—some other men came up—I appealed to them to help me, but they would not—the prisoner continued stabbing her about the head and face—he said "You know I love you, my girl; I don't like to see you in misery, I might as well finish you now," and he put the knife on to her neck to cut her throat—I stepped up a little closer and begged him not to do it, and he did not cut her—he stood back and said to me "You Know me, don't you, mate?"—I said "Yes, I do"—he said "Yes, I know you"—he then said "I prayed to God this should not happen last Sunday night, but it have now, I know I shall not have to live long, shall I? may the Lord have mercy on my poor soul," and he looked round and walked up on to the pavement, and back again into the road—while he was striking her he said it was for going to the Metropolitan Music Hall, dancing at the Metropolitan Music Hall—after he stepped into the road he held up the knife and said "This is the knife the Sisters of Mercy gave to me to do it for you, old girl"—he said "She went to the Metropolitan Music Hall and left my poor children at home starving; they are all lousy; I took them to three different places in Kilburn, and all three of them have been lousy"—he looked round, and then he bolted away, and he ran along Salisbury Road and over the parapet wall of the railway bridge—I followed him; he had the knife in his hand all the while—somebody threw a stone at him and knocked him off the wall—he ran round the railway and right down into Saxby and Palmer's workshop, where all the men were working, and said "Show me the man that took my old</p>

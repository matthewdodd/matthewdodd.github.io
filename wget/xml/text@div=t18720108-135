                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Ruislip—I have known the prisoner for some years—on the night of 18th December, about 10 o'clock, I was in the parlour of the White Bear, kept by Mrs. Weedon—there was some conversation about taking her cart to Uxbridge—the prisoner was too tipsy to go with it—he was <hi rend="italic">chaffed</hi> about it afterwards—I began joking him about it; he got angry and went into the tap-room and sat down—I went into the tap-room, and he said "You b—, you want to black my face"—many of us have blacked his face sometimes when he has been tipsy; I have not—he said he would fetch a stick, and dash my brains out—he went out directly—I followed him, and came up to him about ten or twelve yards off, and I pretended to black his face—I had got no black—I just rubbed my hand over his face—he objected to that—we had a little scuffle, and in the scuffle my hat fell off—I then went back to the house without my hat—I came back again in about ten minutes or quarter of an hour—the prisoner had then got my hat on his head, and a stick in his right hand—I went up to him as quickly as I could, and got hold of him by the collar, and caught hold of his right hand to prevent his hitting me with the stick—he had not made any gesture to strike me—as I took my hat off his head, and put it on my own I felt some sharp instru<lb></lb>ment come down the collar, and my waistcoat, and right down my arm—it did not cut my neck, it caught me on my arm and on my wrist-bone, just as I was drawing my hand away—both my arm and wrist bled a good deal—I got very faint, and Mrs. Weedon let me in—it was about 11.50.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Bear, at Ruislip—on the evening of 18th December the prosecutor and prisoner were at my house—I did not send the prisoner to Uxbridge—I did not see anything of him till 12 o'clock—at that time Bryant came to the door—I admitted him—he was bleeding very much from the right arm, and was very faint—I caught hold of him, and led him in, or he would have fallen—I went out to call a neighbour, and I heard the prisoner say "I will stab any b—that comes near me.</p>

I am surgeon to the police—about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning of 19th December I was called to Mrs. Weedon's, and saw Bryant—he was very faint, his coat was removed from his arm, and I sleeve patched up—I took off a towel that was saturated with blood his found two wounds, one in the centre of the right arm, and one on the wrist,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Serjeant, X</hi> 31). I went to Mrs. Weedon's about 1 o'clock in the morning—I found Bryant lying on a couch very weak and faint, and there was a good deal of blood about the place—I sent for Mr. McEvoy—I went after the prisoner—I found him in a shed adjoining the White Bear, covered over with some straw, asleep—I awoke him, and asked whether he had a knife—he said he had one in his pocket, I searched but did not find one there—I said he would be charged with feloniously cutting and wounding Henry Bryant, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm—he said "Bryant blacked my face, and you can see it is black now"—I turned on my lamp, but saw no black—he then said that Bryant had got him by the throat, and he told him if he did not leave go he would cut his hand, and he did so—he also said something about a stick, but I could not exactly hear what it was—I took him to the station, and on further search, I found this knife down the leg of his trousers; it was pre<lb></lb>vented falling out by a strap that encircled the leg—there was a ole in the pocket through which it, might have slipped—on the way to the station, I was carrying this stick in my hand, which I had found ten or twelve yards from the White Boar, and the prisoner said "Oh, that is the stick I got to Bryant last night."</p>

I am a farmer, at Ruislip—I have known the prisoner twenty years—on the night this happened, I was at my bedroom window, and I heard the prisoner distinctly cry out as if in distress—he seemed as if he was firmly fixed by the prosecutor, and he said "If you don't leave go I will cut you"—he seemed as if he was obliged to do so to make him release his hold; he was acting in self-defence—he is a very inoffensive, harmless man, a labourer about the place—I never knew anything bad in his character—they have played practical jokes on him till he could not stand it any longer—he has been the butt for all the lads, and Bryant has been the leader, and Mrs. Weedon has acted very badly towards the man—he is rather weak in his intellect and he has been used dreadfully—I don't wonder at anything he has done—I have a memorial in his behalf signed by the inhabitants of the parish.</p>

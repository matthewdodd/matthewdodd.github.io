            . I am a cabinet maker; I live in the Curtain-road, Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner from infancy; his character was exemplary in all respects, as a sober, industrious, honest man - he was employed in a cotton manufactory when young - I never heard anything disrespectful of his character - I think this must have been done under mental excitement - about a year and a quarter ago, he lost his father, mother, and sister, who were all the near relatives he had, and he was committed to my care; and he has conducted himself with the strictest propriety - he has had work to do up to the day this transaction took place - he was with me; he never lost his time, and was never out at night, and never had any vicious propensity whatever - I always considered his propensity on the side of virtue - this was under influence of mental excitement; his mind I believe sustained great injury from the loss of his father, mother, and sister; and since that I believe there has been some other causes - he had no medical attendant - he was at work as early as five or six o'clock in the morning on the day of this occurrence - he is a cabinet maker, and a very industrious ingenious young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by mental excitement? A. There has been something of an exchange of sentiment between himself and a female - he met with some difficulty in this attachment; and I believe this was the cause of his leaving my house in the morning - he had received some objections to his overtures that day, and I account for this being the principal cause - many have committed suicide under such circumstances - he has never been in a state of confinement, nor under medical treatment.</p>

               <p>A COMMUNICATION having been made to the Court on the Fourth Day of the Sessions, that the witnesses on the several bills of Indictment preferred before the Middlesex Grand Jury, at Clerkenwell, on the Tuesday and Wednesday, had not been sworn before the Court but by the Crier, at a time when the Court was not sitting. Inquiry was made, and this having been ascertained to be the fact, the learned Judges have determined that the said bills are illegally presented, and no judgment has been passed in those cases; but a Special Commission it is expected will issue for the purpose of fresh bills being preferred, and the cases in which prisoners have been convicted to be re-tried. The Court have accordingly ordered those prisoners, as also those whose cases have not been tried, to be detained; and only passed judgment upon those prisoners against whom Indictments were found at the London and Westminster Sessions. The indictments which have been illegally found are printed in ITALICS.</p>

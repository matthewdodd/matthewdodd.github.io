                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis William Allen, who keeps the City Arms public-house at Ratcliffe. On the afternoon of the 9th of March Jeffries was in my house, and had some gin—I saw him look to the bar-door, and beckon to Brown to come in, which he did—I believe they drank the gin together—Jeffries then tendered a shilling to pay for the gin—my little girl was going to give him change, and he said, "Nevermind, give me half-a-crown for two shillings and sixpenny worth of halfpence"—she said to me, "Can you, mother?"—I said, "Yes," I took a half-crown, put it on the counter, and put my hand on it—when I took my hand off to look at a counterfeit shilling which he offered, he took the half-crown up—he was in the act of counting the halfpence, when I observed to my little girl that one of the shil<lb></lb>lings which he had put down in change for the good half-crown was a coun<lb></lb>terfeit—Jeffries put the half-crown into his waistcoat pocket, and he would not give it up—he had put down two shillings, one of which was a very bad one, and Brown took up the good shilling, the counterfeit one, and the halfpence—I called the pot-boy to get a constable—my husband, who was very ill, closed</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the City Arms. On the 9th of March I saw both the prisoners there—they had half-a-quartern of gin—Jeffries put down a shilling to pay for it—I was going to take it up, and he said, "Stop a minute; will you give me half-a-crown for two shillings and sixpenny-worth of half-pence?"—I asked my mother—she said, "Yes"—she took out half-a-crown, put it on the counter, and Jeffries threw down another shilling—I took up that shilling, and said, "Mother, this is a rank bad one"—Brown said, "Is it a bad one?"—I said, "Yes, it is nothing but a piece of lead"—he then took up the other shilling and the halfpence, and Jeffries took the half-crown—Brown said, "This you must have taken of your brother; you must go back and change it"—Brown put the bad shilling, the other shilling, and the halfpence, into his pocket—my mother told Jeffries he had put the half-crown into his waistcoat pocket, and he denied it—we called the pot-man out of the parlour, and told him to fetch the policeman—the policeman said if we got them out<lb></lb>side he would take them in charge—there was a crowd outside—the prisoners passed through that crowd.</p>

Q.</hi> When Brown took the bad shilling from you to look at, and took up the other money, had Jeffries taken up the half-crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took it up at the same time—I am sure I saw him take it up—he was counting the halfpence, and had put down the two shillings—when Brown took up the other money, Jeffries had taken the half-crown—my mother asked Jeffries for the half-crown, and he denied having it.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock in the evening I was called to the City Arms—at first I mistook the nature of the charge, and begged the prisoners might be put outside before I took them—Mrs. Allen charged them with stealing the half-crown—Jeffries said he had not got it—I had a difficulty in keeping them till the other officer came—I was outside the door, holding them for nine or ten minutes—Jeffries struggled more than Brown—Brown had an opportunity of getting rid of the money—I found seven good sixpences on Brown, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and on Jeffries a penny-piece—Jeffries charged me with taking the half-crown from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jeffries.</hi> I said if I had had the half-crown from the lady, he must have taken it; we were in custody all the time, and had no opportunity of getting rid of the money; if we had been struggling with this man, it is very evident he could not have held us. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, Jeffries struggled to get away, and said I had no authority to keep him; he charged me directly with having taken the half-crown from him; the sergeant and two or three more constables were in the station at the time.</p>

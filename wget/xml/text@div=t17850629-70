            , on the 6th of June, I lost every article that is mentioned, and a great many more; I did not find it out till ten at night, there were seven guineas and a half, four in a box and the rest loose, every thing was in the drawers at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was you from five to ten? - I was in my bar minding my business; I went to put my little boy to bed, I have two doors to my room, I unlocked one, and the moment I went into my room, I found the other door was broke open, I found a parcel of rags, which I call patches, laying about in my room, which had been moved and the work bag taken; I catched the prisoner myself in the street, because he bore a very bad character, and he lodged in my house for a week, and I did not intend to let him lodge there longer, he said himself he was in; nobody saw him there, but I know it must have been him; I had not seen him since he came in, I saw the shift laying on the bed, and a pair of large scissars laying on the bed; I broke his room door open myself, I called first and nobody answered, but the scissars were fetched away, and the thread was left behind, I told him he should not lodge any longer without he paid me a week's lodging, and he had no money; I did not see him till I took him up, the 6th of June was on a Monday, and on the Tuesday morning, met him in Charlotte-street , I laid hold of his collar, says I, you dog, you have robbed me, says he, if you will not send for a constable, I will tell you where your things are, and give you part of the money, and send for my uncle; he said, if I sent for a constable he was sure to be done, I sent for a constable, the minute I went into the house, and I sent for a coach, and he told me he had sold all the things to Mrs. Brown in Fleet-lane, for six shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290094"></xptr> he told me he bought a silk handkerchief for two shillings, and he had but four shillings, I went to Mrs. Brown, and she flew in a great passion, and said, she had no such things in her house, and never saw the boy, I fetched the prisoner to Mrs. Brown's, she denied having anything, pho, pho, says he, you know I sold you them last night, and yo u put me out, and there was a boy that was born with a double chin; in searching him there was a part of a silver locket found in his pocket, which I had in my hand that very day; I put them together as old silver, thinking to sell them the next day, to buy my child a frock, he gave the constable three guineas and a half, as part of my money, and said he would send for his uncle to make up the rest, the constable has the money, I got none of the things of Mrs. Brown, the Justice gave him from Tuesday till Friday to consider who had them, and on Wednesday he told me he sold them to Mrs. Brown; he said he went to his girl in Newtoner's-lane , but she was gone to live with another man, I asked him how he came to break the lock of my door, and he said nobody saw him do it, if he did do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that part of Fleet-lane, where Brown lives, in London or Westminster? - At the bottom next Holborn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, the prosecutrix took the prisoner to the public house in Bedford Square, and sent for me, accordingly I took charge of him, he soon confessed the whole in going to the Justice's, he said, he would restore it as already related, and what money he had about him he would restore again, then he gave me that money.</p>
               <p>Were any promises or threats made use of to make the prisoner confess? - She promised that she would not take him to the Justice if he would confess.</p>
               <p>Was that before he confessed anything? - Yes, I searched him at Justice Blackborough's, and took from him a part of a silver locket, and a pair of scissars.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I have had it for some years, I said, if he would restore all my things again, I would not carry him to the Justice, for it would be the ruin of me, as I had nobody at home, and had two young children, I could not spare time to attend him here; I said if he would restore all my property again.</p>

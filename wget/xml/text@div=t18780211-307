                  </hi>. I am a confectioner of 175, Earl's Court, Kensington—on 17th January I lost the last train at the Mansion House, at 11. 45 or 11.50, and I walked towards Southwark Bridge—I met two women and walked with them over the bridge and turned down a turning on the left-hand side of Southwark Bridge Road—I don't know the name of it—I was never there before—I stopped on the threshold of a house, and hearing a noise at the back, I thought it was not a respectable house and came out and was walking away; one of the women went in the house, the other ran away—I had gone about half a dozen yards when I was knocked down by a blow from behind, and five men were a top of me; they pecked at me and pommelled into me as hard as they</p>

               <p>could, and I was lying there when the policeman came up—I can swear to the two prisoners—Chitty undid my waistcoat and caught hold of my watch; the chain was fastened in my braces and went round my neck—he broke the chain and got it, and the watch; it was a silver one—I did not see what became of him—somebody said "The police are coming," and they scampered off—Sullivan was on the top of me pommelling me—I will swear to him—my face was bleeding, I have the mark now; I could not swear who gave me the blow, because they were all pommelling me—I afterwards met the two police-constables with the prisoners in their custody—I lost my hat as well as my watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 88). I was on duty near Mint Street, South<lb></lb>wark, about 1. 30 on 17th January, and saw a man, who told me there was a man knocked down—I went into Peter Street and then into King Street—I heard a woman cry out "The police are coming," and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground in the gutter at the edge of the kerb, and Sullivan in the act of getting off him—I can't swear to Chitty—there were some others standing about; they ran away when they saw me—I followed Sullivan only down Mint Street into Redcross Street—I lost sight of him—I sprang my rattle—I went on in the same direction, and met both the prisoners in the custody of Cranston—I said "The short man (Sullivan) is the one I saw getting off the prosecutor"—he said nothing to that—on the way to the station we met the prosecutor, he was bleeding from this side of the face—he said "I have lost my hat, my watch, and all my money"—he was very much confused, he seemed to be quite stupid from the violence—he had been drinking—the prisoners were taken to the station and charged—they said they knew nothing about it, they were running after the man with a stick, who had knocked the prosecutor about and robbed him.</p>

You were not running through Duke Street when I men you—I did not tell you to go to the Grapes public-house and tell another policeman to come—I did not have the prosecutor between me and 236 at the waiting-room at the police-court, nor did you say "If you are not careful what you are talking about I shall make it known to the Magistrate"—I did not tell the prosecutor if he would make this charge it would be better for us.</p>

About 1.30 on 17th January I was on duty in the Southwark Bridge Road—I heard a female cry "Murder, police"—I heard a rattle and ran, and at the corner of King Street and Peter Street I saw the two prisoners running in front of me; in fact, they ran right into my face and I caught them, one in each hand—I said "What are you running about?"—they said "We are running after a man that has knocked down a man and robbed him in Mint Street"—I said "No man has gone along here, you two will have to come back to where I heard the rattle spring"—I took them back and met Allen, who said "That little one is the one I saw get up off the man who was knocked down and robbed"—Sullivan said not a word—I afterwards met the prosecutor in Red Cross Street, bleeding from a cut over the eyebrow—I searched the prisoners at the station; on Chitty I found a penny, and on Sullivan a knite.</p>

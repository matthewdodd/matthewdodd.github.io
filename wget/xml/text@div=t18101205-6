She left the duplicate upon the counter, and in half an hour she was to come back to know if I would have it; she did not come, I sent my servant maid for it, as she told me it was a great bargain, she wished me to do so to see what a great bargain it was; I sent a servant with the duplicate, and three pound that it was pawned for, and a shilling to pay the interest.</p>

               <p>Q. You left the house you say in about two hours afterwards - A. I believe it might be two hours; we came out, and going across Portland-place I said I shall not go any further; she says, she is coming to meet me, and then she said, she has lit of a very bad accident; she has put a silver tea pot on the fire and melted it; I am going to get it soldered; I then said, in the name of God, where are you going to; she said she is coming to meet me; I said, who? she replied, my acquaintance she is, you had better take the umbrella, and go back, and I will return to tea: I went back; she told me she was going to get the tea pot mended. I met the young woman at the door, she said, O God, we are robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. In short she went from you - A. Yes, and I went back, as the prisoner said she was coming to tea</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you give that duplicate to - A. To Mr. Fleming's young man; that is the young man, I gave it to him that same evening, I offered him three pound and eleven-pence, he took the three pound and eleven-pence, but he did not give me back the tea-pot.</p>

            . I am a constable. This is the tea-pot that was delivered in my hands by Mrs. Mears; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I got the tea-pot at Mr. Fleming's, I cannot say from which of the young men.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thomas. Is that the pot that was pledged with you for that duplicate - A. It is. The value of it is about seven pound.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my tea-pot, I am positive; I know it by the top, it is rather loose, and there is a mark at the bottom, I have had it upwards of seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say in my defence; Mrs. Sawyer has entirely put it out of my power; I should be exceeding sorry to prejudice you and the jury against them who wish to prejudice me. I leave it to your lordship.</p>

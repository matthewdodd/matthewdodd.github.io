               <p>On the 17th of last month I was going to Houndsditch between eight and nine; the prisoner picked me up, she carried me to her lodgings, to Mr. Lyons's, I had some supper with her, and then called for a bed; the landlady said, it is customary here to pay a couple of shillings for the bed, before you go to bed; it was about eleven when I went to bed, and the prisoner went to bed along with me; then the prisoner said, it is common to pay before we go to bed; very well says I, what is your demand? she said three shillings, I gave it her; after I gave her that I had two guineas in a purse, and seven shillings, and a watch, I was sober, I counted my money before ever I went to bed, and put my purse and my watch in my stockings, as I lay in a strange bed, and put it under the side of the bed I lay on, and a pair of silver buckles were in my shoes; after she was gone to bed, I got up and bolted the door, and saw all was secure, and when I awoke in the morning, between four and five, I found nobody in bed but myself; then I went to look at the door, which way she could get away for I found the door fast, as I made it, then I went and looked at the window, and found it open, and I shut it the night before: It was one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose she got out of the window? - Yes, when the runners were after her, she jumped out of another window, she could nor get out of the other room, because it was locked, and the landlady had the key: I never found my things, I am sure of the prisoner, she was taken up the next day.</p>

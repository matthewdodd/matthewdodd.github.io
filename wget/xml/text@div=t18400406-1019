                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at no. 17, Tavistock-street, in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden. On the 24th of January I had a person in my employ named John Hall—I went to bed that night about five minutes past eleven o'clock—before I went to bed I fastened all the bolts and locks of the doors—I fastened the street-door myself—I have a coal-hole opposite the house covered by an iron plate—if the plate is taken up, a boy could get down—I have measured it—I came down stairs next morning (Saturday) at seven o'clock, and found a door, in the pas<lb></lb>sage leading into the shop, broken open—that had been locked and bolted the night before—I went into the shop, and found every thing in confusion—a square of the glass of the door had been cut away entirely—part of the door is glazed—the bolt of the door is inside—moving the glass would enable a person to undo the lock, the key being inside, but the bolt was forced—it was entirely broken away by force—it is not an outer door—I missed several pieces of black cloth, several rolls of kerseymere, a quan<lb></lb>tity of waistcoat-pieces, two suits of clothes, and the best part of the pro<lb></lb>pety of the shop—the plate was kept in a drawer in the kitchen, and from there were taken some silver table-spoons, some salt-spoons, gravy-spoons, nut-crackers, and a tea-caddy—the parlour door was forced open—I lost, in all, property to the amount of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would cost that to re-purchase it—the coal-cellar door has no fastening to it—if a person dropped down the</p>

               <p>hole they could get into the kitchen by opening a window opposite to the coal-cellar, which was shut down, but was never fastened—it required some strength to move it, for the servant never could lift it up—Hall was an out-door apprentice, and had been with me six months—he was appren<lb></lb>ticed for three years—I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Mr. Smith's service for six months. I have now come from the infirmary of Newgate—I have been there ever since the Saturday morning after I was taken—I have been in custody twice before, the first time was for being seen with a young man of bad cha<lb></lb>racter, I was put in Clerkenwell prison, and remained there a week; the other time was, nearly twelve months after, for being seen with two bad characters—the first time was about three years ago, and the last time about a twelvemonth ago—I was a month in the City Bridewell the last time—I am eighteen years old—I have known the prisoner Bird six months, and Saunders about the same time—I was in the habit of meeting them both at the Duke of Argyle public-house, in Laystall-street, at dif<lb></lb>ferent times, very often—I know a boy named <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—he is about eighteen or nineteen years old—he is not as stout as me—I also know a man named Mitchell, he lived in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel—I became acquainted with him by seeing him in company with Saunders, and I became acquainted <hi rend="italic">with Charley</hi> by seeing him in their company—On Friday evening, the 24th of January, I met the two prisoners at the Duke of Argyle public-house, and for two or three evenings before—it was suggested by Saunders that my master's house should be plundered—he persuaded me to rob my master two or three days before the robbery was actually committed—we met at the Duke of Argyle public-house, in Laystall-street, to arrange it—Saunders, Bird, Mitchell, another man, and the boy <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> I believe, were present—we were together there on the night of the robbery; I be<lb></lb>lieve it was after eleven o'clock—Saunders asked me where the money was kept—I told him I did not know—he asked me where the plate was kept—I told him, in the back-parlour—Saunders proposed that the coal-hole plate in the area should be taken up, and that the boy <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> should go down it, get into the area, and make his way into the house—five of us went to the house, Saunders, Bird, another person, myself, and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>—Mitchell said he would buy any thing we got from the house—we did not go straight from the Duke of Argyle public-house to my master's, we went into a public-house in Holborn first—I do not know the sign, but it is on the left-hand side—I was never there before—Mitchell paid for half-a-pint of gin there, and wished us good evening—we then went to my master's—it may have been a little after twelve o'clock when we got there—the coal-hole plate was taken up by one of them, I do not know which, and the boy got down, went through the kitchen, and opened the street-door—I saw him go through the area window—I remained till the street-door was opened—Saunders was outside stopping by me there, about two or three yards from the door—Bird and the other man went in—Saunders said I had better go home, and to meet him at his own house, in Bedford-court, Bed<lb></lb>ford-street, eight o'clock next evening—I went away by his persuasion—I went to my master's next morning, as usual, and in the evening I went to Saunders's house, as he had appointed—I saw him there, and he said he had fetched the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Smith's house at three o'clock in the morning, and taken away the goods, which were put in the passage, to Mitchell's house, in Petticoat-lane, and there sold some of it, I believe,</p>

               <p>to him, and that there was a portion of the money for me, which he gave me, it was six half-sovereigns—that was all I received—I believe Mitchell is a Jew—Saunders said he had sold it to Mitchell the Jew, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three sovereigns was my share of it—he said there were some cloths, velvets, two suits of clothes, and some plate, which he had taken away—I did not tell of this till I was taken into custody—I do not know when that was—I believe it was a fortnight afterwards, or more—I told the story to my master, in the officer's presence, and went with Weston the same even<lb></lb>ing to a public-house in Leather-lane, I do not know the sign—we went there with the intention of getting Bird, because that was the house he used—the officers were disguised—we found Bird there after a time or two—we went and took a walk, returned, and then found him there—I went up and spoke to him, and had something to drink—I then asked him to come along with me—(the officers were with me)—he said he would, and he did go as far as Greville-street, Leather-lane—I asked him two or three different questions—he said the boy that did the robbery was taken up, with some <hi rend="italic">screws</hi> on him—that is the <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> phrase for keys—I do not know what sort of keys they were—when we got to Greville-street he said he would not go any further—the officer then took him into custody—he used some vulgar expression to me, I do not know what it was, and said if he knew I was going to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> he would have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> for me—in going to the station-house he made a kick at me, and kicked the officer—he did not say any thing then, nor at the station-house, that I know of—I afterwards went with Montgomery and Weston the officers to Saunders's house in Bedford-court, and found him there in bed about three o'clock in the morning—I said nothing to him, but Weston said he was his prisoner—next day I went with Weston, Montgomery, and two or three more, to Mitchell's house, in Petticoat-lane—I do not know the time exactly, but it was about three o'clock—he was not at home—we found him at a public-house in Petticoat-lane, I do not know the name of it—I went into a good many public-houses, to fee if I could find him, and at last went to this one, where he was—I asked him how he did—that was all that passed—he was taken into custody then—I believe Montgomery took him—I believe he tried to get away when he came out, but Montgomery and an<lb></lb>other officer stopped him—I had not said any thing to him about what he was charged with before he tried to make his escape.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him any reason for suspecting them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen the young man there at different times—that was all I could say, and I said I had taken a letter and put it into the post for the servant on the Thursday evening, as the robbery was committed on the Friday—I gave that as a reason to my master—Saunders persuaded me to do so, or I should not.</p>

               <p>that I bad been twice in prison—I swear that I saw Saunders on the Sa<lb></lb>turday evening after the robbery at his own house, about eight o'clock, or a little after, in his bed—it was then, that he gave me the six half-sove<lb></lb>reigns—I knew that morning that my master had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of pro<lb></lb>perty—I took the three sovereigns as my share of it—I remonstrated with Saunders about the smallness of the sum—I did not get any more.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bird.</hi> It was to go to the proposed robbery, and when I refused to go any further 1 was taken into custody.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of February, I went with Hall and the officers to Leather-lane—we were dressed as sailors—I saw Bird in the bar talking to Hall and Weston as I entered—they spoke together a few minutes, and then went out; Hall, Bird, and Weston—I followed them—they walked along the street twenty yards, I should say—Bird instantly stopped, and said, "I will go no further"—Weston said, "You are my prisoner"—he instantly turned round to Hall, and said, "You b—if I had thought you had <hi rend="italic">split</hi> I would have murdered you"—I then likewise took hold of him, and secured him—I afterwards went with Hall to a house in Petticoat-lane, and then to a public-house to apprehend Mitchell—Hall went to the tap-room door, and called a man to him—they conversed together about two minutes—Hall then left him, and told me it was Mitchell, one concerned in the robbery—Mitchell went into the tap-room, then came back, and went out into the hack yard—I followed him—he undid his braces, waistcoat, and coat—I asked where he was going—he said, "To the water-closet"—I told him I should wait till he returned—he then said he would not go—he went back to the tap-room—I followed him—he came out again in a minute, ran to the street-door, and tried to get away—I instantly ran after him, and se<lb></lb>cured him in the middle of the road—I had not mentioned that he was charged with any thing—he was afterwards admitted to bail before the Justice—he gave two false addresses—we could not find him at either—sergeant Chadwick inquired at both.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bird's Defence.</hi> On Friday evening, the 31st of January, I was standing at the door of a public-house in Leather-lane, talking to a female; I saw Hall and two sailors, as I supposed, on the other side of the way; they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060012"></xptr>
               <p>crossed towards me, and went into the public-house where I was standing; I asked Hall who the persons were: he said, one was a brother of his, and another his cousin, and he said to the one he called his cousin, <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi> lend or give me a shilling; "he gave him one, and he paid for some gin with it. I then entered into conversation with him in presence of Weston, he said he and the two sailors were going to the west end of the town, to commit a robbery; he said the two sailors had not been long home from sea; that they were living at the West-end, and were going to the place that night; could I find some false keys or housebreaking implements to take with them, and asked me to accompany them; I said, I did not know where to find such things, nor what was fit for such a purpose; he said, "Come outside, and we will have a bit of talk about it." I went out with him and the two sailors; Weston said, "If we don't make haste, my lads, we shan't be able to do it to-night," and he called a coach, with the inten<lb></lb>turn, I supposed, of going to the West-end, to commit the robbery. When I ascertained their object was to commit a robbery, I refused to go any farther with them, and I returned back, intending to go back to the public-house which I had left, when Weston said, "You are my prisoner," and seized me by the collar. I said to Hall, "You b—, you persuaded me to do what is not right in presence of the officers to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on me; you ought to be murdered;" those were the words I used, but they have been twisted and strained by Weston into something else. Had I not sufficient provocation to use those words? when men, whose duty it is to protect the public, come and lay down such a trap as this, trying to ensnare a man into a share in a robbery, and when he positively refuses to join in it, or go further with them, seize him as a prisoner. Now Weston says I was outside the public-house when they first saw me, and Hall says I was in<lb></lb>side; they directly contradict each other. Consider the number of police-men there at the time, (seven;) was there any necessity at all to come into the public-house to take me when I was standing outside with a female; as to resistance, I made none. I was taken to the station-house, searched, and no money or property found on me; policemen came to see me from every division in the metropolis, and none could say they knew or heard any harm of me; Mrs. Thorpe positively says I was not at the Duke of Argyle in company with Hall; Hall said there were seven persons assembled at that house the day the robbery was committed; Mrs. Thorpe said there was not: when she was first examined she said there was only me, but Weston induced her to get up a second time; he said, "You have come up intending to speak to Mitchell, and you forgot him alto<lb></lb>gether:" she then said she thought about three weeks ago Mitchell was with us, but Hall," she said, "was not there then." It seems to me that Hall brings this charge against me to screen the really guilty parties; he, no doubt, knows who they are, and he will go from here to enjoy with them his guilty earnings: knowing you will not give credit to such an abandoned and worthless wretch, I resign myself, gentlemen, into your hands.</p>

            . I live on Ludgate-hill. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030046"></xptr>16th of November I was in Tower-street, where the prisoner was selling oranges. He offered me four for 6d., then five, at last he said I should have eight - I agreed to take them, and told him I would give him a 1s. 6d. piece, if he would give me 1s.; he said he had no shilling. I gave him 1s., he said he would give me 6d. He turned his back to me; I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and take out a 1s., and put it into his mouth - He gave me the 1s., out of his mouth, and said he had no 6d. - it was a bad 1s., I told him so, and gave it back to him. I gave him 1s. 6d. - he did not return my 1s.; he gave me 2s., one was good, and the other bad. I told him of it, and said I thought he had more bad money about him, and I would have him taken up - He ran away. This was about one o'clock. He gave me a good 1s., and wanted the bad one back, I would not return it. I ran after him, but could not catch him. About three o'clock I saw him in Watling-street; he saw me and ran away. I pursued, and called out, Stop thief! Mr. Hendry came up and secured him. Some money was picked up.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HENDRY. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody - He was running. He took some money out of his pocket and threw it down-it was 1s., a 1s. 6d. piece, and a 6d. - the shilling was bad. I searched him, and found another bad shilling on him.</p>

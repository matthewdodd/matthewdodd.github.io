               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did he say? A. I said it was my property, and it was ridiculous in him to deny it - I said it would be better for him to confess the braces were mine - I have no mark on them - I have sold some of them before I left Bond-street, which is three years ago - I cannot say these are not a pair I sold.</p>

             (police-constable E 140). I took the prisoner - I saw a box on the counter - Mr. Scaith told me he had found a pair of braces in the box. I found this pair of drawers in the box.</p>
               <p>MR. SCAIFE. These are a pair which I know - they were made for a particular man - these are the first I made in this way - they are quite experimental ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you make these experimental ones? A. About two years ago - I have not made any breeches-drawers like these since - I have made some pantaloon-drawers for the same gentleman - he returned these, as he did not approve of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not these been washed? A. I should say decidedly not - I will not swear it; but, on looking at the button-holes, which is the best criterion to go by, I should say they have not - I cut these out myself.</p>

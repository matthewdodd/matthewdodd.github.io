            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge at his master's house, in the parlour; I asked him if he knew any thing about the robbery of the 10l. note, he said he did not; I told him I was well aware that he did - He denied it again; I examined him about it, but said nothing to induce him to confess; he burst into tears, begged forgiveness of his master, and said he would fetch the note; I told him I must go with him-we went up to the work-shop - He opened the trap-door, I got up - He followed and took a piece of paper from between the spars and tiles, which contained a 10l. note; it was wrapped in two papers; his master said it was his. The prisoner cried very much, and begged for mercy.</p>

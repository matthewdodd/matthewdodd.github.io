On the 24th of February, the policeman brought this piece of goods to me - it has my private mark on it - I am quite positive it is mine; but I had not missed it - we had not sold this, nor any other whole piece, when this was brought back - the goods were examined, and this was then missing - I had seen the prisoner before, but do not know her.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Sampson, of Shoreditch. On the 24th of February the prisoner came there between six and seven o'clock - she bought a cup and saucer - she came again, and asked to look at a basin - I turned to get it, and saw she had a plate in her bosom - I took it from her, and found this cotton in her lap - I gave her in charge.</p>

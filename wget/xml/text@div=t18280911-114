            . My husband is a turnkey of the Fleet Prison. The prosecutor's things were placed in the outer archway of the prison; the prisoner sits there daily, with fruit, under the gate - I saw her there and said to her that there was plenty to take care of the goods; she replied Yes, then threw away a basket, which she was sitting on, drew the trunk to her, and sat on it - the cart went away a few minutes before seven o'clock; I saw her on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110083"></xptr>the trunk after the cart was gone, but thought it might be left in her care or it would have been taken from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the prisoner sat there? A. For three months - the fruit people are considered a great nuisance; the Warden has tried every means to keep them away - there are other fruit women there, but nobody was on the box but the prisoner; they sat down by the side of the wall - I only know the prisoner moved the trunk and was on it at eight o'clock and nobody else: I know the other women who sit there by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know another woman was taken up for this and under went three examinations? A. And no doubt if she had been kept, one would have split against the other.</p>

            . I am a Messenger of the Fleet Prison, and live in Fetter-lane. I saw the prisoner sitting on the box between six and seven o'clock, and not having heard of the robbery I took no notice of it - a woman, named Rearden was there, but not on the box; she was taken, on suspicion, before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she not three examinations? A. I believe she had; the prisoner was discharged at the first examination through a mistake, and I took her after that.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Reeves, of Snow-hill. I have a shawl pawned in the name of Ann Williams, on the 2d of September, by a person, who I believe to be the prisoner, but cannot swear positively to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner before that day? A. Yes - I knew her by sight, but not by name; I cannot be mistaken in her - I have seen her twenty or thirty times, and knew her well; I have no doubt of her - we have three hundred or four hundred people in our shop every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say whether she came to your shop on the 2d of September? A. I cannot tell, but believe it to be her who pawned the shawl.</p>

            . I am an officer. Rearden was discharged by direction of Alderman Ansley; the prisoner surrendered herself - she was discharged, and the other remanded; I went to her lodgings, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Rearden was taken first? A. She was - the prisoner came to the office the same day voluntarily, and was discharged; she was in the yard at the second examination.</p>
               <p>- TROAKE. I am the prosecutor's daughter. The trunk was mine; I packed up these articles in it - this shawl was among them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

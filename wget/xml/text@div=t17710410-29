            , at the Statute-hall, at Charing-cross, on the seventh of February, about eleven o'clock: we staid till near three. We both came out together; we went to the Goat alehouse, at Charing-cross; we had a pint of purl: just before we drank it, the prisoners came in; I don't know that I had ever seen them before. The deceased was acquainted with Hewett; she spoke to him: they asked her to drink; she drank a dram with them. They said they were going to dinner at Mother Red-Cap's; they asked us to go with them. I asked how far it was; they said, but a little way. She first consented to go; then I agreed to it. We went out together: she got into Hewett's coach, and I into the other: this was about three o'clock. The coaches were facing the Goat alehouse; they drove to the coach office, in Great Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to separate yourselves?</p>
               <p>Smith. She said she would not ride two in a coach. They stopped about a quarter of an hour, whilst they went into the office; we staid in the coaches the while. Then we went to the Coach and Horses, in Holborn; we got out there, and had a pot of brandy-hot; we staid there about ten minutes; one of the prisoners paid for it: then we went into the separate coaches again, and went to an alehouse, near a turnpike, just before the turnpike;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100023"></xptr> I don't know the sign: we did not get out of the coach; one of the waiters brought us a pint of wine; she had one glass, and I had a; I threw mine down in the coach, because I would not drink it: the prisoners between the two coaches. We went through the turnpike to Mother Red-Cap's; they ordered a dinner there: I believe this was at four o'clock. We both got out of the coaches, and went into the house; they sent out for steaks, and mutton chops, but could not get any; so we had some cold roast beer and bread and cheese for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What drink had you?</p>
               <p>Smith. When we went in we had a pot of brandy hot, and afterwards a pot of beer and two shillings worth of brandy punch. We staid there till after dark; the prisoners paid the reckoning; then we got into the coaches just as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or your companion fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. No. She had a glass of brandy at coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. She was not fuddled when she went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she when she came out?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not perceive that she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was not fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time, till you got into the coach again, whilst you were at this house, were you friendly together?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; very friendly: laughing and joking, and very agreeable together. We got in as before; Hewett's coach went first, we were a good way behind; about an hundred yards. I don't know how we came so far behind: we had been close together all the way going there. They drove from Mother Red-Cap's, on the road to Fig-lane; I did not know where it was. Johnson's coach stood still, whilst Hewett's coach drove on about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Orbell get into the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; into Hewett's coach: he drove first, then Johnson followed him; our coach stopped just turning into <placeName id="t17710410-29-crimeloc158">Fig-lane</placeName>

Then I saw Hewett's coach, about an hundred yards before us, standing still; it was rather dusk; Hewett was upon his coach box. Then I left Johnson in his coach, and went up directly to Hewett's coach: I asked the young woman to let me ride with her; she consented; I opened the door, and got into the coach to her. As soon as I had got into the coach, and had sat down, Hewett came off his box and got into the coach, and began to use Orbell very ill; with that I jumped out.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by using her ill?</p>
               <p>Smith. He began to pull her about, and put his hands up her coats; she squalled out; I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where Johnson was at this time?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not see him after I left his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Smith. I stood against the coach door. I saw him pulling her about very much. Soon after I got out, she fell out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner?</p>
               <p>Smith. She fell upon her backside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether she came down on the step to get out?</p>
               <p>Smith. She fell out with her backside next to the coach, and her head fell backwards under the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Hewett at the time she fell out?</p>
               <p>Smith. Next the other door of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe he did any thing as she came out?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he came out at the same door about a minute after she fell out. She screamed out, got up again, and walked about twenty yards down Fig-lane, before he came out of the coach: he followed her; she fell down just before he came up to her. I did not see Hewett get out of the coach; she had just fell down when he came up to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she walked twenty yards after she fell out of the coach; did you perceive whether she was hurt by the fall?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing after she came out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to have any hurt, as she walked along?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether her head struck against any part of the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; she did not seem to have hurt her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100024"></xptr> head then. When Hewett came up, he began to pull her about, and d - n and c - e her; I did not hear any thing but oaths; she was then upon the ground; he pulled her about, and dragged her upon the ground by her legs: she was holding her petticoats down with one hand, and with the other she catched hold of a little stump; he pulled at her, but could not get her any further; he let her go, and then I ran away: I was much frightened. When I left her, she lay along on the ground, upon her back, and Hewett stood close by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he speaking to her?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; only standing by her side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she call out murder?</p>
               <p>Smith. When she fell out of the coach. I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was she when you left her? Was her cap, handkerchief, bonnet, or cloak off?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were all on when I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you could fix the spot, exactly, where you left her.</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't fix exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the roads that make a bow?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was a good way down the lane from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the covers over her shift sleeves when you left her?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; upon her elbows. I ran to the turnpike at Battle-bridge. I never saw or heard any more of her, nor of the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. What made her fall the second time?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know; she fell upon her side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hit her head?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak when she fell the last time?</p>
               <p>Smith. No. She never spoke after we left Mother Red-Cap's together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her speak to the coachman when he was pulling her about?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pulling her about in the coach, did not she bid him let her alone, or the like?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; she only screamed out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the coach, did she appear to be sober, or how?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see Johnson after you got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnson say any thing to you when he was getting into the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you get out then?</p>
               <p>Smith. I thought he wanted to do something to me that I did not like.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any carriages in the road, as you went to the turnpike?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; two or three drays.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the turnpike, when you met them?</p>
               <p>Smith. A very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you at the turnpike before you saw a coach come?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not see it; I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to the turnpike-man?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not get assistance for your companion that you had left in such distress?</p>
               <p>Smith. I thought she would get away.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first hear she was dead?</p>
               <p>Smith. Last Saturday was se'nnight; I went last Monday was se'nnight to see the body; it was dug up for me to see it.</p>

               <p>Smith. The gentleman ordered me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Smith. At Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from the time this happened till last Monday se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Smith. At my mother's at Knightsbridge; I lay that night with two servant maids of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to see for a place?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had caught the itch; I staid at home to cure myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear of the deceased being dead till this time?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; I had not been out of my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see Johnson's coach?</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the cause of her falling down?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say before the justice? did not you say the cause of her falling down was from some injury she received by falling out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no talk with the turnpike man about them?</p>
               <p>Smith. He asked me if I was one of the young women that had dined at Mother Red Cap's.</p>

               <p>Smith. No.</p>

            . On a Thursday about two months ago, the night the young woman was killed, I was in Hampstead Road about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near the Crown alehouse?</p>
               <p>Martin. I was in it; facing the end of Fig-lane I saw two Hackney coaches stand, one just down Fig-lane, the other near the end of it; with the horses heads towards Pancrass; there were nobody on the boxes, and I saw no passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. How near together?</p>
               <p>Martin. About eight or ten yards; they were pretty close together; I staid about a quarter of an hour, or something more; I thought the coachman might be in there; I went with a view to get a cast to town; when I came out the coaches were gone away; I we nt down Fig-lane; and about thirty or forty yards down I saw something lying in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the coaches standing there did you hear any noise or bustle in the lane?</p>
               <p>Martin. None at all; when I came up to it I found it was a woman; I said, you drunken hussey, or some such thing, what do you lie there for?</p>
               <p>Q. In what position did the body lie?</p>
               <p>Martin. It lay longways in the middle of the road; about one hundred yards from the end of the lane.</p>

            . You left the man pulling her by the legs you say; which way were her legs then?</p>
               <p>Smith. Towards the turnpike house; I left her with her legs towards Pancrass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Crown alehouse?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not know that any house was near.</p>

             till we got a candle and lanthorn; I felt her arm cold; then I thought she was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence about her at that time?</p>
               <p>Martin. I went back for a candle and lanthorn to the Crown; I met a coal cart and a broad wheel waggon at the entrance of the lane; I desired the drivers to stop, for I believed there was a woman dead in the lane. I went and got a candle and lanthorn; as I was coming back again a dray was coming from Pancras; we hollowed out to the man to stop; before he could stop his horses he had passed the body; a gentleman took the candle and lanthorn from me to look at the track of the wheel to see if it had passed over the body; it had passed a yard distance from her; we examined the wheel all round to see if there was any blood upon it, there was not any.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100026"></xptr>Q. Was there any appearance as if any carriage had gone over the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the situation of her cloathes?</p>
               <p>Martin. Her petticoats lay down; her cap lay about a yard off; she had a black silk cloak lay about a yard from her body all over blood; the cloak laid opposite to her; there was a great deal of blood in the road by the body, and the cloak was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her hair bloody?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see better when you came with the candle, had she any cap on?</p>
               <p>Martin. No; her bonnet lay near her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bloody?</p>
               <p>Martin. I did not see; I never saw any handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation of her arms?</p>
               <p>Martin. There was some housewife cuffs, as they call them, down at her wrists; the blood came out of her ears, nose and mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was carried up to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the body any more then?</p>
               <p>Martin. No; I saw the body again the Monday following at the Crown, it was stripped then; she had a cut in her temple; I think the right side; it seemed not to be done with a sharp instrument, but rather with a fall or a blow; her breasts and neck were black all the way down; and both arms were black; especially her left arm; and under her left side there seemed to be a scratch across her breast; two or three little scratches, as if done with nails.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the blood running out of her nose when you came to her, or was it clotted?</p>
               <p>Martin. One of the men took a garter to tie up her chin, and the blood run out of her nose; it was a frosty night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation how the body was? whether it was warm or not when you first touched it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any stump in the road?</p>
               <p>Martin. None that I have ever seen; and I have been up and down the road many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the body that was not black?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was all black as far as I saw; I saw no farther than about her breasts.</p>

            . I came up Fig-lane on the seventh of February about six in the evening; I was driving a dray; I heard a voice call out Johnson twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a man's or a woman's voice?</p>
               <p>Wright. A man's; I was going up towards the Duke of Bedford's gates; I met a coach; the coachman stopped; I did not see him till he came close to me, it was so foggy and dark, and being frosty the coach drove very smooth; he stopped and cried, Hollo! I said, Hollo again; he said, Where am I? I said, Don't you know? he said No, he had lost his road; he said he wanted to go to Grosvenor Square; I desired him to go further on and turn, and I would direct him in the road; he swore an oath, and said, No, he would not, and drove on; he passed on the off side of my horses; I was on the near side; he passed by towards the field side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from where you afterwards found the body?</p>
               <p>Wright. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called to soon after?</p>
               <p>Wright. In about two minutes after, or hardly so long, the man was coming with a candle and lanthorn, and said there was a dead body, and bid me stop, which I did as soon as I could stop my horses; I had passed the body about a yard; I observed a bruise on the left side of the temples; a gentleman came up on horseback; I desired him to let me have his horse to pursue the coachman; he said he could not spare it; her hair seemed pulled about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood?</p>
               <p>Wright. A great deal; when we went to move her she bled very fast from her nose, mouth, and ears; we asked the gentleman where we should take her to; he said to the firsthouse; four of us carried her to the Crown; she had neither cap, bonnet, nor handkerchief on; and had a bit of black ribband upon her wrist; she had something on both her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the coach was it that you heard the person call Johnson?</p>
               <p>Wright. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the voice come from before or behind you?</p>
               <p>Wright. It came towards me as I went up.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100027"></xptr>Q. How soon after that did you hear the wheels of the coach?</p>
               <p>Wright. It was just upon me soon afterwards; it was not above one hundred and forty yards from where I heard the voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment whether the voice was the same as that of the coachman that spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not take so much notice.</p>

            . I stripped the body at the Crown alehouse, and examined the bruises; first I examined her head before she was stripped; her right jaw was broke; it was on Saturday, the day but one after this murder was committed; just behind her right ear her skull was broke and pushed in; there was a scratch upon her left temple, as if done against the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe on the throat?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was only dirty; her breast was scratched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blackness upon the breast and throat that of dirt or blows?</p>
               <p>Wright. I saw no blackness about her breast; the small of her right arm was black for the breadth of three fingers; she was black on the inside of her left arm; and the flesh was broke in through the skin as broad as the top of a finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lower parts of the body?</p>

            . I stripped the body on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. When you first saw the body how did it lie?</p>
               <p>Martin. Lengthways in the road, upon her left side; her left side of her face upon her left arm; her arm was spread from her; and her right arm lay down upon her side; she lay right in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Her head straight or inclined?</p>
               <p>Martin. It lay upon one side of her arm; she lay in a straight line upon the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a wheel have gone over the head and the two arms according to the position she was in?</p>
               <p>Martin. No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she lay in the middle of the road; if a carriage had gone by was it possible to avoid the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was room enough?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes, on both sides to go past; she lay in the middle of the horse road; it is quite a level gravel road; there was room enough for a carriage to have passed on each side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. As she lay straight a carriage might have gone over her, and each wheel have passed her without touching her?</p>
               <p>Martin. The horses could not miss her well.</p>
               <p>Court. The left arm lying extended out she must have been run over in some part?</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. You are used to horses?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for them to go over a body if they can avoid it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of a carriage or horses having been over it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cloak and hat appear as if squeezed in a rut?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was all squeezed among the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look as if naturally dropped into the blood, or pressed in by a wheel?</p>
               <p>Martin. It did not seem as if pressed in by a wheel.</p>
               <p>Murphy again. I saw her at the Crown; I stripped her; her skull was broke on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin broke?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Yes; her left jaw was broke; and from her shoulder to the flat of her arm she was very black; her left side seemed very much mortified within two ribs of her last rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lower parts of her body; her legs or thighs?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Yes; there were no marks of violence there, nor upon any other parts of her body; but five or six marks on her left breast.</p>

             is the man. I have known him some time; our clock had just struck seven. I heard something crack on the road: in about ten minutes afterwards a man came riding upon one horse, and leading another. He said the coach was broke down; he went back to fetch money to pay the turnpike. I saw somebody come staggering after him; I opened the gate: he enquired the way to Brook's mews. I directed him to Mr. Wilkinson's; that was the prisoner

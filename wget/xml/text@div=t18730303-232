                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant at Swansea—on 11th April last I received by post a letter, of which this is a copy; it is signed "John Harvey"—(<hi rend="italic">This stated, "1 have received an inquiry from my nepheu at Dieppe for best steam coal, please favour me with your lowest prices</hi>")—In reply to that I wrote, "I am in receipt of your letter of yesterday; the price of best steam is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; your order shall receive attention"—I wrote on 16th April, saying that I wanted cash unless the hill was approved—I was not satisfied with the way they proposed paying me—in reply to a letter saying that I wanted to he satisfied as to the means of payment, I received a reference to Messrs. Thompson &amp; Co., of 61, Watling Street—I wrote to them, and subsequently received a reply from them stating that John Harvey was a respectable man—I knew a firm of Thompson &amp; Co., and I was under the impression it was the same firm, until I came here after-wards—I then agreed to ship the cargo—I thought it would be more satis-factory to have a personal interview, and I wrote to John Harvey to make arrangements for an interview—I have since ascertained that John Harvey was John Garner—this is the letter I wrote: "Telegram received: Will meet you at Herman's Hotel on Friday"—when I got to Kennan's Hotel I met a person who called himself Johnson, the brother-in-law of John Harvey—in consequence of his own conversation, and from what he said to me, I have since found out that Johnson, who represented himself to be John Harvey's brother-in-law, was, in point of fact, John Harvey, and really John Garner—there was no such man as John Harvey—we spoke of the manner of the shipment and how payment should be made—I told him I would not part with the bills of lading until I had security or the money—he regretted very much John Harvey being from home, and he produced a letter signed "John Harvey," to show that he had full authority to act for him—the day of the appointment was the 17th May—the letter stated, "Whatever arrangements you make with my brother-in-law will be binding on my part, John Harvey"—I concluded I was dealing with Johnson, and that Johnson was the brother-in-law of Harvey—after some conversation he took out a cheque for something like 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "I have a cheque here for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is not endorsed by John Harvey; I have no authority to give it up; I can't part with it; I will tell you what I will do; I have some good bills at home, and if you like I will let you have those as collateral security," and he subsequently wrote on a piece of paper, at my request, "I hand you the following acceptances as collateral security for cargo per <hi rend="italic">Cumberland</hi>"—he signed that "John Harvey"—I expressed surprise that the writing was the same as Harvey's, and he told me that although Harvey was a most respectable man, he had had no education, and that he did all his correspondence; that it was perfectly straightforward, and I should find the whole transaction an honourable one, or words to that effect—I asked him the name of the person he wanted the coals for, and he said "John Hart, his nephew at Rouen," and I wrote the name down in the letter at the time—he said John Harvey was a respectable man, a man well off, and had heavy contracts under Government—he left me for a short time to obtain the bills he had at his house—he returned in about an hour afterwards, and handed me the acceptances, three or four in number—after</p>

               <p>looking at them, I asked him if they were legitimate bills, and he said quite so; that they were trade bills—he said that Freeman, whose name was or one of them, was a Government contractor—one of the bills was for 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed John Harvey, addressed to Mr. Henry Poore, payable at the London and County Bank, Hackney Branch; another, accepted by John Freeman, Government contractor, payable at the London and Provin-cial Bank; and the third was payable at the Bank of England—there was another bill, accepted by a man named Standing, which I received at Swansea—I took the first three to my bankers, and asked them to make inquiries before placing them to my credit—I was not satisfied with any of the bills—I wanted to see John Harvey again, and I made a second appoint-ment with him at Kennan's Hotel—I went there with Sergeant Peck, and he concealed himself—I saw a man who represented himself to be Buckley—I had some conversation with him—he regretted the absence of John Harvey, who, he said, was at Hull, and Johnson, who was at Sunderland—he said he had full authority to act—he said he was a coal merchant at Chalk Farm, and he represented Harvey to be a very respectable man, and Johnson also—we had some conversation, and the result was that I desired him to telegraph to Harvéy, and if he did not return I was to have a tele-gram from him—not receiving the telegram, and Buckley not making an appearance, I started for Dieppe that evening at 7 o'clock—I went first to the ship and saw the captain, and found there were only a few tons out of her—the same morning I went to the broker's, De la Rue, and had some conversation with him, and Hart was sent for—before that I went to Mr. Le Prate, who was the purchaser of the cargo from John Hart, and received the bills of lading and the sale-note from him—the prisoner came to Mr. De la Rue's office—this is the document that was handed to me by Le Prate, it is a sale to him by John Hart—my invoice price was 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the coals were sold to Le Prate for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I showed Hart the bill of lading, and asked him what he knew about it, how he got possession of it—he said he got it from John Harvey—I said "Are you aware that that cargo is stolen?"—he said "No; I have bought the cargo of John Harvey, and the cargo is mine"—I said "I don't wish to charge you with stealing it, but I must ask you to give possession, as it was stolen"—he said "No, I shall not give possession; I cannot, because I have borrowed money on the bills of lading; I borrowed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Spratt, who is a shoemaker in Eleanor Street, Hackney Road"—I pressed him, and Mr. De la Rue pressed him, to give possession of the bills of lading—I said, "Where is John Harvey?"—he hesitated, and said he was not in Dieppe—I asked him then where John Garner was, as I had ascertained from Mr. De la Rue that he was staying at the hotel with Hart—I asked him to fetch John Garner—he went away and came back again in a few minutes, and said that John Garner had left that morning for Rouen, and he declined to give 'me the bill of lading or the possession of the cargo—I went to Hilton's Hotel at Dieppe—I asked the landlord for the visitors' book, and found the two names of John Garner and John Hart together—John Garner was in the same handwriting as that of John Harvey—I went again to the hotel about 10 o'clock, and found John Garner in bed—that was after Hart had told me he had gone to Rouen—I had some difficulty in waking him until I put a candle to his nose—I asked him whether he knew me—I called him Johnson—he hesitated for some time, and then said he did know me—I asked him if he was going to hand me over the money for the cargo—he said he could not do that—I desired him not to move</p>

               <p>from there for twenty-four hours, thinking he would leave by the boat at night—I went on board, but did not find him there when we got to England, but he came two or three days afterwards, and he was taken into custody and tried—I left Hart behind—I afterwards received this letter from him: "25th January. Dear Sir,—I have been in London some time looking for a situation, which I am promised next month. Since obtaining the above, I have been informed that there is in the hands of the police a warrant for them to take me into custody, in connection with the coals; I can only say I am innocent, which I believe you know, although I am sorry for what I have done. I have lost all my money, and find my wife and children starving. I hope you will allow me to earn my living and Bupport my family; if not, I am willing to go before any Jury, but I hope you will spare me the trouble and disgrace. An answer will greatly oblige, J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I arrived at Dieppe I saw Mr. De la Rue, the broker—he sent for John Hart, and he came at ones—I said, "Is your name John Hart?" and he said, "Yes"—he was asked where Garner was, and he said he had left that morning for Rouen—I told him that I believed he was John Harvey, and that he was a swindler, and that he had swindled me out of a cargo of coal—I also said I hoped he, John Hart, had nothing to do with it—Hart said he had purchased the coals of John Harvey—I dare say I said, "He is your uncle"—Hart said, "No, I have never seen him but twice before"—he said Garner was a friend of his, and was staying with him at Hilton's Hotel till that morning—I pointed out Freeman's signature to him on the bill of exchange, and said I believed it was his—he said it was not—I asked him who endorsed the bill of lading—he said John Harvey, and that he believed it was done in Dieppe—I told him I knew Garner as Johnson, and that Garner had admitted he wrote the letters as Harvey—he said he knew nothing of that, that he had purchased the cargo of Harvey, and had sold it to Messrs. Verdu and Le Prate—I told him he had sold the coals at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than they cost, and I believe he said he knew nothing of that—I then went to Hilton's Hotel, where I saw Garner in bed—Hart said he had borrowed a sum of money of Mr. Spratt, on account of the cargo, before he could get possession of the bills of lading, that was in part payment of the coal—Garner's name was not used in the matter at all; it was Harvey all the time—everything the prisoner said was apparently open, and straight<lb></lb>forward—I went several times to Hilton's, but it was at 10 o'clock at night I found Garner in bed—it was from 8 to 10 in the morning that I saw Hart—I could not find Garner all day.</p>

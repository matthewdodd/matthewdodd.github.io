                  </hi>. I live in Copthall-terrace, St. John's-wood. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 24th of Dec, I was going up Park-road, towards my home, which leads from the top of Baker-street, towards St. John's-wood chapel—I was an out-patient of the hospital at the time—I was walking very lame—Smith came and asked me the way to Caroline-place—I did not recol<lb></lb>lect it for the moment—I had not been speaking to her for three minutes, when I heard a snap, and found my watch-guard was snapped in two, and my watch gone—I accused her of stealing ray watch—she ran away, and as well as I was able I pursued her, and cried out, "Police," and "Stop thief"—I got up with her when I had run forty or fifty yards—the instant that I got hold of her, she turned, and threw the watch away—I held her a minute or two, when Davis came across the road, took me by the shoulders, and asked me bow dared I insult a respectable woman, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me about with some violence, but I still kept hold of Smith, and then Davis struck me under the ear with his clenched fist—my leg gave way, and I fell down, but I still kept hold of Smith, and struggled very much with her—a shorter man came up, and kicked me in the side while I was down—I still kept Smith—a soldier came up, and he assisted the prisoners in getting away—I afterwards found I had lost a breast-pin, and from 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after they got away, my watch was brought to me by some groom—there was about two inches of chain hanging to my watch—I am quite sure that Davis is the man—there are lamps on each side of the road—I went to the station next morning, and gave a description of them—on the 15th of Jan. I was returning from Bromp<lb></lb>ton—I met Smith with a man—they went down towards Piccadilly, and turned up to a street that leads to Curzon-street, and just as they got to the top of Brook-street—(I knew the man as belonging to the same party)—I went up to Smith, and saw her—I intended to have given her into custody, but could not see a policeman—I went into a public-house to see if I could see any one there that I knew—I treated Smith and the man with four penny worth of gin—I saw no one there—I came out—we parted, aad I went to Vine-street, and gave information—I did not take Smith that night, because I was lame, and I knew that the man who was with wier would not allow me to take her.</p>

               <p>quite certain when they turned down Down-street—I spoke to the man, and asked him if he would have a glass of anything—I was sure then that Smith was the thief—we went into the public-house together—there was no one in the house but a female—there was no one drinking there—we drank a quar<lb></lb>tern of gin—we had not more than one glass each—I did not 6ay a word to the woman—I did not address her at all—I did not say anything about my having lost my watch—I went out, leaving them in—they went on towards Hertford-street, and I followed them—it was a dark street, and no one to be seen for some time—I have not seen Davis since, or conversed with him—I have not been in his company to my knowledge—I know the Harp public-house, it is in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove—I have not been in his company since this at the Harp public-house—I have been there, but the sergeant of police was with me—I was not there when Neebone was with me—I have never seen Neebone before to my knowledge—I do not recollect Neebone bringing in a pair of boots and shoes—I swear that within three weeks or a month after the robbery I was not drinking in the Harp with Davis to my knowledge—he might be in the house—I was not drinking with him—I am quite certain about that—Mr. Moseley was not before the Magistrate—he was in the country at. the time—I had known him before—I do not know what he is—I believe he is out of business—I had seen him before at his father's, who is a publican—he came in consequence of seeing this in the paper—he came to me at the Botanical Garden, where I am an officer.</p>

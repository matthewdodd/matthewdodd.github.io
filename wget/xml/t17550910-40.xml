I said, I will be with you, and immediately rung my door bell, and open'd the passage, in order to get at him; he jump'd from the wall into the passage. I called out thief, and watch, no watch came; my own servants came, and a servant belonging to a gentleman, that lives next door. The gate at the farthest end of the passage, that opens out upon Constitution-hill, was lock'd; upon seeing that, I knew the man must be somewhat near; we found some glass broken, and found the bundle of the goods mention'd, hanging on the inside of the wall, on a tenter-hook, the wall being full of them; they were wrapped, up in a blanket; the woman let us in to search the house, where we suspected he was got in from the area; we search'd about, and at last found the prisoner, and seiz'd him in the privy, behind the door. By this time, there was a great crowd of people in the street; we took him to the round-house; at coming back, we thought proper to search the houses near, where he was, to see if he had any accomplices, and we found at Mr. Vernon's, by telling them what things I had found , they were taken from them; and upon going into the room, we found the things tumbled about, and a trunk open, in which we were told, had been some of the things.</p>

            . Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner with this copper in Fenchurch-street near Aldgate. I ask'd him where he was going, and what he had got? He said he had got some wood, I laid my hand upon it, and said, it does not feel like wood; he said, to tell you the truth, it is copper. I asked him where he brought it from? He said he could not tell, or would not tell. I asked him where he was going to carry it? He said to White-chapel. I took him to the watch-house. Then he said he took it out of his master's warehouse, but he did not mention his master's name .</p>
               <p>Q. to Frith. Did he own to you whose property the copper was?</p>
               <p>Frith . He said it was the property of Mr. Stevens, and begg'd for mercy.</p>

            . I was in the watch-house, and took the prisoner to the Compter; he would not give us an account how he came by the copper, I went about after that to the copper-smiths to inquire who had lost such pieces.</p>
               <p>Frith. I can't say I had made such strict examination as I have done since. That I am certain is my master's. I have measured one of the pieces to see if I could cut a 17 inch bottom out of it. I have had it in my hand scores of times. We miss'd such as the other pieces, but they not being so remarkable, I will not swear to them, I never suspected him of any such thing before.</p>

               <p>I bought the copper of a man that lives on the other side the water, he leaving off business, being going to sea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer at 10, Trinity Street, Borough—in October last I was acquainted with a personamed Cogswell, and he introduced the prisoner to me about the 1st or 2nd of that month—at first Cogswell came and arranged for me to advance the prisoner some money, and I afterwards saw the prisoner—he represented to me that Captain Bayard was about to foreclose on His goods, and that there was a balance of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to Captain Bayard—he said he was behind and Captain Bayard had threatened to send a man in possession, and that Captain Bayard held a bill of sale as security—I said I would agree to lend him the money if Captain Bayard was going to sell; I would lend him the money if I had a proper security—he said he would agree to any security in reason—I said "You are a stranger to me, Mr. O'Neill; I don't know what your position is, but I will advance the money, but I must have your authority to sell by auction as an auctioneer"—he agreed to do it and signed this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the authority to sell, and under that authority I put a person into possession of the premises in Tooley-Street—I asked him at the time he signed that if the goods were encumbered, and he said "Certainly not, not a shilling, barring Captain Bayard's claim"—I went to Captain Bayard and paid him out—that was on the 6th October, the same day the authority was signed—I paid him 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took a receipt but I have mislaid it—I got the bill of sale from Captain Bayard, but the satisfaction was registered on it, and I had to give it up to the solicitor—on the 7th or 8th October I advanced a further sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. O'Neill—he came with Mr. Cogswell to my office, and I gave the money to O'Neill in his presence—on the 9th October I received a bill of sale in the place of</p>

               <p>the authority to sell—the defendant came to me with reference to it, and he said that a Dutchman was about taking him in partnership, and he would be able to pay the money in about fourteen days, but the Dutchman had a great objection to a registered bill of sale, and if I would allow him to enter satisfaction that he could get the money and pay me, and I agreed to do so—the bill of sale was given after that—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 9th October, and was a bill of sale by way of mortgage to secure</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) That has never been registered—I thought the money would be forthcoming—I only agreed to charge him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for all my trouble—I first found out there was a prior charge nine or ten days afterwards—a letter was sent to me by my man, and I went to the premises in Tooley Street and found other persons in possession—I was induced to pay the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Captain Bayard and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner on the faith that the goods were unencumbered, and I knew there was sufficient security to pay—I should not have advanced another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told Mr. Benson the only matters that influenced my mind was this document and the possession of the goods, and that is what I say still—I certainly thought when I had possession it was my furniture—I did not think there were other claims—I was satisfied with having that authority and having possession of the goods on the faith of what he said—he distinctly said there was no claim upon them—I can't say that I should have advanced the money if he had said nothing one way or the other—I did not give the prisoner any money at all on the 6th October—he said he thought he might be able to get the money in fourteen days, and I said "If you can I shall charge you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble, will that hurt you <hi rend="italic">V</hi> and ho said "No"—at that time I had paid away no money at all—my man started away to take possession at the same time I went to the City Road to pay the claim of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Captain Bayard—I paid it on the 6th October—Mr. O'Neill proposed that I should have a bill of sale—I had paid Captain Bayard's bill of sale at that time—I don't recollect that I said to Mr. Benson that if I had kept Captain Bayard's bill of sale it would have been all right and I should have got my money as it would have been prior to Mr. Bryant's bill of sale—I may have said so—there was a bill of sale of, Bryant's a month before Bayard's—I signed this document after Mr. Bryant had come in and claimed the goods.

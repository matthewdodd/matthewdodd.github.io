               <p>A lodger of Mr. Bennett's took a man up stairs, and robbed the man of his watch, and the man went up and broke open the door, and it is very likely to suppose that some body might go in and take the things: that is not the sheet they took from me, nor the blanket; the blanket they took from me was not worth a halfpenny, only fit for a house-cloth.</p>

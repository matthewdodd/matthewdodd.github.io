               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Perfectly as well as I know myself; he was my <rs id="t18080713-22-deflabel137" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. When did you miss your property - A. On Tuesday the 12th of January, when I came home about nine o'clock in the morning, I found my bureau was unlocked; the bureau was in the parlour next the street; upon finding it open I naturally looked at the drawer where I keep cash. I missed about twenty five pounds in gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was above twenty pounds - A. Yes; - about two days after I missed my watch, a double casee silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that kept in the same drawer where the money was - A. Yes; it was a thing that I did not make use of; I did not miss it when I missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the money and the watch in the bureau - A. The day before, I had seen the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how long before you had seen the watch - A. No, I suppose about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in January - how long was it afterwards that you got any intelligence of the money or the watch - A. I heard nothing of it till the last day of June; I rode out in the morning; when I returned my servant told me he had taken William. I got a constable, and when the constable came I went in to him, I said how could you be such a cursed fool for coming here you knew you would be taken in custody and I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130020"></xptr>rather you had been any where else; I did not want the trouble of prosecuting of him; he said he had a good birth on board a ship, his conscience troubled him, he came to ask my pardon; I told him I could not compound felony, I could not compromise the matter any how; he said the watch was at a pawnbrokers in Whitecross street; before the magistrate he named the pawnbroker; I went to the pawnbrokers with one of the officers to identify the watch; we took the prisoner with us in a coach, to point out the pawnbrokers; he willingly gave every information he could, he did not wish to deny any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Mr. Salmons did you find any watch there - A. Yes, I saw the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How did he behave while in your service - A. He was very attentive to his business, never went out of a night; and I was very much surprized when my man told me he had done it. In the hackney coach, going to Whitecross street, he said he had got in liquor and the money was all stole from him.</p>

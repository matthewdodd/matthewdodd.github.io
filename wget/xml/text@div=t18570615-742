                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Richard Street, Woolwich; my predecessor was Mr. Hughes; I succeeded him last April. I knew he was in the habit of occasionally employing the prisoner—the prisoner was also leading hand of the labourers in the dockyard—he was employed by Mr. Hughes, and afterwards by me, at the butter scale, on the Friday and Saturday night in each week, for which he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made a communication to a policeman, and on the evening of 23rd May I marked five sovereigns and seven half sovereigns—I sent the prisoner into the back room to get a glass of wine—I then cleared the till of all the gold that was in it, and placed five sovereigns and seven half sovereigns in it—I am quite certain there was no other gold there—the prisoner returned to his business—I did not watch him myself—I afterwards received a communication from Miss Hook—I went and cleared the till again of the gold—I found in it six sovereigns, and five half sovereigns; that was one sovereign more than</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150117"></xptr>
               <p>I had put in, and two half sovereigns less—I examined the sovereigns, and found there were five marked, and one not marked—I called the prisoner into the parlour, and accused him of robbing the till—he said that he had not—I then asked him what his wife gave him—his answer was, "A sove<lb></lb>reign"—I asked him where it was—he said that he put it into the till—I said, "How can that be? here is only the same amount that there was without that; if she gave you a sovereign where is it?"—he then said it was a bad job, it could not be helped—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner say, "If there is any mistake about it, I am very sorry for it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that it must be a mistake; he did not say in my presence that he was very sorry for it—there were several persons present when I put the gold into the till—my wife and one of my young men saw me mark it—I made a notch in the edge with a file—I counted seven half sovereigns, and five sovereigns, and put 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the piece of paper I put them in—that was about 4 o'clock, and kept them in a drawer in my bureau, in my parlour—about half past 8 o'clock I took them out, and put them into a small pocket under my apron, and transferred them to the till—I did not count the silver either time—the prisoner has been with me since I took the business, on 1st April—he was recommended to me by my predecessor; he had been with him about six years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

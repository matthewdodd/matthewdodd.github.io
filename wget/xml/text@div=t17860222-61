               <p>Here is a certificate of the conviction of the prisoner, which I had of Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>(The certificate of the conviction read and examined by Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel, with the record, dated the 23d of July, 1783, for stealing a cart, value 4 l.)</p>
               <p>(The other witnesses were ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>I was sent for, and informed the prisoner was at home; I and some others went for him, the street-door was upon the latch, the parlour-door was fast, and one of the men shoved it open; we went into the room, and Bryant laid hold of his son-in-law, not knowing the prisoner; says he, I will go for him, and we went into the street, and there we found the prisoner; I am one of the constables of the parish of St. John, Westminster; Sir Sampson asked him how he came here? he said he came to see his children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not know this is the man that was tried? - I was not here at the trial.</p>

               <p>I am constable; I have seen the prisoner before; I knew him perfectly well; I found him the 26th of January at No. 3, Prince's Rents, in the parish of St. John the Evangelist; I was sent for to Tothilfields bridewell, and they told me to fetch Goff, and we went to apprehend the prisoner, and we took him to Tothilfields bridewell, and the next day we took him before Sir Sampson.</p>
               <p>Was what passed there taken down in writing by Sir Sampson? - No; Sir Sampson said, as the man does not deny it, there is no occasion for any thing further; he acknowledged that he had been transported, and he had left the ship; he said he stood by the captain, while the others arose; Sir Sampson asked him how he came there, he said he came to see his children and grand-children; I know he was tried here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did this man say he was on board when the crew arose on the captain, and made their escape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, they should prove that he was sentenced to be transported, and delivered to the captain.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a farmer of turnpikes; I think the first of my knowing the prisoner was in August 1784; he came into my business the 1st of September, he had been in my business before.</p>
               <p>In what employment did you then engage him? - To keep a turnpike at Sutton, near Biggleswade; I think he kept it one year and three months, his goods are now in my house; he conducted himself like an honest, careful, industrious man; I would entrust him now if he was at large, he had a wife and two children there with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, according to my idea, there is a defect in the evidence here; for it is not proved that he was the same person that was convicted of the specific offence mentioned in the indictment.</p>

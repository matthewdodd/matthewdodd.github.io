Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of March, I was on duty at Maida-hill, Padding ton—I saw the prisoner with another man, each carrying a sack, which appeared to be weighty—they were making towards Lisson-grove—they saw me, and put the sacks down on a resting-place, and sat on them—I passed them on the opposite side—I saw each of them take up their sacks and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on the other side—I turned back and watched them for five minutes—I gave an alarm, and they stopped at the corner of the building—they then ran away with their sacks—several persons pursued with me—they went to a hedge—they had their bags when they went to the hedge—when they came back from it, they had not got them—the bags were brought from the hedge before I got up to them, by the parties who pursued—they contained the leaden-pipe, a hammer, and a bill-hook—neither of them were taken at the time—both made their escape—the prisoner was taken by another officer—I am sure he is one of the men—I knew him before.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 27th of March, I went to the tool-house, and missed two bill-hooks, a hammer, two sacks, a quantity of lead, and some peas—I had put the bill-hooks and the hammer in there on the Saturday morning—I had put this piece of lead in the tool-house three days previous—it had a tap in it—I took the tap out, and have it here—this hammer and the bill-hooks are my master's—his dwelling-house was attempted <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be broken open the same night.</p>

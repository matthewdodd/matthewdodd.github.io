                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, of 50, Leadenhall-street—on 30th June, between 5 and 6 in the evening, I was going towards my shop, and met the prisoner with this clock, which I knew to be mine—I ran in and spoke to my clerk, and then ran after the prisoner, stopped him with it, and asked him where he was going to take it to—he said "To the cab stand"—I ordered him to put it down as it belonged to me, which he did, at the bot<lb></lb>tom of Fenchurch-buildings—I held him till a friend came up, and afterwards gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 237). I took the prisoner—he said that he was going to the cab-rank—when we got to the corner of Fenchurch-buildings, he kicked me in the shins—I then put him on his back, and we struggled for two or three minutes—he said you b—, I will put a knife into you, for keeping me away from my wife and three children—I got assist<lb></lb>ance—on the way to the station he tried to get away again, and to throw two constables—he was sober, I had to knock his head two or three times against the stones, or else I should have lost him—I do not think he would be intoxicated after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They used me shamefully. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I used no more violence than was necessary to secure you—I did not knock your head against the stones before you kicked my shins—I have the bruise now—you refused your address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been out with some friends who treated me rather too freely to drink; a respectably-dressed man told me to wait in a public house, and brought me the clock there out of the prosecutors shop, and gave it to me. Being rather tipsy, I jerked against the wall and broke the glass. He said, "Never mind, take it to the cab rank." I did not know whether it belonged to him or not; I did not think any one would go into the shop and steal a large clock like that in open day.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did they use any threats when they robbed you? - Not in the least, they gave me no ill treatment whatever, only demanded my money and riffled my pockets.</p>
               <p>Court. What light was it? - It was not very dark or light.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - I cannot say it was, to my thinking it was light that I could discern both their faces very well; they were with me about three minutes, or three minutes and an half, I think might be the outside, and Mathers was taken in a quarter of an hour afterwards near to the very spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you an opportunity of discerning Warbois's face so as to know him again? - Yes, I had a very great opportunity because he looked me right in the face, and I him.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that Warbois was one of the men? - I am very positive that he was one of the men that took the money from me; Warbois was taken the same morning about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that Mathers acknowledged the robbery? - Yes, it was taken in writing.</p>

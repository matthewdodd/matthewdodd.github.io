There was a quantity of iron in the vault—I remember the prisoner being employ ed there to repair and clean out a drain—I took him into the cellar to point out the road the drain ran, and as I was walking back he put his hand on the iron, and said, "Who does this belong to?"—I said, "I cannot tell you—yes, I can, "says I; but I did not mention the name—I said, "That is no thing to the purpose"—I showed him the drain, and left him—I cannot tell whether it was the next morning, or one or two after, that the report was brought to me that the iron was gone, but in consequence of what my wife said I went down to see Mullins, and said, "Where is the iron that was in the vault?"—he said, "I have used it for the drain"—I said, "You should not have done that;" and I believe I said, "By God, it don't belong to me, it belongs to another person"—I added, also, that he must take it up again—he said, "Very well," and I left him—I did nothing further at that time—this appears to have been on the 4th of April—I was in a bad state of health, and in the latter end of that month I went to Hastings for three weeks—I took no particular notice of the iron myself, only that it bears some resemblance to this; but whether it is this or not I cannot tell—I scraped away, and found the iron was not there, only bricks and stones.</p>

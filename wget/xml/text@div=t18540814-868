                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Britten, of Basinghall-street. He has stables in Vine-court, and some fowls of Mr. Gardner's were allowed to roost there—I saw them safe on 7th Aug., at 7 o'clock in the evening, and the rails of the stable were then in good condition—I went there again at about half past 6 o'clock next morning, and found three bars broken, and some of the woodwork broken away—the fowls were gone—I found them at the station house—they were the same—the water pipe was taken away, and also some fowls from the stable—this is the pipe in pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by the marks of the staples, and by other marks on it—this is my bag of tools (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Reynold's-court. On 8th Aug., about a quarter past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was in Vine-court, and saw the prisoner with a barrow—when I came in sight he pushed the barrow up the court, and ran up stairs into a house—I went up the court, and saw the prisoner looking out at the window—as soon as he saw me he drew his head back—I called Blackley, the policeman, went with him to the house, found the prisoner on the stairs, and he was taken into custody—I found nine fowls in the barrow, which were the property of Mr. Gardner, my master, and were kept in Mr. Britten's stable.</p>

Page spoke to me, and I went with him to a house in Vine-court, and found the prisoner on the second floor, covering his head with a coat—I pulled it off him, and said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "It is all right, Gardner, I am only having a sleep"—I said, "I want you," took him down stairs, and said to Page, "Is this the party you saw wheel the barrow up the court?" he said, "Yes," and I took the prisoner into custody—I searched the bar<lb></lb>row and found nine hens and a cock, the property of Mr. Gardner, nine feet of lead pipe, and several tools, the property of Mr. Addington—I gave the fowls up to Mr. Gardner, by order of the officers at Guildhall—I have two of their feet here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

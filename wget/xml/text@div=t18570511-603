               <p>before the rescue took place, the mob then met him; he turned round, and was hit on the arm, or pushed against, and he let go of the boy who he had with his left hand, and retained the one in his right—the other boy fell—the person who hit him had a moustache, and a light great coat—during the whole of that time Phillips did not leave the shop.</p>

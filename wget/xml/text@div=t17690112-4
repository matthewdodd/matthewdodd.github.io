            . I am a watchman. On the 23d of December, between two and three in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar with a basket on his back; I turned and followed him to my brother watchman. This was in St. Margaret's, Westminster. I stopped him, and we asked him, what he had got? He said it was venison, and that he brought it from Highgate, and was going to carry it to the Swan at Knights-bridge. I held up my lanthorn, and knew him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120006"></xptr> I said, What makes you come this way? He is a butcher. We took him to the watch-house: he was examined by the constable of the night; it proved to be an ewe sheep, with the skin on, and the guts taken out, and the fat taken off, and put into a wollen rag within the belly of the sheep. The belly was quite warm. There was this direction tied on the basket, To

The prisoner said it was delivered to him by one of the Marquis of Canarvan's servants, to be carried to Knightsbridge. We advertised the sheep, but cannot find the owner. There was no brand mark on the skin.</p>

               <p>I had been to see my father at Southgate. Coming home, I met a man as I came by the Marquis of Canarvan's, at Southgate, he said he was servant there; he said he would give me half a crown to carry the basket to the Swan at Knightsbridge. I did not know what it was; he told me it was venison. I did not know a step of the way without going round. Coming over Finchly Common I lost my way.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Sumeril. When I came home from my labour I examined my pocket, I had 4 s. and 9 d. half-penny in it. I went to bed and put it upon the bed cord, and my stockings on that. I got up in the morning, and went to take my pocket; then I had but one stocking and ne'er a pocket; the prisoner lodges in the same house I do. I went down stairs to do a necessary on my own occasion, and the prisoner was lying by the fire side in the kitchen; I was lamenting my case, she turned round, and under her lay my other stocking and pocket; the stockings I have now on my legs, and the leather pocket by my side, there were ten pence half-penny in my pocket; she called me old catamarandum bitch, and asked me what I made a noise about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutrix was dancing to my landlord's fiddle, and I was in the house, she and a great many people were dancing country dances, we had all manner of musick, and several full pots of beer, and some gin. The man of the house gave me leave to lie down by the fire side; she went up to bed with her candle in her hand; she was a bed and asleep, I lay down by the fire side as naturally as ever you saw any thing in your life, she had half pints of gin and beer to pay for, and to pay the fidler; whatever she did with her money I know not; I never disturbed any body till that woman disturbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you dance that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The man keeps what we call a hop, he plaid on the violin, I gave him a penny and no more; and please you, my Lord, I did jump about.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman at Mr. Smith's. On the 26th of July, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the shop, and saw the prisoner shifting the casks from one side to the other—about eight o'clock next morning he came to work—we were then searching for the waistcoat—the prosecutor said it must be two men whom I had employed a few days who took it, and he accused them of it—I said to the prisons, "John, I am afraid you took it; if you did, acknowledge it, and let the man have his key"—he told me to take care what I said—on the morning of the 29th I saw him in the Maze—he had a bulk in his bosom—I took him hy the shoulder, and demanded to see what he had—he refined to show me—he wanted me to let him go, and said I should not search him—I gave him up to the officer—he then said, if I would forgive him, and look over it, he would never do it again.</p>

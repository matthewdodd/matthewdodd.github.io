               <p>Did you single these two men out from all the rest? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you then or have you now any doubt of them? - Not in the least; my hat was cut through.</p>
               <p>Court. I very much doubt whether this is such an offence as in point of law is called a robbery, therefore my opinion is, that another indictment should be filed against them for a misdemeanor; you might indict them for an assault with intent to rob upon a special count, and another for assaulting and wounding.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of April, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the policeman - I got up, and let him into the house - my family consist of my son and my sister - I and my son had fastened the house up at night, and went to bed about twelve o'clock - we fastened and locked up all the doors, but there is a cellar flap which lets the light into the cellar, that was let down, but the bolt did not catch - it was close down - it is a flap which goes up to the wall and shuts down - it was closed, but not bolted - it is a flap in a larger one.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get to the cellar? A. You go into the bar, and a door opens from the bar into the cellar - that door was locked when I went to bed - when I got up I found the bar door locked, and the cellar door also - we went down into the cellar - I found the brandy jar removed into another cellar where rum is kept - that is the cellar the flap opens into - I am quite sure that jar was in the other cellar when I went to bed - I had seen it there that night the last thing before I went to bed - we found every thing correct - nothing was broken - whoever got into the cellar must have had a light, or they could not have passed along without some accident happening - nothing was taken away from the cellar - there is a staircase from the bar into the cellar, and there were marks where they had been cutting to force open the lock to get into the bar - that is the door I mentioned before - the door was cut by the side of the lock, but not sufficiently to let the bolt of the lock at liberty - the policeman and I went down - we found two gallons and a half of brandy and rum in the jar the brandy had been in - they had removed the jar out of the cellar with the brandy in it, and drawn some rum into it - there was about a gallon and a half of rum taken from a cask and mixed with the brandy - nothing was taken away - we looked about, but found no house-breaking implements, nor any thing deficient- I have known the prisoner some years - he is a labouring man, and was in my house the evening before, with three more companions, and left about half-past eleven o'clock, when all my company went out together - I fastened the front door after them - he had come into my house about half-past nine o'clock that evening with his companions - the house is in the township of New Brentford - the cellar is part of the house, and under it.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty at Brentford on the morning of Saturday, the 26th of April - about half-past two o'clock I heard an alarm given, and presently after a man came up in a direction from Piper's house, and told me something which he had seen - I went up to Piper's and took the prisoner into custody - he was in the custody of Holt the waggoner at that time - White the witness said in his presence that he saw him come out of Piper's cellar - he denied it - I took him to the station-house - he wore a short jacket.</p>

About half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 26th of April I was pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150008"></xptr>ing Mr. Piper's house - I passed right by the door, and saw the prisoner get out of the cellar flap, and cross the road - I saw nobody with him at that time, but about ten minutes afterwards I walked on and met a waggoner - I told him, and he went and caught the prisoner, and brought him over to the cellar flap - he said he would go with me to the policeman - he was dressed in a short smock-frock - I am quite sure he is the man - I did not lose sight of him before he was taken - I was very much threatened by the party at Brentford, and did not swear to him at the time - I have not a doubt of him - I never lost sight of him - as he was going along to the policeman, he said to me at the Black Boy, "I did come out of the cellar, but I hope you will not transport me" - I turned my head round and saw another one come out of the cellar and run off - I do not know him - he got away round the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the waggoner seize hold of me first? A. Yes; you said, "I hope you won't transport me," and made a bolt up the alley by the Black Boy - we had a struggle in the road - I gave an alarm, and others came to my assistance.</p>

            . I am waggoner to Mr. Russell, of Exeter. I was going through Brentford that morning - about fourteen or twenty yards from the prosecutor's I saw the prisoner come from the cellar, and cross the road - White came up to me and said, "That man has just come out of that cellar" - I said, "Why have you not taken him?" I walked before the horses and stopped the prisoner - I said, "What have you been at?" - he said, "Nothing" - White said, "You have just come out of the cellar" - I said, "I shall take you - you shall not go further till there is a policeman," and it was agreed he should go with White to the police - White took him along, and they had a scuffle in the road - I went to assist White, and kept him till the policeman came - I am sure he is the man - I saw him cross the road from the cellar - I did not see him come out of the cellar - this was between the market-place and the bridge at Brentford - it was a moonlight night - it was very light - the moon was not full.(The prisoner made no defence.)</p>

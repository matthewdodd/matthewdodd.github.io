I am a carrier and live at 3, Leather bottle Lane, Norwood—on the evening of 10th May, about 7.30, I was at Chaplin &amp; Home's in Bond Street—the witness Trader spoke to me and I saw the prisoner in my cart and I subsequently missed a parcel—I afterwards went to a public-house at the corner of South Moulton Street and saw the prisoner there—he had got this bag on the seat and the paper was stuffed underneath the seat—I asked him what he had got in the bag—he said the bag did not belong to him—I said "It belongs to me"—I asked him to turn it out and see what it was and he said "It is not mine"—I said "I shall give you into custody"—he said "I can see you are a genuine sort of man, we will square this"—I said nothing—he tried to get away, but I caught him going out of the door.</p>

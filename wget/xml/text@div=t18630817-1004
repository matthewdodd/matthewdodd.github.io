I live at 4, Aldgate, in the City of London, and am a photographic artist; my name is up outside, and there are portraits at the door, so that any person would know what my calling was—on Thursday, 18th June, about 7 in the evening, the prisoner came to my premises—I was in a back room on the first-floor with my wife—I had never seen the prisoner before—he said he wished to look at some of my specimens—he spoke as good English as I can—I showed him several specimens—he seemed perfectly satisfied, but said he would not have one taken then, he would call again the next day—I believe my wife gave him one of my cards and he left—on the following day, Friday, he came again between 12 and 1—I was in the same room—he came upstairs to me—he said he had come to have his portrait taken—my wife showed him where to arrange himself—he said he was in no hurry, he would wait till the other customers had gone, and when they had gone, I took a portrait of him—I did not like the look of it and I took another of him—he then said he wished to speak to me privately, and asked if I could copy works of art—I said, oh, yes, anything—he said he had got some work for me to do, which he would bring the following day—he came on the following day, the 20th, at noon—I asked him where his residence was and I would send for the works of art—he said, oh, his hotel was a long way, pointing towards the east—he produced a one gulden note to pay for is portrait and gave it to my wife: she handed it to me, saying she did not know the meaning of it—he afterwards gave her a gold half-Napoleon, and she gave him change in English coin—he took one portrait away with him, the other</p>

               <p>he left, and I afterwards gave it to the police—on the following day, Saturday, the prisoner came again from about 12 to 1—my wife and daughter were there and several customers—my wife thought he wanted another portrait, so she asked him to arrange his hair again—he said, oh, no, he would wait till all the customers had gone—he did so—he then asked me to shut the door—I did so; my wife and child were there also—the prisoner then took a pocket-book out of his inside coat-pocket—took from it a one gulden note and asked if I could copy that—I said, "Oh, yes"—he then asked if I thought we could procure paper in London like that to print them on—I said I did not know—he said it did not matter much, as we could get plenty in a foreign country, by going to Paris or some of those places—my wife went upstairs to attend to dinner while this conversation was going on, my daughter stopped all the time—the prisoner asked me if that was my wife that had just left the room—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is all right"—he then said, "Is this your daughter?"—I said, "Yes" and he said, "That is all right then"—he then said, "You must not let any living soul in the world see these notes, nor yet the impression you take of the notes"—I said, "It is not likely"—I was to copy 1, 000 from the one gulden note—he said he would give me an order for 1, 000 from that, and we could pass them off to foreign gentlemen as we travelled round the country—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by the pin mark and the No. 840—we were to travel in France, Belgium, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and all parts of the Continent—I said "Very good," and with that he bade me good afternoon—after he had gone, I spoke to my wife and shewed her the note, and after consulting with her, I put on my hat and coat and went directly to Seething-lane station and gave information to Inspector Scott, not ten minutes after the prisoner had left—the prisoner had said that he would call again on the Monday morning to see the impression that I took from the note, and then if I liked he would give me some of greater value—I photographed the note early on the Monday morning—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the glass impression—the prisoner did not come into my place during that day—I saw him on the opposite side of the way I dare say a dozen times, walking backwards and forwards during the afternoon; he was parading about for full three hours—about a quarter to 9 in the evening, I shut up my place in the ordinary way—after my business is over I generally stand at my door for a short time—I was stand<lb></lb>ing there about ten minutes past 9, when the prisoner came up to me and shook hands with me—he pulled me on one side from the shop where the foreigners are and said, "You must not let them hear one word"—the ground-floor is an ice-cream and confectioner's shop, kept by Italians—I said, "Let us go and have a glass of ale together"—we went into an hotel in Jewry-street, about fifteen doors from my place and had a glass of ale—on the way he asked if I had photographed that note—I said "Yes"—he asked how it looked—I said it was very good—he said he should like to see it—after having the ale we went back to my place and went upstairs together—my wife was sitting there at needle work—he said, "Good evening, madame;" and I said, "He has come to see the impression I have taken from that note"—he said, "Oh, shut the door"—the door was closed and I sat down at the table with him—I showed him the photograph I had taken and let him have the note to compare with it; he seemed highly pleased with it and said he had got some more of greater value, and he would let me have them to go on with, and make as good a job of them as that—he then remarked, "But this is a very dry job," and gave me half-a-crown to get a bottle of gin—I went out and was away for about an hour—I went to make</p>

               <p>inquiries where the officers lived that had the case in hand—I left the prisoner at my place; when I returned he had left; I met him as I came back—before I left he talked very much about making our fortunes, and I was to get them done on copper-plate, so that I was to have them lithographed, and he would find any amount of money—I was to get plates done by lithography so that we might go on and make as many thousands as we thought proper, which<lb></lb>ever way I could get them done the best not to be detected—when I went away I left the one gulden note and the photograph in the room—I said he had better leave it, for I thought I could get a better one than I had already got—I met the prisoner on my return, next door to Mr. Gatti's, about seven doors from my place—he told me he had been back, and had left two notes of more value with my wife, and given her six and a half Napoleons as a deposit for me to go on with the work—we parted in the street—when I got home my wife showed me a 5 gulden note, a 10 gulden note, and six and a half gold Napoleons—on Tuesday evening, the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the prisoner came and knocked at my door—my wife and I were sitting in the room—he sat down at the end of the table, with his back partly towards the door—he came leaning right over me as I sat in my easy chair, and said, "You say anything to the police?"—I said, "It is not likely"—he said, "Because I hear something last night, and I am going off to Boulogne in the morning"—he said I must keep the secret, or we should both be ruined and transported and sent to the galleys, and I don't know where, if it was found out—I said it was not a likely thing that I should do anything of the kind to risk my liberty—we had the three notes on the table, and the glass impression that I had photographed—the prisoner was comparing the one gul<lb></lb>den note with it, talking about our travelling, and what fine fortunes we could make, and all kinds of humbug—another knock came to the door; I said, "Come in," and Scott, the detective, put his head round the doorway—he was in plain clothes—I went outside to speak to him—I made some com<lb></lb>munication to him—I returned to the room, and then went out again on to the stairs—the officers then went into the room and took the prisoner into custody, and took possession of the three notes and the glass impression—the portrait I had given up on the Saturday when I had given the informa<lb></lb>tion—this photograph is taken upon a plate of glass; the glass is covered with prepared collodion; it is then exposed to the light, with the note in front, and the impression of the note then becomes printed on the glass—when it is printed on the glass I can set it, so as to print from it—we have to fix it—we wash it and tone it, and then wash it again, and then fix it—when that is done, by placing it upon sensitive paper, we can print off as many copies as we wish, by placing it to the light—we must have the right paper, so that the sun may act upon it—I did not prepare it for printing—I never intended to print—I black-varnished it, so that it could not be scratched when the officers were making use of it—by varnishing it I pre<lb></lb>vented its being printed from, because the collodion is on the varnish side—I varnished it to preserve it, so that, in being shown about, the collodion should not be scratched off—the plate I have produced is an exact <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> of the note.</p>

               <p>I had gone on with the right process, but I never intended to go on with it—from the prisoner's instructions, I was to take all the three notes like this, and then have copper or lithographic plates taken from them, and he would supply me with money to get those plates done—that was his intention—I was not simply to take a copy by photography for that purpose; his instruc<lb></lb>tions were for me to get the plates done, and if we could not get the paper in London I was to travel with him and we could procure it abroad when we had once got the stone. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the impression or shadow is created on the glass, you fix it; it does not eat into the glass at all, does it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends upon what process we are working; in this process it does not—it is a mere shadow on the surface of the glass, which I fixed there by means of the varnish that I put on it—before putting the varnish, I might have washed it off the face of the glass, but I put the varnish on so that it should not be washed off—that was for the purpose of the police making use of it—this is very much fainter than the original from which I printed, because it is varnished on the collodion side—independent of the varnish, there would have been as good blacks as in the original note—the reproduc<lb></lb>tions would have been as good a colour if I had printed—that is what we call a positive—it would have been a negative if I had had instructions to take one, but I had other instructions—the prisoner's instructions were to take something from which I could get a copperplate—if I had followed out the prisoner's instructions instead of those of the police I should have taken a negative, and from that negative I might have printed—I could not print from a positive, it would appear the wrong way—all are taken as posi<lb></lb>tives in the first instance, and then converted into negatives—this was never converted into a negative—I could not possibly print until it was converted into a negative, it would have come out left-handed.</p>

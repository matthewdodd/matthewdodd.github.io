               <p>WILLIAM DUNN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Allen; on Wednesday the 10th of June, the prisoner came to our shop for the waste; I went down into the cellar to hold the bag; he filled first the soft waste hair, and then the hard waste; I heard a quarrel between Mr. Allen's apprentice, and the pot-boy, next door; I stepped from one cellar to the other, and when I returned, I observed the prisoner coming from the hair binn, with a bundle of hair, endeavouring to put it into the bag, but I was too quick upon him, and the bundle broke, part of it went into the bag, and part into the waste binn; they are hogs' bristles; he picked up some of it, and threw the rest into the waste hole; I took no notice then, but asked him what those hairs were upon the ground; he said, he did not know how they came there; he then tied that bag up, and began filling the second, and the second or third handfull that he pulled out was all hair, part of which he threw in; I then said, it was very extraordinary I could not turn my back, but he must be taking the hair out of the binn, and immediately fetched Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You are servant to the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010061"></xptr>Q.What is Mr. Allen's partner's name? - A. He has no partner.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner has been in the habit of coming to your house for waste hair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The hair that you charged him with stealing was in the bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cellar is it, light or dark? - A. It is a light cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. He never came out of the cellar while you were below? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eyes upon him; he could have done nothing without your knowledge? - A. He did it while I had turned my back.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that it was not done by mistake? - A. It could not have been done by mistake, because the two bins were not in the same cellar.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER - sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Allen; I saw the bristles taken out of the bag; I took part of them out myself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did not the prisoner say, at the time, it was done by accident? - A.He said he did not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DOVE sworn. - I work for Mr. Allen; I went down to look at the bin, and missed a bundle of hair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I believe these bristles to be mine; they are a very peculiar article; they cost me two shillings and nine-pence three farthings a pound, and he was taking away this at a penny.</p>

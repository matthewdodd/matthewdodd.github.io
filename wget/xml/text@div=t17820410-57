               <p>I have been ill for many months with the rheumatism last winter, I had been drinking that day, it confused me, I went into the house for a pennyworth of beer, and set down, and gave a penny to the lady at the bar, she said you have got a pot of mine in your pocket, I put my hand to my pocket, and said here are two, I was very much surprised, I was very weak and low, and hoped she would let me go, she never offered to search me, and I might have taken one of the pots away, I have been five weeks confined, and very ill, and no allowance but the goal allowance, I beg for mercy, if I recover mercy of this court I shall go to my own parish of St. Luke's till I get better.</p>

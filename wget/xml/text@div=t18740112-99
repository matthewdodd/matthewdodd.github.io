                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>, 100). On Monday morning, 15th December, I was on duty near the premises of Mr. Chadwick, 23, Noble Street—I went on duty at 6 o'clock in the morning—I passed the warehouse several times between 6 o'clock and 7.50—it was then quite secure; this bar and padlock was on the door; I tried it several times—about 7.50 I was going from Silver Street towards Falcon Square, about 15 yards from 23, Noble Street, I there met the prisoner Bruce; I had just come round the corner suddenly; he was within sight of 23; he moved towards me, and asked me the way to Silver Street—I pointed the way out to him—he said "Is it to the right or to the left?" placing his arms in front of me, and moving himself each way as I tried to get by him, and at last I pushed him on one side and walked over to the door of Mr. Chadwick, where Williams and another man were; they appeared to be either locking or unlocking the door, I could not tell which, but I saw that the bar was off the door at the time, and the padlock was hanging loose on the staple—I caught hold of Williams, the other man ran and then joined Bruce where I had left him standing, and they both ran together up Monkwell Street; I still held Williams, and pulled him along, calling out "Stop thief!" several times—I met a painter, and asked him to follow the other men; they turned into Falcon Street, and I then lost sight of them—Williams threw away this key, which I afterwards found opens the prosecutor's street door—I have the lock here; I turned back and picked the key up—this other key opens the padlock; another witness will speak to that—the witness pointed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, at 6, Portman's Place, Globe Road—about 7.50 on Monday morning, 15th December, I was passing through Monkwell Street—I heard the constable cry "Stop thief!" and saw Bruce and another man walking very sharply close together, they turned into Fell Street—they stooped down, and Bruce put down this iron bar, and the other man put down a key, I think it was this small key—I followed them—Bruce went into the Rose and French Horn public-house—I told the constable that one of the men had gone in there; the other man ran down London Wall—I then went back and picked up this key and bar, and took them to the constable; he told me to take them to the station-house, which I did—at that time Bruce was in the hands of another officer—I should think not more than two or three minutes elapsed between Bruce going into the public-house and his being in the hands of the officer; the public-house is about eighty yards from where I picked up the bar and key.</p>

I did not mention Bruce's name before the Magistrate as having put down the bar; I said "One of them"—the Magistrate asked me which, and I said "The <hi rend="italic">one</hi> nearest me," that was Bruce—I did not see the bar in his hand before he put it down—I was about 20 yards in front of them when I first saw them; they were close together, meeting me; Bruce was not exhausted, he had not far to run, in fact he was not running when I saw him, he was not running after the other man—I did not lose sight of him until ha entered the public-house; I did not go in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I first saw them they were approaching me; at that time Kinsey, the officer, was at the far end of Monkwell Street, coming after them—there was not another person in Monkwell Street; Kinsey turned into Monkwell Street as the men turned into Fell Street, they were walking till the bar was put down and then they ran.</p>

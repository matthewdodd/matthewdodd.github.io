On the evening of the 4th of November last, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060052"></xptr>came into our shop, and requested to look at some shirts. I shewed him some, and he fixed upon one; and then he desired to be shewn some silk pocket handkerchiefs. I took some from the window, and shewed them to him; there was a particular pattern which he said he wanted, but which he said was not there. I turned round to a draw behind to get some others; and by his position, with his hat off, and placed upon the counter, I guessed all could not be right. On my turning round again, he had got his hat on; and I jumped over the counter almost directly, and in his hat, was a whole piece of silk handkerchiefs. I sent for an officer, and delivered him and the handkerchiefs into his custody.</p>

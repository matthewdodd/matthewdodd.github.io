               <p>Q. You were not at home at that time, were you - A. No. I was there on Saturday, the 6th of June, and saw her at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Saturday - A. It was either Friday or Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How late in the day had you seen her - A. About three o'clock.</p>

I found her on the Sunday, in New-court, Nicoll-street, in Mr. Higgs's house. When I saw her there she had got my mistress's gown on I knew the gown by the description they had given me. I asked her what she had been doing. She said she was very sorry for what she had done. Then I fetched Mr. Armstrong, the officer. He searched her in my presence, and found eleven duplicates in her pocket. He then took her to the office, and I informed my mistress that she was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when your mistress came to the office and saw her - A. Yes. She had not changed her dress then. She had the same clothes on as when I took her.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 7th of June, I took the prisoner in custody. I searched her. I found ten duplicates, and a ticket in the shape of a duplicate. I asked her whether the articles these duplicates applied to were her's; she said, yes. I took her to the office, and had the gown taken from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean those things that she had upon her - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her to the office in the same dress you found her - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when her mistress came there - A. Yes. That was before the things were taken off her. She had something in her apron, in a kind of bundle, at the time I apprehended her. I have had them ever since. Here is the stockings. I went round to the different pawnbrokers with the prosecutrix, and found the different articles that the duplicates applied to. One of the pawnbrokers is here, the other is not.</p>
               <p>MR. BURGESS. I am a pawnbroker, at Mr. Edinborough's, Crown-street, Finsbury-square, I produce a sheet. The ticket was written by our boy; he is not here. I have the counterpart of the ticket that Armstrong produces. It corresponds with the ticket that Armstrong produces. Armstrong brought the ticket to me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Armstrong. Did you produce that ticket found on the prisoner to Mr. Burgess - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look first at those things which you saw on the person of the prisoner, when you first saw the prisoner at Worship-street - A. This is the gown that was upon her person. I saw it upon her person. It is mine. I value it at about five shillings. The dimity petticoat is mine, value about two shillings; and the shawl I value about one shilling. These are my stockings, they were in a bundle in a pocket handkerchief; and other trifling things. They are worth three shillings altogether; and this sheet I had given it to the prisoner about a week before for her to mend it. It is worth about two shillings. The other articles were brought to the office. I saw them there. There was nothing said about them. Chapman had the clothes, and produced them at the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>CHAPMAN was called, and not appearing in court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

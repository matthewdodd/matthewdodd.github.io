The prisoner, Wiltshire, was standing up when I first when in. The landlord asked for the money. The prisoner, Wiltshire, hustled me, and said, he had no money. I had a bundle with me when I went into the house, which I put down on the bench. The prisoner, Parsons, went out with a man, and the landlord asked me if it was my bundle which they had taken; when the prisoner, Wiltshire, went to the door, and said, are you gone? I do not know who he spoke to. I ran out, and gave the alarm, when some person said, it is only a lark. I saw no more of them. The articles mentioned in the indictment were in my bundle. About a week afterwards I saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

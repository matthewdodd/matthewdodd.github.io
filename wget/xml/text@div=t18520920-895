                  </hi>. I am a lodging house keeper, at 11, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials. On Friday, 3rd September, about 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my door, and asked for a lodging—I agreed to let her one—she was to pay sixpence for it, and she handed a shilling to my wife in my presence—my wife gave her change in my presence—I took the shilling directly from my wife's hand—I brought it to the gas, and said, "This is a bad shilling"—I looked after the prisoner directly, but I could not find her—she was away—she came back again in half an hour—I wanted to take her then, and she ran away—when I let lodgings the lodgers pay beforehand—the shilling was in my possession till the policeman got it—it was broken in two pieces by Mr. Collins in the next house in my presence, but it was not out of my sight—the prisoner had come back again before the shilling was broken.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on the 3rd of Sept.—I saw her in an empty room at the top of a house in Queen-street, Seven-dials—she appeared intoxicated—I took her to the witness's house, who declined charging her, and then she walked away as well as I could walk—I got this shilling which is broken, from Mr. Collins—Dowling was standing at the door when Collins gave it me.</p>

On Tuesday, 7th Sept., about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked for a quartern of gin—she wished it to be put in a bottle—I served her with it, but I did not allow her to take it away—she tendered in payment a half crown—I tried it in the detector—I told her it was bad—she said it was not—she wished me to give her a portion of it back—I had not broken it, but I had bent it—I would not—she abused me very much—I told her to go away—she went out, and came back, and then abused me—I sent for a policeman, and she was given in custody—I gave the half crown to the policeman—I had been in the room where it was, the whole of that time, and am quite sure it was the same half crown I had received from the prisoner—no one but my<lb></lb>self had been in the bar—this is it.</p>

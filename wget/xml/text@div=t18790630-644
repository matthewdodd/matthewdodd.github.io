                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs. Tamvaco and Co., and have the privilege of purchasing wheat sweepings, which are generally sold privately, but sometimes by auction—I have a right of preemption—on or about March 13th I purchased, amongst other things, some wheat sweepings ex Mabel from Calcutta, and received in due course from Tamvaco and Co. a delivery order—I keep a delivery order book in the office, and all delivery orders have counterfoils like cheques—I took them about a week afterwards to O'Dwyer at the general office, for the purpose of obtaining the exact weights of the goods I had purchased, and to see if they stood in the name of Tamvaco—O'Dwyer is in the employ of the Docks Company—some two or three days afterwards I received back this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of paper attached, giving details of exact weights—I retained it, and put the original or prime order in an envelope addressed to O'Dwyer, and posted it—I have never received it back; if returned by the Post-office it would have come to the firm—it was to this effect: "London, 13th March, Victoria Dock. Weigh and deliver to the order of A. Masson 49 cwt wheat sweepings, ex Mabel, Captain—, from Calcutta, warehoused by selves,' 1879;" marks and numbers, "7 M. L."—it was signed by Tamvaco and Co.—I sold Mr. Dannett the 49 cwt of wheat sweepings about 25th March, but kept no books or record of the transaction—I handed a sub-order signed by myself to Dannett—the delivery order is part of the prime order—those are all the goods I ever sold to him—I met him about a fortnight after on my return, after absence from town.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed as clerk, at the B and K Jetty, Victoria Docks—Bodley was delivery foreman and Laurie was quay foreman there—on Friday, 28th March, Bodley was absent and Laurie was acting as fore<lb></lb>man in his absence—Seymour, the carman, presented to me this order (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) with two others—I took them to the general office and saw O'Dwyer there—I showed him the orders and asked for the landing books; but he said, "You will not require them"—I went back to the B and K department and saw Laurie there and laid the order on his desk in the delivery foreman's office—no one else was there, he was in charge of the premises—I saw the wheat sweepings loaded; Laurie was present, and told me which was the pile to deliver from, and got the man to deliver them, and I took down the weights as they were weighed and loaded; 21 sacks weighing 49 cwt into Green-wood's van—the loading was under Laurie's superintendence—I told him</p>

               <p>the total weight and left the piece of paper containing the weights on his desk after I got the sweepings, and told him at the same time that it was the total weight—I ought to have had the landing-book to enter the weights in it—I did not do so—the total weights should have been endorsed on the back of the order by Laurie, and he would then give it to the carman—Laurie made no entry then of the 49 cwt.—I did not see the carman sign the warehouse receipt book, it was Laurie's duty to see that he did so—it contained a receipt for the goods, and should be signed by the carman—I saw another of Greenwood's vans there later on that afternoon, and it took 14 bags of linseed and 3 other bags—next day, Saturday, 29th March, I saw the same van and the same carman there again that had taken the 49 cwt., and in the same shed (No. 5), and Bodley superintending it; and I saw Laurie and Bodley talking together between 9 and 10 am., but did not hear what they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Greenwood's carmen; I knew Mr. Dannett, and used to carry a good deal of grain and linseed for him—I went to his premises by my master's orders on 28th March, and received a letter addressed to O'Dwyer at the docks, and was instructed to get a load of wheat sweepings—the dock gatekeeper directed me the general office, where I saw O'Dwyer, and gave him the letter, and he opened it, and read it—he then looked among some books, and handed me these three orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which by his directions I took to the B and K jetty—I had been there three or four times before for Dannett for sweepings, and other carriers had been there for my master—I generally saw Bodley there, but Laurie was there on 28th March; I had not seen him there before—I took Laurie the order, and said I had come for a load of sweepings for Mr. Dannett—he said "All right, back in at the jetty"—I gave the orders to some one inside the delivery foreman's box—Laurie and Halliday and one or two others were there—that is the proper place to deliver the orders—I was on the van, and other men were loading—I did not see whether Laurie superintended the delivery of the goods—I usually get the order back with a weight note after getting the goods, which I take to O'Dwyer to get my pass—on this occasion I got my pass from the general office—Laurie did not return me the order, or give me a weight note, but told me to go to the general office—I was not asked to sign a receipt for the 49 cwt; I never signed one at the docks, except on the Saturday—O'Dwyer gave me a pass at the office, and I left it with Hoper the gatekeeper; I could not pass out without it—on Saturday morning, 29th March, I went again to Dannett's place by my master's orders—Dannett's foreman sent me to the Victoria Docks for another load of wheat sweepings, but no papers were given me—when I got inside the gate I saw Gilbert standing outside the general office, and by his. directions I went to the B and K department, No. 5, where I had been the day before—I saw Bodley there, and got the same quantity of wheat sweepings, 49 cwt, in 21 full sacks, without any order—the receipt book was then shown to me, and I signed "D. Seymour," under "ex Mabel, delivered to Greenwood's van, 49 cwt sweeping"—Bodley gave me the pass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not go to the general office at all—the pass was taken front me at the gate, and I was stopped—I delivered the previous load on 28th March at Dannett's, Oscar Wharf.</p>

Laurie," and the other "Weight cut started and delivered"—the pass was for sacks, but whether for seed or wheat I could not say—I put on the pass "Sundry ships"—I had not received the order for 49 cwt. wheat sweepings, and Laurie did not hand it to me on the Friday—I simply made out the pass from memory on the information Laurie had given me—Bodley was delivery foreman at B and K—I had had similar communications with Bodley, and I always saw Bodley when he was there, but on one or two occasions in his absence Laurie took his place, and that is how I met him—I have more than once gone back to the office, and made out passes simply from the information he gave me, without the orders, as I did for Laurie—they worked at the same jetty on the same quay—on Saturday morning, the 29th, the bundle of passes from the examiner's office were had at the desk in the general office, and I looked over them and tore out two passes, one of which I had written the previous afternoon—I gave them to O'Dwyer in the office—they related to seed or wheat delivered on the Friday without the orders being properly backed—I got three blank passes from the books and met O'Dwyer and Dannett at the Custom House Hotel, outside the docks—I gave them to O'Dwyer, and he signed them—I was standing outside the gate when Greenwood's carman came, I was not there purposely, but had just come from B jetty—I had been to see Bodley and Laurie after O'Dwyer had signed the passes—I gave them to Bodley with a letter from O'Dwyer, and I spoke to him about loading the van—he said "Have you seen the van?"—I said "No"—I went back to the general office and saw the carman coming in with the van and I directed him to go to B K—I then went into the office to my regular duties—I went again to Bodley, made out the pass, Bodley told me how many sacks were in the van, and then I filled in the number in his office and gave the pass to Bodley—I cannot say that I had seen O'Dwyer and Bodley in conversation before the 28th March—I have seen them together inside the docks, but nowhere else—I have had money from Dannett and O'Dwyer—I am not well up in the duties Laurie had to do—I believe I was down in A jetty when the van was stopped, I did not see it, but heard; Mr. Wood told me of it after—I saw the order of 25th March signed "Alfred Masson" on 29th, Bodley had it in his delivery foreman's box, and I saw him endorse it "On delivery to Greenwood's van, 49 cwt. sweepings. E. C. Bodley, 29th March, 1879," and I took it back to the general office—O'Dwyer was not there—I did not bring it away, I left it in Bodley's box—if the suborder on the 28th came to the docks it would have been O'Dwyer's duty to compare it with the entry ex Mabel in Ledger 24 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to see if it was in order, and whether the prime order had been lodged, and then enter it and endorse the order for delivery and hand it back to the carman who brought it, to take to the quay, and having received the goods, the carman should come back to the general office with the order and apply for a pass—the order would then be put on a file by the clerk who made out the pass—the date and quantity would next morning be entered from the order into the ledger—we would then know by reference to the ledger whether any goods were standing to the order of that account—those entries were not made in the case of the delivery on the 28th March of the 49 cwt, or of the linseed—I have been with O'Dwyer to Dennett's house; I did not go in, but waited in the street till he came back to me—I and O'Dwyer have pleaded</p>

               <p>guilty to stealing the 49 cwt.—Bodley and Laurie were the only people so far as I know who superintended the delivery at that quay—I believe they had the linseed sweepings under their control, but I do not know much about the warehouse—I made a statement at the office to Mr. Walker the day after the van was stopped—Mr. Stewart was present—O'Dwyer also made a statement—I was called as a witness and gave evidence at the police-court after I was arrested—I have not seen Dannett or Bodley since 29th March, nor Laurie until his arrest about two months afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Stewart on the Monday morning and was suspended on Tuesday, April 1st—I have seen Laurie on two or three occasions at the delivery office, and I know that on two occasions while he was acting as delivery foreman I saw him about the orders—I made a statement at the gaol before giving evidence at the police-court, to the solicitor for the prosecution, and it was taken down in shorthand—I did not say anything at the police-court about having spoken to Laurie on two or three occasions with respect to this matter; I was not questioned—it was about fifteen months ago that O'Dwyer first told me how this was done—he has given me money at different times, and I have had as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time from him, and have had sometimes as much as 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to hold for him—I have not received more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Dannett—I could not say how many times I have seen Bodley for the purpose of having these orders not backed, but I think more than six times within less than fifteen months—about fifteen months ago O'Dwyer told me to assist, and I began soon after, and Bodley was the delivery foreman—sometimes we got goods out in this way two or three times a month, but sometimes we did none for two or three months—I have no idea as to when I first saw Laurie acting for Bodley—I should think Bodley was not there, but I have seen him when Bodley was there—I went to see either of them; Bodley under<lb></lb>stood the business, and if he was there I did not speak to Laurie—nobody was present but the shorthand writer when my statement was taken down—I saw Laurie on the Saturday between 1 and 2 o'clock before the second delivery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Palmer was the solicitor, the particulars were explained to him, and the clerk was sent for and took down my observations in shorthand—when Bodley was present I did not want to speak to Laurie, but in Bodley's absence Laurie was the person who was to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in charge of the general office of the Victoria Docks—O'Dwyer was a clerk there, and Gilbert was under him—I partly heard Gilbert's evidence—on goods arriving they are entered in a particular shipment in a ledger by some one in the general office—an account is opened to a particular ship and for a particular consignee—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the entry in respect of the ship Mabel of Messrs. Tamvaco's goods—on arrival the sound bags are discharged from the ship, and what remains in the ship goes by the term "sweepings," which are taken out and put all together and the total weight estimated by the quay foreman—Laurie was the quay foreman in the month of March last, and for three or four months previously—he would give to the shipbroker the information to enable him to apportion the sweepings among the different consignees—the next thing would be to allot them, and to see that the merchants concerned had the particulars—Laurie would not do that, but would have control over the work—it was his duty to see that returns of the apportionments were</p>

               <p>sent to the general office to go into the ledger—I find an entry at folio 299, ledger 24, of 49 cwt. of sweepings due to Messrs. Tamvaco ex Mabel—it is entered by a clerk—the ledger was under O'Dwyer's control, and there should be a stowage book—when an order is presented the ledger is referred to by the ledger clerk O'Dwyer or one of his assistants, who would compare it with the ledger to see that the order was in every respect correct—he would then enter it in the register order book, and from there post it in the ledger, then write instructions for delivery, and sign the order and instructions and hand back the order to the carman presenting it to take to the delivery foreman (Bodley), who would search out the goods and give instructions for delivery—immediately after delivery the foreman would take the carman's receipt in the warehouse receipt-book, enter the orders and particulars of delivery in the day-book, and refer the carman to the general office for his pass—the pass would be prepared under the direction of the senior of the division, O'Dwyer, who before issuing the pass would see that the order had been properly endorsed by the foreman; the order would then be retained in the office, the record of the delivery to be posted in the ledger afterwards—the original entry would be in a separate column, the order column; there is another column for particulars of delivery, headed "actual delivery"—they would be posted in the ledger to one entry, but to different columns and at different times—the record is then complete—with reference to the 49 cwt sweepings, ex Mabel, delivered 28th March, there is no entry in the order column or the actual delivery column—as far as the ledger was concerned, on 1st April there were still 49 cwt. of sweepings standing to the order of Tamvaco and Co.—upon an order being presented on 29th March it would appear that no delivery had been made of that 49 cwt.—I have examined the register order book—there is an entry on 27th March of an order No. 1076 under the heading "Ship's name" Mabel, ledger reference 24, fol 299, "description of goods" wheat sweepings—I think it is O'Dwyer's writing—it shows that at the chief office a delivery order was received by O'Dwyer in respect of goods ex Mabel—there is no entry of the delivery order in the ledger—the delivery order itself is always posted in the ledger—there is no record whatever in the day-book of any delivery on 28th March—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the foreman's day-book, in which the foreman should post up his work as it is completed, but there is no record in it of the 49 cwt. sweepings ex Mabel on 28th March, but there are other entries of that date, I cannot say whose handwriting, and there ought to be a record of that delivery—there should also be an entry in the warehouse book, but there is not—I think Laurie has been in the docks seven or eight years—he was a permanent foreman, which is a rank above a permanent labourer—he was in a position of trust—he came first as a messenger—I have searched amongst all the papers, and find no delivery order for delivery of the goods ex Mabel—I find no pass for the 17 bags linseed or the 49 bags wheat sweepings on 28th March—O'Dwyer and Gilbert made statements in my presence on 1st April—I did not seek for Laurie, and do not know the last time he came to the docks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This day-book was kept by Bodley—I do not know if Laurie was doing Bodley's work that day—he would apply to Mr. Thompson, the warehouse keeper, for leave of absence—Laurie came, I think, in 1869 as a messenger, and has been gradually promoted to quay foreman—I should not know if he absented himself without leave.</p>

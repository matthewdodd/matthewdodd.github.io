                  </hi>. I am a baker at Wood-place, Shepherd's Bush. On 21st Oct., about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came for a penny roll, and tendered a bad shilling—I told him it was bad; he said he was not aware of it—I asked where he got it; he said he got it in change for half a pint of beer—I asked him to show me the rest of the change, and he then said he got it for carrying a portmanteau for a gentleman—I detained him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and would have given him into custody, but I could not see to officer—he asked me for the shilling, but I would not give it him—he went away, and four or five minutes after I saw an officer, and sent him after the prisoner—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the officer.</p>

I received this counterfeit shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Watt—in consequence of what he said I found the prisoner coming away from the gate of the White Horse, about 200 yards from Mr. Watts—I took him into custody, and found 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, a knife, a piece of leather, and a small packet of tobacco done up in paper—I told him I took him for uttering a bad shilling—he said he had no bad money about him—I took him to the station, and a short time after Chalk brought me three half crowns and one shilling.</p>

I was painting at the White Horse from 10 o'clock till ten minutes to 1, when I took my ladder into the garden, through the garden gate, which I found open—as I entered, I found a piece of paper lodged on the coping just inside the garden—I picked it up, and found it contained three half crowns and one shilling, wrapped up separately—they were bad—I had seen Jones take the prisoner into custody, and I took the money to Jones—I marked it—I had been through the gate at 10, and did not notice anything.</p>

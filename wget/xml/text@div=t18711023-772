                  </hi>. I am a telegraph engineer, and proprietor of the Telegraph Works, at North Woolwich, and also owner of the steam-ship <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—she has been used several times for laving, marine cables—the prisoner Henman was in my service as chief-mate of the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, for a few months—on Saturday, 19th August, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—Henman was on board, but Hilliard was not—Hilliard had spoken to me about some rope, and offered to purchase it for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I said I would go on board the first opportunity, and examine it, and see if it was fit to be condemned—I went on board, and Henman showed me the rope, lying on the forecastle—I told him to bring it ashore, and weigh it on the turn-table, in the proper manner, and let Hilliard take it away with him—a day or two afterwards Henman paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was not exactly the price at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I was told the rope weighed 15 cwt. 3 qrs.—Hilliard was frequently employed in putting coal on board the ships, not by me, but by the coal merchants—I never gave anyone authority to take any rope from the ship, except that which I saw on the forecastle, and which was brought to the works, and weighed—I received an anonymous letter, after the ship had sailed, in consequence of which I caused inquiries to be made.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Hilliard never bought anything of me before—I employed him once to discharge a ship; about twelve months ago, I should think—I had had the same captain on the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi> for the two previous voyages—the day before Hilliard spoke to me the captain said that the old rope on board might be got rid of, and he mentioned that Hilliard would buy it—I told him to see me after I had seen the rope—I told the captain that I would sell it to Hilliard—according to the ordinary course of things the ship's boats would not be lowered to take the rope ashore—I don't know what boat brought the 15 cwt 3 qrs. ashore—the ship sailed on the 25th—she was taking in cable all that time, and she sailed immediately she was ready—I don't recollect seeing Hilliard on board when I saw the old rope—I don't recollect a clearing of old rope taking place before—I got the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Henman, on the Tuesday, I think, within a day or two after I had seen the rope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable employed on Mr. Henley's works, at North Woolwich—from instructions I received I saw Hilliard on 2nd Sep<lb></lb>tember, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I asked him if he knew anything about the rope that had been taken from the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—he said he had bought some rope from the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, but Mr. Henley knew all about it—I said "I don't mean that which went ashore at the works to be weighed, but that which was taken away in two boats, and taken to the Victoria Docks Pier Head—he said he had bought some of the chief mate, and gave him about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, he did not recollect to a few shillings—I saw Hilliard again on 8th September; he then said he recollected what he had given the mate for the rope which was taken away in the two boats, and taken to the Victoria Docks Pier Head; he said it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I met him again on 12th September, riding in his cart—I got into his cart and accom<lb></lb>panied him back to his house—Inspector White eventually took him into custody—I afterwards went on board the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, and saw Henman—I said "What do you know about this?"—he said "I know nothing at all about it"—I said "It is no use your saying that, I have seen the carters and the boatmen, and I have seen Hilliard, who said he gave you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—Henman then said "As so much is known of it I may as well tell the truth; I did sell it to him, and received the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I should not have done so if Hilliard had not persuaded me to do so."</p>

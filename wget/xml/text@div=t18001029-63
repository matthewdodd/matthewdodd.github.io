             sworn. - I am a constable,(produces the buckles); I found them in the prisoner's great coat pocket, in his box.</p>

               <p>Price. I can speak to them from the pattern, having had them in the house a number of years, and likewise from the private mark; I cannot say whose mark it is, it was put on so many years ago.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I met a young man of my acquaintance about six or seven weeks ago, near Temple-bar, and, after some conversation, he told me he wanted a pair of silver buckles, and desired me to get him a pair; he told me not to get them of my master, but of some workman; I let it elapse for some time, and, on last Wednesday evening, Mr. Price and the shop man were up stairs at tea, I went to the glass case, where I was authorized to go, and took out these two pair of buckles; I put them in my inside coat pocket; I took out one of the buckles to give it a rub with a leather, and the shopman, coming down stairs,observed me put it in my pocket again, but he took no notice of it, and, in the morning, the constable was sent for; I locked the coat up in my box, in order to keep it clean; I told him, they were to shew a young man, and if he had chosen the buckles, I should have asked Mr. Price what he would have let my friend have them for; I am extremely sorry that I did not apprize Mr. Price that the young man wanted a pair of buckles first.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Price.) Q. Before he opened his box, did he say any thing about having buckles there? - A. No, he did not; I did not understand him to have said any thing before the box was opened.</p>

               <p>Thompson. He said, before I searched his pocket, that there was something there which was not his own, but was Mr. Price's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Price. I had a very good character with him. <rs id="t18001029-63-verdict355" type="verdictDescription">

About the 9th of this month, between five and seven in the evening, a pane of glass in my shop window was cut, and part of Knox's Essays were taken out; I missed them in the morning, when I took the shutters down; I made it known to the booksellers in general that I had lost the books. I received information that some were offered at a shop in Drury-lane that corresponded with mine. I went and found that they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all that you lost - A. No; I lost twenty-six volumes of Knox's British Essays out of five-and-forty; I signified to the party, that if any body brought the remaining part to stop them; so he did on Friday last.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who took him - A. No.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. On the 9th or 10th of this month, the prisoner offered me three or four books for sale; I asked whose they were; she said they belonged to a gentleman that was gone abroad; he had mispacked his things, and what few things were left were theirs. I bought the books, and placed them in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them - A. Three shillings. Mr. Laycock, a bookseller, came in and informed me, that I had three or four books in my windows that were stolen from a bookseller in Panton-street in the evening. Mr. Maynard came in and brought the books that corresponded with them four books I bought, and the other the prisoner brought on the Friday following. I was not at home. The witness Latham took the book in. I came in soon after; he told me the prisoner had left the book, and was to call in half an hour. I went to Mr. Maynard, and informed him. These are the volumes she brought to me the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the woman that brought them the first time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. LATHAM. This day week the prisoner came to our house with an odd volume; Mr. Reynolds and the prosecutor took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had them of my son; he was to pay so much a week for them. I was distressed; I sold them.</p>

I live at 13, St. George's Place, White Street, Borough, and am a brewer's storesman—about 10.30 on the evening of 26th July, I was in the Coach and Horses—I heard a band of music and went down the street with a man named Watts—he knocked against a woman who was carrying some beer—a young man said something—I can't tell whether the prisoner was present—there were some words and I felt two stabs in my left thigh—a man named Ward was charged with stabbing me—he was</p>

I am a widow, and live at 5, Queen's Gardens, Crosby Row—on the evening of 26th July about 10.30 I was outside the Coach and Horses listening to a band that was passing—I saw Wood and Watts there dancing on the pavement—I saw Mrs. Noonan, the prisoner's mother, coming from the Constitution public-house with some beer in her hand—as the two men were dancing they shoved up against her, and spilt some beer—I saw the prisoner there—he asked one of them what he shoved up against his mother for, or what he struck her for—one of them, I can't say which, said he did not do it, and told him to go and get his supper—the prisoner said "Can you make me go and get my supper," and Mr. Wood said "I could eat eight or ten like you before breakfast"—I saw the prisoner make two blows at Mr. Wood and run away down Crosby Row—Mr. Watts followed him—I remember Frederick Ward being charged with this offence—I did not know him till I saw him at the station—I was sum moned to be a witness and bore testimony for him—he was acquitted—I am certain he was not there at the time Noonan struck Mr. Wood.</p>

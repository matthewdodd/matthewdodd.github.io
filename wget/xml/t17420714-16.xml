About 5 Weeks after she came to the same Place at Fulham; I charged her with taking it, she took me on one side, own'd the taking of it, and said she would pay it one Shilling per Week, she agreed to stay in the Toil Room; in the Morning I brought her before Col. De Veil, she said it was the first Fact, and that she was guilty. - The Prisoner in her Defence intimated that the Money was given her to permit Freedoms, to which however she would not consent; but had no Evidence to support it. <rs id="t17420714-16-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

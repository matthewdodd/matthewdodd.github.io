               <p>I keep the White Horse in Little Britain. The prisoner came to my house on the 22d of November, and called for a pint of purl, at about a quarter after eleven in the morning; he sent me a shilling to change by my servant which I disputed. I went to him in the tap-room, and told him I thought it was not a good one; he begged the favour of me to let him leave a parcel. I told him he might; he said he would call or send for it. In the morning of the 23d I was looking into the newspaper for a particular thing I wanted to see. I saw an advertisement that answered the description of the prisoner. I immediately sent to Sir John Fielding's. I did not know how to act.</p>

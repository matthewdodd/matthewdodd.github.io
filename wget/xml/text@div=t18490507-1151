                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Jones, of 43, Lon<lb></lb>don-wall, leather-merchants—the prisoner had been in the habit of buying feathers there—we keep horsehair seating. On 4th May I counted the number of pieces of seating at eight o'clock in the morning; there were eighteen—the prisoner came there a little before nine—none of the seating had been re<lb></lb>moved—he agreed to buy some feathers—I had to go up stairs to pack the feathers up—I left the prisoner on the ground-floor where the horsehair seat<lb></lb>ing was—he said he was going across for change for a sovereign—I did not see him go—I was up about five minutes—I packed the feathers, brought them down, and delivered them into his cart—he paid me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—his boy was in the cart, which stood just on the edge of the pavement, op<lb></lb>posite the door—immediately after that, I counted the horsehair seating again; and there were only seventeen—the piece that was missing weighed about 30lbs.—there were 39 1/2 yards—no one has been on the premises but me and him—about a week before that the prisoner said to me, "You do a large trade in seatings"—I said, "We do"—he said, "You sent out a large lot yesterday"—I said, "Yes, and we have got a fresh lot in"—the one that was missing was one of the fresh lot—I left the door open—my back was scarcely turned a minute—I had no conversation at the cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 151). On Friday, 4th May, from information, I went to the Castle public-house, Fore-street, with Mr. Jones—we placed ourselves in a position to watch Mr. Jones's warehouse door from about eight in the morning—I saw a horse and cart drive up about a quarter before nine o'clock—the prisoner and a little boy were with it—the prisoner got out and rang a bell—he was answered from inside—he went in—(from eight till a quarter to nine, no one else had gone to the warehouse door)—he had a great coat on, and a loose bag in his hand—in three or four minutes afterwards I saw him come out alone, and the great coat was wrapped round a parcel, which appeared to be heavy, which he was carrying with both hands—he lifted it into the cart, and went back into the warehouse again—I saw the back of the little boy in the cart—after the prisoner returned into the warehouse, he came out again, alone, in about two minutes—he crossed the road to where I was concealed—he had one of his fingers in his waistcoat pocket—he returned to the warehouse, waited there about two minutes more, and then came out with the porter, who had a bag on his head, which, to the best of my belief, was the bag the prisoner had carried in—there were some deals in the cart, and a large flock bed—after the prisoner put something in, it seemed to drop down into the cart—I could not see that; he threw in great-coat and all—I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and followed the cart along various streets for two hours, or two hours and a half—it got to Whitechapel Church—during this time he removed some deals from the cart, and left them at Mr. Wild's, in the Curtain-road, and a small parcel in a handkerchief—at Whitechapel Church he took up another man, and drove down Back-church-lane, to Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane—I saw him whipping his horse—he had looked back previous to that—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was about forty yards from him—we lost sight of him in Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane for about two minutes, as it was blocked up—when we got to the Minories we saw the cart, with the boy in it, standing opposite Mr. Catch<lb></lb>pole's—the prisoner and his friend were gone—we stood and watched the cart about half an hour—the prisoner did not return—the boy drove the cart to Little Moorfields—the prisoner came to it there—I went up to him, told him I was a police-officer, and he must consider himself in custody for stealing a roll of horse-hair seating that morning from Jones and Son's—he said he knew nothing about any horse-hair—I asked where he went when he left his cart—he said with a friend of his to have a glass of stout—I took him to the station—I found on him two sovereigns and five pence—I found the feathers in the cart, and this little book with memorandums in it—I did not take the boy, he was too young; I rode to Chelsea with him and searched his father's house.</p>

I was watching, and saw the prisoner drive up about a quarter before nine, and go into the warehouse—he came out with a bulk of property concealed under his great coat, which he carried on both his arms, and threw into the cart hastily—it answered in size and shape to the property we missed—I afterwards saw him come out again and go across the road—he returned to the warehouse and came out with the porter—the cart then drove away—I did not accompany the officer; I sent the porter—I know the prisoner's writing; this book is in his writing; this item "Seating," is the prisoner's writing; this last item is "39 1/2 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the measure of the piece we missed was 391<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 yards, and worth from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

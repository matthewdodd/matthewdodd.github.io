                  </hi>. I was an inspector of the G division of police. On Friday, 3d September, I went with four other officers to 2, Crown-place, Crown-street, Soho, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—I found the street-door open and I went up to the two-pair—Bryan and James Brannan were with me—I had left the other two officers outside—I forced the door open and the first thing I saw was three or four children in bed in the first room—another room led out of that where I saw the two prisoners in bed—I said, "Well Mr. Ferryman, I have come to pay you a visit;" he jumped out of bed, and I said, "I have come to take you in custody;" he said, "For what?" I said, "For having coining implements;" he said, "You wont find much; you may find enough to give me a stretch, but not much else"—I called up Elliott and Cook—Bryant and Bran Dan then took the two prisoners—I proceeded to the mantel-shelf, and under an image I found 6 counterfeit sixpences of the date of 1846, they were wrapped separately in paper—I found on the top of that image which was broken, another little packet, containing 4 counterfeit groats of the date of 1844, wrapped separately—I went to a shelf in the room, and in a little box I found a galvanic battery plate with the wire attached, which had evidently been dipped in solution—this jar was full of acid—in a tea-cup close by, I found a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece partly dissolved, and a cup containing a little fluid—I preserved a portion of the acid—in the box I found 2 files with white metal in their teeth—they apparently had been recently used—I found a canister con<lb></lb>taining plaster-of-paris in powder, this bottle which contains acid, and there were several other bottles—I noticed that the copper-wire had been</p>

               <p>dipped—I could tell that the cup had been recently used—there was a little solution in it. I returned to the mantel-shelf and took up this book—Thomas Ferryman said, "Don't take that Mr. Brannan, that is our rent book"—I went to the cupboard and found some sand and several articles all necessary for coining—I found this pad which is for holding the mould when it is so hot that they can't hold it with their hands—these are articles used in manufacturing counterfeit coin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the G division—on 3d September, I accompanied the last witness to 2, Crown-place, Crown-court—I went up stairs and entered the room on the second floor—Thomas Ferryman was getting out of bed when I went into the room—he asked me if I would allow him to dress himself, and I fetched him his clothes which were hanging behind the first room door—I searched them, and in the waistcoat pocket I found a counterfeit spade guinea—he said, "That is mine, take care of it"—he dressed himself, and I assisted in searching the room,—in the first room I found 3 counterfeit groats on the mantel-shelf under an image, they were wrapped up separately in paper—on the shelf I found a small tooth-brush, a galvanic battery wire, and a knife with plaster-of-paris adhering to it, a pair of large scissors, a small tin funnel, and a small iron ladle in a cupboard on the landing outside the door of the room—there was nothing in the ladle, but by the side of it I found this piece of white metal—there were several files, some rotten stone, and a piece of leather.</p>

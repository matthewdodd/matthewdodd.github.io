                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. On the evening of Monday, the 16th of September, I had about a dozen cheeses in my window—I missed one the text morning—this is a part of it—it had a mark of "R," which is still on it—on Wednesday the 18th, the policeman called to say he had got some cheese, and on the 19th, I saw it at the Magistrate's office, on the table—I examined it, but I did not see any mark on it, but I had not time to examine it fully—next day I examined it, and discovered the "R"—it was the same sort of cheese as this, and here is the "R" branded on it with an iron—I am able to swear this is the cheese I lost on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson</hi>. The Magistrate said, "Take it up and look at it"—he took it, and turned it over and over, and said, "It is a little like mine, but if it is, the mark has been cut off, and I cannot swear to it," and the foreman of the shop could not swear to it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It laid on the table—I did not torn it over and over—I did not say if it was mine the mark had been cut off it—I had no doubt it was mine—I was not sure what mark was on it, and the next day I sent a cheese up to the Magistrate to compare it with the mark.</p>

I saw the cheese safe on the evening of the 16th, at seven o'clock, and about eight o'clock I saw Thompson standing about the door—the cheeses were inside the shop, but the window was up—a person in the street could take it—I was in the shop from seven o'clock till ten that evening—we had a good deal of business—I know what was sold—this cheese was not cut—we never cut one when there is another in cut—we have never sold a Cheshire cheese whole since I have been there, which is twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pemmel-court, Church-street, Green<lb></lb>wich, and am a labourer. On Tuesday, the 17th of September, just before dinner-time, Thompson and Charles Bosted came to my house, and my fond Bosted said, "Will you buy a bargain, will you buy a piece of cheese?"—I said, What weight is it?"—they said 16lbs.—I said, "1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 3, Dunster-court, I have the care of two houses. On 1st April, in the evening, I heard a noise in the first floor of No. 3, where I live—I tried the counting-house door, and found it locked—I went out, and saw the prisoner at the first-floor window attempting to escape—I said if be did, I would shoot him—he went back, and I sent for the police—he came to the window again, and jumped out into the court with a piece of iron in his hand—I tried to secure him, but he beat at my head with the iron with great violence, and ran down the court—I pursued and threw a glass bottle at him, which struck him in the back—I pursued him into Mincing-lane, and with the assistance of the police secured him without losing sight of him—he threw down a bunch of picklock keys which the policeman took, and this piece of iron, which I picked up—this key unlocks the door, we found marks of the inner door being tried to be forced—the drawers and cupboards were in a state of confusion, but nothing had been taken.</p>

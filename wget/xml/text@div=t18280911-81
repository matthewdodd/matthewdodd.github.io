On the 31st of July, in the evening, he returned to our house sober; between that and bedtime he became intoxicated, without any apparent means of getting so, the keys of the spirits being in another person's hands - next morning we searched the spirit and wine cellar and found part of a bottle of wine concealed, and under the stairs a parcel of tobacco: we replaced it and kept strict watch till Sunday, the 3d of August, when he was taken with it in his possession.</p>

I was placed in Mr. Potter's shop, where I could command a view of the staircase leading from the cellar; and I saw the prisoner come from the staircase, enter the passage, and go into the street with this parcel - I followed him; as soon as he saw me he took to his heels and ran - I overtook him, with the bundle under his arm, and brought him back; my fellowservant took it from him - an officer was sent for, who opened it and it contained tobacco.</p>

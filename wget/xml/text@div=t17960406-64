               <p>I know the prisoner, and I knew the deceased George Simmonds; I was in company with them on the 29th of March, I was out when the affair happened; I returned before he died, and went home with him in the coach.</p>

               <p>On Easter Tuesday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at Mr. Ralph's, the sign of the Duke's-head, Priest-alley, Tower-street; I went in about a quarter after seven, and called for a pint of porter; I found the prisoner and Simmonds there, they were quarrelling together, something about dictionary words.</p>

            About the meaning of the words? - A. Yes; Simmonds asked me if I had got any porter; I said yes, a pint; he said he would be a pint with me, and make it a pot, and we drank together; Simmonds got up to Newton, and doubled his fist at him, and called him a foolish something, I cannot say rightly what the word was; I pulled him by the coat, and said, George, sit down; he sat down, and got up the second time; I said, do sit down; he doubled his fist at him the second time, and called him a foolish something again, I cannot say what the word was; Newton said to him, if you strike me I will enter an action against you, or serve you with a copy of a with;

             still shook his head at him; Newton said, if you do strike me, I certainly will strike you again;

             then said to Newton, come out; he stripped himself, and they went out into the yard, and I followed them; Simmonds was stripped, Newton was not; George insisted upon fighting; I said they should not; accordingly I went in between them, and said, if you will fight you shall both fall upon me, and when you have beat me enough you will leave off, they then went in doors, I went to make water, and before I was done, they were both out again beginning to fight; George Simmonds had his cloaths off, Newton had not; Newton said to him, are you in carnest? George said, yes; then, says Newton, I will give you something to mind me;

             threw Newton upon the ground, and fell upon him; the second time he served him the same, and fell upon him the second time; the blood ran down Newton, and Newton struck, as night as I can say, at the bottom of the breast,

             then fell backwards, and cut his head on the back, here, (pointing with his finger to the part), he turned on his right; side, and made a noise in his throat, as if he had the rattles; by that, somebody in the yard said, Newton you have killed the man; Newton said, if I have I will not run away; we put Simmonds in a chair, and rubbed his head with brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he lived? - A. No; I was not there when the surgeon was sent for.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I was sent for to Simmonds the day after the accident happened; I found him senseless; I examined the wound; the blow he received on the head produced his death; there was a small fracture in the skull.</p>

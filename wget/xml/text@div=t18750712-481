I am a convict undergoing four months' imprisonment in Coldbath Fields—I had been in the employment of Crosse and Blackwell twelve years in August—I am nineteen now—my sentence is for stealing these three bottles of milk punch and three of cherry brandy—I worked in the town department as packer—the prisoner was a corker of capers in the caper room—he had nothing to do with making up orders or packing goods—he would not receive any orders—I got the three bottles of cherry brandy and three bottles of milk punch from Mr. Best by presenting that piece of paper to him on the Tuesday—the prisoner gave it to me on the Monday, I believe—I can't tell you what he said exactly, but he gave it me to get the goods with—he only asked me to get the cherry brandy and the milk punch—he said he had written it—I was to get the cherry brandy and the milk punch, and take them to him—it was on the Monday he gave it me—I don't know the date—I uttered it on the Tuesday—I got the cherry brandy and punch and took them to the caper room—four women who work for him were there besides</p>

               <p>him—I took the bottles in in a tray on my head—they were lying down—three of them were long bottles, and three about the size of port wine bottles, they were supposed to be pints—we take trays into the caper room if we have sufficient goods to bring out—I did not see the prisoner open the bottles, but he gave me some of it—I gave them to him in the caper room—he gave me some of both—I left the bottles with him in the caper room, and did not see any more of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had some of the stuff in the caper room and Driscoll had some—Mary Ford, Elizabeth Matthews, Mary McDermot and Emma Matthews were there—I was sent to prison for stealing this brandy and punch—I have been there a fortnight to-day—Messrs. Crosse and Black-well were informed about the prisoner while I was in the House of Deten<lb></lb>tion—people came to me and made inquiries about it, and I gave information—the order was given to me on the Monday, and I kept it and gave it to Best on the Tuesday—I knew all the time it was a forged order—we did not say anything to one another when we were drinking it—Driscoll was about four or five yards from the door of the caper room when I went in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell—the prisoner has been in their service about twenty years—this piece of paper, which purports to be an account of stock taken by him in his de<lb></lb>partment at Christmas last, is in his writing—I have seen the order, and from the similarity of the letters, I believe it is the same writing—we have no customer with the initials G. W. at 146, Harrow Road—I have been to that road, and can find no such number.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My belief is they are the same writing and acting on that belief, I consulted Messrs. Allen, the solicitors—that was after Hulbert had been sent to prison for four months.</p>

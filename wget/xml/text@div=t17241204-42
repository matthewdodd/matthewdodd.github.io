About Midnight they all went out together, and passing by the Prosecutor's Shop, Mason struck the Bar of the Windows with his Hand, and said it would be no great Difficulty for them to get in there. He then forced off the Staple. The Prisoner ript off the Hinges of the Outer-Shutters, and wrenched off the Runner of those within, and pushing one of them back, took out the Goods, and so they all returned to the Prisoner's House, where they spent the remaining part of the Night. Next day they put the Breeches into a Sack, went all together, and carried them by turns, till they had dispos'd of them. Two Pair this Evidence pawn'd to Norwood in Hart-street, Covent-Garden for 4s. Five Pair the Prisoner sold to

He observed the Prisoner go a-cross the Way to two of his Companions, who waited for him with a Bundle in a Sack. This made him suspect that they were stol'n, and therefore he stept out after these 3 Men; but they being aware of him, made off. He then had the Breeches cry'd; by which he found that they belong'd to Mr. Watts.

             depos'd, that having heard of Watts's being robbed; and going along Hart-street, he saw Flemmer, whom he knew to be a Rogue, go into Norwood's with 2 Pair of Breeches, while the Prisoner and Mason waited with a Sack on the other side of the Way. All which gave him ground to think that these were the Men that had robb'd Mr. Watts; and therefore he stood still to take Notice of them, which the Prisoner suspecting, said to Mason - D - that Chuckle-beaded Son of a Bitch. What does he stand watching us for? - Go over and take him a Knock. As Mason was coming towards him, Flemmer came out of the House without the Breeches, and so they went away together. This Evidence then went and gave Norwood a Hint, and desired him to stop them when they came again And Flemmer happening to come the same Evening, Norwood apprehended him. He impeached the others, and made himself an Evidence. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the others indeed were at his House the Evening before the Robbery, and they would have had him gone with them; but he refused, went to Bed, and left them below with his Wife. About 3 in the Morning they came again, and called, but he made no Answer. They came a 23d time at Break of Day, with a Sack, and Breeches in it, and told him, if he would go with them to vend them, he should have Part of the Money; which he did; but was no way concern'd in the Robbery. <rs id="t17241204-42-verdict237" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I live at Kingsland. On Wednesday last, my wife and I were returning home from Cheapside. I called a coach. I ordered the coachman to drive to Kingsland Turnpike; he hesitated, and said he lived at Hatton-Garden. I said then he might take us to Shoreditch-Church; but however, he did not stop at <placeName id="t17811017-15-crimeloc73">Shoreditch-Church</placeName>

               <p>What time was it? - A little past two in the morning: it was as light as day. Mrs. Allen tapped me on the knee, and said, My dear, here are thieves. I jumped up, and saw a cutlass at the window. I clapped my hand into my pocket, to save my gold; but one of the fellows immediately opened the door on my side, and jumped into the coach with a cutlass; and, before I could get my hand out of my pocket, the other door was opened, and one jumped in on that side; one stood on each side the door; and the coachman told me that one stood before the horses heads, but I only saw four. I thought to save my gold, but the man was as quick upon me as thought. I put my hand in my other pocket, and gave him some silver. He then asked for my watch. I said I had none. I believe they were in the coach altogether ten minutes. Then one said to the other, D - n him, do him: upon which he catched hold of my wrist, and gave it a twist, and I let all the gold fall to the bottom of the coach.</p>
               <p>He did not cut you with the hanger? - No; he held it close to my face. When he took the hanger from my face, on the money dropping, the handle hit my forehead. The prisoner, Harford, behaved genteel to me; he called me by my name, and shook hands with me. He said to his comrade, If you hurt the gentleman or the lady, I will do you. He then asked me what I had lost? I said sixteen guineas, besides the silver. He then said to his comrade, D - n you, if you do not find sixteen guineas, I will do you before night, for I can depend upon the gentleman. In pulling my breeches off, when I went home, a guinea dropped out of the knee, so that I lost only fifteen guineas in gold. They were not content with the money, but one of them searched me from top to toe, my back and sides, and every where.</p>
               <p>Who did that? - I do not know. I think that man is not taken yet. The others were scrambling in the bottom of the coach for the money. They could not make it out. One of them came back, and said, Here is another guinea in the bottom of the coach. The moon shone-bright. They picked up the last guinea, and then they politely desired my wife and I would rise, and sit on the other side of the coach, while they searched over the seats of the coach. The coach-doors being both open, my hat fell off on the ground. Harford took it up. I had a hatband in it, and he felt all round the hatband. Then they shut the coach-door: I lean'd out at the coach-door, and said, Gentlemen, the hat is of little value, I wish you would give it me again. Harford came back, and politely gave it me; and then the other prisoner came back, and said, Madam, we must have your cardinal; and he wantonly pushed the point of the hanger into the pannel on the outside of the coach: I observed, the hanger had a black handle. I said, No, d - n you, you shall none of you have the cardinal, and was going to jump out of the coach. I said, D - n you, if I had my mare, I would never lose sight of you. Upon that Harford said, No, come along. He genteelly bid me good morning, and squeezed my hand, as lovingly as if he had been my brother. As the coach was going away, my wife said, What a likely young man that is that was on my side of the coach! he resembles very much our boy, we have just lost. I said, So<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170016"></xptr> he does. That was Fowler. In less than half an hour after; my own waggon came up with greens, and all my milk-people. The turnpike-man told my waggoner and the milk-people, that I had been robbed. A milkman said he had just met them all five: that he had met them before, and knew they resided about Grub-street and Moor-lane. In the morning, I got some of Mr. Wilmot's people, and took four of them together; the other two I was not so sure of. The prisoners I am certain to: I had them in my eye a long time together.</p>
               <p>(Two hangers were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. This is the one that Harford had, that was first presented to the outside of the coach; and this other is the hanger which the other wantonly jobbed into the outside of the pannel of the coach.</p>
               <p>Fowler. What mark do you swear to me by? - When he robbed me, he had a brown great coat on: it was as light as day. I saw him as plainly as I do now. The other prisoner brought me the hat open; and I likewise saw his face as plainly as I do now: they had nothing over their faces.</p>
               <p>And you have no doubt in the world about their persons? - None.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, and attend at Justice Wilmot's office. I took Harford that same morning, I believe between nine and ten o'clock. I found these two hangers in Fowler's lodgings. I don't know where Harford's lodging was.</p>
               <p>How came you to know it was Fowler's lodging? - He was asked where his lodgings were, and he told Yardley, who took him up. I found the h angers concealed in a closet.</p>
               <p>Fowler. They were on a shelf, they were not concealed in the closet. - They were upon a shelf: Yardley was searching the closet, and I found them.</p>

               <p>I took Fowler. I asked him where he lodged; he said at No. 12, in Honey-suckle Court, Grub-street. I told Wade it was necessary to go and search, as Mr. Allen had made mention of some hangers. Accordingly we went. I was searching the bottom of the closet, and Wade put his hand on the shelf, and found these hangers. I found two brown coats in the house, which Fowler claims to be his. We took two more besides the prisoners: they were very much intoxicated. Mr. Allen could swear to only the two prisoners, therefore the magistrate discharged the others.</p>
               <p>To Allen. Were the persons who robbed you, much in liquor at the time? - No: they appeared perfectly sober; so sober, that they told the money, and found that a guinea was wanting; and they came back to pick that last guinea up.</p>

               <p>Harford. When I was taken on the Wednesday morning, that man asked Mr. Allen if he knew me: he said he thought he knew my voice. I was taken to Mr. Wilmot's: he was asked if he could swear to me. He only said, he believed he could swear to me. They trembled so, the court took notice of it. I was remanded, and the next day, he positively swore to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. The first day, I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>(The information taken by the justice, was read in court, and exactly corresponded with the evidence now given by the prosecutor.)</p>

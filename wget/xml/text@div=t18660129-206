                  </hi>. I reside at 35, Thistle-grove, Brompton, Middlesex—on 5th January I was passing along Cheapside, when my attention was called by a gentleman behind to my handkerchief being stolen, and that the two men had run down the side street—I followed them—they were stopped by an officer, taken to the station and charged—they denied it—they were searched and the handkerchief was found upon one of them.</p>

On 5th January I was in Milk-street and saw the prisoners coming down one side of the street—a gentleman was running after them—I took hold of both of them and asked the gentleman what they were charged with—he said with stealing a hand<lb></lb>kerchief from a gentleman's pocket in Cheapside—they made no reply—the prosecutor then came up—I took them to the station and the handkerchief was found upon Reynolds.</p>

I was in Milk-street, Cheapside; Reynolds came up to me, and asked if I could direct him to Spitalfields; I was walking with him a step or two, and was about to direct him, when a gentleman came and gave him into custody; I don't know anything of Reynolds, and he will tell you so.</p>

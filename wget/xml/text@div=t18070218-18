On the 13th of January she was dismissed about eight or nine o'clock; on the 14th, when the time of winding up the watches came, I missed three more. In the evening my man takes the watches down to the safe, and deposits them, and he comes up again with the box; in the morning he takes them up again, he comes up with one box first, the safe is left open while he comes for another parcel; I judge she went to the safe and took them. When I missed them, I supposed it must be her, I went with the officer who is present to apprehend her, he searched her, and found two tickets, and one watch was found upon her. There were produced before the lord mayor, five watches, two by the pawnbrokers, and two by Mr. Aldridge, and one that was found in the water closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of the house. - A. I have the lease of the house. I have two sisters live in the house, they have nothing to do with the rent of the house, they have one third of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her. - A. A very good character with her; I turned her away for being so dirty, I dismissed her before I missed all the watches.</p>
               <p>MR. ALDRIDGE. On Tuesday evening the prisoner at the bar came to my house, about eight o'clock in the evening; she said she wanted a gold key, I shewed her some, she fixed on one, then she asked me if I bought watches, I said no, not on my own judgment, not being acquainted with watches, but that I would shew them to a watchmaker, and get them valued; if she would call again the next day at twelve o'clock she should know the value of them. She came the next morning at ten o'clock, I had not shewn them to the maker then; she said that she wanted to go to Brighton with her mother and a child that was bit by a og, that made her call so soon, it would be near a fortnight before she returned; she wanted some money in order<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180027"></xptr> to defray the expences. With that she said I should have the two watches all the time; she had a guinea first and then I lent her four shillings, I was to keep the watches till she returned. She came no more. The next day the city marshall came from my lord mayor, to let me know that she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the young woman. - A. I should not know her now, I swore to her before the magistrate; she was then in a pelisse, in the same state as when she came to my shop not in that state she is now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Barras, at Laleham. He left home on the 2nd of September—I sleep in the house when the family are out. On Thursday night, the 5th of September, I saw the premises locked up, and all safe at a quarter past ten o'clock—I came in at ten o'clock, and the scullery and kitchen-doors were locked about ten minutes after that—my fellow-servant and I went to bed about a quarter to eleven o'clock—I got up at half-past five o'clock, and when I went down I found the scullery-door which I had seen locked up the night before, open—it was not broken—the lock was thrown back, and it was open—the larder, and the safe drawer were open, and a wire window between the dairy and the larder was torn open—I then went into the yard and found the dairy-door, which is in the yard, open—I missed from the dairy two pieces of beef out of a salting-pan, and some bacon, and three brace of partridges, and about 10lbs. of cheese out of the larder, and several other articles—the wood-work to which the bar of the window of the knife-house was fixed, had been cut through with some instrument, and the iron-bar forced in—it was taken out, and laid outside in the yard—I missed one pair of my master's boots, and three pairs of the children's—close outside the dairy-door, about two yards from the window, I saw some marks on the ground—they had been made by corduroy trowsers or breeches, at the knee—I gave information to the police at Staines—I was present when Taylor searched a cart in Harris the constable's yard, at Egham—there Was Beef, lard, butter, partridges, and all the things I have named, found, and a kitchen cloth, marked "W. B. K., No. 12," which is master's mark—I fully believe the articles to be my master's—I could not swear to them, but every thing I saw corresponded with what was lost—I have not the least doubt of the towel, and I had cut the bacon the night before, but a stood deal of it had been used after it had been taken—there was not the same quantity, but it was the hind part, and dry, the hock—I did not see the boots.</p>

                  </hi>. I was committed with the prisoners on this charge, but have been permitted to give evidence—I have lived with Wheatley six years—I had been going to leave him for the last three months—on Thursday night, the 5th of September, I went to bed as usual, about nine o'clock, or a little after—Richardson and Ball boarded and lodged in the house, and used to sleep there—Wheatley went to bed with me that night—Ball and Richardson were at home at the time—none of things claimed by the prosecutor were in the house then—I heard a talking between four and five o'clock in the morning, and went down stairs—Wheatley had been gone down about five minutes—I did not dress my<lb></lb>self—when I got down Ball and Richardson were there, anil had got their</p>

               <p>trowsers on—Wheatley was not dressed—I do not know whether Balt and Richardson had been in bed—there was some bacon, cheese, butter, and lard on the table—I said to Wheatley, "How came you by all this victuals?"—he said, "This is the cheese I ought to have had for the races; but as I did not have it then, I roust keep it for my own use; you are not wanted, you may go to bed; you need not ask any questions"—I saw a pair of boots by the side of the chair, and some birds on the chair-back—I did not notice what birds they were, and could not say how many here were—there were two pieces of salted beef on the table—I went to bed—two or three days afterwards I heard one say to the other, (but which spoke I do not know,) that they had sold the birds and the boots to Cutler—on the 10th, the day before the cart was borrowed, Wheatley said, if I left him he would stop my goods to pay the rent—I had said that day that I should leave him—he meant my household furniture—Ball said, "Rather than see your goods taken from you, I would hire a cart, and take lethem to Laleham for you"—I had taken a house at Laleham—the cart was borrowed, and I took out an old bedstead, and put in—among other things, the cheese and other articles produced were put into a drawer, not a box—and I believe they were put into the cart, but I did not see it done—I was not awake when they came in on the morning of the 6th—only when I awoke I heard the talking, and Wheatley got up—I do not know who put the victuals in the drawer—I never saw this towel till Mr. Taylor showed it to me—it was not in my drawer on the Sunday—I never saw any apron.</p>

About the 24th or 25th of February last we had information that our warehouses were robbed of a considerable quantity of oil. And on the 26th at night. I had information brought me that the prisoner was taken in getting a barrel of oil out of the cellar: upon which I went and saw the barrel out of the cellar by the door, near the water-side at St. Paul's warf, the prisoner was then in custody; he has worked for us a year or two.</p>

            . I was called out for a fare between 6 and 7 at night. I do not know the exact time. I saw a man come on shore at them stairs with a long sack or bag: it appeared to me to have an empty cask in it: he passed me. Presently another man came down to the stairs head. I and

             were looking out for a fare; by and by I saw the man that came first by me with a small cask on his shoulder: he got it away in an instant. And on the Saturday following, I saw that same fellow came peeping about there again; but I having a fare to carry a person to Westminister, did not see the last of him then. After that Mr. Enderby hired me as a watchman. I saw the prisoner and another man come on shore in a waterman's boat; I got behind a nook, behind the corner of the necessary. A boy said to me, What are you doing here? I said, I am waiting for a fare: it rained that night. Presently this man and another asked the boy to drink; the boy said, Thank you; and went with the prisoner. After he came back again, the boy said, Mr. Ellen, I am afraid I am upon no good design: these men have agreed with me, I am to carry them up, with a vessel of small beer, for a shilling. I went up to the Fortune of War, and told my two assistants (they are servants to the prosecutors) I desired them to be in the way, for there were two strapping fellows, I could not take them myself: then I went down to my boat, and broke my mop-stick in two: said the boy, What did you do that for? I said, to shy at the rats; don't you see how they run about? by and by came the two thieves out of that public house; they and my two assistants had been all fitting together. I saw the prisoner fumbling at the cellar door of the warehouse; he clapped his shoulder to it, and shoved it open: by and by I saw him roll a cask of oil out of the warehouse. I jumpt to him, and said, You villain, what do you do that for? he said, What, What, What, What! and made a blow at me, and miss'd me. I took this stick and knocked him down with it. (Producing a large piece of a mop-stick.) The other fellow was come out of the cellar; I made a blow at him; he bobb'd his head and I miss'd him. I jumpt to the prisoner, and swore I would blow his brains out if he did not go with me; but I had nothing but this mop-stick about me. I took and led him almost forty yards, calling Thieves, Fire, and the like, but nobody came to help me. When I came to the public house door, there came out one of my assistants, with a pipe in his mouth; the prisoner had insisted upon going into that public house, and I gave him another knock on the head, because he should not get away from me. When I got him into the public house, there sat my other assistant, with a pipe in his mouth: then they went away, and left me to take care of the prisoner. I asked for a pennyworth of gin. I then asked for a knife to cut the waist-band of his breeches, that he should not run away. He said don't cut my flesh. Every one in the house called me thief-catcher except the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170039"></xptr>Ellen. God knows; for I had enough to do take care of the prisoner. The servants said, after they had hunted about they bolted the warehouse-door; but in the morning the door was open: I imagine he ran into the warehouse. The prisoner said he was to carry that cask to the Britannia, by London bridge, where a Jew was to have met him for it. We took and marched him to look for Mr. Jew, but I kept him so long that the Jew was gone. He owned he had taken a cask the day before.</p>

               <p>I was coming out of the public house, going to the necessary house by the water side; I tumbled over this barrel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The barrel of oil lay by the warehouse door. The prisoner acknowledged to me that he took it out, and that he had taken some before.</p>
               <p>Ellen. The other man with him was a very stout fellow; we imagine he has entered himself for a soldier, to go to the East Indies.</p>

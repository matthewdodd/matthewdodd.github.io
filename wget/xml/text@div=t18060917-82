On the 20th of July I had been invited to supper, and having staid later than usual, I was quite intoxicated, I was returning home, as I suppose, about twelve o'clock; I have no further recollection than about nine o'clock the next morning I found myself in a house in Bow-street, Covent-garden; I missed the gold seals, a watch chain, and a silk handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the last witness coming to your house. - A. I let him in on a Saturday night, between one and two in the morning; he had the prisoner with him, I had seen the prisoner before with other gentlemen, they seemed to be both of them very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them into a room in your house. - A. I did. It was about three o'clock when she went out, she went out by herself, and left him in the room.</p>

             sworn. On Sunday the 20th of July, I went to No. 4, Charles-street, Long-acre, and there I found the prisoner; I told her what I came about, she said the gentleman had given her the handkerchief, she gave the handkerchief to me, and there were two seals and a chain wrapped up in it, and she said she did not know how they were there; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To prosecutor) Do you know the chain, seals, and handkerchief. - A. The chain was fixed to my small clothes pocket, and the seals were hanging to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief you do not know. - A. No, they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor had only three bad half guineas with him, he gave me the handkerchief, and I left him upon that condition.</p>

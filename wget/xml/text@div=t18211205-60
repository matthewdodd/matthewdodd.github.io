On Sunday, the 19th of November, in consequence of some suspicions which we had, Mr. Chapman put two half-crowns, eight shillings, and two sixpences, into my purse, in my presence, and marked them all. I left my purse in a little work basket, on the back drawing-room table, it was all safe on Monday, at about a quarter past one o'clock. About three o'clock, I missed a shilling out of it; the prisoner had been in the house all the time.</p>

            . In consequence of suspicions entertained by me, I marked two half crowns, eight shillings, and two sixpences, so that I should know them again. Mrs. Chapman brought the purse to me about three o'clock, and I missed one shilling out of it, I called the prisoner to me, he had been sent out to get a watch glass for me. I asked him how much he had paid for it, and gave him a half sovereign, desiring him to give me change, he gave me two half-crowns, one shilling, and sixpence, saying he would give me the remainder afterwards. I instantly perceived that it was that shilling which had been taken out of the purse; it had my mark on both sides, I charged him with the theft, and talked to him some time, on the consequence of such proceedings, and promised never to disclose it; he trembled exceedingly, and sat down. I continued to talk to him, he offered to swear that he had not touched the purse, I said, I was sorry he should say so, as the money was marked. He then said, the housemaid had paid him one shilling that morning, and that must be it; the housemaid was called down, and in his presence, she stated, she had paid him a shilling, but persisted in her innocence. I sent him on an errand, when he returned, he appeared to have been drinking; for he was very violent, and said, he would not live with a thief, and positively fetched an officer to take the girl up. I produce the shilling, I have had it sealed up ever since, I swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where is the mark - A. Under the chin; I did it with the point a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked to him about it, and he became frightened, and went to a Justice - A. He became frantic. Mr. Burgess, my fellow curate, called, and he wished him to examine the girl, to try if she would confess; he persisted throughout that he was innocent, I said if he would confess, I would not disclose it, it was his madness and infatuation that made me bring him here.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to MRS. CHAPMAN. Q. Was not the basket in which your purse was left, in the room the greater part of Sunday and Monday - A. It was accessible to every person in the house. The last time I looked at the purse, was eleven o'clock in the morning, but I remained in the room till a quarter past one o'clock.</p>

            . I have lived with Mr. Chapman about three months, I recollect, Monday, the 19th of November, I paid the prisoner a shilling, about twelve o'clock, that day; I am sure it was not twelve o'clock. I owed him 6 s., he did not ask for it, I had had the shilling several days, I took it out of a small drawer, in the kitchen, where I occasionally keep silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many shillings had you - A. Only this one; I had a sixpence at the top of the house.

            . I am cook to the prosecutors. On Monday morning, at twelve o'clock, I was coming down the area steps, Worrel was sitting in the kitchen, and the prisoner was in the pantry. On the 10th of November, I remember I received 18 d. of Worrell, she gave me half a crown, out of the kitchen drawer, and I gave her 1 s. I believe that was the only shilling she had.</p>

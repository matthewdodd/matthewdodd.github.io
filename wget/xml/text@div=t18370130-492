                  </hi>. I am cook to Mrs. Anne Talfourd, who lives in Nor<lb></lb>man-house, North-end, in the parish of Fuiham. I have been in her service better than four months—on the 14th of January, about a quarter put seven o'clock in the morning, I found the back parlour shutters and window open—it is on the ground floor—I was in that room the night before about ten o'clock—Mrs. Talfourd was in that room at ten o'clock—the left the room to go to bed then—I was there then and observed that the window was fastened with a little catch which goes into a loop—I fastened it myself—there were three other servants in the house—I was up first in the morning—I observed some castors on the floor, and the chiffonier there they bad been the night before, open—I missed four salt-spoons from the chiffonier, a mustard-spoon, a silver tea-pot, a silver cream-jug, the silver top of the pepper-castor, and the Missionary box, which is a box to collect money for the ministers abroad—I found the Missionary box in the garden open and empty, and I found a work-box under a tree opposite side window—that was not open—I have not found any of the silver or other articles—I observed some footmarks on the flower bed—one footstep was right up to the window—they were. the footsteps of two people—I saw a ladder at the bottom of the garden, up against the wall, on the garden side—it is a very high wall—the ladder belongs to a market gardener next door—it was a strange ladder to me—I saw footsteps going towards the ladder from the flower bed—the ladder was more than the length of this court from the window—the window had been opened with a chisel—there were marks of a chisel having been put in underneath and prised it up—there was a curious mark in one heel of the footsteps—I know nothing of the prisoner—it was not light enough to see without a candle when I got up—I should not have known the face of a man without a light—Mrs. Tal<lb></lb>fourd is a widow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Fulham—I know Mrs. Talfourd's house, it is in the parish of Fulham—I heard of the robbery between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 14th—on the night before, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was in Star-lane, Fulham-fields, about four hundred yards from Mrs. Talfourd's garden wall, and saw the prisoner and two others—they were going in a direction towards the garden, and they said, "Good night"—I knew the prisoner before—I was side by side with him—I was going to Hammer<lb></lb>smith, and he was going towards Norman House—I am quite positive of him—there was a constable with me—the prisoner said, "Good night," and the constable said, <hi rend="italic">"Night"</hi>—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—I have not the least doubt of him—I took him into custody about seven o'clock the next evening, in a public-house at Hammer-smith—I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I took him to the station-house and gave him in charge—I also found a pair of gloves and a silk handkerchief on him—on the Sunday morning I took his shoes off—he is lame, and both his feet are not alike—here are the shoes—I went with them to the garden between to and eleven o'clock—I noticed the window, it had been prised up to force</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300010"></xptr>
               <p>the thing off the hook—they could then get in—there is a flower-bed under the window, there were tracks upon it of only one person—the window might be about four feet from the bed—any body opening the window, could get in easily enough—I also observed tracks in other parts of the, garden towards the garden wall—there appeared tracks of two persons in, the garden, and three outside—I observed the tracks of two persons just under the window, as if walking backwards and forwards—they had been to two windows—there was only the track of one person under the window which was open—the tracks of the other person were within two yards of that window—there was the mark of the heel of a left foot without a tip under the window—the shoes were right and left—on the right foot there was a quantity of nail marks to be seen—there has been a piece of of iron round this heel, but the half is worn off—the ground was all fresh dag, and was soft—I applied this shoe in the presence of the witness, and the Inspec<lb></lb>tor—I looked at the foot, then put it down gently to see if it fitted, and it fitted in every respect—I also put it down at the side of the impression once, and found it corresponded—it left an impression just the same—there are three nails—there was only the impression of one which sticks up the highest—I could not discern the others—here is a double row of iron nails, I could not discern that, but they corresponded in every degree, and so did the im<lb></lb>pression I made with the shoe—the prisoner being lame, this right shoe in made high to keep him level—there are seven nails on one side, and six and four on the other, and as he came from the ladder, this was the first foot he had put down—the flower-bed goes all round the garden from the ladder to the window, and I traced that from the ladder, right up to the window step by step—the precise number of nails were to be seen, and where he had made a false step the impression was to be seen—we could count the nails—on one place was seven nails, and the other places two rows of six, and the shoe is worn more down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the police—I was present on Sunday, the 15th, when the two shoes were applied to the tracks in the gar<lb></lb>den—they agreed in every respect—I applied the one with the tip off the heel, to the side of the other mark, and it entirely corresponded with it, and then we applied it to the track itself—we applied the right shoe in the same way in several places, both in the track, and by making one with it, in my judgment both exactly fitted—it is quite a common thing for a man in the prisoner's station in life to have nails and iron tips—I could make out the precise number of nails—seven nails—six within and four on the opposite side—the servant saw them compared inside the garden.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night the robbery happened I had been to Hammersmith, and was coming home—I live in Star-lane—I met the po<lb></lb>licemen about five minutes to twelve o'clock—one of them did me good night—I was with two young men, and had been drinking at a Public house—when I came home to my lodging I was fastened out, and could not get in—one of the young men said, "I have to go nearly as far as Chelsea, I am afraid I shall be locked out, we had better go to a public-house and get something to drink"—we went to Kensington and Hammer<lb></lb>smith,</p>

               <p>and about six o'clock in the morning we came along home, and met a policeman, who searched us all three, and let us go, and next day I was taken to the station-house, but I knew nothing of it—the landlady of the public-house I was at, came before the Magistrate, and said I came there with two more young men, and if I had any property she must have seen it, and we came out of her place at six o'clock in the morning—but the Magistrate said there was no occasion for her to come here.</p>

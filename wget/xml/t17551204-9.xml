I had strong reason towards the latter part of his time to suspect him of robbing me (his having a quantity of money about him.) I carried seventeen shillings in silver to an engraver in Gutter-Lane, for him to put a private mark on each, which he did. Then I gave 8 s. 6 d. to one Wilson, and the like to Mrs. Rayner, to come and lay out with the prisoner before I got up the next morning, at nine o'clock. When I got up, I went and look'd in the money-drawer, and there I found 11 s. 6 d. and no more; then I went to the two persons, and found the woman had laid out with him 6 s. 6 d. and Mr. Wilson 8 s. 6 d. which made 15 s. Then I asked the prisoner what money he had taken, he said he had put it all in the drawer. I asked him what Mrs. Rayner had laid out, he said 4 s. 6 d. I said has she not laid out 6 s. 6 d. then he said yes she had. I asked him what Mr. Wilson had laid out, he said 6 s. 6 d. I said if you recollect, he laid out 8 s. 6 d. which he own'd; then I sent for a constable, and desired he'd let me see what money he had about him; he readily pulled out about 9 or 10 l. I said I must search him; when he found that, he pull'd out 3 s. 6 d. from his waistcoat pocket, and flung that on the table: Then I sent for the engraver who mark'd the money, and he pick'd out that 3 s. 6 d. which he took from his waistcoat pocket, and the 11 s. 6 d. in the drawer. All mark'd money. The constable has got it in his possession now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner had put the money into the till and taken it out again?</p>

               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of the till?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. There is no key at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to trust him to take money for you in the shop?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. Yes, I had frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money he laid down on the table?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. He said he had been robbing me for 3 months past, and all the money he had was mine.</p>

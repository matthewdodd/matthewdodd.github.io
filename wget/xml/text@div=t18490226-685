                  </hi> I live at 9, Leman-street, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel, it is my dwelling-house. On 12th Feb. I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I was the last up—I left the back-parlour window shut, the blind down, and a piece of wood between the two headings to keep the window from going up or down—I came down first next morning about half-past seven, and found the window open and the piece of wood in the parlour, the drawers turned out and box opened, and the money in it gone, the box put on the table, and the receipts out of it—I also missed a brooch, a breast-pin, a necklace, a stamp, and a needle-case—these are them—I saw them the day before.</p>

I went to the house and found the window partly open; it might be opened by moving the stick—about half<lb></lb>an-hour afterwards I saw the prisoner and three or four others in Green-street, Spitalfields, holding some beads in front of him—seeing a star on the snap which had been described to me, I took him and asked where he got the beads—he said they belonged to his sister—he pulled his hand out of his pocket and dropped a brass ring—I picked it up—he said, "That is only brass: it is good for nothing"—I took him into a public-house parlour and asked whose it was—he said his sister's—I asked where she lived—he said in the Borough, but refused to tell me where—I found this stamp and needle<lb></lb>case in his pocket.</p>

I was paid the last, and was playing at shittels in the skittle-ground; until I was paid; I was about two hours in the skittle-ground; the prisoner was there. When I had got my money, I was going home to my lodging; as I was going through a bank in Stepney-fields, where there was an opening, the prisoner and another man were lying down on the other side, and the other man gave me a smack, and knocked me down, and this prisoner took my money; there were two ten-pound note, and three single notes. I never saw the prisoner from the time I was robbed, until about six weeks ago, nor did I ever see him before I saw him in the skittle-ground. After the robbery, I met a man, who advised me to go to Shadwell office, and tell what had happened; I did so, and an officer went with me, and looked every where after the man who had robbed me. I gave the officers a description of the man. I went to sea soon after I was robbed, and was gone for eight months. When I came back, I did not stay here long, but went to Russia almost directly; nobody was with me when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. He is older now; he has different clothes on; but his face is not materially altered; he had larger whiskers then than he has now; I described him to the officers has having long whiskers when he robbed me. I can't say I was sober at the time, nor was I drunk; I could stand, or go, or do any thing. I will swear I was not sick in the public-house. This was a very public field. The officers have been supporting me since the last session; I have heard that there is a forty pound reward if the man is cast.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Shadwell police office. I first saw the last witness in the Summer of 1814; but on what day I can't remember; it was about eight o'clock at night, when I was shutting up the office; he said he had been robbed about half an hour before; he did not give me a description at that time; he gave me a description on the 30th of March, after he had been a voyage. We made every search for the man without effect. In consequence of the description he gave me, the prisoner was apprehended. I was ordered by the magistrate to support the prosecutor, because he was a foreigner, and had no friends.</p>

I never saw the prisoner before in my life; if he had been in the skittle ground that afternoon, I must have seen him; he was not there.</p>

               <p>there was some copper doubled up by Graves—I saw him put it into a bes<lb></lb>ket, and take it away—It was basket he usually put the tools in—Graves was there as labourer to Hastings—after breakfast I returned to the infirmary—It was after nine o'clock—some copper was then doubled up by Hastings—Graves put that in the basket—he was by ay the time Hastings was doubling it up—the prisoners were removed, to work at another part of the buildings, and Graves carried the basket with them—that was a little after nine o'clock—there is a place below where the cop<lb></lb>per should he taken to—It is a part of the preemises occupied by the college—It is not usual to double it up, and put it in a basket—It could not be seen in the basket.</p>

On the morning of 30th April, I had been in the Whitechapel County Court, and a verdict was given against me—it was for a milk business which I had purchased of the defendants—on leaving the Court, I saw the defendants; neither of them said anything to me then about buying the business back, but a month or so before Griffith Griffiths had said it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would not mind giving me that for it—on the evening of 30th April, I went to Griffith Griffiths to ask if he would give me the money he had said—I had not seen Robert Griffiths for a month before—my wife, my daughter, and my son, went with me, and I said to them, "You stop here while I go and see if Griffith Griffiths will give the money"—I arrived at his place, in Slater Street, about 8 o'clock—Robert Griffiths was at the door, and Griffith Griffiths was sitting by the fire—I spoke to Robert Griffiths, as I had not seen him so long, and I was going to ask him to have a glass of ale—he told me to be off, and he struck me in the eye with his fist, and then he struck me on the head with a long stick, with a knob to it—I considered it was one that they drive the cows with—it was with the knob he struck me on the head—I was stunned for a moment, and fell, and on recovering I looked and saw Griffith Griffiths strike my daughter across the forehead with a poker—Robert Griffiths caught hold of me, and while I was tussling with him, I caught his coat, and part of his coat came into my hand—that is all recollect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Trevallion, and the daughter of the last witness. I remember the County Court day—on leaving the Court, my father said to Griffith Griffiths, "Why did not you take the money I offered you?"—I think we left the Court about 12 o'clock; I went home with my father—about 8 o'clock in the evening, I accompanied my father to Griffith Griffiths's house; my father said very likely he would take the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—when we got to his house Robert Griffiths came out, and my father put out his hand, and said, "Well, old fellow, how are you?" and Robert Griffiths up with his hand and hit my father in the face, and he returned into the house and got a stick, and then Griffith Griffiths came out with a poker behind him, and struck my father, and knocked him down on the stones—my mother went to get him up; I went to assist her, and Griffith Griffiths struck me with the poker on the forehead—I did not notice the size of the poker; he afterwards hit me in the face with his fist, and then hit me four times more with the poker, over my shoulders and arms—I thought my left arm was broken; it dropped down by my side—I reeled against the grain pit, and in a few minutes the policeman came, and some<lb></lb>body assisted me in the street—before this I heard Robert Griffiths say to my father. "I will give you something," and he was holding up the stick—I went to the station, and was attended by a surgeon for eight days.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 227) I took Trevallion into custody about half past 2 o'clock, it was for throwing some bricks—on the way to the station I saw her father, the two sons, and her husband—the father was very violent, and threatened to kill Griffith Griffiths before he went to bed—his wife said, "We will have your money, and your blood too"—Mrs. Amos called Mrs. Griffiths a w—, and said, "I will have your liver out before you sleep to-night"—after the charge was made they came out, and Amos said, "You shall suffer for this"—Griffith Griffiths did nothing, he was very quiet.</p>

               <p>in the back yard—I saw Mrs. Trevallion in the yard, and there was a young man there, who I think was a son of Mr. Amos—I did not see the Griffithses at all—the young man and Mrs. Trevallion were making use of abusive language—afterwards, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I saw Amos there; he said, "Come out, I will thrash you like a dog"—he called him a b—villain, and said, "Will you give me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back for it?"—Mr. Griffiths said, "It don't suit me"—Amos said, "You are a b—villain; come out, and I will drive your teeth down your throat"—about 8 o'clock in the evening I saw Mr. Griffiths fighting with two men, and I saw a woman rush in between them, I suppose, to scratch his face—I heard Griffith Griffiths order them out of the yard two or three times—at that time the policemen were fetched—I have known Griffith Griffiths five or six years; he is a quiet sort of neighbour—I do not suppose I have spoken to either of them above five or six times.</p>

                  </hi>. A window of my house looks into the yard of the prisoners—on that evening, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I saw Mr. Amos, his wife, and daughter, and son—I heard Amos say that if Griffiths would come out he would thrash him like a dog, be it when it may, or where it may—Mrs. Trevallion called him a wretch—Amos said he would not pay him a d—farthing, and Mrs. Amos said she would sooner keep her husband in prison all his life than she would pay it—I saw them again about 8 o'clock; they came to the yard again, and I heard Amos say, "Come out, I will thrash you"—I heard Mrs. Amos call Mrs. Griffiths a nasty, bitter w—, and she said she could prove her a w—, pointing to the brother, Robert Griffiths, who was there—they kept there a long tune—I left the window, and went in—I heard Griffiths say, "Go out of my premises, I will have my premises clear"—I have known them fifteen months—they are very quiet people, I never heard them have any words.</p>

I live two doors from the defendants' premises—on 30th April, about 6 o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Amos came into my shop; she seemed very much excited—about 8 o'clock I heard a disturbance, and I went up the gateway, and saw Mrs. Amos, her daughter, her son, and her husband, and Mrs. Amos said to Mrs. Griffiths, "You nasty, dirty, stinking w—, come out; if you don't come out, I will pull you out; I know you like an old man"—I saw Robert Griffiths come out of the cow house, and go into the room, and they said, "There he goes, we will pull him out"—I saw Joseph Amos take up a pail, and he attempted to cut down Robert Griffiths with it—he said, "I will cut you down with the pail"—he tried to strike him with it in his hand—at that time Griffith Griffiths came out with the poker, and said, "Will you leave the yard?"—Mr. Amos made a blow at Robert Griffiths, and pulled him out—when I saw the poker I came out of the yard, and saw no more—when the persons in the yard saw the poker they all mustered together to fight, and tore Robert Griffiths's coat—I saw Griffith Griffiths hold the poker up, and saw the persons fight him—I did not see him use the poker—when Robert Griffiths came out of the cow house to go into the room, he never answered the people—it appeared to me that the Griffithses were doing no more than acting in their own defence—they are very quiet people—I rent the next house to them, and the next to that.</p>

               <p>house, next door to Mr. Griffiths. I heard a disturbance between two women and two men, from 6 o'clock till about half past—they called Mr. Griffiths's name, and said they would beat him, and put their fists in his face, and knock his teeth all down his throat, let them see him where they might—Mr. Griffiths told them to go out of his yard—they would not—one man pulled his coat off, and the women were calling Mrs. Griffiths all the dirty w—they could lay their tongues to—they did so a great many times—Mr. Griffiths did not come out to answer them—I saw them at 8 o'clock, they were in the yard, the same two men and women—Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths were in doors—the door was closed—they were wanting Mr. Griffiths to come out, or they would break the door—if Mr. Griffiths had not come out, I believe they would have burst the door open—I did not see him come out, I believe he did come—I have known them four years; I do not think there is one can speak evil of them.</p>

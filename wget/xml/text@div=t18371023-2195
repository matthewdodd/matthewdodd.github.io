                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Charles-street, Westminster—my father keeps the house. I have known the prisoner a long time—he is a gentleman's servant, and lived with Mr. Christian—he came on the 3rd of October, and asked me to give him a glass of water—I went down stairs for it, returned in five minutes, gave him the water, and he went away—I missed the watch in less than five minutes—I had seen it in a basket early that morning—he came about twelve o'clock—this is the watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Miss Harris gave me information of this—I heard the prisoner was out with his master's carriage, and went to Wandsworth, to his master's house, and waited till he came home with the carriage—I called him aside, and told him, in the presence of his master, that he was charged with stealing the watch—he denied it, and said he had never seen it—I took him outside the gate, and began searching him—I felt something in the shape of a watch in his pocket, and asked him what it was—he said he would tell me the truth, that it was the watch, and begged me not to inform his master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he say any thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said he did not know what possessed him at the time—he did not say he had often had the watch before—I am sure of that—he had got a watch of his own in his pocket—I did not notice that he had been drinking.</p>

The mob had by this time gathered about the house, to the fore door; our people were carrying them across the way to Mr. Jones's; he is a publican and has an entered cellar; there was a large mob assembled at this time round the house, but they did not attempt to take any away, but kept abusing Felton, a man that was employed by me as an extra man about a fortnight; I took no manner of notice of that, till I got all the kegs but three over the way, these three kegs stood in the passage; then one of the people that was in the cellar called out to me and said it was all out, and begged me to come down and see; while I was there I heard Felton call to me by name, and when I came out he was gone, and the kegs were gone likewise; I had not seen any of these prisoners in the mob before I ran out, and found the mob had dispersed two different ways; one up the hill, and one down the hill; I went to rescue Felton up the hill, where I was informed he was carried, and the rest of the people with me; I went up armed with pistols cocked, and found Felton surrounded by the mob, and they were heaving stones at him; he was protected till I came up by two other of our people that I left as a guard, I had information against four houses, they all lay close together, and by threatning to fire at the mob I rescued him and brought him down; they had him every way, he had his pistols cocked, but he could not tell who to fire at; I did not see any body in the mob that I knew; I brought him down to Jones's, the mob soon after that surrounded the house; we got ourselves into a small parlour; they made a demand of me to turn him out; I cannot say who made the demand, the expression was, turn out the b - gg - r, we'll have him dead or alive; I said they should not, while I was alive; then they swore they would have him; they knocked in all the windows in the front, and likewise the windows of the hind part; I had a hurt on my arm by a stone 3 lb. weight, I thooght it was broke, all that I saw that I knew, was the prisoner Rowe, him I saw close by me among the mob; the mob was quite thick; I heard him call out, d - n you, if you are all of my mind, I will go in and drive all the b - g - rs to hell; I am very clear it was him, because I made him an answer; I told him, you ought not to be the man to say so, for a little while ago you wanted a birth; they kept us in that situation for four or five hours; I searched the next day, but it was too late.</p>
               <p>This was in the parish of Kingston? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people might there be in this mob? - It was impossible to count them, but there were upwards of two hundred; our party consisted of ten; at last I saw a Custom-house officer I knew; I desired him to go down to the beach to get assistance; and shortly after we had assistance; and when I thought we were strong enough to get Felton out, we determined to fire, and defend ourselves, but when we came out, nothing was done till we came down to the beach and got him safe off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs, Prisoners Counsel. Was there any thing said about the informer by any body? - Yes, they called him an informing rascal.</p>
               <p>That was what they wanted? - They said, they wanted the informer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you ever get back the kegs? - No.</p>

               <p>What became of Snell and the kegs? - The first time I saw him, was upon the green; I cannot exactly tell how many minutes it might be, but he came up some time afterwards, with his hands in his bosom; Oh, you b - g - r! says he; that was all I saw Snell do; when I first ran upon the green, Rowe threw stones, and wanted to get hold of me, but when he got nigh me, he did not heave any more stones; the other man was in company with Rowe, and made the same offer to lay hold of me; they swore they would tear me limb from limb, and that I should not go home alive; and I held out a pistol; I was on the green about twenty minutes; Bradley came up with some more to my assistance; and I went down again; the mob heaved glass bottles and stones; at last I got into the house of Jones; and Ruthey said, when I was going down, the B - g - r! I have two pistols at home, I will go and fetch them; so when I saw him again, it was in the room; I saw him throw the glass; I saw no pistols, but I saw three cutlasses with

I live in Brownlow-street, and am an undertaker—about half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 1st of April I went into Mr. M'Gregor's shop, in Broad-street, St. Giles's, to ask for a loaf—the prisoner caught my eye as I turned round—I had asked for the loaf before I got tho<lb></lb>roughly in—the prisoner said, "They will be here directly"—he appeared to me to be putting the drawer in with his hand—he then came round the counter, and called down the passage, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, you are wanted"—he turned round and went out—as soon as he got out I imagined he had been commit<lb></lb>ting a felony—I followed and apprehended him—I asked what he had got in his cap—he said something belonging to his father—I said he must come back with me—he said he would not—Mr. M'Gregor came—we took him back, turned out his cap on the counter, and these coppers came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon by profession, but have not carried it on for twelve or eighteen months—I live at Shepherd's Bush.

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. Morgan, and am between eleven and twelve years old. In May, in the week before Whitsuntide, I was at Mr. Bethell's house—my father lives there—Mr. Bethell, Joseph Howell, Worthington, and my father were there—it was between five and six o'clock—we were having our tea—I heard Worthington, Bethell, and Morgan tal<lb></lb>king about a clarence carriage of my father's—it was to be hired at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—the money was to be paid in advance, and the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid, or else the carriage was to be returned—I saw a paper signed—it was read out before it was signed—Mr. Bethell and Mr. Worthington signed it—my father did not sign it—he wrote it—I saw it—it was a sheet—it was more than that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper produced</hi>)—I recollect their reading about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—Worthington had been there about half an hour—he appeared sober—I am not aware when he went away—I remained there all the time until he went—I did not notice the clock—I did not remain till Worthington left for the night—he went down in the loft—I went to bed about ten—Worthington was not there then—I was in the room when he went down to the loft—I did not see him go away—I did not see him after he went down to the loft—it could not he seven then—I saw the paper in the hands of Worthington—he read it, and then asked my father for some paper—my father told me to get it out of the drawer—I got it out of the drawer, and gave it to my father, who gave it to Worthington, and be wrote a copy of the agreement—I saw him do that—he said he could not see very well, because he had not got his <hi rend="italic">specs</hi>—I am sure he copied it—I saw him write, and he had it before him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Homer-street, Paddington. In May last, I was working for Mr. Bethell—I know Worthington perfectly well—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 23rd of May last, between five and six o'clock, as near as I can tell, I saw Worthington at Mr. Bethell's in Lisson-street—he was quite sober—he staid in the room about half an hour, and then went into the loft—he finally left about half-past six, as near as I can recollect—before he left I heard an agreement made, and saw the writing prepared on the subject of the clarence—I was present when Worthington signed his name to a paper—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was larger then—the agreement was there, and he read it over before he put his name to it—Bethell, Morgan, Mrs. Morgan, and the little girl were present, besides me—I heard the contents of the paper—it was on the subject of hiring a carriage at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid in advance, and if 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid it was to be returned—I heard it read over, and saw the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—it was not 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it was in sil<lb></lb>ver—after the memorandum bad been written by Morgan and signed, Worth<lb></lb>ington asked for a piece of paper—the little girl got a piece of note paper, and gave it to her father—I should say there was half as much more than there is now—I saw the paper on which the agreement was written—it was somewhat bigger than it is now—I saw the girl return with a piece of paper for him, and saw him write—I looked at him while he was writing, and saw him take a copy of the agreement—while he was writing he said he could not see well because he had not got his <hi rend="italic">specs</hi>—he was quite sober—I after<lb></lb>wards went to him for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he would call and pay Mr. Betbell.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said about 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the worth of the carriage—if he would buy it, he should have it for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he hired it, it should be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—it was not at his option either to hire or buy it—he hired it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Court during part of the time the wit<lb></lb>nesses were examined—I went out when Worthington came in—I am a coach-maker, and live in Shouldham-street—I know Worthington perfectly well—I had known him since the beginning or latter end of last Feb.—about the 26th of May, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, he came to me about this clarence—he wanted me to put on the back and the side-plates—he was indebted to me at the time—I said, "You have got a new clarence"—he said, "Yes, but I have not purchased it, it is on hire"—I thought he might pay me some of my account if he had purchased it—he had hired it at so much a month—Mr. Keene called on me in June—I had known him some time before as a money-lender—he came about the balance of an acceptance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we went up to the public-house, and had something to drink together—I said I was going down to Oxford-square to Worthington—he said, "Did I know Worthington?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am going down to my mother's, we will go together"—I said he had hired a clarence—he said, "I have not seen it"—he said, "I will go down the Mews first, do not take any notice of me, and I will come in afterwards and see the clarence," but it was not there—he wanted to see the one he had hired—I did not mention it to him to intimate that his circumstances were mending, that he might get some of hit debt—I did not know he was indebted to him—I said I was going down to Worthington, and he said, "Do you know Worthington? he owes me a good bit of money," and then I told him about the clarence—he said, "I will go down first, you pretend you have not seen me"—I went, and Keene let me in—Worthington came, looked into the coach-house, and then went in this way to me, as much as to say it was not there—he said, "What will you say old boy, will you go and have something to driuk?"—I said, "I don't mind;" and me, Keene, and Worthington went round to his mother's and had a pot of beer—Worthington drank and said he must go, for his old lady was out, and he must get something in—Keene said, "I cannot get anything out of the old devil now about the clarence;" and he and I stopped and had a pipe of tobacco together—he had not bought the clarence at that time—a day or two afterwards I again met Mr. Keene at Camden-town—he said, "Have you seen anything more of the clarence?"—I said, "No"—he said, "What do you think it is worth?"—I said, "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "I must have that"—I said, "You may depend upon it there will be something wrong about it"—he said, "I will chance all that"—to convince myself it was on hire, for I knew it was one Morgan had bought, I went to Morgan to ascertain, because I thought Worthington was telling me an untruth—I did not believe he had hired it—I thought he had told me so to screen himself from paying me—Morgan showed me the agreement—I told Mr. Keene I had seen the agreement for the hiring of it, when I met him in Camden-town—I saw the agreement about four days after Whitsuntide—I should know it, for his name was on the right-hand side—to the best of my recollection this is it</p>

I was coming up the street at the back of it a little after six in the evening; I saw the prisoner there; there were about twenty or thirty people there; some were carrying boards out of Boggis's house. I saw the prisoner take up some boards which appeared to me to be wainscoting and doors, but I did not take particular notice of them. I said, O Stephen, I am sorry to see you there! he replied d - n something, but I do not recollect what he said more.</p>

               <p>What is his name? - He is outside the door.</p>
               <p>Is he an acquaintance of your's? - Yes, a sawyer.</p>

               <p>I kept an house in New Turnstile; it was pulled down on the 7th of June between six and seven o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>In what condition was your house when it was attacked? - Very tenantable. I was very comfortable.</p>
               <p>In what condition was it when the mob left it? - The glass was broke to pieces and the wood-work of the dining room broke out; the wainscoting was almost all demolished.</p>
               <p>Do you know when the prisoner was taken up? - I cannot remember the time.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the first information against him? - I think it was Mr. Young; the examination was over at Hick's hall before I knew it. I think Mr. Young came in after he had been at Hick's hall, and told me; and the other came in afterwards.</p>

               <p>You cannot speak to the time the wainscoting in the dining-room was destroyed? - No. I was frightened, and as soon as they came about the house I left it. I got the best of my furniture cut; what I left behind was entirely destroyed.</p>

               <p>Do you know those two men? - I cannot say I do; when I am at work I make it a rule not to mind who comes in or what is said, but I heard the words that They could make a hundred pounds of him; that was on the Monday before he was taken up. I asked the man they came to, when they were gone, who the man was? He said his name was Young, and that he worked with him.</p>
               <p>That man here? - No. I have known the prisoner from a child; I knew him in the country, he is a very honest hard working man; when he left a master there were others ready to send for him; he has always born the character of an industrious man.</p>

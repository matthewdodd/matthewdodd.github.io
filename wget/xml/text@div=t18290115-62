            . I am clerk to Mr. Waterhouse, of Lad-lane. I bought these two whips on the 16th of December, of the prisoner, for 1l. 2s. - he gave me this receipt;(read) "One chaise-whip and one hunting ditto 1l. 2s. - paid, T. Wood."</p>
               <p>MR. PALLISER re-examined. Q. How long after did you discover this? A. I had occasion to suspect him, and I had market these goods; I employed Mr. Clarke to buy them; when he rendered his account on the Saturday, I particularly asked him if this was a correct account of all he had sold; he said it was; it was his duty to account to me every Saturday night; he ought to have entered there 22s.: if I had been in the shop I should have sold them for 24s., which was what he asked for them; I am sure he said, and in the presence of my clerk, that the account was all correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you pay for them? A. I do not like to tell that; I should not have sold them for less than 24s., and then I should have got about fifty per cent; he came into my service form Window Grice: there had been no disagreement between him and me about working over-hours; there is a custom among our men not to work by candle-light for twelve nights before Christmas, but it had not come to that time; there were no mistake about any collars.</p>

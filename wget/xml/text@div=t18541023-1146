                  </hi>. I live at No. 63, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate. At a quarter past 1 o'clock in the morning of 4th Oct., I was in the act of taking the key from my pocket, to open the door of my father's house, when I was suddenly pounced upon by three men, of whom the prisoner was one—</p>

               <p>I am certain of that—I had never seen him before—one put his hand over from behind, I imagine, seized me by the throat, and pulled me down on the pavement—the prisoner came before me and got on my chest, and one of them took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—they all ran away—I got up as well as I could, and pursued—the prisoner was the only one I kept sight of—I followed him down Acorn-street; I collared him, and called, "Police!"—a policeman came, and took him—I went back to the place where I had been attacked, and I found my watch key on the pavement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I was on duty that morning in Bishopsgate-street—I heard a cry of "Police!"—I went, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner—the prosecutor said that he had been robbed, by the prisoner and two more, of his watch, and that the other two had run away, and he had followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him—I took the prisoner to the station; he told me he had been to see his sister, and in coming along he heard a cry of "Police!" and ran down Acorn-street after a man, but could not see him—I had seen him caught by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I was sent for on the 20th of September, to Mr. Sharpe's by Mr. Bish, and searched the prisoner, and in one of his pockets I found this new machine; I then found the key of his box in his pocket, and I found the things which I produce, in his box, and likewise this bunch of keys, one of these keys opened a many of Mr. Sharpe's drawers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpe. In January last, I had an accident of fire in my house, and a coat was lost, in the pocket of which were these keys, I apprehended they were destroyed, the boy was only with me five weeks, consequently he must have had them from some other servant.</p>

               <p>What was you to do with these things? - I was to sell one dozen and an half for the prisoner, and the rest he gave me to keep for myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Sharpe. Can you swear to any of these things? - I can swear to some of the things that were found in the boy's box, these razors have my name upon them, but I cannot positively swear to them, here is a powder box, marked by one of my clerks, and a pair of stockings marked, I know them perfectly, all the things that are here are the common run of stock.</p>

               <p>A great many of these things were given me by a porter that lived at Mr. Sharpe's, not all of them, he persuaded me to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpe. The porter has absconded, the prisoner came to me an errand-boy and general servant, I had an exceeding good character of him from Mr. Lloyd, an attorney, in Chancery-lane; and indeed I am induced to believe that what the boy has told you is true; I do not doubt but the keys were given him by this porter, and he induced him to take the things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raley: My Lord, I am the father of the witness Raley, a lad whom I have brought up with the greatest tenderness, I have done all I can for him, I am very sorry to see him in that situation; I wish him now to receive that reproof that may penetrate his mind, I am father of a large family, eight in number; I cannot admit him into my house, but I will put him into a place of safety up at Hoxton; I have advised him to go to sea, I will get him a birth.</p>
               <p>Court to young Raley. I am very sorry, young man, to hear this account of you from your father, you must have behaved very ill indeed; you have had great good fortune in not being yourself prosecuted, you ought to have been prosecuted, and if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190070"></xptr> you had, the evidence that came out to day, would have involved you in the same guilt, and the same disgrace with this unhappy young man; and I hope if you have any feelings, that his fate, and my public exhortation to you, will have some effect upon you, and that you will not go on in practices, which in all probability must bring your unhappy father with sorrow to the grave, as well as draw down certain destruction upon yourself; you will be delivered into his care, submit to that restraint that he imposes upon you, and to that course of life which he thinks fit to mark out to you, and endeavour by your future conduct to deserve that he may forget what is past, and that you may become an useful member of society.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raley the elder. I return your Lordship many thanks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, foreman of the Jury. My Lord, it is the wish of the Jury to recommend the prisoner to mercy, as supposing he may have been drawn in by the porter, and as that witness, young Raley, appears to have been a partaker in the guilt.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the thing that alarms me, is the example; because put it to your own breasts, you all carry on trades in the city of London, and you are all obliged to entrust your property to your servants: I have therefore always held a very strict hand over this particular crime, because it seems to me, as if men's property depended intirely upon never relaxing the punishment due to servants that rob their masters; now having said this to you publickly, if you still wish this boy should find favour, I for one will not oppose it, though I cannot heartily approve of it.</p>
               <p>(The Jury did not repeat their application.)</p>

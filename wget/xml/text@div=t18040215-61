               <p>Q. You did not find any of your house broke open? - A. No, only the street door was unlatched at eleven, or thereabouts; I always lock the door myself; I am certain it was latched, because I heard it.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; Mr. Cutler brought the prisoner to me; after I had secured the prisoner, I went back to the house, and there I saw those boots in a kind of a hole in a dark place in the cellar, at a distance from the copper, near the stairs; the copper was in the front kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the venereal disease very bad; I went to the doctor, and he gave me some medicine to ease me; I saw this house, and not seeing it look a very decent house, I took the liberty of going in; I went in as a man came out; the gentleman came, and took hold of me; I have not been in London above five weeks; my friends live above 107 miles from this place, I had not an opportunity of sending to them.</p>

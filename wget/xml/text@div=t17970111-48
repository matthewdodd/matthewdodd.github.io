The opera called Abroad and at Home; I told him he was a thief, and I knew there were thieves among them; I had for months before told them, the first I detected I would prosecute, that none had a right to take a sheet of paper out of my premises, without having it from me; I had heard that there was such a claim set up, and I told every man of mine that I would not allow any such thing, and that if I detected them, I would prosecute them; I told them if they wanted a book, and asked me for it, in all probability I should give it them; I told the prisoner, if he would permit two of my people to search his lodgings, very well, if not, I should get a search warrant, and I sent

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You describe yourself to be a printer and bookseller? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve your apprenticeship to? - A. I did not serve my apprenticeship to the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve any apprenticeship to any business? - A. Yes; a grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you a grocer? - A. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a coal-merchant? - A. Never; I believe I once took a room of coals, and sent a chaldron of them to my mother-in-law, and they were measured out of my room, and therefore they put me down, seller,

            ; that is the only chaldron of coals I ever sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Grocer, or Coal-merchant. or Printer and Bookseller? - A. I am no coal-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then grocer let it be - You heard that there was a claim made by men employed by printers, to certain copies? - A. There are a great many printers here to prove that they have no such right.</p>
               <p>Q. But we will hear that rather from persons who were bred to the business, than from a grocer; did you ever hear that there was such a claim made? - A. I have heard that there was, and I have heard a great many things that are not true, but I told them I would not permit it; I have heard both that there was such a claim, and that there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that the proper way of settling a disputed claim, was to indict that lad for felony? - A. He did not pretend to claim any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he or not set up a claim to a copy of that book? - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor of any book in which he was concerned as a compositor? - A. No; he never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether he did or not? - A. I say he never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He never stated that claim? - A. Never to me, nor in my hearing; I believe he said, after I had taken him up, that he understood he had a claim, but that that was very foreign to the answer he gave me when I detected him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you detected him, as you call it, he was folding some sheets, which, he said, were damaged sheets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he was at least as likely to know whether they were damaged sheets as a grocer? - A. It was a perfect book, all but one sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the business? - A. Better than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been employed by you? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued to employ him from the time you left the trade of a grocer, till you came into that of a bookseller and printer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say, that after you detected him, as you call it, he did set up this claim? - A. He did not set it up; he said, he understood there was such a claim; he said, he understood it, but he never made such a claim; he begged my pardon, and said, if I would excuse him he would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You had threatened him with Botany Bay, I believe? - A. I had threatened to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the Mr. Cawthorne, I believe, who got into Bell's shop? - A. Yes; very unluckily for me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very unlucky that you should both be dissatisfied - What became of those sheets you found the boy folding? - A. They are here.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and searched them; I found here the plays stated in the indictment; they are in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you find them? - A. At the top of a small book-case, or desk, that stood very near the door upon entering the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are overseer in this shop of Mr. Cawthorne's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this trade of printing? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell us a little more than Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110072"></xptr>Cawthorne could about a custom in the trade, which is claimed by workmen, of having a copy of each book they print? - A. I have frequently heard of the custom, but I know of no printing office, but the King's printing-office, where it is allowed.</p>
               <p>Q. In the King's printing-office, are they allowed a copy, or are they paid money in lieu of a copy? - A. They are paid money in lieu of a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked in various printing-offices? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In those printing-offices, have you not known that the pressmen and compositors have both set up the claim of a copy of the work which they print? - A. I have heard of it frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not an understood claim? - A. I believe they contend it to be a right; I have heard them say there is an act of Elizabeth, which gives them that right.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the question was tried between the journeymen and the masters, by Mr. Lane of Leadenhall-street? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man was Mr. Cawthorne's journeyman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to his lodgings, there was no search-warrant? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He went with you very willingly to shew you his lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you found? - A Some plays.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a place of concealment, as if he was conscious of stolen property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Cowthorne.) Had you given notice to these journeymen, that you would not allow this before these plays were worked off? - A. Yes. I had; I told them, if they had a claim to shew me by what authority, and it they had a right to them, I would give them with my own hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did not you bring an action against him? - A. I was advised to indict him for felony.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a pretence of right, that is all that we have to enquire into; to be sure, we are not to try a civil right by a criminal prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Cawthorne.) Q. When had you first issued these orders to the journeymen, that you would not allow the copy? - A. I suppose, nine or ten months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months after you commenced printer and bookseller, you must, by that time, have been perfectly acquainted with the customs of the trade? - A. I don't think I am now.</p>

             sworn. - Q. I will not ask you, whether journeymen have a right to a copy, but did they ever claim a right? - A. I never had any such claim made in my house, nor I never heard of any, further than this, there was, some time ago, a case which Mr. Lane brought before my Lord-Mayor where some of his men did make a similar claim to this; but to prove that they were conscious that they had no such claim, when my Lord Mayor desired a meeting of masters and journeymen to decide the claim, they would not meet, and it has always been understood, that they had no such claim.</p>

               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - Q. Did you ever hear of this claim? - A. Yes; I have certainly heard of such a claim, and I think I am bound to say, that numbers of the men think they have such a claim; in a civil court, I should explain the matter, but, here, I presume, I am only to answer questions; they have certainly some crude notion, which is totally unfounded; if every man was allowed to save a sheet, it would take away the whole of the printer's profit; it would amount to twenty pounds a week in my house; but there certainly is such a claim.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I think, Gentlemen of the Jury, there can be no occasion to go any further; at the same time, the acquittal of this man must not be understood to decide the right.</p>

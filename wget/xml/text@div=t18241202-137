            . I am the wife of Edward Green. The prisoner has been in my service since the 16th of October. I had a character with her. I had been out of town, and when I came home I found she had been making some inquiries about the neighbourhood. I spoke to her about it, and she absconded without asking for her wages, I missed the articles stated in the indictment, on the 20th of November. I saw them again on the 27th - they were left at the house where she lodged.</p>

            . My husband is a paper-hanger, and lives in the Hampstead-road. The prisoner came to live with me about four months ago - she then went to Mrs. Green's service. She had been in the habit of coming in and out, and one evening she brought a bit of carpet for my little girl, and said she would bring her a bit of fringe. I saw her with a shawl on, but I don't know whose it was.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Parker, the landlord of the house at No. 2, Conway-street, came in and told my mistress that I had reported every thing that was bad of her; my mistress also charged me with it. I took her the shawl, by her desire, to wear while I was going to Mr. Parker to ask him what I had said. I found the ticket of the ring in the ashes. I put it into my pocket until I went to my landlady and gave it her. I pledged my shawl to obtain the ring, and since I would not give her the ring for the 1 s. I owed her, she came to Mrs. Green's and told her that I had robbed her of several things.</p>

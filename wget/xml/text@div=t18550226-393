                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Redcross-court, Southwark, and work at Mr. Joseph's, with Lyons and the prisoner. On 18th Feb. a quarrel took place between them, about 2 o'clock in the day, during which the prisoner got up, and stood right behind me, with a knife in her hand—Lyons was facing me—the prisoner said, "If it had not been for my work, I would rip your guts out"—they had several words, and Lyons said that at night she should certainly stop outside, and have satisfaction for what she had been saying—about 7 o'clock I left the premises, with Lyons and several others—I waited outside, about six yards from the gateway—the prisoner came out, and said, "What is the matter?"—I said nothing—she passed</p>

               <p>me a little way, and Lyons ran out and attacked her behind—she caught hold of her by the neck, with her right hand—I was then about two yards from them—I saw no blow until such time as I saw the knife come down in the prisoner's hand across Lyons's neck, as she turned round after seizing the prisoner by the bonnet—I did not hear her say anything—a man named Hooper seized the prisoner's arm, and took the knife from her—Lyons went into the warehouse, and was taken to the hospital—it did not bleed much for such a great wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser, at Guy's Hospital. On 15th Feb., about 8 o'clock, Lyons was brought there—I examined her, and found a large superficial wound extending over the lower jaw, about an inch and a half long—it was merely through the skin and through the tissues underneath; it did not penetrate the muscular tissue—it was not half an inch deep—it had ceased bleeding, but there was blood on her cheek—it could have been inflicted with a knife of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I dressed it—she did not remain at the hospital, but has been several times since to have it dressed.</p>

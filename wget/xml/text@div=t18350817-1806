                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-scrgeant C</hi> 9.) On the 27th July, I went to the premises of Mrs. Squibb—I scarched the top room—I went the second time, and found these things in a large box—I found this plate, these glasses, and brush—that was all I found—it was the prisoner's box—she told me so—it was locked, and she gave me the key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you the key when you asked if it was her box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had delivered it up—she told me it was her's when she was brought up for examination, I described it to her—she knew I had had the key—she never made the least concealment of it—the house is good-sized, and well furnished.</p>

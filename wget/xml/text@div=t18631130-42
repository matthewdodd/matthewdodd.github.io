I am the wife of William Henry Stout, of 145, Back Church-lane—on 27th October my sisters were fined at the police-court and committed—on the same day, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I saw the defendant as I was coming from my sisters' house, with a parcel under my arm to pawn, to pay the solicitor who had pleaded for my sisters—I saw the prisoner in the street striking my eldest sister—I went up and said, "Come away, there's a good girl"—I said to the prisoner, "Are you not satisfied with what you have done to my other two sisters?"—(she was not a witness against them)—she said, "Oh, it is you, you b—cow, who went and got the solicitor for your sisters;" and after making use of other expressions, and saying she would have my b—life, she knocked me down with a blow with some sort of a glass which was in her hand—I was lying on the ground and saw a second blow coming from the prisoner; I put my hand up and got it on my wrist—I afterwards found myself in the London Hospital—I was there a fortnight within two days—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw her at the police-court.</p>

I live at 25, Henry-street, Back Church-lane—on 27th October I was in Henry-street, and saw Stout and Ford—Stout's younger sister went up and spoke to Ford, and the elder sister said to the younger, in Ford's presence, "Come away—she said, "Are you not satisfied with what you have done to my other sisters"—the prisoner said to Mrs. Stout, "It is not you I want, it is the younger sister; it is you, you b—cow, I want"—she had a decanter in her hand, with which she struck Mrs. Stout right across the eye—the decanter broke, and Mrs. Stout fell down and bled fearfully—she got a second blow across her wrist with the decanter—when she put up her hand to save her face; she was then lying down—she had the glass in her hand; the decanter was broken with the first blow.</p>

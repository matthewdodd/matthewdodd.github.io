I am a shoemaker, of 146, Royal Mint-street—I also deal in tobacco and cigars—I know the prisoner as a customer—on 12th or 13th July, about 4 o'clock, he ran into my shop when I was just going out, and said, "Will you mind this for a short time and I will call for it?"—it was this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave me a threepenny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> and took three</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, of 8, Cooper's-row—the prisoner has been in my employ as cellarman three or four works, off and on, but not constantly employed—he had access to stock of this nature—this box is my property; it contains twelve bottles of sparkling Moselle, worth 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw it safe on the afternoon of 12th August, before I went to dinner at 1 or 2 o'clock—I had lost several cases before, and watched them every day—I know this particular box was safe by this mark; I had another box marked C. W., 32, it is an individual box which I bought as a sample—my house is not 500 yards from Royal Mint-street—the prisoner was absent all that day without leave—I discharged him on Saturday before I recovered the box—I live in the country—I went down on Friday night, returned on Saturday morning, missed the box, and went to the police-station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you employ a good many men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half a dozen sometimes—I did not consider the prisoner a regular servant—he was employed on particular jobs—on Friday, when I went to dinner, he was left in an outside cellar to wire bottles—when I had finished my dinner, I went out and found that he had gone, and presume he had gone with the box at that time—he was to an extent discharged on Friday night, but he came on Saturday morning—he was not paid on Friday night, but he was early on Saturday—I told him on Friday night that he was of no further</p>

               <p>use to me, he was a worthless rascal, and must go out of my place; and he was discharged on Saturday, and I paid him—there may be 10,000 boxes marked 32, but this is the only one I had, and the only box of this description of wine—it is not a common description of wine it is a muscatel flavour, and is very highly esteemed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you were to start off in search, would you find boxes containing bottles like these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Plenty; the grower of this wine is to be found in Brandon-court, and he may have 1,000 such boxes, but not marked 32—they would be running numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From that number are you able to swear that is your box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most positively—I never saw another No. 32, and this is the only box of samples I had; I expected it to be stolen as others had been—I also know it by the name "Humphrey" on it—I asked the shipper how that, name came on it, and he told me that he had shipped some boxes that were not delivered—the grower's name is on the bottle, and had all the names in the world been on the box I could have sworn that it was mine.</p>

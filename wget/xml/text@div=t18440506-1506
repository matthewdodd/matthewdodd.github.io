                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at the Roebuck, at Turnham<lb></lb>green. A little before twelve o'clock, on the night of the 30th of April, I shut up the shutters with Frederick Allen—I afterwards went into the tap-room and saw the prisoner there with some other persons—I got up to leave—I saw the prisoner take a bundle belonging to Frederick Allen off the seat, put it under his jacket and button it up—I told Allen, and we went after him—I saw Allen fall down close to the prisoner—I collared him, and asked for the bundle—he would not give it me, and said it was his own—he had got it with him—Busk, the constable, came and took him—I had seen the prisoner come to the house, and he had nothing with him then.</p>

About twelve o'clock, on the night of the 30th of April, in consequence of what Goring told me, I went after the prisoner—I had a bundle on the corner of the seat in the tap-room—I caught the prisoner—he pushed me down—Goring collared him with the bundle—this handkerchief and other things are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Clerkenwell workhouse, and am employed there as a messenger. The prisoner and Parkes were paupers there—on 4th March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner standing in the yard, with a ladder in his hand—Parkes, who was employed as a carpenter, said to him, "If you don't put that ladder away, I will come and take it from you"—the prisoner had no business with it—he replied, "I'm d—d if I do," and threw it at Parkes with all his force, with his two hands—I do not think it struck him—there were six or seven other lads with him at the time—Parkes then went into his workshop, and came out again, with the lath of a bedstead in his hand—the prisoner then attempted to run away—he and the other boys <hi rend="italic">dodged</hi> Parkes about the yard, hooting and shouting at him—Parkes was chasing him with the lath in his hand—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the prisoner in the yard, with a small pocket-knife in his hand—it was open—he stood, and shook it at Parkes, and challenged him to come near him, and said if he did he would run it into his guts—that aggravated Parkes, and he chased him again—the prisoner ran into the house—he came out again, and ran up the yard, vowing vengeance, and swearing he would be d—d if he would not have a brick and split his b—head—I got the brick from him—after that he ran into the hall, and Parkes after him with the lath—while they were in the hall I heard a pair of tongs fall down—I went</p>

               <p>up to Parkes, and saw him bleeding very badly from the eye—I saw the tongs on the floor, and the prisoner standing among the men by the fireplace, six seven yards from Parkes—I did not see any blow struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Clerkenwell workhouse, employed as a carpenter. As I was crossing the yard, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, going to my workshop, the prisoner had the steps running about the yard—I said, "You had better put those steps in their place, or the Governor will come out presently, and you will get into trouble"—he began his blackguard language—I went into the shop—he came and placed the steps in front of the door—I went to take them from him, and he threw them with all his violence at me, and bruised my knuckles—I said, "If I cannot catch you I will reach you," and I took the lath—he ran—I overtook him, just by the house-door, and <hi rend="italic">reached</hi> him between the shoulders, and I caught him a second time inside the door—I never struck him, I only gave him a <hi rend="italic">poke</hi>—I came back to my shop door, and no sooner had I turned round, than he came at me with an open knife, and swore he would rip my b—guts out—I took up the lath again and ran after him—he got on one side of the hall table, and I on the other—I could not get at him—I said, "Never mind, I shall catch you another time"—I turned round, with the lath in my hand, and walked towards the fire, to speak to some one; and as I turned round, in half a minute or less, I received a violent blow in the eye, which struck me senseless—I did not know who had done it—the blood gushed out—I have entirely lost the sight of that eye, and the other is so weak I can hardly see anything with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the hall of the workhouse at half-past five o'clock on 2nd March—a table runs down the middle of the hall—the prisoner and Parkes came running in—the prisoner took the right side of the table, and Parkes the left—Parkes tried to get over the table at him, but did not—he came back from the table, and stood at the corner of it—the prisoner went to the fireplace and took up the tongs—Parkes made a stand, and in a moment the prisoner threw the tongs at him—he was then about five yards and a half from him—they struck him in the eye, and I directly saw the blood come from it—the prisoner then ran away.</p>

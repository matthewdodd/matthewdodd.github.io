It appeared that the damage by the fire was chiefly to the goods, and no great damage done to the house, although the fixing of any part of it according as the Indictment was laid, would have been Felony without Clergy (the State upon which the Indictment was grounded, being very severe in those cases, it appeared the boyes Friends were very sufficient persons, and had give 70 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750414004"></xptr>with him, and a bond of 500 l. for his truth, but besides that, the Master confessed that he had been offered full satisfaction of his damages by the boyes friends, if he would have desisted from Prosecuting, which the Master affirmed still he did only to discover the complotters by that means in the business, upon the whole matter the Jury found him as to <rs id="t16750414-2-verdict8" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Camden-street, and saw the two boys - they asked if I knew any body who wanted to buy a donkey; I said No - they said they won it at a raffle: another person came by, who told them to go to Wittington-college, and there they sold it - they sent me for change for a sovereign, and then this gentleman came and took me.</p>

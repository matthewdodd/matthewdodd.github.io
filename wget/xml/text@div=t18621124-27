                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint authorities—I went on Friday, 7th November, to 126, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, accompanied by other officers—it is a common lodging-house—the street door was open—I proceeded through the kitchen and across the yard to a room at the far end, the door of which I pushed open, and saw the whole of the prisoners sitting at a table by a clear bright fire, the prisoner Barrett holding a sixpence in one hand and a file in the other—on seeing me she placed the file on the mantel<lb></lb>shelf—I took this sixpence (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of her left hand—at that time I saw Campbell, who sat next to her, place his left-hand in her lap—five or six of the officers were then in the room—I said, "Consider yourselves in custody for being here manufacturing this counterfeit coin"—I did not see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240040"></xptr>
               <p>what Campbell had in his hand, but I took thirteen counterfeit sixpences out of Barrett's lap—that was after I had said this—Campbell laughed, and said, "Sure, I only came in, sir, to solder this girl's coffee-pot"—I said, "Just attend to me, will you; you won't find this a laughing matter here<lb></lb>after, to be found with these people in manufacturing this counterfeit join"—he said, "Oh, by Jesus, I solder all the coffee-pots and things for these girls, and all the people in the neighbourhood; they all know me well"—the fourteen sixpences are here, the file is not—it was mislaid yesterday—I saw Barrett using it—she had the file in one hand and the sixpence in the other.</p>

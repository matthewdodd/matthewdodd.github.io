            , and others. The prisoner had been in our employ, and left about six months - I do not know the handwriting on this order - the prisoner had no authority to obtain goods in our name - he never brought it to our house- he was in our house several years - I had very little to do with him, and do not exactly know when he left. (Order read).</p>
               <p>"Send, for Gardner and Co., - a cwt. of bar tin.</p>
               <p>21st of July, 1834."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the note sent to me for the tin - I never mentioned Mr. Gardner's name - I delivered the tin to the person who gave me the note - he said he had it from Gardner - his uncle was named Gardner, and kept the Globe, in Mile-end-raod - he lived at Twigfolly.</p>
               <p>JOHN JAMIESON STEVENSON re-examined. We had no other Gardner a customer - I understood by the order I was to deliver this for Gardner and Co., of Cow-lane - I put no questions to him - I did not know he ever was in Gardner's service - on the 26th, he came again, and presented this order to me, and said, "I have got an order for you" - I said, "Very well;" and desired one of the men to weigh it - in the mean time, I sent for a constable - he returned in a quarter of an hour without one - we told him we must detain him while we sent to Gardner's - he then looked towards the door - seeing no chance of escape there, he plunged into the Thames, and attempted to destroy himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By some means I slipped into the water - I did not exactly know what I was about - that note was also delivered to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN NICHOLLS re-examined. The prisoner was not employed by our house, on the 26th of July, to procure any quantity of bar tin - this note is not in the handwriting of any of our firm.</p>

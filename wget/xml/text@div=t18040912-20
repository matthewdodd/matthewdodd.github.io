               <p>Q. Did you miss any mare, of any kind, on Friday night, the 18th of May? - A. Yes; a chesnut mare and a black mare; they were missing on Saturday morning, the 19th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last? - A. On Friday evening, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. They were in a clover-field of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the clover-field? - A. About five o'clock on Saturday morning I went to my clover-field, and saw the gate open and half unhooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other cattle in the same field? - A. Yes; there were three others that remained in the field; I took one of the horses and went down to Bury, and had some hand-bills printed, and distributed them as fast as I could; on the 23d of July, Mr. Mason and I went down to Dagenham; we heard that Mr. Denginfield had purchased this chesnut mare; Mr. Denginfield bought the mare for Mr. Tyser, of Barton; he told us, if we went down to Mr. Tyser's, we should find the mare; Mr. Mason and I accordingly went down, and there we found the mare; she was branded on the fore hoofs with RE; we took the mare up to the Office in Worship-street; that is all I know about that mare; I am sure it is my mare. The black mare Mr. Atkins came and told me he sold to Mr. Roper, in town; Mr. Ray, the Officer, went with me to Mr. Roper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Roper live? - A. I cannot tell exactly the place; when we went down to Mr. Roper, the mare was gone down the country on a journey.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the mare last? - A. On the 15th of August; she was branded in the same manner as the other was on the hoofs; Mr. Roper told me he would send the mare when she came off the journey, which he did: I was certain it was my property, being branded on the hoofs; Mr. Ray sent her down to me by one Frost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These mares were traced back into the witness Atkins's hands? - A. They were.</p>

             sworn. - I bought two mares and a horse of the prisoner on the 20th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them? - A. Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy them? - A. At my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner before? - A. I knew him in Smithfield selling horses for a year and a half; I am positive he sold horses there, and at Mr. Langhorn's. Here is a letter that came from Sittingbourn, which was the reason of my taking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 20th of May when you bought them? - A. Yes; I sold two of them to Mr. Poulter and one to Mr. Roper; the black mare to Mr. Roper, and the chesnut mare to Mr. Poulter; he informed me that he lived at Sittingbourn and kept a hop-ground; that he had waggons, and that he would buy two or three horses frequently, merely to get the load up, and after he got his load up he sold them, though he got nothing by them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you kept them before you sold them to Mr. Roper and Mr. Poulter? - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell them for? - A. I sold the three for forty-two pounds: I gave him forty pounds for the three; I sold the black mare to Mr. Roper for seventeen pounds, and the other mare, with the horse, I sold for twenty-five pounds to Mr. Poulter.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the mares' hoofs marked? - A. They were branded on the hoofs; I cannot rightly say what with; it was an E and something else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You can read and write? - A. I can read, but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any receipt on this occasion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought them in a lumping way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You contrived to get rid of these horses as soon as you could? - A. I have got horses that I bought to-day, that I will sell to you within an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep them, I suppose, till you can make a fair profit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought these horses for forty pounds, kept them a fortnight, and then sold them for forty-two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120025"></xptr>pounds? - A. They earned their keep; I sold a horse the other day at sixteen pounds loss.</p>

               <p>Q. How many horses have you charged the prisoner with stealing, that were found in your possession? - A. There are three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Eleven stolen horses were traced to you? - A. Certainly I did buy them, I did not know they were stolen when I bought them; I took the prisoner, and after I took him, he made his escape.</p>
               <p>- POULTER sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. In Black Horse-yard, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy a mare of the last witness? - A. Yes, I bought a chesnut mare and a horse together of Mr. Atkins; the mare belonged to one man, and another man claimed the horse afterwards; I have known Atkins some time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the mare? - A. About the latter end of May, I cannot say particularly the day; I gave twenty-five pounds for the two; they were very dear when I bought them; the mare had had a kick, she was very lame.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mare marked on the hoof? - A. Yes, and this gentleman found her as I bought her, and I had sold her to Mr. Denginfield; I knew she was marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have known the witness Atkins a long while? - A. Yes, I have known him twenty years; I know nothing of the black mare.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Atkins.) On the 19th of May, where were you? - A. I was nigh home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in London? - A. Yes, I was in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any people to assist you in your business? - A. Yes, my son, a man, and a boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did either of them see you when you bought these horses? - A. Yes, my man; he is gone from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here who knows you were in London on the 18th or the 19th of May? - A. I have not been further than Rumford for these six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. That is somewhere about the time these horses were missing? - A. For these six or seven months I have been no further than Rumford.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any body here that saw you buy the horses? - A. No, I have sent for the man; I am not in the habit of going out of town.</p>
               <p>- DENGINFIELD sworn. - I bought the chesnut mare of Mr. Poulter, about the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Poulter.) Did you sell the mare to Mr. Denginfield? - A. I did, about the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Denginfield.) Where do you live? - A. At Dagenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy the mare? - A. I bought the mare of Mr. Poulter, in town; the mare was at grass when I bought her; I believe it was about the 3d of July; she was branded on the fore hoofs with R. E. the mare was lame when I bought her of Mr. Poulter; I turned her to grass; I gave information to Mr. Edgar where she was, and he took her to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Atkins.) Q. You told us that you had not been out of town for these five or six months any further than Rumford? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your memory is not impaired, is it; you know Chatham? - A. Yes, it is near Rochester.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at Chatham three or four months ago? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said a while ago you had not been out of town for these six or seven months past, not for three months before you saw the horses, any further than Rumford; upon your oath have you not been at Chatham about three or four months ago? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When were you at Chatham; was it before you bought the mares? - A. Upon my word I cannot rightly tell you.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You went down to Dagenham with Mr. Edgar? - A. Yes, and I was at the Office when the prisoner was brought in with another man, on the 9th of July; Mr. Atkins charged him with stealing some horses that he had sold him; Mr. Atkins said he had given him a direction that his name was John Brown; the prisoner persisted that he did live at Sittingbourn; I asked him whereabouts, he said, at Chapel-farm; I said, if he kept a farm there, perhaps he could tell who he bought the horses of; he said he could not tell the people, he had bought them of some travellers at a village called Bye-France, in Kent; we searched, and found some letters that told us where his lodgings were at St. Giles's, and that his friends lived at Norwich; I went with Mr. Edgar to Dagenham, where we found the mare, and brought her up to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour do you call it? - A. I do not know exactly the colour; the gentleman called it a chesnut colour; she was branded in the fore hoofs with R. E.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.

On Monday, the 9th of July, in the evening, he was brought to our Office; Mr. Mason, in my presence, asked the prisoner how he got possession of these horses, and where he lived; those were the horses that Mr. Atkins charged him with stealing; Mr. Atkins gave us to understand that he had bought several horses of him; the prisoner told Mr. Mason that he lived at Sittingbourn, in Kent, and that he bought them of a traveller in a village called Bye-France, near Sittingbourn, in Kent; those are the words, I think, that were made use of; I found out afterwards that he did not live at Sittingbourn; I found out where he lived in town, at a tobacconist's shop, in St. Giles's, near to Oxford-road, where he had lodged some time, in a two pair of stairs back room; I told him I had been to his lodgings, and that he did not live at Sittingbourn: that we found out his lodgings at St. Giles's, and he made no reply to it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You were not there? - A. I cannot say I was; there was so much confusion, I was not present all the time; there were a great number of examinations.</p>

               <p>Q.Things are done very regular at your Office, the depositions of the several witnesses are taken down in writing? - A. In general they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not your clerks attend for the purpose of taking down the depositions in writing? - A. Yes.</p>

When he first came up to our Office, the flap of his coat was off, which I found at the public-house the next day; it was tore off right up to the button; I went to the public-house and got it, and the prisoner had it sewed on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Atkins.) Did any body accompany you when you went to the Office? - A. Yes, an officer, whom I have sent home in a coach, to get the person that saw me buy the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the question put to the prisoner where he bought the horses on the 9th, the night he was taken to the Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body lay hold of the prisoner? - A. I detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body lay hold of his coat? - A. I laid hold of his coat in the City-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make his escape from you? - A. We were in the City-road; we went over to a public-house; we were asking where he bought the horses; he said, of some travellers, in a village called Bye-France, in Kent; he said, I will not stay inside; I stood between him and the door; I said, now tell the man every thing true; he said, I will not tell you any thing at all; he ran, and I ran after him, and catched hold of his coat; the flap of his coat came off; we stopped him, and put him into a coach, and took him to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have made no confessions; if I had even had the horses, I should have been much to blame to make that confession; I know nothing at all about it.</p>

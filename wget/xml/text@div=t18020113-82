I said, to town; my great coat was buttoned; they instantly tore it open, and searched for my watch, which I had left at home; I said, my friends, I have nothing for you only a few six-pences; don't use me ill; I thought it was very hard to be used in that manner; they said, it was bl-y hard for them to be without money; the sailor instantly put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, where there was about eighteen pennyworth of halfpence, which they took out, with a knife, a cork-screw, and a tobacco-stopper; he then put his hand to search for my breeches pocket, and the prisoner held me; I had nothing in that pocket; there were four shillings, and there might be a dozen six-pences, which he took out, and run off directly; when the prisoner loosed me, he gave me a shove round, and he run off; on turning round, I saw the heads of two gentlemen; I halloaed to them, and begged their assistance, for I had been robbed; we pursued them about one hundred yards, and took the prisoner; the other run away; they had no arms.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW MACKENZIE sworn. - On Thursday last, the 14th of January, I was in company with Mr. Greenly, going home, and it being so clear a night, we agreed to go across the fields; when we got about one hundred yards of the pitching-block, I saw a man, who called, I am robbed, give your assistance; we agreed to pursue the men who were running; and, after running a few yards, took the prisoner; he made no resistance, or was he out of my sight.</p>
               <p> - WYATT sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, but only found an old pocketbook, a knife, and tobacco-box,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along the footpath, and heard two men running; I stood up, and a man passed me; I saw two more coming up, and, thinking it might be a quarrel, I turned out of the road; upon which they came and took hold of me; I was not going to run away, I had done nothing; there is my discharge from the army in that pocket-book, in consequence of being wounded three times.</p>

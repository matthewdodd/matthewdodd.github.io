            , an orange-merchant, Lower Thames-street: On the 3d of August, about twenty minutes after eight in the morning, I went to Mr. Field's and bought half a bushel of canary seed of the prisoner, and paid him five shillings for it, which I received of Mr. Field; I took no particular notice of the money; about half an hour after Mr. Field sent for me, and asked the prisoner if I was not there while he was out; he said I was, and paid him five shillings for half a bushel of canary seed; Mr. Field asked him where the money was, the prisoner said, I put the money in the till, you were at the till, you may have taken it out, for all I know; on questioning him further about it, he said, he had said all he should say, he should say no more; Mr. Field then gave charge of him, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Being warehouseman, it was his duty to sell you any thing you wanted? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the shop? - A. When I was paying the prisoner, a little boy came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the boy asking for some matting? - A. No; I did not observe what they were talking about.</p>
               <p>Mr. FIELD called up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you marked the money? - A. No, it was already marked; I know the money I gave to Mr. Adam; at eight o'clock, I sent all the men to breakfast, but the prisoner; I then went and gave Mr. Adam the money, to go for half a bushel of canary, and waited till he came back; when I returned home, I asked the prisoner, if any body had been there in my absence, he said, not any body had been there; I asked him again, and he again told me nobody had been there; I then went for Mr. Tibbs, a constable, and Adams came soon after, and we went into the counting-house, and asked the prisoner, before Tibbs and Adams, whether any body had been there since I had been out; he said, no; but recollecting himself, he said, a man had been for half a bushel of canary, upon which, I asked him for the money, he said, he had put it in the till before I went out; I had emptied the money out of the till, so that if it had been there, I must have seen it; Tibbs asked him what money he had about him, and he pulled out two shillings; I looked at it, and saw it was no part of the money I gave Adam; I gave charge of him to Tibbs, and bid him take him to the Compter; after staying a long time in the shop, the prisoner went down the cellar stairs, and took the money from under the stair, and said, "here is the money," he gave it Tibbs, and said, it was the five shillings he received for half a bushel of canary; I have not seen the money since, I should know two of the shillings again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any promise, or said any thing to induce him to confess? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He was entrusted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140055"></xptr> to sell goods before this time? - A. Yes, occasionally, when the other men were at breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked upon him as accountable to you for the money he took? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a scheme to catch the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After a denial several times, he produced the money from under the stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So the money had not been out of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked to him for the produce of all he sold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the two shillings marked that you can speak to? - A. One with a figure of 3, and the other was a battered shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen shillings in the course of exchange with figures on them? - A. I certainly have.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you if you have seen battered shillings? - A. I certainly have.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of August, I was sent for by the prosecutor, to take charge of the prisoner for robbing him; Mr. Field asked him what silver he had, he said, only two shillings, which he produced; I took him into custody; the prisoner went to the cellar stairs, and went a stair or two down, and put his hand under the stairs, and took out five shillings, and gave them me, and said, there is the five shillings, that I received for the canary seed; I tied it up that very minute, and it has never seen sun nor moon since I put it together, (the five shillings were produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Field. These two I can swear to, I believe the other three are the same I gave Mr. Adam, to give to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Adam). When you paid him the five shillings, what did he do with it? - A. He put it on the counter, and his hand over it.(Mr. Knapp, on the part of the prisoner, contended that this was a fraud only, not a felony, but the objection was over-ruled by the Court).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel.(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character). <rs id="t17960914-9-verdict44" type="verdictDescription">

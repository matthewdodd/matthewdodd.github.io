On the 4th of October, about eleven o'clock in the day, Woodley came and took a furnished lodging, at 4s. 6d. a week; he said another young man was to lodge with him - they were shoemakers; he gave me a reference to New Inn-yard, where they gave him a good character; Woodley returned about two o'clock, and hired the lodging - he went out again, and brought Wilgoss back with him; they went up stairs in a short time, went out again, and returned about ten o'clock, to go to bed - the next morning I went up to make the bed, and found the key was gone; they returned at night, and I asked how they came to take the key, as I wanted it to make the bed - they said, "Never mind, we will make it ourselves;" the next morning Woodley came down, a little after eight o'clock, with something white under his arm; in a few minutes Wilgoss came down, and I said, "Now for my key;" he said,"I have left it up stairs" - I went up, and found it was gone; one of my lodgers said, "I think I heard it laid on the stairs;" I found it, went into the room, and missed the articles - the prisoners never returned.</p>

             (Police-constable N 23). On the 4th of October I received information, and on Friday evening, about eight o'clock, I was standing at Kingsland turnpike gate, and the prisoners passed me - I followed them, and asked Wilgoss his name, and if he did not lodge with Mrs. Scott; he said No - I took him to the station, then went for Woodley, and took him: he said he had lived with Mrs. Scott, and left her because she was making a bother about the key; he dropped a box, and I took it up- it contaained eight duplicates, and one was for this blanket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

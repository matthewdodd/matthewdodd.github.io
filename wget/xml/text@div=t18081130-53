            . I am a boot and shoemaker, I live at No. 18, Green Arbour court, Old Bailey; I have known the prisoner better than two years. On the 13th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, he sent my son to me to say that he had won a watch at a raffle; he came down afterwards to me in my own room, he asked me if I wanted to buy one; I told him no; he went, and returned with my son and said if I wanted to buy one I should have it for eighteen shillings; I then asked him how he came by it, he said he won it at a raffle; I asked him if he was sure of it, he said yes; I then asked him if he was quite sure of it, he said yes. I sent him and my son together to his master and mistress, to ask them if they were agreeable for me to buy the watch; they returned and answered that his mistress did not care what he did with it, he might throw it in the channel. After asking him if he came honestly by it, I paid him the eighteen shillings for it, and desired him to give it to his mistress to lay it out in clothes upon him; he said they owed him six shillings before, he knew better what to do with the money.</p>

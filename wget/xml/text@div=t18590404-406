I am a Greek—I reside at 32, Wellclose-square—I am the chief mate of a Greek ship—on Wednesday night, 16th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I left the Rose and Crown in St. George's-street in the East—I was accosted by the prisoner—he was in company with another man—he asked me to give him something to drink—I refused to do so—then he asked me again, and I agreed—we went down a small narrow street—I don't know the name of it—the prisoner was abreast of me, and the other one was on my right-hand side—the prisoner began talking to me, and at the same time he took my watch and chain away—I am sure it was the prisoner that took it—I seized hold of him by the collar, and kept hold of him till the policeman came up—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—it had a gold chain to it, which cost me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is not here—a part of it is left on the watch—when the prisoner took the watch from me he put it inside his breast—I don't know where it was found.</p>

On the night of 16th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Thieves" in Artichoke-hill, which runs out of St. George's-street—I went to the spot—before I reached it I saw a man get up off the prosecutor and the prisoner and run away—when I reached the spot the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner by his left hand and his throat—I took hold of them both—the prosecutor could not speak so that I could understand him—all I could understand was, "My watch"—I found this watch on the ledge of a window—the prose<lb></lb>cutor said in the prisoner's presence that it was his watch—I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

I said I would take 2s. worth-the man brought it. I gave the prisoner two good shillings, they were dull and had been in circulation - He took them up, gave the other man the basket who went away; the prisoner then put two bad shillings on the counter, and asked me to change them; I refused, and told him they were not what I gave him - They were quite bright and new; he said he would summons me, and asked for a pen to put down my name. I locked the shop door, and told him, I would have him searched - I sent up for Rawlins the constable, who lodged with me; the prisoner put one of the shillings he had offered me into his boot before Rawlins came down, took it out again, and fell on his knees, begging I would not hurt him, as he had a wife and six children, Rawlins searched him and found one bad shilling on him. The good money that I gave him was not found; he had an opportunity of giving them to the other man.</p>

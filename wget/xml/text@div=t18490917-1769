                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Rosemary-lane. On 13th Sept. I was at a <hi rend="italic">waket</hi> in a house in Back Church-street—I returned between two and three o'clock in the morning, and when I got within a few yards of my own door, where I was speaking to two or three girls, the prisoner came up—she took hold of me by the breast, and said, "I have got you now;"and she struck me three times with her fist, on my mouth—I had never seen her before, to my knowledge—there was a woman with her, who gave her apenknife, and said, "Here is a knife, stick the Irish b—r"—the prisoner took the knife, and struck me with it over the left eye—my eye was wounded—I do not think it has affected the sight—the other woman escaped—the prisoner was stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailoress, and live in Rosemary-lane. I was with Mrs. Bradley on Friday morning, 13th Sept.—I saw the prisoner come</p>

               <p>up with another person—the prisoner interfered between me and Mrs. Bradley—I told her several times to go and mind her own business—she took Mrs. Bradley by the gown, and struck her three blows in the face with her fist—her companion had a five-bladed knife, which she handed to the prisoner, making use of a very bad expression, and the prisoner struck Mrs. Bradley three times—I knew the prisoner's companion personally, but no more—I should know her if I saw her—the prisoner said she was waiting for that a long while—I do not think she ever saw the prosecutrix before—the prosecutrix never saw her before—I stopped the prisoner when she was going away—I think she is an unfortunate girl.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The person who did it ran down Anchor-yard; you could not catch her, and you came to me as I was standing in the street; how can you say it was a five-bladed knife? there was no knife, it was a room-door key.</p>

The prisoner waa given into my custody for stabbing the prosecutrix in the eye—the prisoner did not say a word—the prosecutrix's eye was bleeding very much—on the way to the station a man ran up, and he made some assertion that the prisoner was not the woman, which she repeated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there between two and three o'clock on Friday morning, 13th Sept.—she had a punctured wound over the left eye, and one or two lesser wounds below—the wound over the eye was not calculated to do mischief from the way in which it went—it was about a quarter of an inch deep—I should think it was not given with much force, or it would have gone in deeper—it passed between the coats of the eye and the bone above—if it had been a little lower it would have gone into the eye—the other two wounds were immediately beneath the eye—they were very small—I should say they were not such wounds as a key would make; it must have been some sharp instrument—I should think they must have been aimed at the eye—if it had been a blow with a key, it would have been a contused wound—it was a punctured wound—I have not the least doubt it was done by some sharp instrument, not a key.</p>

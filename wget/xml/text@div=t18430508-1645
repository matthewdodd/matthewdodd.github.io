                  </hi>. I live in Long-acre—Wood was my errand-boy—I have been losing screws and buckles for about a year—we could not tell who took them—they went day after day in small quantities—these papers that inclose the buckles now produced have all got my private mark on them—I spoke to Wood on the 27th of April, and accused him of taking them—I said if he did not bring them back I should proceed against him—he made no remark, and I left him—he afterwards communicated with my warehouseman—I went with a policeman to Abbott's house—I saw Abbott, and asked him if he had any buckles of a particular kind, he said, "Yes," and showed me some—I said, "These are not the sort I want, I want some smaller"—he said, "I have not got any, I sold them"—he said he bought them of a boy—I said, "How could you think of buying these buckles of a boy, and giving so small a sum as 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three dozen and a half," (which he said he did,) "when they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen?"—he said the boy was a plater, or his father was—I then looked round, and saw these other things, which are also mine—I said, "These are mine"—he said he had them of a boy who he knew very well—we brought them away, and the policeman took Abbott to the station—these things are all mine, and most of them have my private mark on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutor. On the 27th of April I spoke to Wood about the buckles—he said he knew nothing of them—he came to me again, and said, "If I can't get the buckles back, will Mr. Canning discharge me?"—I said, "I don't know"—I then asked where he had sold them—he said Mr. Canning knew—I said, "Yes, but I don't"—he said it was a kind of grinder's shop in St. Andrew's-street, and he got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—that he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and the man said he could buy them for that in a shop—he said he took them from the warehouse.</p>

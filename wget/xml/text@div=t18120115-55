On Saturday, the 4th of this month, I was discharged from the Company's employ. Three or four fellow-labourers that were discharged at the same time, we went to drink together. In the evening I left them to go home. In Whitechapel road, going home, three or four men met me. One says to the other, I'll be damn'd if I do not know that man; he lives in Dog-row. I turned round and said, you are damn'd - I do not live there, though I did live there ten years. They made answer, that I dealt in oysters, and that I opened some for them. I then found they knew me, though I did not know them. I got into conversation with them, and they mentioned two or three people's names that did live in Dog-row. With persuasion I went into the Angel and Crown, opposite Whitechapel church, to drink with them. They called for a pot of beer and half a pint of liquor, and paid for it; we drank the liquor, and came out of the house together; there were four of them. I bid them good night, and in my way home, just before I got to <placeName id="t18120115-55-crimeloc320">Great Garden-street</placeName>

I got up and halloed out watch; the patrol came up; I told him I had lost my watch and money; I told him two went up Great Garden-street, and the other two went up the road; I went with him to the watch-house, and the constable of the night went with me to the public-house to know whether these lads used the house or no. We could not learn any thing of them; there I was wandering about for a little while. I laid hold of this prisoner somewhere near Whitechapel church, I called the watchmen, and gave him in charge, the officer of the night did not take my charge, they seemed to think that I had not lost a watch, being a poor man. I would not leave the prisoner then, I followed him, thinking somebody might be coming by that would hear my case. By Osborne street, the prisoner knocked me down, a watchman was leaning over his box, when I got up I said, you see how I am served, this is one of the party that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman take him. - A. No. He knocked me down the second time, and the watchman never came out of his box; I got up, and made the best of my way home. This was on the Saturday night. On the Wednesday morning I saw the prisoner at Worship street, and as soon as I saw him, I said he was one of the four that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said two held your hands back, while the other two rifled you, what did they take from you. - A. A silver watch, two dollars, and a three-shilling token, I have never seen them since. The prisoner was searched at the watch house, nothing was found on him.</p>

            . I am one of the beadles of Whitechapel parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty on the 4th of January last. - A. I was. A patrol brought the prosecutor to the watchhouse a little after twelve o'clock, he told me that he had been robbed of a watch and two dollars,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150047"></xptr>he did not then give any account of the persons that robbed him, he could not describe the persons. A little before two he brought this man in, he then said that he had lost his watch, two dollars, and two three shilling pieces, he was very much in liquor and varied his account, that is the reason the officer did not take the charge.</p>

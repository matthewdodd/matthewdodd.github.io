                  </hi>. I am a labourer in Spitalfields—I knew John Howard—on 10th April, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was with him and some other persons at the corner of George-street—there was a dis<lb></lb>turbance with the prisoner and a lad named William Hartley, who is called Fairboy as a <hi rend="italic">nick-name</hi>—there were two girls, lodgers of the prisoner's, there—they had a part in the row—I saw the prisoner take up a part of a brick and heave it at Fairboy, and it hit Jack Howard in the front of his head—he fell down senseless from the blow—we picked him up, and strapped up his head with a bit of strapping, and he came out again a short time after<lb></lb>wards—he took no more notice of it then—he fell backwards, I believe—the back part of his head was cut—I saw it—it was bleeding a little at the part where he fell—the brick was a three-quarter brick—the prisoner was about three yards from him when she threw it—I saw Howard three or four days afterwards, and he said he had been fighting again outside the Bells, in Brick-lane—he said he had got pretty well from what the prisoner had done—he took no more notice of that until about three weeks after—he said when he was fighting outside the Bells he was struck down again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not see the young man make a blow at me before I took up the brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fairboy had made a blow at you, and called you a good many names—I believe he said that you had given him in charge to the police, and had him taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Fairboy sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I can't exactly say whether the prisoner was—she did not appear exactly sober—if she had heaved the brick with the intention of hitting Fairboy, she might have hit him, as she was only three yards from him—she might have done it to frighten him, or she might have done it to hit him, I can't say for certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon at the London Hospital when Howard was brought there—it was some days before 23d May—the cause of his death was abscess in the brain, in the upper part on the left side—I attribute that to an injury in the front part of the head, some what on the right side—there was some diseased bone—I could not tell from the appearances how long before the injury had been inflicted—I could tell that it had been for more than two or three days—there was a small external opening on the head; it would not heal—it went down to the skull bone, not into the bone—the cause of death was the abscess on the top of the brain—I don't mean exactly on the surface, it was in the substance of the brain—I don't think it could possibly have been caused by a fall—it might have been, but not from the collateral circumstances—such a thing may have been, although I have never seen anything like it—I could not say it might not be so—I think it is more probable it was caused by something thrown—it was consistent with the appearances that the injury might have been caused as long ago as 12th April—he died on 1st June—he was tre<lb></lb>phined twice—he died from the effect of the disease—trephining was his only chance—it was skilfully done by one of the first men in London.</p>

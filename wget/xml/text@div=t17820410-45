               <p>I am left in charge of the buildings, I locked the doors on Saturday night, the 23d. of February; on Monday morning, I found the lead ripped off, of both windows, and checks belong to Esquire Pullen, I saw the advertisement, and went to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to work, between six and seven o'clock, there were two men asked me to help them down with it, I did so, and took one of the pieces that was wrapped up in a coat, into the public house, one of the men asked me to bring it out.</p>
               <p>Court to the Jury. I believe in this case you will be eased of the comitting of the fact, for the prisoner is indicted for stealing this lead, generally as the offence of stealing at common law, of any other property, now there is an act made in the reign of his late majesty, which makes the offence of stealing lead when fixed to a dwelling-house, a felony, and the reason of that act of parliament was, that before that time, it was holden, that the taking away the lead, or any other thing fixed to the freehold, was considered not felony, but if the property had been severed, then it became felony in any other case, it was to provide against this mischief, that the act of parliament was made, to indict a more exemplary punishment on such offenders; the indictment now not being upon the statute, nor having pursued the words of the statute, you cannot find him guilty on that, and the evidence does not support the indictment at common law, therefore upon this indictment in point of law, whatever the fact may be, the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>

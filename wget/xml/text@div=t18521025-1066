                  </hi>. I keep refreshment-rooms at 69, High-street, Borough. On the evening of 23rd Sept. Anson came and asked for a glass of porter—he gave a sixpence to pay for it—I placed it in the till—there was no other sixpence there—I gave him change, and he left the house—when</p>

               <p>he left, I looked at the sixpence, and immediately discovered it was bad—I placed it on a shelf behind me—on the same evening, about 11 o'clock, Anson came again—I knew him when he came in—he called for a glass of porter, and offered in payment a counterfeit sixpence—I immediately saw it was counterfeit, and I took it in my hand and went out of the private door, in at the other door, and secured him—I saw Lucas outside, standing on the kerb, looking through the window—I then went after Lucas—he was not then on the kerb—he peeped through the doorway, and saw Anson and me; he then crossed to the opposite side of the way—I went and told him I wanted him—he said he had done nothing—a constable came up, and I gave both the prisoners into custody, with the two sixpences—Lucas was brought into my house, and searched, but I did not see anything found on him—I was attending to my business, but I saw three sixpences—I did not notice the date of the second that was uttered by Anson.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody on a charge of loitering about warehouses—he was examined on the 16th and re<lb></lb>manded till the 25th—he gave his name William Johnson, but refused his address—on the 22nd he gave his name William Cromer Palmer, 18, St. John's Terrace, Upper Holloway—I went there with Roper, and in consequence of the information I obtained I went to a house m Maryle<lb></lb>bone Lane, Mrs. Ribley's, who is related to him by his first wife I believe—I there saw a box, which I took to the police-station, and found it contained 4 pieces of silk and 13 or 14 remnants of various lengths—some of it is identified by Messrs. Candy—I saw the prisoner on the 30th and told him that since the last remand I had traced a box from his house to 11, Marylebone Lane, and had found in it several pieces of silk which were identified as stolen from different warehouses—he said "I know nothing about it, I bought them of a Frenchman."</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 19th Jan., I was at a beer-shop at North Hyde—the prisoner was there; I had never seen him before—I had a purse with ten or eleven shillings in it—I spent one or two shillings, and had then nine shillings in the purse—I sat and drank, and the prisoner sat by my side—he put his hand in my pocket—I said, "What are you doing with your hand in my pocket?"—he drew it out and dropped a shilling and a half-penny on the floor—I left the beer-shop about eleven o'clock with Collis—I had my money then—after I had got some distance I was overtaken by the prisoner and another—he said, "You have accused me wrong to-night"—I said no, I had not—he began to push against me, and put his arm round me, put his hand in my pocket, and pulled my money all out—I said he had taken my money—he walked a distance with me, and said he had not—I saw a policeman, and the prisoner and the other man ran away—I never got my money again.</p>

I was in the public-house that night with the prisoner and Lovell—I did not see the prisoner do anything, but I heard some money full on the ground—Lovell said, "What business had you with your hand in my pocket? you have picked out my money"—the prisoner said, "No, I have not"—Lovell picked up the shilling, and I picked up the halfpenny—Lovell afterwards left the house; I went with him—two persons overtook us, but I do not know who they were—it was quite dark—a man struck at Lovell—he said, "I never picked your pocket"—Lovell said, "You did"—the policeman came, and both the men ran away—we were rather in drink, but we knew what we were doing.</p>

I came up and heard Lovell say, "If you rob me, don't knock me about"—I turned on my light, and a man, who I believe was the prisoner, ran away—he jumped over a hedge, and we lost him—Lovell had been drinking, but he knew what he was doing, and ran very well.</p>

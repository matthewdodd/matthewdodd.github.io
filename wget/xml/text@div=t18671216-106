                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 108 <hi rend="italic">L</hi>). On the night of 29th November, about ten o'clock, I was in Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, at the corner of the Hercules public-house—I went to the urinal there—I saw the prisoner—he and two more came from a beer-house on the other side of the road—one of them caught hold of my truncheon-case behind, and pulled me, and said, "Make haste, old fellow"—I said, "I can't for the moment"—I turned round, and the prisoner was making water against me, all down my side—I told him he was a dirty fellow—he still continued, and I pushed him away—he created a disturbance, and got a mob of people round, and I took him to the station—I called another constable, 203 L, to assist me, and as we were going to the station, about half-way up Tower Street, I saw the prisoner drop something—I immediately stopped—two little girls were behind, and I called to one of them to pick it up, and she picked it up and gave it to me—it was a parcel done up in this paper—I opened it at the station, and found it contained eleven bad shillings—the prisoner refused his name and address—I was in uniform.</p>

On the night of 29th November, I saw Miller with the prisoner in custody—I laid hold of the prisoner on the right side—as we went from the Hercules public-house down the West<lb></lb>minster Road, along Down Street, he put his hand to his breast and dropped something—Miller said, "What is that he has dropped?"—I said, "I don't know"—we stopped immediately—Miller looked round and said to a little girl, "Pick it up and give it to me"—she did so—we never lost sight of it—we then took the prisoner on to the station, and the paper was examined—I did not hear the girl say anything when she picked it up.</p>

Q.</hi> How came you to allow him to put his hand to his breast and throw it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know that he had anything in his hand till I saw it fall—I did not prevent him putting his hand to his breast—there were several persons following behind when it was dropped besides the two little girls—there was a crowd round when he was taken into custody—there was not a great many following to the station—there might be a dozen or more—my attention was first called to this by seeing him drop his hand—I did not hear Miller ask the girls if they saw the prisoner drop it—there was a lamp about six yards off—I saw the prisoner searched at the station, and two sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, and twenty pence found on him, all good money.</p>

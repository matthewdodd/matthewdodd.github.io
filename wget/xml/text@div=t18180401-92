               <p>JOHN MARCHANT. I am a shoemaker, and live in Field-lane. On the 1st of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and offered me a pair of shoes for sale; he said he made them himself the day before. I told him they had been made a long while, and had laid in some shop. I asked him who he worked for? he said for Mr. Ewel and Mr. Walker. I asked him if he worked for any other person? he said, No. I asked him if he worked for Gotch? he said, he did not now, but that he did sometime ago. I told him I suspected the shoes belonged to Gotch, and asked him to go there with me-he would not. I sent for Gotch - He ran out of the shop, I followed and secured him on Snow-hill - I am sure he is the man. Gotch came and claimed the shoes. The prisoner then said he bought the duplicate of them. He could not tell where they were pledged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew they were not country-made shoes.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them.</p>

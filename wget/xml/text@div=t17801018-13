On Friday the 22d of September there was a sale of a farmer's stock in my neighbourhood. I went up stairs to see what money I could spare, as I had my rent and other things to pay. I looked over my money. I put my bank notes in a private drawer in my bureau which stood in my bed-chamber. I put forty-seven guineas and six half-guineas in a canvas bag, which I put in the drawer upon the bank-notes. I then told over two guineas worth of silver in shillings and sixpences; there was a half-guinea, and four half-crowns. I put all that into a common drawer which slides in by the side of the private drawer; they were likewise in a bag. I saw that my snuff-box and other things were all safe; that was at nine o'clock in the morning; then I went out among my plowmen and servants. I came home again a little after twelve o'clock, and between twelve and one I went out to Evans's auction. After the auction was over, seeing some farmers there who live at distant villages, I asked them to come home with me and eat and drink something, as we had not dined. We came to my house a little before five o'clock, and sat together in my kitchen till between eight and nine, when they went away. As soon as they were gone I went up to bed;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180018"></xptr> there is a closet by the side of my bed in which I put my clothes and some garden-seeds. I observed that a seed-box was removed out of its place; then I saw a hole through the ceiling in the closet which led up into the cock-loft. I went directly to my bureau; I found it broke open, and I missed all my money, the snuff-box, the spoons, the seal, and the other things. I called up my boy and my men, and we alarmed the town directly. I found the back-door of the barn was open. The way in which the fact had been committed was by getting into the barn, getting upon the barley in it, and so getting into the cock-lost, which communicates with the end of the barn; that cock-lost is over some stables; she must have crept along the cock-loft till she came over my chamber; the hole that was made in my chamber was large enough to admit a person to pass through it from the cock-lost. We searched, but could not find any person about. I rode that night to Hounslow and Slough; I did not get home till three o'clock; I went to bed for a short time; when I got up in the morning I came and laid an information at Sir John Fielding's office; then I went to the Bank and gave an account of the Banknotes I had lost; I could hear nothing of them. On Monday morning I came again to Sir John Fielding's office and to the Bank, but they had heard nothing of them; coming along Piccadily , between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I accidentally met the prisoner along with a man opposite St. James's Church.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - Yes; she had lived with me. I asked her where she had been? She said in the country. I asked her what country? She said Chester. I asked who the man was with her? She said her husband. I said come we will drink together; I wanted to see you, for I have been thinking about you. I asked her where she would go? She said to the Blackmoor's-head , behind St. James's Church; there was a chairman at the door; I put them in first, and begged him to get me a constable; when we went in I desired the landlady to let us have a back-room to ourselves, for we should want some victuals. I called for a pot of beer; the constable did not come; I went to the door to the chairman, he had not been for one; at last I persuaded him to go for one; when I went out the prisoner wanted to go out too; I followed her; I said she should not go out; she began to be very abusive; the chairman then brought in the constable; I gave him charge of the man and the prisoner; he said he would search them. She insisted I should not see her searched. I went out of the room; the constable searched her, and, as I afterwards learnt, he found fifteen guineas and some silver upon her, and likewise my snuff-box; the constable took her to Sir

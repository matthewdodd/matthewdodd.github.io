Last Saturday night I sent him into the cellar to put some old nails by; I suspected him, listened, and distinctly heard him take up several handsfull of nails. He came out of the cellar, I waited about ten minutes till Bond came in, then called him and the prisoner into the counting-house, and ordered him to deliver up the nails which he had taken from what he took down into the cellar; he said he had none. I said if he did not deliver them up I would send for an officer. He then emptied both his waistcoat-pockets of nails, and begged of me to forgive him, as it was his first offence - there were 3 lbs. of nails. While I sent for an officer he made his escape out of the counting-house into the smith's shop; I followed, and brought him back, he got on a ladder, and partly dragged me up; I hung to his collar; he made a slip, and shook me off; he then ascended the ladder, got on the shed, and broke through a window into a woman's room; he could not escape through there, and returned. I found him on the roof of Mr. Dickenson's livery stables, and gave him in charge.</p>

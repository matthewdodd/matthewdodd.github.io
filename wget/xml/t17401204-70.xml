The Prisoner pretended to be my Friend, and pulled off my Coat, and said I might beat them both; they knocked me down twice, and made me bleed, so then I let them do what they would; I lay in the Kennel sometime before I came to myself, and the Prisoner was taken with my Coat upon him; he was carry'd before Justice Chandler , where he confessed the Fact, and said that he was induced by his two Comrades, to come there that Night on purpose to rob.</p>

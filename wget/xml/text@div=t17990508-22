               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, Harrison, live with you as your <rs id="t17990508-22-deflabel134" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17990508-22-defend344 t17990508-22-deflabel134"></join>, at the time your house was robbed? - A. Yes, about ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is your house in Mile-end? - A. It is in what they call Old Town, it is in the parish of Stepney, it is called St. Dunstan's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When your house was robbed, between the 10th and the 11th of April, how many did your family consist of? - A. My wife, myself, the servant, Harrison, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife, at the time, able to go about your house? - A. With a great deal of help, she could walk about the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed on the night you were robbed? - A. I believe about nine o'clock; we generally go to bed between nine and ten; my wife and I went to bed nearly together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your servant up? - A. She always went to bed after we were gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house in a state of safety when you went to bed, were the doors shut? - A. They were, I had not taken any particular notice of them, but I did not observe any doors open; between four and five o'clock I received an alarm, that my house had been robbed, it was about day-break; I did not get up directly upon the alarm, I was very ill, and my wife got up first; it might be three quarters of an hour before I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up, did you observe what had been taken away? - A. I cannot say in particular that I missed any thing just at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss any thing yourself? - A. As soon as I came down stairs, I found the drawers were stripped in my parlour, and the drawers locked again; they were locked before I went to bed; they had been opened by the keys belonging to them, by taking my wife's pockets from under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the keys of those drawers on the night before the house was broke open? - A. In my wife's pockets, she always carried them to bed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were those pockets kept in the course of the night? - A. Always put under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, were the pockets under the head of the bed? - A. No, the pockets were taken out and carried down into the parlour, and there emptied of every thing in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any thing else under the head of your bed? - A. I had my watch under the head of new bed, and I am sure I had it that night, and it was missing in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your servant, Harrison, know that you kept your watch, and your wife her pockets, under the bed's head? - A. Yes, she did; I will tell you how she came to be acquainted with this; when she came to help her mistress up, I asked her to take the watch from under my head, to see how the watch and clock agreed; this she had done eight or ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else lost from under the head of your bed, besides these pockets and watch? - A. Yes, the keys, and there was money in my wife's pockets, three guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed, did you see any money at all in your wife's pockets? - A. No, that is what my wife told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else in her pockets, besides the keys? - A. There was some silver besides, I saw it; there were nine shillings and sixpence of new money; I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pin-cushion? - A. I saw the pin-cushion on the night of the robbery, when the maid undressed my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that pin-cushion left in the night? - A. It was in my wife's pocket, under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, did you see any thing of your wife's pockets or pin-cushion? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the course of the day? - A. It was found in the course of the day, hid under the prisoner, Harrison's bed, by the side of an old window-blind, between that and the wall; there were a good many other things found then, but I cannot tell what; there were pieces of new linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when that search was made? - A. One of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing particular about the house? - A. I cannot say I perceived any thing particular; there were the candlestick and things stood about the room as there had been every morning, and the breakfast things upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was your loss altogether do you think? - A. It might be between fifty and sixty pounds altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose those articles mentioned in the indictment, I will state them - A. Silver watch, two silver table-spoons, six silver tea-spoons two silver salt-spoons, two gold rings-were work any <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080043"></xptr>particular mark about the gold rings? - A. They were my wife's; in one of them was my picture.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been found since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Two bead necklaces, do you know that they were lost upon this occasion? - A. Yes; they were removed from where they had been.</p>

There was a silver coin besides these, of the value of two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney, Q. Tell me how lately you had seen these things-for instance, how lately had you seen the silver table-spoons? - A. I might not have seen them for a week.</p>
               <p>Q. The salt-spoons, perhaps, you had? - A. I don't know that I had seen them for a month.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at No. 10, Cromsby's-row, next door to Mr. Wade.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you observed? - A. I got out of bed about half past four o'clock, to look at the weather.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light at that time? - A. It was just grey-light, not fairly day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough, at that time, to distinguish the features of a man? - A. Not at that time, if he was at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe, when you were looking at the state of the weather? - A. I saw something lying in my own garden, which I supposed to be a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any sence which divides Mr. Wade's yard from your's? - A. Yes, a brick wall; I put on some of my clothes, and went down to it, and found it to be a trunk; I took it up to my bedroom, it appeared to me to be full, I did not open it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box afterwards? - A. I carried it back to Mr. Wade's, it was never examined in my presence; I delivered it to the prisoner at the bar; I went to bed again, and was nearly going to sleep, and I heard some noise which disturbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be? - A. I should think it was nearly half an hour, not so much, perhaps; I then looked out of the window, and, in a few minutes, I heard a woman scream out, and cry murder, several times; I then put on my shoes, and went to the window, and saw Susannah Harrison leaning out of her master's window, and I found she was the person that made the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this alarm, where did you go to? - A. I asked her what was the matter, and she said somebody was in the house; I put on some of my clothes, and called my brother to get up; I went to the front of my own house to look at Mr. Wade's house, which was close shut, all fast, and secure at that time; I then went back into my own garden, and called to Harrison, and asked her how I could get in; she said, if I could get over, the back door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get over? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when your brother found your back door open? - A. It is a gate which goes into the passage, my brother pushed it open; my brother got first to the back door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080044"></xptr>Q. Were you in sight? - A. I was; I saw my brother hit it with a stick, and it went open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you perceive then? - A. When I got into the house, it appeared very dark; not being used to the house, I asked Harrison to give me a light; she said, yes, she would give me one; she was up stairs in her room, I suppose; I did not see her, but I spoke to her.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw her at the window, did you observe whether she was dressed or not? - A. I did not take any particular notice one way or the other; after she came back, she said her candle was gone, and she immediately came down stairs, and opened one of the parlour windows.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came down stairs, how was she dressed? - A. I did not take any particular notice of her dress, she had part of her clothes on, I cannot say what part, she was not fully dressed, she had a gown on and a flannel petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. After she had opened one parlour window, and going to open the other, we heard a noise, which very much frightened her, I was afraid she would have sainted away; I opened the other parlour window, and then opened the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had opened the kitchen window, in what state did you observe the rooms? - A. I looked round, and saw nobody, but there was a bundle lying in the passage, which, she said, were sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine it, to see whether they were sheets or no? - A. No, I did not; I know nothing of it any farther; she then said, that all her clothes were gone; I went out of doors, and took up a bundle lying there, and said to her, perhaps these are your clothes, this was about two yards from the door, the back side of the house; she said, no, that was dirty clothes; I then told her I had found a box; and she said, it was her mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave that box? - A. I gave it to her, and she carried it up stairs; I then left them, there was nothing more passed.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were in the house, did you observe any bottles or candlesticks? - A. I did not take any particular notice; there were some things on the table; I saw a candlestick broke, with the bottom off, and a piece of candle burnt down near to the socket, it appeared to have guttered and run down; I then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the officers been sent for before you went away? - A. Not to my knowledge; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, at the time you first went down, it was not very light, not light enough to distinguish the features of a man, without you were close to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that box from the window? - A. I think it was from ten to fifteen yards, but I could not distinguish what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it before you were alarmed, after you looked out of the window? - A. It was near half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Harrison, my Friend asked you about her dress? - A. I observed that she held her gown round her, and I saw her flannel petticoat under her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what she had on, might have been put on in a minute? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable, belonging to the Police-office, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you sent for to Mr. Wade's house? - A. About eleven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Wade came to the office; I, in company with Cooke and Holbrook, went to examine Mr. Wade's house, to see how it had been attacked; we examined the front door and windows, and the back windows, and we found no violence whatever; at the maid-servant Harrison's window, we observed it broke, it was up stairs; we tried to see whether we could get out hands in at the hole of the window, and unfasten it, but we could not; we were very well satisfied then that the prisoner must be concerned in it, then we left the house; Mr. Wade had sent the prisoner, Harrison, off upon an errand, and we watched her back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more observed-Did you see where she went to? - A. No, I only watched her home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you see her first? - A. We saw her about a hundred yards from the house, returning home; she might have been sent out an hour or two; I was not present when she went out; we followed her into the house, and brought her into the parlour; we told her, from the information we had received, and the window being broke in that manner, we suspected her to be concerned; she seemed a great deal frightened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. And did you not add, you had better tell? - A. No, I did not; then we took the prisoner, Harrison, into her bed-chamber, in company with Mr. Wade; upon the teller of the bed we found two neck-cloths and two handkerchiefs, a red pocket-book, a piece of new Irish cloth, and a pin-cushion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that? - A. By the side of he maid-servant's bed, behind a window blind, close to the wall; I was obliged to take away the blind before I could take it up; that is all I know upon he 11th.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see in what state any candle or candlestick was? - A. No, I did not; on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080045"></xptr>the 16th I went to

               <p>Q. Did you find that friend of her's? - A. I did, I cannot tell his name; he went with me and Cooke to the prisoner, Harrison.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had brought her forward, tell us what Harrison said? - A. The gentleman went with the prisoner, Harrison, into a room by himself, and after he had been there about ten minutes, he called Cooke and me into the room; then he began telling us where the property was in her hearing; he told us it was at one

               <p>Q. Did you go to the place where she described this Carter to live? - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the morning? - A. Near about four or five o'clock; Carter got up, and says he, I know what you are come for; we went up stairs into his bed-chamber, and we found a quantity of wearing apparel, which I now produce, in a bundle, tied up together in a chintz gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or did he give any account how he came by it? - A. He said the girl had either sent it to his house or brought it to his house; I know nothing more than finding the property. (That part of the property produced which was found at Carter's house).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was all that, in the chintz gown, found at Carter's? - A. Yes, this is the chintz gown; here are the silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you afterwards make any further search in Mr. Wade's house? - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose directions did you make that further search in Mr. Wade's house? - A. By the directions of the prisoner, Harrison-she said, there was the silver spoons, a watch, and money, in a box under the dresser in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the place she described? - A. I found this box, and likewise this box, (produces them); and a bundle of white handkerchiefs, all under the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. What is contained in these boxes? - A. Here is a watch, two rings, six silver tea-spoons, two salt-spoons, two table-spoons, three guineas and a half in gold, thirteen shillings in shillings, and eleven sixpences; I searched further, in the back-kitchen, by the directions of Harrison, and in a carpet, I found these articles, a silver thimble, a quantity of half-pence, three white aprons, and a pair of white stockings; that is all I know of the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Now, the first conversation the prisoner had with any person was with her friend? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to state that these things, which were at Carters's, were taken that night or in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not state that some things had been taken there before? - A. She did not mention to me that the things were taken that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that she ever described any part of the things that had been taken to Carter's were taken that morning? - A. No, she never did.</p>
               <p>Q. And never did described any person of the name of Carter to have been there that morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What distance might Carter's house be from the house robbed? - A. It might be half a mile; one thing I omitted, which the prisoner, Harrison, told me concerning the key I found in her pocket, she said that Carter's wife gave it her to unlock at closet.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Carter's house four or five days after the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you that the things, which had been taken to Carter's house, had been taken at that time? - A. No, she did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go to the prisoner Carter's house, did you see the prisoner, Harrison, before you went to Carter's? - A. No, I did not; I went with my fellow-servant, it was near about four or five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of April; upon Brown's knocking, Carter looked out at the window, and said to Brown, in my hearing, I know what you are come for; I found in his bedroom a bundle tied up of wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it tied up in? - A. I cannot tell what, it was a spotted something, it seemed to be a piece of linen, that I brought away; I know nothing more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Wade's house with Brown? - A. I did; I was not present when he found any thing backwards; upon the tester of the bed I found this parcel.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that chintz gown, and tell me whether you know any thing of it? - A. I know it, I made it for Mrs. Wade; I knew it by the work when I saw it in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make it? - A. The latter end of last summer; I don't know that I have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Wade.) Do you recollect seeing this chintz gown, and how lately before you were robbed? - A. It might be a month, or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any other articles of apparel? - A. I know that is my wife's gown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What I want to know is, can you tell us the last time you saw any of these articles; had you seen any one of them the day before? - A. No, not so late as that; I believe the chintz gown was the latest thing I saw, and that is a month or six week; some of them I am sure I had not seen for a great while.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you to say that the chintz gown was the last thing you saw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Can you tell us whether there is any of your property in this box; here are the table-spoons? - A. They are mine, there is my name upon them; that penknife is mine. - (Another box produced). This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth twenty shillings? - A. I hope it is worth forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these two spoons? - A. The two table-spoons cost me six and thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is some money? - A. There is some of both new and old silver; I can speak particularly to the new money, there is nine shillings and sixpence I know, my wife had it in her pocket, I have seen it a dozen times, it is in this King's reign, it was money that my son made my wife a present of at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find a pin-cushion in that parcel? - A. It is not here. - That little box in mine, there is one ring in it; and in another box is the ring which bears my picture; the other is a garnet ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you went to bed and left your servant up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The fastening of the doors and windows were left to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not stay to see whether they were fastened or not? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say whether the back door was fastened or not? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, I submit to the Court, that there is not sufficient evidence to support the specific offence charged against the prisoner, Carter, on this indictment, he living at the distance of half a mile from the place where the offence is stated to have been committed, nobody having seen him near the place at the time; and five days having elapsed before the officers went to his house.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not for me to determine whether that prisoner has committed a burglary or not, the Jury must decide that; and to support the charge, there is sufficient evidence to go to the Jury. - Melancholy indeed would be the state of the subjects of this country, if, because a man robs a house in the dark, and nobody fees him, he is not to be convicted.</p>

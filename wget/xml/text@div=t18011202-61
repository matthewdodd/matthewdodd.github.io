             sworn. - On the 27th of October I had left my place, and was going to Westminster, about eight o'clock in the evening, it being star-light; I had a bundle, containing the articles mentioned in the indictment; as I was going through the Park, a soldier came up to me, that is the man (pointing to Gann;) and laid hold of me, and asked me where I was going? I begged him to let me go my way; he would not, but held me by the arm; then another soldier came up, which is Haywood; he wanted to catch hold of me, but the other would not let him; then the other prisoner gave him a wink.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see him wink? - A. Yes; then Haywood went behind, and snatched the bundle from under my arm, and run away; I squalled out stop thief! Gann held me while he went to a distance, a quarter of an hour or more, and told me to hold my tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not threaten to do you a mischief, did he? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not afraid of their using you ill? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that held you? - A. He run away towards Knightsbridge barracks, and I walked after him as fast as I could; a corporal then came up to my assistance, who is not here, and we went after them to the Barracks; I kept them in sight all through the Green Park.</p>

No, I did not keep them in fight the whole way; I did not see them go into the Barracks, but I found Haywood there, and the other came in about ten minutes after; the serjeant searched for the bundle, and found it in another man's knapsack; the soldier that owned the knapsack, said Gann had put it there; Gann only said, I was mistaken in the person.</p>

             MORRISON. I am a serjeant of the Police. I saw Butler in the watch-house on the 6th of December, and asked him where he lived - he said in the Edgware-road; I asked where there - he said near the turnpike; I asked how many doors from the turnpike - he said he did not know; I asked the number - he said he did not know, and that it was a private house, he believed; I said I thought he did not live in the Edgware-road - I took him down, locked him up, and went to his house immediately, with Weatherly, who took me to Drummond-street (he is not here) we made inquiries at a public-house, and in consequence of information, went to No. 80, Drummond-street, Paddington, and on coming to the door, a little girl came - I went into the house; a female stook in the passage, who said her name was Butler- I only know it to be his house from information; I found in that house, among other property, a fur tippet, two shirts, a silk gown, a buff handkerchief, six keys, and several articles of jewellery; I have had no communication with Butler about these articles. On the Tuesday following, I went to Pichott's, No. 25, Chester-terrace, Regent's-park - I knew he lived there; I found him and his wife there - they were removing; a van stood at the door, loaded with boxes - I told Pichott I was an officer, and asked him if Butler was there last Thursday; he said No, he was there last Sunday week - I then said I had come to search the house; I did so, but found nothing suspicious in the house - I then told him he must go to the watch-house, and I should take the van and goods there also, which I did; he said the whole of them were his boxes - after taking them out of the van I told him I wished him to be present, as I intended to search them; he, his wife, Watkins, and a female were present - I found this shawl, claimed by Sharp, in one of the boxes, and a pair of drops, claimed by Mr. Timewell, in one of them; this was on the 8th of December - I found a skeleton-key in a box, at Pichott's; a pocket tinder-box, and an instantaneous light-box in one of the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You call this a skeleton-key? A. I believe it to be one; it was newly field when I found it - I have been in the Police from the first commencement of the new system; I call a key which has been altered as this is, a skeleton - the wards have certainly been field down; the drop ear-rings were in Pichott's box on the 8th - the owner was not present at the time; I produced them at the office - they were not recognized there; Miss Sharp was present - there were three hearings; they were not recognized till after the prisoner was committed - they have been recognized only to day, by Mr. Timewell; he described them to me particularly before he saw them, and the moment he saw them in my hand he said they were his; he saw what I produced at the office, but I only produced what had been recognized at the watch-house - all the property was at the office, but not produced to him; it lay on the table, but his attention was not directed to them - he had not a full view of every thing on the table; he could not see it, unless he looked down direct upon it, for there were forty or fifty articles produced, and these might be covered over with some others - I believe they were; the witness' attention was only directed to what was recognized at the watch-house, and which I produced as theirs - they were told to look at the property on the table.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD. I know the house, No. 80, Drummond-street, to be Butler's; I have been employed by him himself; he let part of it out - I did not see the things found, and have had no conversation with him about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you before the Grand Jury on this case? A. Not on this case; I was employed by Butler last about two years ago, but have seen him there since - I was there on the 18th of last September; he had one lodger on the first floor, and I believe there has been no other lodger, for I have had occasion to watch the house; I certainly cannot from my own knowledge say who has lodged there since September.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he had a lodger? A. Yes, a female, who I have executed some warrants for; she had the first-floor, which is two rooms - I believe she had both; she seemed to have access to both.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY MORRISON. I found the things in the back parlour, which is occupied as a bed-room; they were not on the first floor - here are some skeleton-keys which I found in Butler's back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether that room might not have been let to a lodger? A. No, only from what Mrs. Butler said - I do not know Butler to be a carpenter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BURRIDGE. I am a constable of Marylebone Office. On Saturday, the 12th of December, I was hailed by a person in Marylebone-street, and saw a woman in company with a person I knew; she came up and said her name was Pichott - I received from her a bundle, containing two shirts, which Mrs. Sharp claimed at the office.</p>
               <p>JAMES TIMEWELL. I can identify the whole of these articles; some I found myself at Butler's, and some at the office - the bracelets I found in a drawer in the back parlour, the chain, glass, silk dress, and two shirts; they were all in the house at the time of the robbery - I know the drops; I did not see them at the office, or I should have known them - I did not identify any of my property at the office; the drops were in the same drawer as the bracelets, and taken from the same place - the silk dress and tippet were in the front drawing-room; the property found in Pichott's boxes is mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.You did not identify the property at the office? A. I mean I did not identify any fresh property there - I had examined it before; I was told to look at the property on the table, but I had examined it, and thought I had seen all that was mine before, but to-day is the first time I saw these drops - if I had seen them I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140014"></xptr>should have known them; I could point them out from among a thousand - the officer was opening a bundle to day, and I saw them, took them out, handed them to another officer, and told him a mark which was on them before I examined them.</p>
               <p>MISS SHARP. This is my mother's shawl, and was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Had you had it some time? A. Yes, four years, but never wore it; I took it out of the paper a week before the robbery, and looked at it; I know the pattern - there is no particular mark on it, but I am sure of it by the appearance, colour and pattern; I should know it among others, having had it so long.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. Respecting the property, it was brought into my house by John Jennings - I did not know it was stolen; respecting the two shirts, I had took two to Mrs. Pichott, and asked her to mark them for me.</p>

               <p>Picholt's Defence. Butler was known to my wife's first husband several years ago, and was at that time foreman at a lime-yard - I knew nothing of him then; it was five or six years ago - when I married my wife I went to live by the New-road; she met Butler, and told him what business I was in, and that I should be glad to serve him - I accordingly worked for him; he called and paid me ready money for every article I made for him, and took them away; I never went to his house - he was always represented to me as possessed of hundreds of pounds, and having a kiln of his own; at one time I heard he was independent.</p>
               <p>HENRY TORIAS HAWKINS. I am a carpenter and joiner, and live at No. 9, Chester-terrace, Regent's-park; I am minding three houses there. On the 22nd of November I left my house at a quarter to six o'clock, and went to a place of worship in Charles-street, Hampstead-road; I got into the chapel about five minutes to six o'clock, and remained there till nine o'clock, I believe - I do not think I had got there more than three or four minutes before I saw Pichott sitting across a form near my pew door; I beckoned him into the pew which I have part of - he came in, and remained there till the service was over, which is generally at eight o'clock, a minute or two before or after; this was a mile and three quarters from some parts of the Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Is Pichott an acquaintance of your's? A. I never exchanged more than ten words with him before; Mr. Wild preached at the chapel that night.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WAGGETT. I live with my father in Henry-street, Hampstead-road. On the 22nd of November I went to the chapel in Charles-street, at six o'clock; Pichott was there when I went in - I sat near the pew in which he and Mr. Hawkins were; he remained there till the end of the service, and I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is he an old acquaintance of yours? A. He subscribes to the Missionary Society, for which I collect, and here is my book - that is the way I knew him; the service ended near eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am the last witnesses' brother - we live with our father. I went to chapel with her on the 22nd of November, and saw Pichott in Mr. Stevens' pew- Mr. Hawkins and his wife also sit there; his wife was not there that evening, she was ill - Pichott was there when the service began, and till it was over, which is generally about a quarter to eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you happen to recollect the 22nd of November? A. I remember my sister speaking to him at the door, and a person at the same time asked my sister what Mr. Jackson was to preach the following Sunday morning, which was our Sunday School anniversary sermon - that was on the 29th; Mr. Wild preached that night.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLESSLEY. I live at No. 10, William-street, Regent's-park, about a mile and a quarter from Edgware-road. On the 22nd of November I saw Pichott at my house from a few minutes before eight o'clock till half-past ten; I had a sister insane, who had an inclination to have somebody to read to her, and I got him to come for that purpose, but he did not read, for she was not in a fit state; I am certain he came about a quarter before eight o'clock - I saw him out at my door at half-past ten o'clock, with his wife, who had come after him.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 10, William-street, at Blessley's. On Sunday evening, the 22nd of November, about five o'clock, I called at Pichott's house, and remained with him till six, when he went to chapel, and I saw him again about a quarter-past eight - he was in my compay till a quarter after ten o'clock that evening, at Blessley's - his wife was with him when I called at his house; I went to Portland-road, returned about a quarter to seven, and remained in company with Mrs. Pichott till eight o'clock - she was sitting in the room with me, reading; I afterwards went to my lodging, as he had promised to come there to see a woman who was ill in the house; I went there at five or ten minutes past eight, and found him there - he said he had been there ten minutes - his wife came in about ten minutes; she had merely waited for a lodger to come from chapel - she left William-street with him.</p>

            . I live at Blessley's. I saw Pichutt there on the 22nd of November; he came to read to a lunatic - she was not in a fit state, and he came into the room I was sitting in - I left the room a quarter before nine o'clock; he was there then - I saw him first about five minutes past eight; he was then in the lunatic's room - I had never seen him before, and remarked what a sedate, good sort of a man he appeared.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CARPENTER. I am in the employ of Mr. Robins, an auctioneer - he bought the house No. 25, Chester-terrace. I gave Pichott notice to quit, and on the day he left I went and ordered him to quit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did the notice expire? A. He was merely there on sufferance; he quitted the day he was apprehended - I went there to see that he left; while the cart was at the door they came and seized the things.</p>

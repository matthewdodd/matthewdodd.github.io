                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Whitbread, and live at Soutball-green. On the 20th of March I went out, at twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, to take my husband's breakfast to him, where he worked—I locked the door, and took the key with me—there are only two rooms to the house, one up stairs and one down, and there is no back door—the window was fastened and nailed—I returned at nine and found the door open, and the staple drawn—I went up stairs, and dress and cape were gone from my box—the prisoner is my husbond's uncle—these are the things—I know them by the lining being joined all round the bottom.</p>

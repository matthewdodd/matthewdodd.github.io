On the 4th of January I saw the prisoner take from his desk a quantity of indigo, and put it into his hat; he covered it over with a cloth or handkerchief; he put his hat on his head, and proceeded to go down stairs; as he was going out I stopped him, searched him, and found the indigo in his hat.</p>

            . I am an assistant-elder in that warehouse in Cutler-street. When the prisoner had leave to go out he came down to be rubbed down in the accompting-house, one of the labourers followed him down, and said he had property about him; I said, I hope it is not true; the prisoner said, it is too true, he had got it in his hat. I took it out of his hat, there was two pounds, it is worth three shillings and sixpence a pound. There are some thousands of indigo in that warehouse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

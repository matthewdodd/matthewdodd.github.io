                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich—I am a mason, and a contractor for the Board of Ordnance. I have known the prisoner eight years—he bore a very honest character—I never was in his shed—he is employed to make and sharpen tools there—he has sharpened picks, and axes, and other tools for me—he is in the habit of making tools of other persons.</p>

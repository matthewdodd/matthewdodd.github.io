                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Cranbourne Tavern, in Great Newport-street—On Saturday, 24th of last month, I saw the prisoner in front of my bar with another female about 9 o'clock—the prisoner asked for some gin, and paid for it in coppers; they stopped there half-an-hour—the prisoner asked for some gin afterwards and put a shilling on the counter—I was about to serve her—I saw the shilling—I could not discern whether it was good or bad, and she swept it off the counter in the direction where she was standing on to the floor—I am quite sure it was the prisoner did that—after that she said to the other woman, "See what you have done, you have knocked the shilling out of my hand"—I said, "Never mind, we will look for the shilling"—she then went out and the other woman followed her—I saw the shilling picked up in the place where she had swept it off—it was given to we; it was a bad one, and I put it by on a shelf; I afterwards gave it to</p>

               <p>the constable—I next saw the prisoner about two hours or two hours and a-half afterwards, she was alone then, she came in and asked for a quartern of rum in a bottle, and after it was put into the bottle and offered to her she said, "I don't want rum, I want gin;" my wife was serving her—she said to the prisoner, "Mind, don't give me any more bad money"—she also said, "You left a bad shilling in the box before to night"—she then threw another shilling down, it was a very bad one—I took it up, called a constable, and gave her in charge—I gave the two shillings to the constable—I am sure that the shilling given to the constable was the last shilling that was uttered; I never lost sight of it—the other was lying on the shelf all the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Is it likely that if I went into the prosecutor's and swept the shilling off that I should not have stopped to pick it ip! I certainly was convicted before, but since then I have been getting an honest living. I met my husbatfd that day, who has been living away from me, and he gave me a half-crown. I paid away a shilling. I got my tea with sixpence, and I went into the public-house with the other shilling and had a quartern of gin. It is not likely if I had dropped it I should hare left it there and not picked it up.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110019"></xptr>Morley. A window facing the water.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked it what time did you leave it?</p>
               <p>Morley. About seven or eight o'clock; I found it broke open fronting the water; the boards of the side of the warehouse were broke, the front of the warehouse next the water was wood.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they broke?</p>


               <p>Morley. There was a hole made; there were two or three boards broke, a man might get, in at the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know particularly what you lost?</p>
               <p>Morley. I do not know what was in the trunk, or box, there was a truss cut open; I was the first that went in in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose wharf adjoins?</p>
               <p>Morley. There is a dock between the King's brewhouse, and our yard on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. What on the other side?</p>
               <p>Morley. A little bit of a wharf where they land wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no fence?</p>
               <p>Morley. The warehouse parts our wharf, and the other wharf.</p>
               <p>Court. Can they get into this warehouse without going through your great gates, and under the shed to it?</p>

            . I met with Castle (on Thursday last was se'nnight, at five in the afternoon ) at a public house by Newgate-street. I saw him in company with one Isaac's; I called for a pennyworth of beer, and sat down; he asked how I did; I said he had got the advantage of me; he asked me if I did not remember his coming along with Isaacs: he told me he had got some things to dispose of; this Isaacs was a Jew that used to deal with him. He said he had two swords to dispose of; I asked him where I could see them; he said, he would either bring them, or I should go and see them, immediately. I went with him to the sign of the Dolphin; a lad fetched the swords.</p>
               <p>Q. He bid him do it?</p>
               <p>Bureau. Yes. He asked me what they were worth; I said, I did not know; I asked him what he would have for them; he said, six guineas. I told him I could not tell the value of them, and asked him if he had nothing else. He said he had got some lace to dispose of; I asked what lace it was; he said, some lace from off regimenta l cloaths; he did not produce it. I asked what became of the cloaths; Glover said they were thrown over-board. I told them both to meet me in the evening and bring the things, and that I would deal with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110020"></xptr> them. Nothing was produced then, but these two swords.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Bureau. A tobacconist. Glover said he was going up the river (he is a bargeman) and he could not meet me, he said, that evening, but would the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they meet you the next day?</p>
               <p>Bureau. No. I saw Castle on Saturday afternoon, about five o'clock; I asked him why he did not come; he said he could not that time. Another man followed me, and asked me to buy the swords; he said they were his; I said I would not deal with him, I would deal with Castle.

            's men. I took these goods, at the sign of the Dolphin, in Darkhouse-lane, I had a search warrant from Alderman Wilkes. The Dolphin is a public house; we took the prisoners there. I found these two swords, and the things that are here; a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a shirt tied up in a bundle, behind a butt, in the cellar: this was the place where the swords were shewed. (The things produced) There were the two prisoners in the house, when I searched, the two Mr. Bond's, and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the swords in the wrapper?</p>
               <p>Heley. They lay under a bed, in the two pair of stairs room. The landlord said, What you are searching for is under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up any body besides the two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Heley. Yes; there were two or three more. Before we searched the house, we secured the two, and made the rest sit down to take care of them, while we searched. (the swords produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. How many shirts are yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two waistcoats are mine, and two shirts; I know them, they are marked: the wrapper is mine, and the paper snuff-box, is mine.</p>

               <p>- Phillips. I was at the Dolphin alehouse when it was searched: I am a constable; I took the prisoners, and search'd him first. I found in Castle's pocket this button; No. 7, upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Does that button belong to you?</p>
               <p>Hays. Our regiment has that number on the buttons.</p>
               <p>Phillips. I found these two pocket pieces in his waistcoat pocket ( produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to find the snuffbox?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I thought it was a tobacco-box; I did not take notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Heley. Out of which pocket did you take the box?</p>
               <p>Heley. Out of his coat pocket (the box deposed to by Mr. Hays.)</p>

               <p>I Was at work late on Thursday night, I had been down to Deptford with a fare; and rowing up, a man called, Sculler; I came to him, and he put these things in the boat; he asked me where he could lie that night; I told him in Dark-house lane; knowing there was a night house there; he asked me if I would buy these things of him: he told me if I could get any body to take them he would make it worth my while to meet him at ten o'clock. The Jew came, and said he would give me fifteen shillings for them, and break the blades off immediately; then Bureau bid me meet him at his house the next morning; I did not go then, he came to me; and I said there is the man that owns them; he will not take less than three guineas for them; then he said he had some lace that I should dispose of for him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bureau. Did you offer him fifteen shillings for these swords?</p>
               <p>Bureau. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would break the blades off?</p>
               <p>Bureau. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that that asked you to buy the swords?</p>
               <p>Bureau. A sort of a waterman.</p>

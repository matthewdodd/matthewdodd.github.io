                  </hi>. I live in Elbow-place, Howard's-green, City-road. I have known the prisoner about two years-for the last eighteen months he has been in the habit of playing with my children—I missed a watch and two rings on the 2nd of January—I have since had a watch and two rings shown to me, but I cannot swear they are mine—I produce the watch.</p>

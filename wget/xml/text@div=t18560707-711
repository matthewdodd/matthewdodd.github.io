                  </hi>. I live at No. 27, Ray-street, Clerkenwell, and am landlord of that house. The prisoner and the deceased were lodgers of mine, they lodged in the attic—I have not very often seen the deceased—she was of very drunken habits, her manner was sometimes abusive and sometimes not—I was not in the house myself at the time the injuries were inflicted—I saw her the next morning—I did not see the wound—she seemed lively—after 17th June I gave them notice to leave—I told Connell he should not remain in the house at all, on account of his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and landlady of the house. The prisoner and his wife lodged there—she was very much given to drink indeed, and particularly the last twelve months—I heard that she was in the hospital—that was on Saturday as she died on Sunday—I saw her go out in the morning of 17th June—I did not see her come in—about 9 o'clock that morning I heard a noise like something falling—at that time I saw Tregurtha the carpenter go out of the house, and he had either his apron or a handkerchief up to his face—very shortly after the prisoner came down; he had a man's hat and a stick with him—he told me he had found Tregurtha in the room—(the carpenter I believe he said—I do not think he knew his name)—he said he had found the carpenter in his room in a very improper way with his wife, and he had given him a good beating; he then went out—I do not think I saw Mrs. Conncell again, that day—on the day after I saw her in the street—I did not see any wound about her—she was so much given to drink I did not want to speak to her—I saw her a week afterwards—I did not see any wound upon her at that time—I did not see her alive again after that Wednesday week, which was the 25th—the prisoner was as respectable, quiet, steady a man as I would wish to have in the house—on the Sunday that she died I under<lb></lb>stood him to say that he threw a flower pot at them as they were going out of the room together—the deceased did not make any complaint to me about being injured—Tregurtha had been in the habit of coming to that house to do work for these nine years—he had no right to go up into the lodger's room to do repairs without my leave, but I had seen him come down on two occasions when he had received no orders from me—I did not ask him what his business was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 7, St. Peter's-terrace, Little Saffron-hill. I knew the deceased for some years—I have been in the habit of doing repairs in the house No. 27, Ray-street, often by orders of the landlord, at the request of the lodgers, if anything was wanting to be done—I bad orders to do it by the landlady, Mrs. Coxhead—on the morning of 17th June the deceased beckoned to me to come up stairs—the room at the top is the room in which she and her husband lived—she came to the street door, and let me in, and said she wanted her door repaired—I went to the top of the house with her, and the panels of the door had been at some time forced in from the outside—she went up to the room with me, and she said she was tired with going up stairs—I was standing just against the woman—she was sitting on the bed—I had not my basket of tools with me; I had left my home to go to Kingsland-road—I was standing just alongside of the woman, and just after I was there, about a minute and a</p>

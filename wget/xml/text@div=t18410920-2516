                  </hi>. I am a free waterman. On the 5th of August I rowed for a prize skiff in the Thames, off the Custom House—my colour was pink—in the fifth heat I and Radford were [about to row against each other—I know the defendants—they were all in a cutter, of which Henry James was acting as coxswain—he was in the head—whilst pre<lb></lb>paring to row in the last heat, I heard Henry James say, "So help you G—, so help me J—C—, if young Hipkins can win the boat, he shall not win her"—at the time he said that, all the other defendants were in the same boat with him—he spoke loud enough for them to hear—I was about a yard off at the time, or more—it was loud enough for me to hear—George James said, "You young b—, you shall have a swim for it"—he said that loud enough for the others to hear—in consequence of that I would not row, and spoke to Broughton the manager—I was afterwards induced to row, and Radford and I started—we made a false start, and were called back, as we started without the manager—we started a second time—we rowed scull to scull all the way as far as the tier, which we had to go round, and then Radford came alongside of me, put his scull against my back, and went right ahead of me—I followed him as far as Horsley-down New Stairs—I caught him there, touched him on the outside quarter, and turned him round—that was fair—I then pulled about three strokes, and got just clear of his boat, just ahead of him, when James's cutter came alongside of me, and Henry James laid hold of my boat—I asked him what he meant by laying hold of my boat—he gave me no answer—before that I heard Henry James say, "Give way," which means for the rowers to pull—he said that just as I turned Radford round—he came up along-side, laid hold of my boat just abaft the rowlock, in which the oar is, and upset my boat—my feet were in the stretcher straps—when I saw the boat going over, I got my feet out of the straps—I was thrown into the water, underneath my boat—Henry James put his arm down, laid hold of me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184109200140"></xptr>
               <p>and hauled me over my wager-boat into his cutter, and I was taken ashore—I cannot swim—I was taken to George's Stairs, and into the George public-house—I know it was Henry James that pulled me out of the water—he was in the cutter's head—I was very bad when they got me into the boat, and said, "Pray take me home, take me home"—I was alarmed—I was confined to my bed seven days, from being in the water, and being in the heat in which I was—a doctor was sent for directly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Repeat that. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "So help you G—, so help you J—C—, if you can win the boat, you shall not"—he said that publicly, in the presence of all the people there—he was in the cutter at the time—I cannot say how many heard him—we were in the middle of the river—he was in the cutter's head, and the other men were just rowing by the manager's cutter when the words were said—he was lying down in the cutter's head—the cutter was a four-oared boat—the seven defendants were in her, one forward on the look-out, one sitting down, the man steering, and four rowing—the one sitting down (Morris) was about the middle of the boat—before I started I was not cautioned by any of the defendants, or by any body, not to foul—nothing of the kind was said—I was not told that if I fouled again I should not have the boat, even if I won her—I swear that—nor any thing of the sort that I could hear—they had not charged me with fouling before I started the last time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear it was fair for you to touch Radford's boat on the outside quarter, and turn him round? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In waterman's wagers—this was a waterman's wager—in a waterman's wager we may foul or sink them if we like.</p>

               <p>men then started—they started at first without the manager's sanction—the manager ought to have started them, but did not, and he called them back—I was in a boat waiting on Hipkins—when they started the second time, they rowed till they got to the tier—they were as nearly level as could be then—then they got entangled together till they got round in shore—they could not get clear of one another, and Radford put his scull against Hipkins's back to get off, that was in a fair wager manner, and he then got the lead—I saw Hipkins overtake him at Horsleydown New-stairs—he touched him on the outside of his stern, and turned him round—Hipkins was then just clearing Radford's boat, but had not time to get a-head of him—Henry James was behind them in a cutter waiting on Radford—I heard Henry James say, "Give way"—the men in his boat then pulled up to Hipkins's rowlock, and I saw Henry James lift up Hipkins's boat with his hands, and turn her bottom upwards—Hipkins went into the water—he went under the water, and I saw Henry James, as soon as ever he could do it, lay hold of his wrist, and drag him over his own wager-boat into James's cutter's head, and they rowed ashore with him—I should say the water was a dozen feet deep there—I did not row ashore—I saw Hipkins about an hour or an hour and a half after it happened, at home in bed, and he was ill at home seven days, from the 5th till the 11th—George James, Thomas King, Rivitt, and Cook were rowing the cutter—Morris was a sitter with a Dogget's coat and badge—he was doing nothing—Legon was steering.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>boat was capsised, not a hundred—there were some hundreds on the wharfs who could see what happened—I saw Hipkins foul Radford just before the accident—he ran into Radford's starboard side—I do not know whether he went light on the canvas—his boat's stern touched Radford's hind quarters—he ran into his gunwale—not so much as five or six feet—the wager-boat was about twenty-five feet long—it was the usual size, it was very light—the canvas was drawn over as far as the fore-rowlock—that is done to prevent the water coming in—the cutter was a great deal longer than the wager-boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after Hipkins fouled Radford, did Hipkins' boat cap-size? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about three minutes, or from that to four—I will swear it was more than one, and more than two—James's boat came up before mine—I was about a yard from James's boat—Hipkins's boat was not a-head of Radford's when it capsized, he was about clearing his boat's stern, and then Henry James said, "Give way," the men pulled, and the boat capsized—I will swear Henry James said, "Give way," be<lb></lb>fore Hipkins was in the water.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I was at this race, in a galley, lying between two tiers—I saw Hipkins and Radford rowing up the eddy—Radford was ahead—Hipkins caught him on the quarter, and turned him out athwart the tide—I was in a cutter looking on, and Radford's boat's head came into our cutter, which stop<lb></lb>ped it, and the instant she touched our cutter Hipkins's boat turned over, with Hipkins underneath—I then heard James say, "Give way," and he rowed up, and took Hipkins out—I am certain Hipkins was in the water before James said, "Give way"—before the boat capsized James was not near enough to touch him—if it had not been for the cutter coming up the man must have been drowned, nobody could have got near him.</p>

I was on a barge, looking at the race, and about forty yards above the boats that were rowing—they were going against the tide; and from the situation I was in I could not see whether Hipkins was on the inner or outer side, but it struck me his nose was on the inner side—I saw him cross above the stern of Radford's boat, and following him up in the same position, he turned Radford across the tide, still following him in the same position, and turned him completely round—I then lost Radford, and saw Hipkins sit-ting in his boat, and completely turn over, and no other boat near him at the time—the accident occurred in the course, I may say, of less than a minute—the exclamation I made was, "Good Heavens! the man is in the water, who will save him?" and within half a minute I saw some boat, which was a larger one, come up close to the boat, and then all the other boats closed round—I did not see the man got out—at the time Hipkins's boat capsized that larger boat was not near enough to interfere with the other—I could not see it.</p>

I was steering a four-oared cutter near the boats at the Regatta—I was right off the place where the collision took place, lying with-in the tier, perhaps fifty or sixty yards off—I could see the rowing of the boats—they were inside us—we were lying on our oars, waiting for their com<lb></lb>ing up—they came up while we were lying there—Radford's boat was inner-most, if there was any difference, and Hipkins's was out just on his quarter—Radford's boat was first—I saw Hipkins touch Radford on the top of the stern, and he, being just at the offset of the tide, it carried his boat round—Radford's boat's head came against our gunwale, and by that sudden stoppage Hipkins's boat ran on to Radford's—I think Hipkins slid, or attempted to get up—the boat turned over against the tide, and Hipkins fell over on the larboard side into the water—the tide was going down—it turned over towards London-bridge, against the tide—the boat was athwart the tide—at the time Hipkins's boat tipped over there was no boat close to them—James's cutter was some little distance astern, to the best of my knowledge, five or six yards, it may be a yard more or less—while the boats hung over each other's quarter they were going down the tide—I saw the cutter come up after the accident—from Radford's boat being stopped so suddenly, and Hipkins striving to back water with his right hand, it caused the boat to trip the contrary way, and he slid—he was in the act of getting up—he went out on the larboard side, and went over against the tide—Hipkins was trying to get ahead of Radford, and to get the head of his boat as it was before—I saw James pick Hipkins up after the boat upset—I am positive the cutter came up after the accident.</p>

I know all the defendants—I had seen four heats before this—Hipkins fouled shamefully—he belongs to Horsley<lb></lb>down Old-stairs—he fouled Luton in the first race, just above Horsley<lb></lb>down Old-stairs, going round the tier—he made himself and Luton lose the race, and let Wheeler come in—Wheeler belongs to George's-stairs—I was lying fifty or sixty yards from the boats when Hipkins went over—our boat did not move at all—we were lying on our oars—our head was towards the bridge—I cannot say whether our oars were in the water—they are four-teen or fifteen feet long—I was at the helm, standing up—I noticed James's cutter five, six, or seven yards behind, it might be a yard more or less—they were rowing—it did not stop at all, till they came and picked the man up—I knew they were waiting on Radford—I should say the cutter rowed up half a minute at the utmost after Hipkins was in the water</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was present at the Regatta—I was up stairs in a granary, considerably above the water, and about forty yards from where the boat capsized—I could see a long way—I saw both boats coming close to the edge of the water—Radford's boat bore a little out towards the middle of the water with its head—Hipkins's boat came and caught the nose against the stern of Radford's boat, which directly twisted round, and then Hipkins's hung on the stern of Radford's—it kept so till it had nearly done turning round—the man shifted a little in the boat—I think that caused it to capsize, and he fell into the water—I saw the galley come up in about a minute, and pick him up—at the time Hip<lb></lb>kins fell into the water, and his boat was upset, the cutter was not near enough to interfere with him in any way—I am positive it did not come up till after the accident—there was no third boat up till after the accident, and that was the boat that picked Hipkins up.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you astern of the boats, or ahead of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ahead of them—there were several barges between me and them, but I was up high, in Mr. Coventry's granary—several boats were rowing after them—I do not think there were a dozen, because they were by the side of the water, making room—I saw Radford's boat go towards a cutter, but whether it struck I cannot say, but I think it must have touched—it might have been stopped by it—I cannot say whether it touched the cutter or not—the galley that rowed up and took up the man was about a yard or two from the boat—the boat laid pretty well across the river when he was got out—if the man had staid steadily in his boat I do not think it would have happened—the cutter was a considerable bit from the boat when it got hooked on the stern of the other.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you manager in this case on one side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On both sides—after the first start, the men were brought back to start again—Henry James was irritated, because the men were called back, Radford being a little in advance of Hipkins; and he said if Radford could not beat Hipkins, he should not have the boat—he did not mention any person's name—he nodded his bead towards Hipkins, and I believe he said, "So help roe, Jesus"—Hipkins did not speak to me in consequence of that—I asked James for an explanation—he said he meant nothing by the words he had expressed, after the time he had spoken them—he did not mean any further meaning to them—I did not hear what George James said, nor what King said—I belong to George's-stairs—I have the terms on which the race was to be run—they have each of the men's signatures to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer at Pimlico. About 1 o'clock or half past 1 in the morning of 15th May, I drove up with a friend to the Alfred's Head public house, at the corner of the London Road—I went in the house, I saw Turner there—she spoke to me and asked me to stand something, which I declined—I called for two glasses of brandy and water—I drank one and took one out to my friend in the dog cart—I apprehend I was followed by Turner, but I did not see her follow me, but while my friend was drinking, I found Turner's arm round my neck, and with her right hand she got hold of my breast pin in my stock—I said, "Let go my pin," and I pushed her away from me—I was immediately knocked down from behind—I had not seen any one else near me in particular—they were just clearing the house out—I attempted to get up three or four times, but was knocked down again—after rising, I missed my watch—I observed the</p>

I live at No. 39, Princes Street—I have charge of a fire escape at the corner of the London Road—I was on duty about 1 o'clock on the morning of 15th May—I saw the prosecutor in front of the public house, standing by the chaise cart—Turner had her arm round his neck, and several other girls were making a disturbance—they were talking about fighting—I saw Driscoll strike Mr. Thane and knock him down—I saw her strike him twice.</p>

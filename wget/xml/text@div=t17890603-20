               <p>Did you see the prisoner take them? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the property in his possession? - On the Sunday following, I saw the prisoner with the stockings on his legs, and Mr. Palmer had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Who took the stockings off the prisoner's legs? - Mr. Palmer.</p>
               <p>Did he give them to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know them to be his? - They were marked with his name, but the mark is picked out.</p>
               <p>How do you know them then? - By the footing, I footed them myself; I left the house about two, and on my return I found the window nearest the door open, the window was shut down.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him in the house about that time? - No.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had missed his duty, and I was desired by Palmer to bring the prisoner to his house, on the 27th of April, the Sunday after the things were missed; when I brought him there, I asked him why he missed his duty; and he said Duckworth had told Palmer of the affair, and that made him afraid to return back.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He said they were not his stockings; I did not see them taken off, they were taken off next day.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Palmer deny the property to be his, when Mrs. Banks said she thought they were Palmer's? - He did not say positively either way, but that he had such a pair that his brother gave him.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about the stockings? - He said I knew his brother had given him a pair like them, and I did; but when his shoe was taken off, I knew them by the foot being drawn, and I could not wear them without gayters.</p>

               <p>To Palmer. How came you to suspect the prisoner? - From what I heard Walker say.</p>

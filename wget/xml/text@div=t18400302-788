                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Dooley, and live in Golden-lane. On the night of the 1st of February I went to a butcher's shop in White cross-street and bought a leg of mutton, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I changed a sovereign, and got 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I put the money into my purse, and put it into my pocket—I then went to a green-stall—the prisoners were standing there, close by my side—I purchased a bundle of turnips there and paid 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I had in my pocket—I took the 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket—the purse and money were in my pocket then—I then bought some parsnips, and when I came to pay for them I missed my purse—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020009"></xptr>
               <p>and took him into custody—the prosecutor had given me a description of "My G—d, I am robbed of my purse and money"—the prisoners ran away directly I said so—I went down to Whitecross-street, but could not see them—I afterwards returned to the green-stall, and requested the green-grocer's wife to go along with me—I afterwards saw the prisoners in Whitecross-street, and they were taken into custody by an officer—it was a long silk purse that I lost—it contained four halt-crowns, and five shillings.</p>

Morris, a friend of mine, was along with me—during the half-hour I went away, I did my best to find them—I did not go to the butcher's shop then, I did afterwards—the policeman took me there to see whether they had given me the money or not—there were not many people about that night—it was Saturday night, and about half-past ten o'clock—I did not accuse any body else of having taken my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Teagle, of No. 4, Turk's Head-court, Golden-lane. We keep a green-stall—on Saturday night the 1st of February, between ten and eleven o'clock, Mrs. Dooley bought a bundle of turnips of us—she paid my husband 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she took the money from her right-hand pocket—when she paid for them she asked for some parsnips—at the time she was bargaining for them she kept her gown up in her left-hand—I saw the two prisoners—Norris was bargaining with my husband for some broccoli sprouts—Nathan stood next to Mrs. Dooley, and Norris next—I saw Nathan's hands in the prosecutrix's pocket, and when she went to pay for the parsnips she exclaimed, "Good G—d! I am robbed"—the prisoners went away directly without purchasing the brocoli sprouts—I did not go with Mrs. Dooley the first time—she went by herself first—she came back and insisted on my going with her, which I did—we went to the bottom of Whitecross-street, and as we came back again we saw the two prisoners behind two women—I pointed them out to the officer—Nathan said, "See, I am <hi rend="italic">done,</hi>" and Norris said" Good G—d! my child."</p>

Teagle gave me some information, in consequence of which I went with her and Dooley into Whitecross-street—when we got into Play-house-yard Mrs. Dooley pointed out the two prisoners to me, both together—I went up to them, and seized them both by the arms—I had said nothing at that moment—Nathan said, "We are <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> see"—Norris said, "Oh my child!"—I then told them what they were charged with, and they denied it—Norris had a basket with her, containing various small articles of grocery.</p>

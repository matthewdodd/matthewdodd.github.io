                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Constable, Great Eastern Railway</hi>). About 2.45 on the morning of 10th February I was near Angel Lane Bridge—I heard footsteps coming very close to the bordered fences on the road outside—I got on the fence and saw two men with some bundles on their arms—the prisoner was one of them—I spoke to the yard foreman, Cracknell, and then went and stopped the prisoner—they pitched the bundles at my feet, and ran in different directions—I pursued the other man, but he escaped—Cracknell stopped the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of Stratford yard—I saw the prisoner running up Angel Lane, towards Stratford New Town—I stopped about 200 yards from a truck of drapery in the yard—I afterwards found some bundles about 150 yards from where I stopped him—he dropped the inside of this lantern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was warm.</p>

               <p>truck No. 43, loaded with drapery—I returned to where the prisoner was and told him he must go to the station with me, for being concerned with another in stealing some drapery from a truck—he made no reply—I then went back to the yard, and examined truck 3640—it was a Brentwood truck—I found the string of the tarpaulin covering had been cut near the wall—I also found a large bale of goods had been cut open, and to all appearance robbed—the trunk contained goods of the same description as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some jeannette and some alpaca—when I first saw the prisoner he was without a hat—I asked him where it was, he said he had lost it in the road—afterwards Constable Eastliffe brought me a hat, and the prisoner said it was his.</p>

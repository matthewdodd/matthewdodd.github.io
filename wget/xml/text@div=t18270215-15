I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were all safe in the drawers the day before; I then went in search of the prisoner - I found him at the bottom of Lamb's-place, Castle-lane - I accused him of taking them; he said he knew nothing about it - he lives in Crane-court, Castle-lane, not a hundred yards from us; I followed him to the top of the lane, and then gave him in charge; he was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found upon him - as we were going to the watch-house I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and give something to a boy named Stirrup, but I do not know what it was.</p>

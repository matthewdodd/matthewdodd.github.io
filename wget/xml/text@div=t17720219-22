I said, I would give them my money, but I was not willing to part with my watch. The prisoner said, if I did not give both, he would shoot me dead, or blow my brains out, or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Haysom. A moon-light night. The prisoner stood by my side at my horse's head; Collins was behind me, and Tudor was on my left side. I gave them two guineas, I believe, and a half guinea, and 6 or 8 s. in silver. The prisoner felt up my thigh for my watch; he could not easily get it out; he said if I did not pull it out myself, he would instantly blow my brains out. I am a messenger; I was going to Mr. Stevens at the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know their names?</p>
               <p>Haysom. Collins turned evidence. I have never seen my watch or money since. After I had delivered my watch and money, Collins said, D - n him, blow his brains out. The prisoner said, D - n you, what would you have? he has behaved like a gentleman, and delivered up his all; you shan't hurt him; and gave me a shilling to pay the turnpike. I refused the money at first, but afterwards I thought it was most prudent to take it.</p>

               <p>Haysom. No; I only said, I believed him to be the man; I never swore positive to him before, but I am sure he is the man; I should have been glad to have made him an evidence; for I had no intent to hurt him, because I believe he saved my life.</p>

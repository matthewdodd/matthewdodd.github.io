                  </hi>. I keep the Montpelier Tavern, Walworth—on 17th January, I believe, both the prisoners came to my house about 7 o'clock at night—Hill I can swear to, and I believe Jones to be the person who was with him—they went into the tap room, where there is a bagatelle board, and remained there till closing time, playing—there were other persons there—have another bagatelle room—they then came and stood at the bar—five or six young gentlemen were playing in the parlour, and after they had left, about five minutes past 12, Hill walked back as if to go to the water-closet—heard the parlour door slam, which is close to the water-closet—spoke to my potman, and said there was some one in the parlour—he said, "No there is not, for I have just turned the gas out"—he went to look, and when he came back, the door slammed again—he took a light, and met Hill coming from there—saw him—cannot say whether he came out of the parlour—he came back to the bar, and was the last person that went out—next morning I missed some balls—missed them before anybody had come to the house that morning.</p>

I am potman to Mr. Steptoe—on the evening of 17th January, I saw both the prisoners at our house—I saw them playing at bagatelle in the tap room—there is a parlour at the back of the house, where there is another bagatelle board—I went into that room about 10 minutes past 12—the balls were all safe then—I was the last person in the parlour, and put out the gas—about five minutes after I heard the parlour door slam—my master sent me to see who was there; in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I opened the door, and looked all round the room, but could see nobody—directly afterwards I heard the door slam again—I went and took two lucifers from the bar to light the gas, and I met Hill coming out—I said, "Hallo"—he said, "All right, I have only been to the closet"—he was then buttoning up part of his trowsers—he came from the direc<lb></lb>tion of the bagatelle room, where the balls were—the next morning the balls were missing.</p>

I took a coach at Whitechapel, and went to the Bank, and got small notes for the large notes and afterwards went to the Yorkshire Grey, in Whitechapel. I lodge at 38, Church-row, Commercial-road. I asked the coachman his fare. He said, six shillings. I went into the Yorkshire Grey, to get change. I had fifty pounds in notes left. I took a one-pound note out of the pocket-book. I paid the coachman, and paid for a glass of rum and water at the bar. There was a man came up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010037"></xptr> stood, with a whip, across the passage.

               <p>Q. Have you ever found the pocket-book, or any part of the property since - A. No.</p>

Where did you find the axe? -Under the prisoner's clothes, on the ground, immediately as I missed it almost, within five minutes or less; I did not see her take it, but she sat close to where I used it; the people were gone for chips to the other shop, and I hallooed out to my shopmates, and said I have lost another axe, and I went and found this axe under the prisoner's clothes, forty yards distant from where I left it; when I found it under her clothes I sent for the constable, and took her up, the axe is here, the officer has got it.</p>

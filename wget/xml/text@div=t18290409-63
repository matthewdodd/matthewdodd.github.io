            ; he is afflicted with paralytic. On the 25th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was going along the road leading to Hampstead, where I live; I had a bundle with me, which contained this property - there are no houses in that part of the road, but fields; the prisoner passed me, met another lad, and said, "Have you seen my brother?" he said No; he went on towards London - the prisoner passed me back again, and called twice, "Bill;" he then turned round, and I came nearly opposite to him - he snatched my bundle, and ran away; he never spoke; I turned round, and cried Stop thief! he was taken about a hundred yards from me - I believe some gentleman picked up my bundle; I am certain the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090035"></xptr>soner is the lad - I have always expressed the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever say he was not the lad? - A. No; he was not liberated to my knowledge - I said he might be liberated, but the gentleman said we had better lock him up; I never said I did not think he was the <rs id="t18290409-63-deflabel377" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner was taken within a hundred yards? - A. Yes; and the moment I saw him, I said,"That is the boy;" I have never said I did think he was the boy - I have always been of opinion that he was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it is true that the boy was let go twice? - A. He was; I did not know these other boys - it was so dark, that unless there was something very white about a person, you could not see them - if the bundle had not been white, I do not think I should have seen it; I believe the witness went to the watch-house, but I am not positive - she was certainly present when the boy was liberated once; it was so dark, that I should not be surprised at a person not knowing any one they had not seen before - I did not see the bundle dropped; the other boys passed in the same direction.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you go up to the spot when he was taken? - A. I met the gentleman with him - the spot where the bundle was taken was a lighter part than the rest of the road; it was close to a lamp - Mr. Paxton has the property, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, was that boy liberated or not? - A. There were so many round, that I do not know positively whether he was or was not - I did not see it.</p>

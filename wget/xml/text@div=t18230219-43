            . I am an officer. On the 8th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner between the Three Tuns, and the Bell, Aldgate, with a truss on his back. I looked after him to see where he was going - he crossed the road, I followed him, and when he got near Jewry-street, I stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going with that?" He said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is directed, where are you going to take it?" He said, he did not know, nor where he brought it from. I took him, he said he was a seafaring man, and knew a great many smugglers, and met them in Whitechapel; and they said they had some tea and coffee to get rid of, that he was waiting to take it, and that they gave him the truss. I found it contained calico, and the invoice in it led me to the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two men whom I knew to be smugglers, they said they had some tea if I could find a customer for it; I said, I dare say I could, and they gave it me.</p>

            . I live in Little Ebury-street. Chelsea. I have known the prisoner these six months - on the 30th of September I was working at Mr. Davies' premises, in the <placeName id="t18311020-220-crimeloc1177">Five-fields, Chelsea</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How do you know it? A.I have no private mark on it - I bought it from the manufacturer, whose name is on it; I have used it about two years - I do not recollect that I have said, I knew it in no other way but by the maker's name; I have no recollection of saying so to Mr. Fletcher - I know Mr. Fletcher; he is a bricklayer - I did not leave him behing me at work; I left work about half-past five o'clock, as soon as it got dusk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? No; he had a fustian jacket on - I noticed his face, and pointed him out at Queen-square.</p>

            . I worked at the same buildings. I remember Johnson leaving his work - the prisoner was with me the best part of the day, from three till about seven o'clock; we left the buildings a little before five, went to the Orange Tree coffee-house, and had two pints of porter in the gardens - we then went to the King's-mews, in Pimlico; from there I went to my residence, No. 3, Eccleston-place - the prisoner went with me; Johnson had left at three o'clock for a short time - I did not see the prisoner take any saw; there are three houses - three plasterers and one bricklayer were at work there - some of them wore fustian jackets.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any body have taken it without your seeing it? A. Yes, but I do not think the prisoner was in the house where it was, from three till five o'clock.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner fourteen years - he is a truly honest character; I was at the Session's-house, and heard Johnson say he could not swear to the saw, except by the maker's name; he had no private mark on it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JOHNSON re-examined. Q. Where had you your conversation with the prisoner? A. In the back parlour of the house where the saw was; Fletcher was not in that room, to my knowledge - I used the saw about half-past three o'clock, and did not see it afterwards; the prisoner was there after that.</p>

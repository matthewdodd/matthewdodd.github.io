                  </hi>I am the wife of William Frederick Robinson, and live at Walham-green, Fulham. On Monday the 25th of May, I left my house about five o'clock in the evening, and fastened it—I left nobody within—I fastened the parlour window with a bolt, and the glass was per<lb></lb>fect—I returned about nine o'clock—I found the parlour window broken open, the bolt had been forced, and the wire-blind forced out of its socket—a writing-desk had been removed, and the lock forced—the persons must</p>

                  </hi>I live in the adjoining cottage to the pro<lb></lb>secutrix. On the night in question, I was at my window about half-past fire o'clock—I saw a boy jump over Mr, Robinson's wall, and saw Wa<lb></lb>len with the boy—I had seen Walen come into my garden about half<lb></lb>an-hour before, but did not see the boy then—when I saw the boy jump over the wall, I watched at the window, and saw Walen enter the gate, and go down by the side of the house with a red book in his hand, as if he was examining the premises, or had come for orders, but having seen the boy jump over the wall, I thought it could not be so—he came back and examined the window, then returned, and came back again—he then with his shoulder or elbow broke a pane of glass, pushed the hasp back, opened the window, and put in the boy—I cannot say whether Jones is the boy—he walked out of the garden, closed the gate after him, and came to my gate—I came down from my bed-room window, and said, "I must give you in charge, '—he said, " What for? "—I said, " For breaking the win<lb></lb>dow, and putting a boy in"—he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 126, Eastfield-street, Limehouse—on the morning of 8th May, I was sitting peeling pota-toes with the prisoner and his son by a former wife—the prisoner asked him to read something out of the newspaper—he said that if he did read it, I would not explain the words to him—I said if I could see myself I could read it, without his reading of it—a few words then ensued between me and my husband, and he said if I said any more he would slap me in the face with a piece of bacon he had in his hand—I said that was more than he dared do—he then gave me a smack in the face with the back of his hand; it hit me on the ball of the eye, and I ran to the doctor's—I have not been able to see since.</p>

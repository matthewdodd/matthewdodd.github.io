I keep the Globe and Friends public-house, Moorgate-street, Commercial-road East—I was in my house on 10th January, when the prisoner came in and asked for two pennyworth of rum—my wife served him—I was standing by at the time, and could see and hear all that passed—the prisoner put down in payment, a florin—my wife said, "This is bad"—I said, "Let me look at it"—she handed it to me, and I said, "This is bad"—I was putting it in my mouth, and was going to bite it, when the prisoner said, "No, don't destroy it; I will pay you 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," or something to that effect—I bent it up with my teeth—before I put it in my month he said, "Give it me back, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and he threw the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down—a police constable happened to be at the bar at the time, talking to me on business, and I gave the prisoner into his custody, with the florin.</p>

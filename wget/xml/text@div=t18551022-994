                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 1st Sept., my atten<lb></lb>tion was called to the deceased, who was then in the reception ward at Lambeth workhouse—he was able to stand upright, and was conscious and rational, and able to reply to my questions—I found him tremulous, as if from a habit of hard drinking—he drew my attention to the condition of his chest—I found the fore part of it very much swollen, enlarged, and bruised, so that I could not feel the bones underneath—I had him put to bed in the sick ward—on 3rd Sept., I found symptoms of an abscess on the right side of the chest, which I opened, and there was a discharge of about a pint of very fetid matter—that appeared to relieve him—he appeared better the next day—on 6th Sept., he was much worse, and from that time till the 13th he continued declining—on the 13th, his state was one of imminent danger—I told him so at that time, and he said that he felt that he was sinking and could not recover—in consequence of that I directed a police Magistrate to be sent for, and the deceased made a statement to him in my presence—no longer time elapsed between my telling him he was in imminent danger, and his making the statement, than was necessary to send for the Magistrate—after that the deceased continued gradually to sink till the 20th, when he died—on the day after his death I made an examination of the body, and took some notes of it—the head was carefully shaved over the upper portion of the scalp—I found two contusions between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain—I uncovered the skull, which I found solid and unbroken—the membrane covering the brain was congested, and adhe<lb></lb>rent in its inner surface to a small spot at the upper part of the brain—the brain itself was slightly congested at the base of the skull—I examined the chest and found the large sinus of an abscess, extending from the right breast across the breast bone to the left breast about eight inches in length—it had penetrated into the hollow of the chest, and up to the throat back to the spine, and down into the belly—it had surrounded the surface of the lungs—it had partly got into the texture—the outer surface of the lungs were adherent to the inner walls of the chest—I found the fourth and fifth ribs broken on the right side, and the breast bone also—the external part of the chest was covered with dark discoloration, the result of contusions—there was a double fracture of the fourth rib, and a single fracture of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220157"></xptr>
               <p>fifth rib—I afterwards examined the stomach, and other ports of the body—the muscular substance of the heart was pale and flabby—the cause of death in my opinion was the inflammation, and formation of the large abscess and an un united fracture in the chest, the result of external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, what length of time had elapsed between the in<lb></lb>jury and the abscess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is, that for the formation of such a large abscess two or three weeks must have elapsed—it might, in a bad con<lb></lb>stitution, have occurred in ten or twelve day—he was in a state of mus<lb></lb>cular debility from hard drinking—I do not know that if a man continued drinking for days after receiving this injury, it would cause the abscess to form sooner than it otherwise would—I should rather have recommended the continuance of stimulants—my opinion is, that the injury was caused by blows—it might be by great pressure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrates at Lambeth Police Court. I was present at Lambeth workhouse when Thomas Dice made a statement—it was taken down by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said to the man as to the state in which he was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was told by the Magistrate that he must believe himself to be dying before anything could be taken down as evidence—the reply he made was, "I believe I am dying"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The dying declaration of Thomas Dice, taken on 13th Sept., 1855, before Isaac Onslow Secker, Esq., one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace in and for the County of Surrey; and the said Thomas Dice, before making this declaration, said he believed he was dying from the effects of the injuries he had received in this case: 'On Friday night, 23rd last month, at from half-past 11 to 12 o'clock, I was in my own house—I went to bed, and my son came into my room—I got up, and he said, "Now"—I took up a stout bottle, and broke a chimney glass with it—I did that because I would not throw it at my wife—I had been having words with my wife—his mother called him into the room—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, put the old rascal (meaning me) out," and he took hold of me, and gave me a bit of a pull and three or four punches on the head, and then knocked me on one side, and laid hold of my neck tie, and put his knee on my chest, and beat me about on the chest—I called, "Murder!"as loud as I could, and said, "Do, for God's sake, let me go!"and he said, "Yes, I will, as soon as I have beaten your chest as flat as these boards"—he struck me several times while I was down—that was on the night—I went to bed then—I heard him, at 4 o'clock the next morning, busying about the horses, and I went down, and said, "Don't take my pony away," and he said, "What do you think of it now?"and before I could get away he struck me on the chest again—I got a rattle to spring it, but before I could spring it he struck me on the chest several times—I said, "For God's sake, don't"—he then said, "Give me a rope, and I will hang the b—r," and</p>

               <p>then he went away to market—I bled from my right eye and nose—not from the chest—I was drunk on the Friday night in question—I was not drunk on the Saturday morning, but I got drunk during the day—I feel easier now than I did—I feel that I shall not recover from it—I believe I am going to die.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was a quarrelsome man—his demeanour, when he made this dying declaration, was such as ought to be the demeanour of a man who supposed himself dying—I believe he was a dealer in marine stores—I should think his age was about forty-five.</p>

                  </hi>. My father's name was Thomas Dice—he was about forty-five years of age—I recollect Friday night, 24th Aug.—my sister came and awoke me—when I awoke I heard my mother screaming—we dressed, and got down stairs—I went into the room where my father was—he had been drinking—he took out a stout bottle, and threw it—he was very violent—my brother was there—my father said, "What the b—y h—I do you want?"—my brother said, "Only for you to be quiet"—my father took the stout bottle, and threw it at him—it went through a looking glass—my brother then took him by the shoulders, and pushed him out of the room, and he slipped down the stairs—he slipped down on his back—I then went to bed, and heard nothing more till the next morning—about 4 o'clock next morning, just as we were going to market, my brother told me to go and get the horse—I went and got the horse, and my father struck my brother with the rattle—my brother got hold of it—he was struggling with him—they both fell down into the road—my mother came out, and she said, "Smash it"—my brother said, "I have smashed it"—I went off to market—my father got up, and went indoors—my father cried, "Murder!" when he was slipping down stain, and he did the next morning while he was in the road—my brother did not kneel on him—they both fell down together, struggling for the rattle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> I believe this rattle had been a cause of frequent annoyance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my father was in the habit of using it—my father went to market that morning—he came up to give my brother in charge for felony, for horse stealing, for stealing his pony—he called a policeman, and offered to give my brother in charge for horse stealing—the policeman asked him what his name was—he said, "Thomas Dice"—he asked him where he lived—he said, "In the same house I live in"—he walked to market—my brother got his things ready when he was just upon starting, and he got up and got back again—I do not know what time he went to market, but he was up there, and waiting—the market is about four miles distance.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Upon hearing an outcry I stopped Cuthbert and Cook, Cuthbert had a handkerchief full of things; amongst other things a pair of silk stockings and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130006"></xptr> a handkerchief, (they were produced in court, and Eyre deposed that the stockings were his master's, and the handkerchief his own property.)</p>
               <p>Cuthbert's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going to Brentford along with a waterman to see a cricket-match at Kew Green; coming back just by Walham Green, I had occasion to ease myself, going near some logs I saw this bundle lay; I desired this young man to help me to take the bundle up: East asked me where I got it; I told them, when they lifted it upon my back I could not carry it. Cook said we had better put it in different handkerchiefs, and carry it towards home. I live in Westminster; Fagan was going to the turnpike, I said they had better go on the right hand by the dead wall, that was the nearest way home, and we would keep the things till they were advertised. Jealous came up, the watchman laid hold of me first, and asked me, what I had got; I said a bundle I had found.</p>
               <p>Another of the prisoners, Jealous said, this man called out to him and Jennings to run after me. Does it stand to reason that this watchman, who could hardly run, could have stop'd me, if I had chose to make my escape.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Finsbury-place. I took this 10l. note from the prisoner (looking at it) - it was in November, I believe, but am not certain of the date - I know I took it from him; I knew him before, and there is my own hand-writing on it "J. M. K.," which are my initials, and here is what I believe to be"W. H. C." - I remember having this note from the prisoner; there is nothing on it in my writing but my own initials, the "W. H. C.," I know was on the note at the time I put my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you pay the note away? - A. I do not exactly recollect; I believe I paid it to Mr. Hedley, but cannot swear that; I knew the prisoner's name when he paid it, and observed the initials on the note at that time - I do not know his hand-writing; I believe these to be his initials.</p>
               <p>Q. A. man wrongfully passing off a note could not have led to his discovery sooner than by putting his own initials on it? A. I had no suspicion, and should not have hesitated at changing a 100l. note for him - he bore a good character ever since I have known him; I did not know where he lived at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you told him the charge you took him on, before you asked him any questions? A. No: the first question I asked him was, who he took the note of: he told me

            . I am the superintendent of the Jerusalem coffee-house, which is the place of resort for the captains of East India ships. I am well acquainted with nearly the whole of the captains of East India ships; I knew none named Sadler in October, November, or at any other time; if there had been such a captain it is not likely that I should not have known him, because I keep a regular register of every ship that goes to India, not only from England, but from every port.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the superintendent of a coffee-house? A. I act as clerk, keep an account of every body who comes there, and attend the captains; Arthur and Bell are the proprietors - I cannot swear there is no captain of that name, but it is very unlikely, because I generally know all the ships that go; I have not my books with me - there are about five hundred East India ships every season; captains die continually, and the first mates succeed them.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first thing he does. I suppose, is to come to the superintendent of this coffee-house, and give his name? A. Generally; I have not brought the list, because my memory is quite sufficent; it is considered pretty accurate, but no memory is infallible - I looked over the lists this morning; there are no other coffee-house to which East India captains resort - they go to Lloyd's, but it is neccessary to come to our house to get passengers; it is generally their custom to come - it is not compulsory; I print a list every month of ships going to India, from information from the captains and documents and letters which I receive.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Is it your business to keep a list of captains who arrive from and go to India? A. It is, I keep it as correct as possibly I can from my information - I also observe the captains frequenting the house; I never heard this name, either as a captain or otherwise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the captains of all the ships going to the East Indies come to your house, or only these of the East India Company? A. Not only the commanders, but also the three trading Companies - the captains of the free-traders come generally; there may be one or two exceptions, but there are very little more.</p>

            . I engrave the cheques for Sir William Curtis and Co. - (comparing the cheques with a margin in the book produced) I have seen this before; this cheque appears to me exactly to correspond with the line in the counterpart in the cheque-book - there is a cypher which we call the cheque; the cheque is cut nearly down the centre; the different parts of the cypher exactly tally - the two lines tally exactly; nothing can be more perfect - none of the remaining counterparts in this book will fit it - the cheque is exactly the same size as the book, and most decidedly that cheque was taken from the counterpart in this book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first make the comparison? A. About a fortnight ago; I have engraved for the house these twenty-five years - there have been alterations in the firm during that time, and the cheques have not been always the same exactly - the size of the cheque would be the same if it came from any cheque book of theirs: I swear this came from this margin, by the cypher; they unite exactly, and no other in the book will - I have compared it with no other book; I think it has been cut with a knife; a knife or scissors are equally common to cut cheques - it is usual to cut them down the cypher; this fits excellently.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it will not fit fifty other books? A. No - this is a little worn on the edge, but is quite fresh.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you examined it a fortnight ago, did the edges correspond? A. Exactly; I do not cut the books - that is done by the binder; whether they are of the same size depends on their being equally cut - I speak to the plate from the comparison I have made; I believe it to have come from this book.</p>

            . I bind cheques for the house of Curtis and Co, they are made five abreast folio, and are cut down; five books would be nearly the same size, but there must be a trifling difference, we cut as nearly the same as we can - I bound this cheque book, and have every reason to believe this cheque came from that book, and from the very part that has been pointed out; though we cut them as near as we can, they differ a triflle: we are obliged to vary a trifle, to prevent cutting through the impression - I am perfectly convinced this cheque came out of that book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first compare it? A. Last Saturday week - I have not compared it with any other books; I have here a thicker book of theirs - you will find there are no two cheques alike exactly, that is not the same distance from the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath is not this one (pointing one out) the same size? A. There is about one-sixteenth of an inch difference in the width of the margin - there is not so much difference at this end, but there is a trifle which is visible most certainly; I could not cut any cheque from this book promiscuously to make the margin fit - I must case it up and down a little - the books may be cut very nearly of a size, but not exactly the same: they may be exactly alike sometimes, but, generally speaking, there is a little variation - we cut them with a rule and knife.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you cut only one book at a time? A. Only one - they are cut round the edges with a plough, and then with a knife, to separate them into five; it is very seldom that two books are exactly of the same size - we cut four or five sheets at a time with the plough, but only one at a time when cutting them into slips.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your finding no cheque in this book agreeing with it, satisfies your mind that it did not come from any other margin? A. Yes; I undertake to say that cheque will not fit any other part of the book, and that it came from the one which is marked; it is possible for two books to be cut the same size, and it may be probable.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If three or four books were put into the plough, they would be of the same size - but the middle cut is rather higher? A. Yes, if it should fit in length it would vary in width, as we must case it up and down; and if two pieces of paper, cut out of different books,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090090"></xptr>were possibly of the same size, yet the cypher would vary.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Though originally the folio sheet was cut in a plough the five divisions are separately cut? A. Yes; the engraving remains the same, but it occupies a different position in the different books, being eased up and down in one or the other: this cheque exactly fits this book, and belongs to that margin, and that alone.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The book you have brought is one-sixteenth of an inch deeper than the one produced? A. Yes; I did not select it because it was larger, I took it promiscuously from a parcel of fifty or sixty; I brought it merely to explain that one cheque would not fit another margin; I brought it, not because it was larger, but because it was thicker, and offered more specimens - I do not mean wider, but containing more cheques - not because it was a different size in the length or breadth - it is one-sixteenth larger - but I did not select for that - I had no opportunity of comparing them - some may vary a quarter of an inch; I have not examined my stock to see if there are any of exactly the same size as the original book.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you say when this cheque-book was bound? A. About a week ago - I have no idea when the other was bound; they have had these thin books perhaps ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>MR. ROE Alterations have been made in engravings - I should think the engraving of this book was done about the beginning of 1828, from the style of engraving - I should think it was printed at that time; five cheques are engraved at a time; the cyphers cannot vary much - we rub them down on the same copper from the pattern - they cannot vary at all.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. That book was not in existence in 1822? A. Certainly not.(The cheque was here read.)</p>
               <p>MR. BLAKESLEY. These crosses were not on the cheque at the time it was uttered - they are my cancelling.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you do with it when you paid it? A. I put it on a file, and referred to it again next day; Mr. Gates has had it since.</p>
               <p>MR. GATES. I received the cheque from Blakesley, and produce it to-day - it has been in my possession ever since the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed, as I naturally must be, at this awful period of my existence, with feelings which language is too weak, too powerless to describe, it would be superfluous in me to enter into any other details than those connected with the case before you. I stand before you, Gentlemen, charged with having committed an offence which a just God knows I am innocent of; and I sincerely trust that before the light of Heaven shall close upon you this day you will be fully convinced how unjust and cruel is my persecutions, and how soon an innocent man may be considered guilty, and thus subject to all the melancholy horrors of a prison and a trial: firm, however, and undaunted I meet the charge, for"The brave man ne'er despairs,"But lives when cowards die."</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will find, by the evidence adduced against me this day, that part of the money paid for the forgery, in question, passed through my hands; you will hear that I have said I received a note from a person named Wilson, a mate on board an Indiaman, now sailed, whose captain's name was Hadler, or Sadler; such, Gentlemen, I solemnly declare, is to the best of my recollection, the name I received; but, Gentlemen, you are doubtless most of you men of business, and know that notes may frequently come into your possession without being able to recollect from whom you took them. Besides, if a man choose to give me a feigned name, is it justice, Gentlemen, is it humanity, because such is the case, to cast me at once as a guilty man? For by the Sacred God of Heaven! who knows the secrets of our hearts, I stand before you a melancholy spectacle of unjust persecution. You will next find adduced in evidence against me a cheque-book found in my possession; but this, Gentlemen, thank Almighty God, I can account to you how innocently it came into my possession; I will then leave you to judge whether it, in any way, tends to prove my guilt: I have been in the habit of receiving from Mr. Barclay, at various times, different sums of money, as I may have had occasion to ask for it, which money I always (with a few exceptions) received by cheques upon Curtis' house; it was on one of these occasions, when I applied to him for the loan of a sum of money, which was one day when I saw him at Guildhall; he said, if I would meet him the next day he would give it me, as he had not then a blank cheque in his pocket-book; I saw him the next day, and received the amount I asked for; it was to me, however, a great disappointment to wait till next day - and that such an accident might not again happen, I obtained a blank cheque-book, and always kept in my possession one or two, to avoid a like occurrence; thus, Gentlemen, I have accounted to you how innocently this book came into my possession; let me, therefore, deeply impress upon your minds the evidence adduced against me this day, and judge, Gentlemen, whether any conduct of mine has been like that of guilt; Good God! had I been a guilty man, would I have changed the notes in my own immediate neighbourhood, within a stone's throw of my own house, and that to a man who knew me well. Did I not give my real name and place of abode? - Did I offer to conceal it? - No: Does this, Gentlemen, look like guilt? had I been a guilty man, would I have retained in my possession that book, when I had so many opportunities to have destroyed it - months have passed, and years would have passed, e'er I should have destroyed it, for an innocent heart can see no fear. It is but natural I should enjoy the pleasing hope; I may yet be restored to the bosom of my family, and the society of my friends; but it is still more natural to except that to the remotest period of my existence, hours of reflection must cross my mind, and deep-felt anguish remind me of the unjustness of my persecution. Does not this day, Gentlemen, prove to you a melancholy instance - an instance which must ever remain deeply engraven both on your minds and hearts? that however high may stand your characters, let it he pure as the unsullied snow, or innocent as the light of Heaven, still dark suspicion will find its way to both. Lord Erskine quotes, with much truth and judgment, "That it is far better that nine hundred and ninety-nine guilty men should escape, than one innocent man should suffer."Thus deeply impressing on the mind the value which he sets upon innocence; what reparation, Gentlemen, can man make to man, when the last awful act has taken place upon the unhappy victim of innocence? The least he could do then would be to hide himself for ever from the world, and shudder at his own acts of cruelty and oppression. No tongue can tell, Gentlemen; no language, however eloquent, can convey even a faint idea of the anguish of my heart this day - fondly hoping, yet painfully doubting: picture to yourselves, Gentlemen, what must be my state of feelings; it is your verdict alone that can restore me to my once happy home, or doom me to be an unhappy sufferer of an ignominious death. But, Gentlemen, as just and enlightened men, you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090091"></xptr>act with truth and judgment - the life of an unhappy fellow-creature, who deserves the deepest pity and regret, is now at your hands. I now, Gentlemen, conclude my defence - one that is brief, innocent, and true; I have, therefore, nothing left me now to do, but to lay my hand upon my heart, and with a clear and guiltless conscience, humbly and most respectfully await the verdict of a just and upright Jury of my country.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted.</hi>) I belong to Mayence—I came to London in June, by the steamer <hi rend="italic">Batavia</hi>—I had never been here before—I had with me a portmanteau, containing my clothes—on arriving at the station in Fenchurch Street, I received a card from a private hotel-keeper—I went to a <hi rend="italic">cafe</hi> for some refreshment, and asked the waiter to explain the card to me—the prisoner was there, and the waiter, not being able to speak German, addressed him—he spoke my language—he said that I should do better than that; that he was well acquainted with the locality, and he would go with me, and take a room—we went to a <hi rend="italic">restaurant,</hi> at 77, High Street, Aldgate—the landlord had a room to let, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner said he thought he could get one for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at his suggestion, I left my things with the landlord, and told the prisoner to say that if we did not find a cheaper lodging we would return there—we then left, and were riding about in an omnibus for about twenty minutes—we went to another coffee-house—the prisoner told me to wait there, while he went to a commissionaire, with whom he would speak, and procure a place for me—he came back in five minutes, and said he had missed his way, and begged me to wait another five or ten minutes, and he would then return—after waiting another five minutes, I began to be suspicious, and I left there, and went out to try and find the place where I had left my portmanteau—it took me an hour and a half to find the railway station where I had landed, and from there to find the coffee-shop, and then I found that the prisoner had been, and fetched my portmanteau away; it was not there—I have since seen it at the police-station—when I left it, it contained two pairs of trowsers, two shirts, four pairs of socks, and several small articles, a packet of letters and papers, and a 10-thaler note, a 5-thaler note, and five 1-thaler notes, and a neck-tie—this is the tie (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the notes have not been found—this blue shirt is not mine, that was found afterwards in the portmanteau—this grey coat is mine, that was outside the portmanteau.</p>

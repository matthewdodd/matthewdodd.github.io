On the 14th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock, I met the two prisoners in the street in Spital Fields, they asked me if I would go home with them, I told them yes; they asked me for something to eat, I went into a cook's shop and gave them some beef and bread, I bought them two candles and two bundles of wood. I then went home with them.</p>

I went into a room up two pair of stairs with them, I undressed myself to go to bed, I took out my pocket book to see my money was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the pocket book in the presence of the prisoners. - A. Yes, they were looking at me. I had a five pound bill and a two pound bill, I put them safe in my pocket book, and I put my pocket book inside of the lining of my jacket, and my jacket I put under my head and went to bed; these women came to bed to me. I soon fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was you in liquor. - A. No, I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a little in liquor. - A. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in liquor you fell asleep. - A. Yes. In the morning I awoke about four o'clock, I looked for the two women, they were both gone, and the jacket under my head was gone. I rose up in the bed, I found the jacket laying upon my feet, I looked in my pocket book, I found my money was gone all but sixpence and three halfpence; I stopped there till daylight to get a constable; he searched the place, but there was nothing there. I waited about the street for the purpose of taking them. About eleven o'clock they both came home together, I went into the house after them, I said good morning to them; they said they did not know me. I went up stairs after them, I asked them for my money, they denied it and said they had none; I staid in the room with them about five minutes, they both denied having any of my money. I came down to get a constable, I was no sooner down stairs but they were down stairs after me making their way up the street, I made them walk back to the watchhouse, and gave them to Mr. Hart the constable; he searched them in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by yourself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he found any thing upon them. - A. He said not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with your bills or notes afterwards. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not find out where either of them changed this five pound note. - A. No, they bought new gowns and new pattens.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them buy it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners sober. - A. Yes, when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some liquor with them. - A. We had a pot of porter together before we went home.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us that they left you in the night, what had you one of one side of you and one of the other. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did not you perceive them get out of bed. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a very large bed. - A. Not very large, it was big enough for three to lie in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out first you do not know. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor whether they went out separate you do not know. - A. No, they both came home together.</p>
               <p>Ellison's Defence. I know nothing of the man's money; when he met with us he said he had only a few shillings, which he laid out, and if we would let him sleep with us he would pay us the next day when he got his money.</p>
               <p>Barker's Defence. He said that he had not above two or three shillings, and that he was going to lay out, he was going to get some money the next day; we never saw any thing of his money, he lost his money before we saw him, he said he had been to the play.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) What time did you go to the play. - A. At eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the place that you went to the play. - A. Upon my life I cannot speak the name of the street, somewhere in Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a play. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before you went to the play. - A. No, I had beer at the play, it goes round.</p>
               <p>Q. What play did you see. - A. I cannot say, there was a song singing.</p>

I asked them why they left him so early in the morning, why they left their own room and left a stranger in it, they said they had no further business with him, he had no money to pay them, in consequence of which they were not obliged to give him their company.

               <p>I live in Chappel-street, Tottenham-court Road. I lost a silver watch in <placeName id="t17780115-18-crimeloc98">Church-lane, St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>What were you to give her the 6 d. for? some gallantry to pass between you? - Yes; then she robbed me of my watch. I felt her hand in my pocket, and I could not recover it; when I got up, I asked her for it; she said she had not got the watch, nor had she seen it. Cummins came in and asked what was the matter; I told her I had lost my watch; she said I never had a watch; I said I had, and would not go out without it. Smith struck me, and bid me be gone for a dirty dog; I said I would not go out without my watch; she pulled out a knife, and said she would cut my liver out if I did not go, and Cummins shoved me out and shut the door upon me. I never found my watch.</p>

               <p>I had been with Cummins to the Seven Dials to buy an apron; this man came up to us and asked if Mr. Durmer lived there; we asked what he was; he said a smuggler; we were washing; he asked us to drink, and he sent for a quartern of gin, and sat down a quarter of an hour, and then he said he had lost his watch; I said don't say you lost it here. I saw no watch.</p>

               <p>I live in the bottom of the house; there was a young woman washing; this man came and asked if we knew one Durmer a smuggler; he said he was to bring him some tea on Saturday night; he asked if we would drink, and sent for a quartern of gin, and afterwards a pot of half and half; he sat about a quarter of an hour; I was going down, and he asked me to get him two sixpences<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150016"></xptr> for a shilling; when I returned he said he had lost his watch; I said I did not see that he had a watch; he said he had; I said then why did he not send for a constable; he said he had been in some company, and had lost 8 s. and should be glad to find the woman out.

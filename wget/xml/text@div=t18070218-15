I did, a quarter before nine in the morning; he came down the yard, and into the warehouse, no further than where the copper lay; I kept my eye on him, he had not been there five minutes before he went out again; I directly went to the copper and missed three cakes, I called to my fellow servant to come after me, I says he has got it with him; the prisoner was then just got into Thames street to the gates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him. - A. No further than when he shut the wicket. I came up with him about twenty or thirty yards from the gates; I told my fellow servant to get a constable directly; the prisoner said, for God sake, Griffith, do not be too hard with me; I brought him back, and as he came just to the gate the pocket dropped away with the weight of the copper; I saw two cakes drop out; the constable searched him and found another.</p>

On Saturday the 24th of January, I saw the prisoner brought back in the custody of Powell, I saw the prisoner's pocket give way; I saw two cakes of copper fall.

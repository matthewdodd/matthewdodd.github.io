                  </hi>. I live with my father, at 4, Churh-street, Greenwich—the prisoner is my mother—she does not live with us—on Thursday evening, 28th November, I had been out for an errand, about a quarter past 6 o'clock, and was returning home; I felt some wet come on my neck and face—I did not look round—it came again, on my face and head—I had on a wide hat which came sloping down—I did not look round the second time—it came again—I did not look round then—it came a fourth time, and I looked round and saw my mother close behind—I only looked round the last time—that was the first time I saw her—I said, "Don't"—she was then close behind me—I went into the road—she walked down the street—nobody else was near enough to have thrown that on me—there were some boys on my right, and I received the wet on the left side of my face—it was in the middle of the road that it was done, in the middle of Clarence-street, and I went into Church-street afterwards—there was no one near when the wet was thrown on my face, but the boys, and they were seven yards away from me—there was the "Spanish Galleon" public-house on one side, and the light from there and the baker's shop both shone on me—that was the last time, when I looked round—my face burnt after the wetting—my shawl and pinafore were burnt, and also a hair-net which I was wearing—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the things I had on—I have looked at them since—there are marks on them of something.</p>

               <p>there was a little boy with me and I thought it was he who threw it, but he had gone the other way—he was a friend of mine—I have never said before that I addressed my mother upon feeling the wet, and said to her, "Don't"—this if the first time I have ever said it—I have said before that it was done two, three, and four times—I am eleven years of age—(<hi rend="italic">The witness' deposition being read stated,</hi> "I felt something wet come over my face; I looked behind me and saw my mother close to me; I thought it was water.")</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 55). I apprehended the prisoner at 13, Bridge-street, Greenwich, on 3rd December—the father of the child came for a Magistrate's warrant on the Friday, and I received it on Saturday, 13th November—I did not execute it till the following Tuesday, the 3d—I told her she was charged with throwing vitriol over her child—she said she did not do it—I received these clothes on the morning of the 4th, when she was before the Magistrate, after she was apprehended—they were in the same state as now; burnt and spotted with holes—there is a hole in the shawl, and also in the pinafore—they were produced before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Clarence-street, Greenwich—on the evening of 28th November, the little girl was brought to my shop by the father—it appeared to me that the acid had been thrown over this shawl which she wore—she had been crying—I saw a mark of the acid on the left-cheek; a redness—I placed my finger on the spots on the shawl and found that it was a corrosive acid, because it burnt my tongue and lips—I applied no other test—I did not smell it—in my judgment, the corrosive substance wat diluted sulphuric acid, which is vitriol—I have not seen the pinafore, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it is all caused by the acid in my opinion—the injuries to her face were not at all severe—it was about twenty minutes past 6 when she came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you had examined the articles of dress they were quite dry, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were wet—I examined them at twenty minutes past 6 on the evening it happened—she was brought to me directly—I did not retain the things more than five minutes—I sufficiently ascertained that it was an acid—it was evidently a weak acid; if it had been stronger, it would have burnt the things altogether—being weak, it has not destroyed the texture.</p>

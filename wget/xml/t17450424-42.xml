            . [apothecary] On the 2d of March last, about six in the morning, I was knocked up to go to the deceased; I found him exceeding full of pain, and he could not make water; he had all the symptons of a mortification upon him, and seemed in a dangerous way; I asked him, where the seat of his complaint was, he said it was about his bladder, and believed it was occasioned by what happened the day before; he said he was in company with one Smith, and they had some words, that he went out to make water, had got his penis in his hand, and was knocked down and pulled back; that Smith obliged him to fight, and in the middle of their fighting he begged to make water, and it was refused him. This he told me, he was as honest a man, and as industrious a man, as any in his capacity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not probe the man?</p>
               <p>Astley. I went for a surgeon, and I felt of the parts, and found there was no retention of urine, and the surgeon said, he had no great quantity of water in the bladder; and the surgeon did endeavour to cause him to make water; the next morning Mr. Presgrove introduced the Catheter, but there was no water came.</p>

             surgeon. I was desired by Mr. Astley to pay a visit to Mr. Worthington, and I found he had a violent pain in the abdomen, which I took to be upon the neck of the bladder; he ordered a somentation in order to relax the parts, and I think Mr. Presgrove was called, and he endeavoured to introduce the Catheter, but could bring away no water. Mr. Presgrove advised him to the warm bath, as he was going there he saw Mr. Cheselden, and he introduced the Catheter, and he brought a little water off his bladder, I believe about three or four ounces. I opened the body, and there was some water in the bladder, and something of an inflammation that extended itself near the bladder. I could not see any bruise on the parts, but in taking off the outward skin, I found there was a mortification on the upper part of the bladder, which I apprehend was occasioned by the retention of urine; his having something of a desire to make water, and holding it so long as he did, must be the occasion of a violent inflammation of the parts, which occasioned the mortification, and I believe that was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend any of the blows he received in fighting, was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Heathfield. I don't apprehend that any of them was the occasion of his death. I put my probe into his nose, and there was but a trifling wound; and I found the bone of the nose fractured, which was a surprising thing to me, but I don't think that was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What other bruises were there upon the body?</p>
               <p>Heathfield. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a retention of urine before?</p>
               <p>Heathfield . I asked him that question, and he said he had not.

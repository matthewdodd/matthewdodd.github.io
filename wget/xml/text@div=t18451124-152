                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Kensley, and live in Lamb-lane, Bridge-street, Greenwich. On Tuesday, the 23rd of Oct., I had a quarrel with my husband, and left the house and went to his father's house, No. 3, Lamb-lane—I saw a few of the girls who lived there, but not the one I wanted—I found the prisoner there—I did not see his sister there for an hour afterwards—I went out into the yard where she was and struck her—the pri<lb></lb>soner was looking out of the up-stairs window at the time—he lives there—he came down directly—I only struck his sister once—I should have done so more, but a few of the young girls came between us—I then went into the house, into the room where the prisoner was—he put his fist in my face and called me very bad names—he struck me twice, once in the face and once in the breast—I had pulled his hair after he put his fist in my face—he was sitting in a chair at the time, by the side of the fire-place, and I struck his head against the side of the fire-place—there was a fire in the grate—I did not strike him against the stone, but against the wainscot—I did not pull him off his chair—there was a poker in the fire-place, and when I pulled his hair he</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday afternoon, the 23rd of Oct., I was at the prison<lb></lb>er's father-in-law's house—I lived there—I saw the prosecutrix there, she and her husband were having a quarrel, they came in there and came to a fight—the prisoner's sister was outside, in a place they call the back lane—the pro<lb></lb>secutrix went out to her, and struck her, but not violently, she could not hurt her in the way she struck her—she struck her more than once, but not to hurt her—she then came into the house again and the prisoner came down stairs—there was a great deal of swearing on both sides—the prisoner put his fist in her face and then she flew at him, struck him and pulled his hair, and he struck her with the poker—the quarrel was about her striking his sister—I was very bad with the tooth-ache, and did not notice particularly—she pulled his hair and scratched his face, and held his head down by the fire-place—he was sitting by the fire-place at the time he lifted up the poker—I do not know whether he said he would knock her brains out, or whether he would hit her—he struck her with the poker, and then her eye came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Greenwich. On the 23rd of Oct. I was called in and saw the prosecutrix—I examined her eye, which was in the actual state of displacement from its natural cavity—she has completely lost the sight of that eye—a poker was produced to me, which I examined—a thrust from such an instrument would cause such a wound—during my attend<lb></lb>ance on the prosecutrix she did not take that essential care of herself which such a case required—the sight of the eye was lost immediately after the thrust, by the effusion of blood into the chamber of the eye, but that is sometimes absorbed—she did not take care of herself, or it was possible the sight might have been restored.</p>

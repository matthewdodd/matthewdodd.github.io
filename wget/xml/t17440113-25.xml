            . The beginning of November the Prisoner came to lodge in my house, I lost these things which she had the use of, she went away on a Sunday morning about 5 or 6 weeks ago, she took these goods and the key of the lodging along with her; she sent the key back in a penny post letter, and said she would come and make all things easy, but she did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after she went away that she sent the key?</p>
               <p>Smith. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but somebody else had been in the room?</p>
               <p>Smith. The door was locked when I received the key, and when I went in I missed the things. - I never spoke to her till last Thursday was sev'nnight, and then she owned she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things let to her as part of the furniture of her lodging?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The pot never was in the room, and she said as I was out of business and was put to some difficulties, that if I could lie without sheets I might make use of them till I could get into business.</p>
               <p>Smith. The pot was in the room when I let it her, I never gave her leave to pawn them. I could have lent her five shillings or a guinea if I had thought proper, without lending her things to pawn. <rs id="t17440113-25-verdict131" type="verdictDescription">

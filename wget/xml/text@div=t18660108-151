                  </hi>. I am the wife of William West, of Everard-place, White-chapel—on 27th December, I went into Mr. Farrant's, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel, to pledge a dress, and saw the prisoner standing beside me—she took a parcel off the counter, and walked out with it—the shopman spoke to me, and I told him.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you been at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I was there more than ten minutes—there was nobody there but me, my sister, and the prisoner—I was in the shop at the back, they do not take in pledges in the front—it is parted off from where you go in to buy—there are no boxes—there was no gas lighted—it was about half-past 3—I am quite sure there was only my sister, myself, and the prisoner in the part we were in—it is not a very large shop—this shawl was a parcel done up, lying on the counter—the shopman spoke to me when he missed the parcel—I stayed in the shop, and he went out and brought the prisoner back with two parcels; her own and the one she had taken off the counter, just in the same state as when she took them out—there were not other</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Joseph Farrant, pawnbroker, of Cable-street, Whitechapel—I produce a shawl which had been pawned—I saw the prisoner on 27th December, leaving the shop with it on her arm—I stopped her when she had got between fifty and a hundred yards—she had turned the corner—I said, "You must come back to the shop"—she made no answer, but went back with me—I fetched a constable, and gave her in custody—she said the young man behind the counter gave it to her—I had been behind the counter that day, and am the young man who spoke to Alice West—I had seen the bundle in the shop two or three seconds before—I was not attending to Alice West when I missed it—I spoke to her—I was booking the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there anybody else assisting you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were three young men with me behind the counter—there were a good many people waiting to be served when I went out, I should think about six—they were mostly women—it was when I brought the prisoner back to where Alice West was, that she said that it was given to her by a young man behind the counter—I cannot be mistaken, it was not that it was given to her by a young woman to hold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you receive the shawl from Purkiss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the Magistrate offered to settle the matter summarily, if the prisoner would say that she was guilty, but she said no, she would be tried.</p>

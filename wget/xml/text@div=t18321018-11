On Wednesday, the 3rd of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I went into the Castle, public-house, and had half a pint of beer at the counter - it is near Sharpe's-alley, but I do not know the name of the street; I had a sovereign, 18s., and some halfpence in my pocket; I looked at my money when I paid for the half-pint of beer; I had five half crowns, five shillings, one sixpence, a sovereign, and a few halfpence; I had been drinking before that, and was not quite sober, but could recollect what happened; when I came out of the house, I had the sovereign in my mouth; I had taken it from the silver, being afraid I should give it for a shilling if I went to another public-house; the silver was in my waistcoat pocket, in a black purse; I do not know that either of the prisoners were at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you were out of the public-house did you see any body? A.

               <p>Q. How soon did you come to your senses? A. I recollect nothing more till next day, when I found myself in the workhouse, under Mr. Palmer's care; I am still in the workhouse; I was a good deal hurt on my shoulder and back; I was ill for a week or eight days - I saw no man but Whittey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do I understand that you had your recollection so about you as to know perfectly well what you was about? A. I was not so far gone but I knew the party who struck me and knocked me down - I saw no third person; I was sober enough to see if there were three, but never took notice.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had you got any employ in town? A. No; I had 7s. or 8s. or 10s. when I left home at Sheffield, but I earned some on my road here; I had about 2l. 7s. when I came to town - I worked for it on the road, at slating and plastering; I earned a sovereign in Lymington, and about the same in Warwickshire, and I earned 7s. or 8s. more; I have not earned any in town; I have been looking for a brother whom I have not seen for eight years; I spent all my money but 1l. 18s. and some halfpence; I believe what I paid at the Castle for my beer was 1d., for it was common beer; I never said I changed a sovereign there; I did not offer the landlord a sovereign for a shilling - I gave a sixpence; I did not offer the landlord a shilling; I am quite sure the male prisoner was by at the time the female was standing over my head.</p>

            . I am a private watchman of St. Sepulchre's. On the 3rd of October I was in the neighbourhood of Cow-cross, about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner Bullimore drag the prosecutor out of the Castle public-house, Cow-cross, which is nearly facing Sharpe's-alley, and knock him down; the prosecutor was in liquor - after knocking him down, he wanted to take him up a dark passage, called Faulkener's-alley, which joins the public-house; when he knocked him down, he called out, "Come on, Jack, he is down as dead as a herring;" a black man(the witness Springet) came out of the public-house, and helped to pick him up; he laid hold of one arm, and Bullimore the other - Bullimore endeavoured to drag him up the alley, but Springet said he had better let him be on the step, and he would recover himself; they had not been there above two or three minutes before Bullimore said,"I know where the man lives, he lives on Saffron-hill" - somebody said Yes, but I cannot exactly say who it was; Springet and Bullimore took him over towards Sharpe's-alley, and I did not see any more of him then; but about ten minutes after Springet came up to me, and a Policeman, and told me there was a drunken man being robbed and murdered; I and the Policeman turned to go down Sharpe's-alley, where Springet said the man was, and met Palmer, the master of the workhouse, coming up with a Policeman - they asked if I had seen any body go by, if I had seen Whittey go by; I said I had seen Whittey and a woman go by, and thought they would find them at the Bull's Head; I went there with them, and found Whittey and the female prisoner - they had got a measure of gin; Whittey was outside, and the woman in; they told them they wanted them to go down to Sharpe's-alley to see a man that was laying there - they took them down there, and when they got down there they were told they had knocked the man down there; Whittey and the woman said they were passing by at the time, and had assisted the man up; the woman made use of very bad language, and said she was coming by, and saw the man laying there, but they did not knock him down at all; the master of the workhouse gave charge of them - I saw Crowson, a bricklayer, standing at the corner of Sharpe's-alley, when they were in custody; Whittey told Crowson he had been at Croydon fair, and had got some money belonging to his(Whittey's) brother; he said he had got 1l., and gave Crowson 18s. out of it to give to his brother - I saw the money; there were four or five half-crowns, but I cannot exactly say what, as it was in the dark - Crowson went up to the station-house, and delivered it to the inspector; I saw nothing of Bullimore after he led him into Sharpe's-alley': I went away from there up to Cow-cross, and Springet fetched me; I did not interfere when Bullimore knocked him down, as they talked about being his friends, and seeing him home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you thought they were friends? A. Yes - I saw him knock him down; I cannot say whether the prosecutor was too drunk to help himself - Bullimore hit him in the breast with his fist; he caught hold of his collar, and dragged him out of the house - they were all in the public-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you thought this was done in friendship? A. I do not know about friendship - I have been a watchman nearly two years; he was knocked down right facing the public-house door; I did not interfere, because there are such desperate characters there - it is not safe to go without assistance; if there had been a robbery I should have gone over - I did not see the landlord; his name is Knight: Bullimore was inside the public-house when he knocked him down - I did not see him till the man laid on the ground; I did not hear the landlord say any thing to Bullimore - I did not hear him call out "Joe, help the man up - don't let him lay there;" nothing of the kind was said; I stood on the other side of the street - it is about twenty yards wide; there are Policemen about - I had a rattle, but I had no business to interfere unless I see a robbery; I went over about the time they were picking him up, and saw them put him on a step; I did not go up till after Whittey and his wife came up - Bullimore hit him hard enough to knock him down; I did not speak to the prosecutor at all - he was not sensible to be spoken to, he was so much hurt; I afterwards carried him up, and helped to put him to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. You say you saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180022"></xptr>them all coming out of the public-house - who do you mean? A. I said they were all in the public-house - Springet, Bullimore, and the prosecutor were all together; I did not see either of the other prisoners there - I did not see the prosecutor till he was knocked down; I did not see him in the public-house, and have never said so; I did not see him till he was dragged out of the public-house and knocked down.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. On Wednesday night, the 3rd of October, about fifteen or twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor four doors from the Castle, in Cow-cross-street, standing with his back against a shop shutters, passing money from one hand to the other, apparently looking for something among the silver - I suppose he had about 1l. worth of silver; I did not see whether he had any purse - he was in a dark part of the street; I could discern nothing in his hand but silver - he appeared to be rather in liquor, and was talking to himself; he left there, and went into the Castle public-house - he appeared to keep the money still in his hand; I did not see him again till after I had apprehended the female prisoner, which was about half an hour after - I then found him laying with his arms extended opposite the poor-house in Sharpe's-alley - about a quarter of an hour after I had seen him go into the Castle, Whittey and his woman passed me near Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross-street, going towards the City, in a direction from the Castle to the Bull's Head, where I apprehended the female prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Did you see the prosecutor after he was inside the Castle? A. No; I heard some money thrown on the counter, and heard Knight, the landlord, make some observation to him about putting it into his pocket.</p>

            . I sell canes about, and sometimes travel with beasts from Scotland; I live in Rosemary-lane. On the night of the 3rd of October I went to the Castle, Cow-cross-street, about eight o'clock, and saw Joyce, the prosecutor, there when I went in; he was drinking there when I went in; I judge it to be about eight - he was very much in liquor; I saw him flashing a sovereign and some half-crowns about in his hand - the landlord told him to put them into his pocket, and advised him to go home - he went out at the door, made a stagger and fell - the landlord desired somebody to pick him up; this was outside the door - the landlord asked me to see him home to his lodgings; I was going to conduct him to Saffron-hill -I took him down Sharpe's-alley, just close to the work-house, and then the prisoner Bullimore came up, and hit me a blow on the head with the but end of a whip, and asked me to fight; I did not say a word to him -I picked up my hat, which was knocked off, and made my escape; he called me a black b-gg-r, and I ran away - as I ran away I saw the Policeman, and told him they were robbing the poor man.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you see Whittey or the woman? A. They followed me down the alley when I went to see the man home: they were all three together - after attacking me they got round Joyce, but what money they took from him I cannot say; I did not see Joyce knocked down - I was glad to make my escape, as they asked me to fight; I thought my life was in danger; I saw the female prisoner looking on while the other two were round Joyce, and in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180023"></xptr>few minutes I saw the Policeman, and told him they were robbing the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Bullimore till you got to Sharpe's-alley? A. Never, till I got into Sharpe's-alley - Joyce went out of the Castle; I did not see him knocked down by any body at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it take you to go from the Castle to Sharpe's-alley? A. I dare say it took about half an hour; when Joyce fell down at the door, the landlord said, "Joe, help him up, it don't do for the man to lay there;" my name is Samuel - I did not see Bullimore till he came and knocked me down, and my life was in danger; the landlord asked me to see Joyce home - Bullimore came and helped him up with one arm at the door of the Castle, but he left him; I did not see him in the public-house - he was outside the door in the street; the landlord was inside, just at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say you never saw Bullimore till you saw him in Sharpe's-alley? A. I say I never saw him in the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Bullimore help him up outside the door of the public-house, and give him all the assistance he could? A. He assisted him up, then left him to me till he came up in Sharpe's-alley and hit me; I did not notice a private watchman outside - I did not see Bullimore knock Joyce down at the door; he staggered, and the landlord said, "Pick him up;" I did not see Bullimore in the public-house, nor see him come out of it - I dare say he was in the street; he hit me on the head in Sharpe's-alley, when Whittey and the woman were about Joyce, and he asked if I would fight - my life was in danger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were there at eight o'clock - did you sit drinking there all the evening? A. I staid there till the house was being shut up - I was very sober; I only had half a pint of beer - I was about half an hour taking him to Sharpe's-alley; I have got a bad leg, and do not walk fast.</p>

I apprehended Bullimore on the 4th of October, at a quarter to six o'clock, at his master's yard, Mr. White, a horse-slaughterer, in Sharpe's-alley; when I entered the yard he was standing in the middle of the yard - he turned and came towards me, and before I could speak to him, he said, "What is the row that happened last night?" I told him he was wanted at the station, that Whittey and the female prisoner were there - when we got to the station, Draper recognized him as having knocked the prosecutor down; he said, "What do you say, that I robbed him?"

            . I am landlord of the Castle, Cowcross-street. On the night this took place, Joyce came into my house, about eleven o'clock; he had not been there before - I never saw him before in my life: I am sure he was not there at eight; he appeared intoxicated when he came in - he went out when I told him it was time to close the house; Springet was there - Bullimore was there that night: when Joyce went out at my door, he fell down outside; no one touched him - Springet was close to the door; I called out to Bullimore, "Joe, help him up - it won't do for the man to lay there;" he did so, and Springet took hold of one arm - Springet and Bullimore were both at my bar together; he could not avoid seeing him there - my house is about fifty yards from Sharpe's-alley; I did not observe that Springet was lame, nor any thing to make him half an hour going to Sharpe's-alley.</p>
               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Were either of the Whittey's in your house? A. No; the prosecutor laid out 1s. 1d. at my house - he tendered me a shilling for half a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him throwing his money about? A. I saw him with a sovereign and 12s. or 14s.; I could not tell rightly how much he had - I shut up at half-past eleven o'clock, and was closing my doors when I saw Joyce fall; Bullimore was close to him - Springet was outside also; I was inside, but just within my door, shutting it - I have known Bullimore about twelve months.</p>

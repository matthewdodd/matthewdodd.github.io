I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of April - he said at the Thames Police-office that he had bought the hat of a person in East Smithfield; I went with him, and he pointed out Gideon to me, but he denied having sold him this hat, and said he never had such a hat in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (through on Interpreter). I had a good hat on my head, but it fell down, and they would have it that I stole it.</p>

I had a brass ring put on my finger by somebody, I examined my pockets, I found I had lost eleven guineas, and two handkerchiefs, and the buckles out of my shoes; and they had put another pair of buckles, just loose in the straps; I know nothing of the persons that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not seem to have a very clear recollection, whether you was robbed by men or women? - I recollect I was assaulted by women, and therefore conjecture I was robbed by women.</p>
               <p>Court. The state you was in at that time, Sir, perhaps made it difficult for you to say how long it was before that you had these things safe; what was the place you came from? - I came last from the playhouse, it was a little after nine.</p>
               <p>Drury Lane play-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The condition you was in, I suppose you did know whether you was not robbed of these before you came into the play-house? - I was in the Lobby, I suppose, half an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Was you sufficiently master of yourself, to be sure, that you was in the lobby, or is that, what other people told you? - That is what I have been told since.</p>
               <p>What is the last place you recollect yourself to be in? - The last place I recollect to be in, was in company, where I dined, and spent the afternoon, which was Duke's-Court, near Bow-street, coming into the air, the effects of intoxcation came on, and deprived me of recollection.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether, when you left this place, you had your money and your buckles and ring? - Yes, my Lord, ten guineas of it was in a paper, which I received of a gentleman then in company, which I just looked at, and screwed it up in the same paper, and put it into my pocket, and I did not spend a shilling there.</p>

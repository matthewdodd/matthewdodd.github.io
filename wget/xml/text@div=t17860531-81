               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Did you see the people that were with Mrs. Watkins at the time? - No, I only saw in the house the second time, Mr. Watkins, and the property, the parties were gone; I have seen the prisoner several times before and since the 4th of December; I believe his father lived next door to Watkins; I have told Scott and Graham that I believed I had seen the prisoner since December last.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Scott? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know any good of him? - I never knew any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Do you believe him a man to be believed upon his oath? - Upon my oath, I do not know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Is not he the man that proclaimed war against the French? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had the misfortune to hear Scott examined upon his oath? - No, Sir.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am engine keeper of St. Andrew Holborn, and live in Union-court; about half after six, on the 4th of December last, which was on Sunday evening, I had information, and I went to Watkins's; I knocked at the door and went backwards, I heard a hustling, and I looked into the shop, and in the back part of the shop, there is a kind of a little parlour, there I saw the prisoner sitting on the side of Mrs. Watkins, and there was another man; then I saw the prisoner lay hold of these clothes in his hands, and he held them up to Mrs. Watkins, says she, that will do very well, put that down; then he handed up a shirt, she said, that will do very well, put that down.</p>
               <p>Could they see you at the time? - I do not know that they did, I was in the dark, in the shop, and the room was light where they were; Watkins was gone, I do not know where; then I ran into the room; and I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar; says I, and you will do very well; when I got hold of him the other rushed out, he slipped out of my hand; I then underneath the table found these things, I tied them up and gave them to Roberts.</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. Well Master Scott, are we to have war or peace with France? - That is neither here nor there.</p>
               <p>They sent you to the compter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watkins opened the door for you? - Yes, in a moment.</p>
               <p>How is this shop parted from the parlour? - Close together, only the window.</p>
               <p>You went there to search for some scarlet cloth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So Mrs. Watkins and the prisoner went on deliberately? - Quite quietly.</p>
               <p>The scarlet cloth was in the house at the time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many minutes might you be in the shop looking in the parlour? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>How did the prisoner escape? - How do I know, out at the front door, Mr. Graham was behind me, and he knocked Mr. Wilkins aside, who was at the door, and they both got away.</p>
               <p>Why is not Mr. Wilkins here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was he here on the trial of Watkins? - I cannot tell you, I am short of memory at this present time.</p>
               <p>Now I will brush up your memory, do you believe he was not here and examined? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Have the goodness to tell those gentlemen, who are to decide on this man's case, and your oath, why this Wilkins was not here to day? - I do not know, I was subpoened.</p>


               <p>Mr. Hardcastle. I subpoened him because I thought he would not come.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was offered ten pounds to screen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310092"></xptr> up the matter, and not to bring the thing into question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Scott. Do not you know Mr. Wilkins is not here, because he would say that the prisoner at the bar was not the man? - How do I know that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you not heard Wilkins say so? - He was in the street, and it was dark.</p>
               <p>Was you sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never heard Watkins say that the prisoner was not the man that was in Watkins's house? - I know nothing at all about it; I cannot say, indeed.</p>
               <p>But you shall say, one way or the other? - I never heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Where did this man live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he lived with his father in Fleet-lane? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe it? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Where did his father live? - I heard, after he was taken up, that he lived in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Then, do not you know now, that this man lived with his father, next door to Watkins? - I do not know that this man's father lived next door to Watkins, ever since this affair; I do not know it, nor do I believe it, upon my soul; I tell you the truth; it may be so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many minutes did you wait at the door? - About a minute; three or four knocks, and the door was opened; Scott knocked pretty softly, the door was opened, there were two or three bolts undone; I heard Mrs. Watkins saying, that will do; I heard no further, I heard it but once, that was before the things were put under the table; I was close to Scott.</p>
               <p>If she had said any thing else, you would have heard it? - May be not so soon.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say, that will do very well, I will give you three guineas and an half for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know that young man? - Yes, very well; after we were out, I said that is Barney; in the evening, I said so to Roberts and Mr. Wilkins, and Mr. Scott and Mr. Singleton.</p>
               <p>Was you a witness on the trial of Mrs. Watkins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did Barney's father live? - I believe, in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>When did you see Mr. Wilkins? - I saw him to day in St. Paul's church-yard; I told him I was coming here, about Barney; he said he was not subpoened, and the children kept him away.</p>

               <p>Had you any talk with Scott about the people that were below stairs? - The first thing that Scott said to me, was, Manby, I charge you to aid and assist, and mind these things.</p>
               <p>What things were those? - They were a coat and waistcoat, and such things as these; accordingly, I did so; then Scott says to me, says he, Manby, do you know any of those parties that were in the house? no, says I; says he, can you describe either of the parties, or tell either of their names?</p>
               <p>What parties was he speaking of at this time? - He did not speak of any parties particularly; it was those people that he found with Mrs. Wilkins; I told him it was out of my power to do any thing of the kind, for I was up two pair of stairs; says he, if you can describe either of the parties, or tell ever a name, by G - d I will give you ten guineas.</p>
               <p>That was Mr. Scott? - Yes; he knows me very well, and has done for many years.</p>

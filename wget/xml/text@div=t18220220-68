On the 24th of January, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came and said he wanted a jacket - I shewed him two, neither of which were good enough; he approved of the third, and agreed to give 22 s., and then wanted trowsers to correspond. I asked him to walk into the warehouse, which is up stairs: he said,</p>
               <p>"No, bring them to the door;" and while I was turning to fetch them he walked away with the jacket. I ran after him down Dock-street, hurt my foot, and could not follow. I saw him about eleven o'clock, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw him last November - A. I never saw him till January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come into your shop in November, and bargain for a jacket, and you kept the money and would not give him the jacket - A. Such a thing never happened; he told the Magistrate so, but I deny it. He said I changed them, that he refused to have them, and I kept the money; and as his vessel sailed the next day he could not prosecute me - but no such thing occurred.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Ellis's service; I was outside the door when the prisoner came; he said the jacket would not fit him, then said it would do. I turned round, and in a few minutes saw my master pursuing him. He followed him through all the dark avenues, crying, Stop thief! to the quay where his ship was. I went on board, and said there was a thief, who had stolen a jacket; one and another threatened me, and the captain said if I did not go about my business he would give me in charge. I fetched an officer from Lambeth-street, and then the man was denied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked him if it was his ship<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200043"></xptr>- A. Yes; and he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" he pulled the jacket off, and began working with the rest of the men. He did not say the jacket was little enough for his 24 s. I never sat eyes on him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he the jacket on when he ran away - A. Yes, and his own under his arm.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I am an officer. Ellis fetched me on board the George, Berwick smack; I found the prisoner down in the forecastle; he asked one of his shipmates where the jacket was; he said it was in the hammock, where I found it. He said he did not steal it, for the man owed him money.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 18th of November, I bought a jacket and trowsers of him for 24 s.; I paid him; he took them up, and wanted 1 s. more. I saw that he had changed them, and I would not have them. He said he would give 5 l. to a lawyer, rather than give me money or clothes. I went to the Magistrate, who asked the man's name; I said I did not know it; and he said it was no use to come without it. I went and got his name, and told the Magistrate I wanted it done quick, as I sailed next day. He said then there would not be time. I have a witness who went to the office with me, but I did not tell him what it was for, because my mates should not call me a fool. When I came back again I went and looked at a jacket, put it on, and said,</p>

               <p>"I will keep it for the 24 s. I gave you last voyage."</p>

            . I was on board the George, in November last, and went with the prosecutor to the office the day before we sailed. I waited outside while he went in. I was on board when this Jew came - he asked the prisoner if he belonged to the ship - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes; and I think the jacket is little enough for my 24 s."</p>

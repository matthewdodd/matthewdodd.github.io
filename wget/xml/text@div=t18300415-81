The prisoner came into my service on the 26th of January; on Sunday, the 21st of March, I went out, leaving her at home - I had seen all the property stated in the indictment safe the day before, and some that morning; I returned at eight o'clock in the evening, and knocked at the door; I received no answer, and was going for a Policeman, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150051"></xptr>a neighbour gave me information - I got a constable and got into the house; the prisoner was gone, and I missed all these articles and money - I got information and afterwards went to No. 20, Little James-street, Manchester-square; the property had then been found - I saw it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hire the prisoner? A. I hired her first about the end of November. I met her accidentally; I walked with her and made an appointment with her, as is usual in such cases - it was not for her to come into my service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear she did not live with you as a mistress? A. Certainly not - I have receipts to prove she was my servant. When I first met her I went with her to a house in the neighbourhood of Soho-square, and there found her to be a girl of the town, as I believed she was; but from the knowledge I obtained of her character afterwards, I thought she might be trusted, which induced me to take her; I never slept with her while she was in my service - I certainly did in Greek-street, Soho; I had frequent interviews with her at her lodgings, which she took me to in Meards-court; I gave her money - I gave her nothing but her wages while she was my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep her as your mistress before she came into your service? A. I never considered her so. I supported her in every way; the wages I gave her was 5s. a week, or 12l. a year, which was the agreement - I took lodgings for her before she came into my service; she lived at those lodgings about two months or longer, till the 26th of January, when she came into my service - I first saw her on a Sunday, the latter end of November or beginning of December; I walked by her side - I appointed to meet her on the Tuesday evening; I did so - I took an apartment for her at No. 21, Norton-street, Marylebone, but did not pass her off there as my wife; she was there about a month - it is not a house of ill same; the landlord is a chair-maker - she walked with me to the house; no inquiry was made whether I was married - there was a little objection made at first as to a reference; I said if there was any objection I would not take the apartment - I refused to go in doors; no question was asked as to whether we were married - I I did not go there with her as my wife; when she had been there a month I might have said the expences were too great for me - I certainly thought so, and proposed to take another lodging; she solicited me to apprentice her to learn shoe-binding - as I intended to leave my business and go abroad, I did not wish she should he unsupported; she said if I would apprentice her to the shoe-binding she should do well, but she never would return home - she is seventeen years old; I am twenty-seven - we had two other lodgings; one in Nassau-street. Middlesex Hospital, the other in Cirencester-place, Fitzroy-square, and staid a fortnight or three weeks in one, and three weeks or a month in the other - I then, in consequence of being about to dispose of my business, and my servant having burnt a sheet, I sent her out of the house, and stated to the prisoner that she should come for a short time, which would be about a month; I charge her with taking 21l. - I gave her no part of that to buy dress; I believe there is at home in my watch-case a broken brooch which she begged I would never part with for her sake.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not sure of her? A. No, she being dressed different, and it being dark in the evening - she had a veil on.</p>

In consequence of information I went to No. 20, James-street, with Hornsby, and found the prisoner there; we found the articles stated in the indictment at her lodging - she acknowledged to me that the whole of the things belonged to Mr. Hodges; there was a quantity of linen, other goods, and some clothes of her own, which she acknowledged she had bought out of the money she took from Mr. Hodges - I found ten sovereigns and a half, and asked if the money belonged to Mr. Hodges; she said it did - I asked where the remainder was; she said she had bought clothes with it.</p>

               <p>C. A. C. HODGES.

            . I am a watchman. About three o'clock in the morning of the 8th of July, I saw the prisoner with the prosecutor, who was very much in liquor; I went down the street, and saw the prosecutor down on his back, and the prisoner kneeling on him; I saw him take the money out of his trousers pocket, and put it into his own waistcoat pocket - I saw him do it three different times; he then got up and ran towards me - I seized him- he tried hard to get from me, but I held him, and found the money in his pocket; there were two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences, and 1s. 8d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received a sovereign from Mr. White, which I changed; I saw the prosecutor laying tipsy in the street, and the watchman poking him about with a stick; I assisted him up - he said he lived in Wild-street - I took him there, and he said he lived in Gate-street - I took him there, and again into Wild-street - he fell down; I thought I could leave him, when the watchman stopped me; the prosecutor was also taken to the watch-house; he said in the morning that he did not know what money he had.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SULLIVAN. I had received a sovereign, and changed it at the public-house. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">THOMAS HAMBER</hi>. I am one of the messengers of the Court of Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy. I produce the proceedings under a fiat against Samuel Strong, and a certificate of the appointment of the official assignees, George Gibson, Thomas Boyd, and two others—on the 18th of November I took the prisoner and put him in possession of the premises, at Nos. 337 and 339. Oxford-street—I found the doors sealed up by the Sheriff's officers, who had been previously there—I broke the seals, and placed the prisoner in charge of the whole of the property—on the 30th of November, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to the premises with Mr. Parrington—Mr. Ashurat was with me some part of the time—I asked the prisoner if he could account for the robbery—he denied any knowledge of it—I asked him if he had used due precaution in keeping the place secured at night—he told me he had, and that no person had access but himself—I went with Mr. Ashurst the next day and the same questions were repeated—the prisoner still denied all knowledge of the robbery—he said, his wife and two persons were the only visitors that he saw—one was a person whose name he did not recollect—he did not state where he had been while the visitors were there—he was asked how many times his wife had visited him, and he said, three times, and that the other persons were merely casual visitors, as they passed—Mr. Ashrust questioned him very particularly as to the pro<lb></lb>perty—he still denied all knowledge of it—Mr. Ashurst cautioned him, that if he found any thing, however trifling, in his lodgings, he should con<lb></lb>sider him guilty of the whole, and he should be punished—he said he wads quite contened that it should be so, and he gave directions, in a written note to his wife, to permit us to see every place belonging to him, at his lodgings—we went to his lodgings in Nelson-street, Commercial-road—he was asked id any one else could have taken any thing while he was there—he said, "Certainly not," because he had secured the place with a seal, placed by himself—he told us his lodgings were at No. 5, New Nelson-street—I went there in company with Mr. Parrington, Mr. Strong, the bankrupt, and Mr. Wooley, his foreman—the lodgings were searched, and we found a remnant of a piece of linen, which is now in Court—It is about eight yards—It was found in a drawer in the room, at his lodgings, Mrs. Atherways's, who, I believe, is the prisoner's sister-in-law—those lodgings were searched in my presence—a box was found, containing silk and mercery goods; and a portmanten, containing rib ands—It was found just as they are produced—after that, I went back to Oxford-street, and gave the prisoner into custody—I examined the seals, and they were broken—from the inventory and the cost price which I saw marked, I should think the property produced is worth from 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I desired the prisoner to turn out his pockets, and found about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—I found a letter at his lodging—I know his handwriting; this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "19th of November, 1835, 337, Oxford-street. To Mary Smith, 5, New Nelson-street, Commercial-road. Dear Mary, on leaving the Borough yesterday, I was sent here in possession—It is also a linen-draper's shop—I should have written to you earlier, but had got paper, or any money to but a sheet of paper; let me have my clean things—G.

                  </hi>. I became a bankrupt, and the prisoner was put into possession, at my premises—I and my family were excluded from the part where the property was—I was in the shops three or four times afterwards—the prisoner was always there—this piece of cloth was in my stock where I became bankrupt, and this piece of velvet was mine, I am certain of it—I had seen it previously to the Sheriff coming to take possession—It had not been sold, to my knowledge—I don't know Mrs. Waterway—she is a poor woman, and not likely to buy velvet of this description—when my property was seized the doors were fastened up, and sents put upon then—I went into the counting-house, I believe, twice afterwards, and the seals were taken off the door, that I might get my books out—Mr. Mason was with me at those times—he saw the seals broken for me to get in, and he sealed them up again—to the best of my belief, the whole of the pro<lb></lb>perty is mine—I did not take any article away, nor did Mr. Mason.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> were you residing on the premises from the time the Sheriff took possession, till the prisoner was put in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; both the shops were sealed up—we inhabited the rest of the house—I saw the Sheriff's clerk seal the shops—I do not think I saw the seals broken when the prisoner came—other persons might have broken the Sheriff's seals, taken out goods, and put on other seals, but it is not probable—my private cost mark is on this velvet, and the selling price, in my own writing—I believe I saw it at the time the Sheriff came—that was ten days before the messenger came—all the linen-drapers of London have bits of linen—I would not say that this piece has not been sold.</p>

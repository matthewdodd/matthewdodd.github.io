                  </hi>. I resided with Mrs. Sarah Parker from 23rd May last—she at that time lived at No. 8, Old Manor Street, Chelsea—she had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to live on, I believe—she received that from the Royal Exchange, but she had the rent of No. 16, Sloane Street—I remember the prisoner coming to her; I and Mrs. Parker were present—I think it was 28th or 29th May, but I know the advertisement was 27th May—when the prisoner came he asked which was Mrs. Parker, and of course she answered—he said he had seen an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> and he should be happy to undertake her business—she replied she should be happy to put it into the hands of any respectable solicitor—he said, "I will under<lb></lb>take it for you, and carry it through, and all expenses will amount to 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." she said, "Then undertake it certainly; I am a very poor woman, I can't</p>

               <p>afford to pay much"—he said it would be the first and last expense; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given him then, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the day following—she stated that she was the widow of Christopher Shepherd Parker, and her brother, Mr. Neagus, had drawn out of the bank 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her property, and her sister, Susan Branch, 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her daughter Sarah to go to Australia, and previous to that, 15, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her husband's debts, and that her husband's nephew, the Rev. Mr. Close, had come and taken out some, and all she had left was 180, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank, the Roebuck tavern, and two houses in Dowgate Hill—the prisoner said, "In that case, you are a person of large property?"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "I can get it for you, and will do so imme<lb></lb>diately, but I must have money to serve writs on different parties"—he asked if there was a will—she said yes, but it was at Messrs. Seton and Nicholson's, in the Adelphi—she produced her husband's father's will—she said that she had had three children—he said, "Then the pro<lb></lb>perty has been willed to your children?"—she said they had all been poisoned—he appeared to make notes; he was constantly writing all that Mrs. Parker stated—she said, "Now you can proceed, of course"—he said, "No, I cannot without money"—she said, "How much?"—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—this was not at the first interview, it was the second or third—the first time he came he stated his name to be Jervis, but he did not say where he resided—he said he had both a town and country house, and kept a carriage—he said, "I am a solicitor"—I think that was very nearly all that passed the first time—the second time he came for the remainder of the money—he said he was going to Merton or Morden, to search for the regis<lb></lb>ters of the deaths of those children—Mrs. Parker gave him the money, and he said he should go on the following day—during that second visit it was stated about the 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember his coming in July; I do not remember on what day—he then wished to have more money, for the purpose of going down to Bury—Mrs. Parker said to him, "There are very few lawyers or solicitors of the name of Jervis; are you related to Sir John Jervis?"—he said, "Oh, yes, I am the son of Sir John Jervis"—she said, "Have you any brothers or sisters?"—he answered, "I have a sister"—she said, "Is she married or single?"—he said, "She is married to the Turkish ambassador"—Mrs. Parker said, "I thought you were some great man, you bear the stamp of it;" and, turning to me, she said, "Do you not think so, my dear?"—I said, "I must beg to differ in opinion with you"—I then turned to him, and said, "I have many times asked you for your address; you told me you had a town and country house, and kept a carriage; will you favour me with your card?"—he said, "Unfortunately, I came out without my card"—I said, "Then will you favour me with your country or town address, and I will put it down on paper"—he answered, "This is quite irrelevant to the point, and it is not customary to question solicitors"—he said he was a solicitor of forty years' standing—I asked him, if he kept a carriage, if he would occasionally give me a ride—he said he would be happy to do that—at that time he required 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to go down to Bury—Mrs. Parker said, "I cannot give it you, I have but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I have no doubt my friend here" (pointing to myself) "will accommodate you with the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he had 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he left immediately on receiving it—he said that he had filed a bill in Chancery; that was before he received the money—he said the business was going on, and Mrs. Parker would receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday, which he would bring her, and that she would receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month till the case was concluded—I remember his coming again after that—that was in</p>

               <p>Oct.—at one time he received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot tell the date—before he received that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he stated that he had been down to Bury, and he had seen Mrs. Parker's brother, and had served him with a writ, and that her brother must come up; he said it was highly necessary—he inquired the state of Mrs. Parker's mind when she was absent one morning; I cannot recollect the time—on several occasions he called when she was absent, but waited till her return—he received altogether upwards of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How soon did you first see me after 23rd May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The advertisement was inserted on 27th May; you replied to it, and called immediately after—I wrote the advertisement, and Mrs. Parker herself inserted it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">Looking at one.</hi> is my writing—I had never seen you when I wrote this—when you called you gave your address, No. 62, Newman Street—you had written a letter, and given your address—that letter was received, I have no doubt, by Mrs. Parker—I mean to persist in saying that you came up stairs, and said, "Which of you ladies is Mrs. Parker?"—most decidedly you did so—you might have seen Mrs. Parker previously, and left your address; she saw many persons—when you first came, Mrs. Parker did not answer the door and begin to introduce you to me—I did not interrupt her by getting up and stating, "In short, Mr. Jervis, I am the wife of a solicitor, and I have written the advertisement, and I mean to act as her friend in the matter, as she has been greatly robbed"—you stated that you called to know whether she could make out anything, and what she could show you—she produced the probate of her husband's father's will—you looked at some of the other papers, and pre<lb></lb>mised to call on the following day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the following day, 1st June, did I call and read that probate over to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All I can say is, that I got so weary of it that I went to sleep—the first time you had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Parker, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next—you said you would carry it through for the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mrs. Parker told you she had three children, most decidedly, and you asked me if it was true—you said, on reading the probate, "Then it will go to your husband's children," and she said, "Yes, I know that; I have had three children;" and you asked whether they were living, or, if dead, where they were buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not give me instructions to go to search for their burials and baptisms at St. Martin's in the Fields, at Merton, and at Morden, and was not money given for that purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money was given—I believe you came the next day, and said you had searched Morden and Mitchan, and advised that Doctors' Commons should be searched, and you went with Mrs. Parker to Doctors' Commons—you were constantly coming for money, stating it was for this and for that—I believe you told Mrs. Parker that you could only interfere with one thing at a time, and you would only go at first under the will of her husband's father—my husband is not a solicitor, he is a law stationer—I cannot tell you where he resides; I do not reside with him—for the last three years I have resided with Mrs. Parker—I did not separate from my husband; there has never been any separation—he leaves me, and returns when he has what he calls his <hi rend="italic">spree.</hi>—I have not seen him for three years, but we parted very good friends—he does not maintain me now—I summoned him before a Magistrate, and the consequence was he was compelled to maintain me—Mrs. Parker said she had 180, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the funds, and that her brother had sold out 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and her sister had sold out 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her daughter to go to Australia, and 15, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her husband's debts—I never went out with you and Mrs.</p>

               <p>Parker, but down to the Roebuck—we met you at the station, and she said, "I have brought my sick friend with me; as she is ill, and it is so fine a day, I think a ride will do her good"—we went to Buckhurst Hill—I heard something of the people at the Roebuck directing you to Mr. Jury—I went to the Roebuck with Mrs. Parker when you were not there—I lodged with Mrs. Parker from 25th May till Oct.—I was invited on a visit—I paid her 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—you asked me one morning the state of Mrs. Parker's mind—I mentioned about a child by George IV., and four children by the Duke of Wellington. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of the witness was here put in and read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever receive a letter from the Duke of Wellington? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I was eighteen or nineteen years of age—you told me you were going to throw up the case, and when Mrs. Parker came in you said it was a good case—you said so most decidedly—I asked for your card; you told me your letters were to be addressed to Newman Street—you said you kept your carriage—you said that Sir John Jervis was your father, and your sister was married to the Turkish ambassador—you said both in answer to questions—I have not known you to wait two or three hours for an omni<lb></lb>bus—I know Mrs. Parker received the rent of her house in Sloane Street—she said you bore the stamp of being a great man—I have been with Mrs. Parker to the City—I told Mr. Ingram I could not state on oath when the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid till I referred to my friend, and I find you received it on 11th Aug.—the signatures at the bottom of these sheets of paper are my hand<lb></lb>writing—by direction of Mrs. Parker, I signed Sarah Parker at the bottom—I did not read it; you did—I do not know whether you left it two days to be read—it might be two weeks for what I know—in all probability it was—I suppose you read it yourself—Mrs. Parker said to me, "I approve of that; my dear, I will trouble you to sign it." (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be a state<lb></lb>ment by Mrs. Parker of property to which she was entitled, and particulars relating to her family.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You talk of the service of writs; was it not the service of notices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You called them writs—I signed many—I did not read them all—I glanced over several—I never saw Mrs. Parker pay you any money except at Manor Street—she did not pay you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Buckhurst Hill—most de<lb></lb>cidedly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not come and put the two sovereigns on the table before me, and did you not see it, and tell me to take them up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Rein Deer that might have been, not at the Roebuck—she went to the Rein Deer to pay money, but what I do not know—I was there, she paid you some<lb></lb>thing, I cannot say what she paid you—you did not say before persons had a bill filed it was necessary to know what it was about, and she had better give the proper notice to know what it was, nor did I say it was perfectly correct—I signed some of the notices by Mrs. Parker's request—there were one or two which I did not approve of—you left some one night, and I kept them till the next day—I do not recollect receiving a letter by post on 11th Aug. (<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>—I recollect receiving this envelope—but this other paper was not enclosed in it—I positively swear that I could not enclose it in it—the signatures to all these sheets are mine—I do not know when I signed it (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be a statement by Mrs. Parker, that large sums to which she was entitled had been withdrawn from the bank by her nephew, George Neagus, her brother, and other parties.</hi>—I persist in stating that you told her you had filed the bill—I did not read these papers that I signed—you read them over, but I had not time to listen—you stated that the way</p>

               <p>was fair, everything was right, that she would have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next Saturday—I do not know whether you told Mrs. Parker that if she would make an affidavit that she was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world, besides her wearing apparel, after the payment of her just debts, that the Court of Chancery would assign her a solicitor—I do not know whether you showed her a petition—this is my writing to this paper (<hi rend="italic">This was a petition of Mrs. Parker to the Court of Chancery, applying for permission to plead.</hi> in forma pauperis)—this paper might have been left with me two or three days before it was signed—I do not recollect—I have heard you say to Mrs. Parker, "My dear madam"—I recollect going with her to Newman Street, to see a piece of writing—you did not put her to any expense for refresh<lb></lb>ment; you refused to take any refreshment with her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in custody for being tipsy on 30th Aug? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So it was stated—"I dined with Mrs. Parker that day—I really cannot recollect whether she prepared a shoulder of lamb for me, or whether I went out after dinner—I went out on that day, if it was 30th Aug.—I do not know whether I am bound to answer whether I got drunk, but I would say, "No"—I was taken up by the police, by Mrs. Parker's direction—I found myself in custody, and I said I knew not why I was there—I should say I was not in liquor—Mrs. Parker certainly came and got me out—I was not often tipsy when with her, not if she treated me—I was not often tipsy there, most decidedly not—I was not tipsy when I kept the papers all night—I was able to sign them, but I did not choose to sign them that night—I was not always more anxious to know about Mrs. Parker's business than she was herself—I did not always give the instructions; certainly not, only when she directed me—she keeps ardent spirits by her, and wine—she locks them up, and her tea and sugar, and other things—it was stated about her being mad before you produced a letter from her bro<lb></lb>ther, on 16th Aug.—I did not say I could prove to the contrary, and offer to leave the house and go to a neighbour, and fetch the doctor who was attending on her; most decidedly not—she and I had a quarrel, which gene<lb></lb>rally began in consequence of her referring to my husband—she used to market for herself, and she was under no restraint—I was her lodger, but she did everything as housekeeper—she kept house, and did as other people do—she did not talk as other people do—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi> is my writing—I recollect your coming perfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I tell Mrs. Parker that I had come in answer to your letter, to tell her I had not filed her bill at present, but I should want to see her pro<lb></lb>bate again first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What passed before I entered the parlour I cannot tell—when I entered, her niece came in immediately afterwards—I am not aware whether you asked Mrs. Parker for money—the first that was stated was, "They come to interrupt our business"—her niece said she had searched and found that you were no attorney, and there was no bill filed—you did not tell her there would be one filed—you distinctly told her the bill was filed—I am positive of it—the niece did not call her aunt a liar, and tell her she had had no children, nor did I get the doctor's bill and receipt to prove that she was not crazy—I did not say I was sorry that the niece had conducted herself in such a way, and say that I was afraid to go down into the kitchen to her—the niece said, "If I have insulted the gentleman, I beg his pardon;" and she laid a stress upon the <hi rend="italic">if.</hi>—you said you were an attorney, and you had a client very near, for whom you had done business for many years—you never said anything about having a clerk—I was not</p>

I heard you brought one statement; I do not know that I saw it—I heard some of it—you told me you should want 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service of notices—I thought you always honest—I thought you were going on right—I did not give instructions for you to be taken into custody; certainly not—I think I have paid you 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the whole—I do not recollect your saying that part of that was for writs—Mrs. Houghton paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I gave her her breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper—I have been several times to Newman Street—I never heard you say you had a country house—I believe you mentioned about a petition in Chancery for me to proceed <hi rend="italic">in forma pauperis</hi>—you said you could get me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—you said that as soon as any money was paid in they would make me an allowance, and appoint an attorney and counsel—you read the petition to me—I believe you called on me on 29th Sept.—I really do not know whether Mrs. Houghton was present—my niece was there—I never heard you ask me to make any will—you said you were going to file a bill—I recollect my niece came into the room very quickly—she said you were an impostor, and came to extort money—you</p>

               <p>might say that you had not come for money, but you were money out of pocket—I believe she did say she had been to the Chancellor, and there was nothing done—I believe she begged your pardon—you might offer to show her her uncle's letter—I think you pulled your certificate out of your pocket—I do not know whether Mrs. Houghton said she could prove I was not insane—it is very likely I called at Newman Street about the end of Aug., and request you would come and see me, as I was alone—I did not accuse my niece of stealing two tons of coals—I missed some Brussels carpet out of my house, and she had the care of it—I recollect your coming to my house on 31st Oct.—my nephew chanced to come in—I did not know he was in London—you might tell him that I was going to file a bill <hi rend="italic">in forma pauperis</hi>—you had better have kept it to yourself—he told me that you told him that I should have 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a week—you asked me for the probate, to examine it with the dates—I did not hear you tell him that you kept your carriage—I never heard you tell him you were the son of Sir John Jervis.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ever in my life get any money from you under the representa<lb></lb>tion that I was the son of Sir John Jervis and brother in law to the Turkish ambassador, and kept my carriage and country house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have repeat<lb></lb>edly told you "No"—I did not ask you why you did not come sooner after I had called at Newman Street—you did not ask me for any money that day—I do not recollect your bringing any affidavit—I believe you said you should return on the following Tuesday—I do not recollect that you opened the probate and began to read it—it was so sudden, about the person being ill in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, that I do not recollect anything more—I recollect your bringing the statement, and putting it into my nephew's hand, but he would not read it—you said you brought it for him to read to you and I—I asked you to tea, and you said you should like the lady to have a cup of tea, and you went out and came back, and partly fainted away; I gave you a glass of gin—I followed in the rear, and said I had nothing against you, and told them to leave you alone.</p>

               <p>the prisoner since he has been in custody—I am sure I did not say to him, "Are you related to Sir John Jervis, the Chief Justice?"—I did not remark on his coming to the house all weathers without a carriage, because I knew he had not a carriage; he always came in an omnibus or a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

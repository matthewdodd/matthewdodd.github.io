                  </hi>. I am clerk of the Petty-bag—the office is in Rolls'-yard, Chancery-lane—it is an office of the Court of Chancery. On 2d of Dec., in consequence of information, I went to look at some of the presses—the clerks were in the office, and the prisoner was amongst them—he had been employed in the office eight or nine months as a writing-clerk—I saw that some of the rolls were not in their places—I inquired of all the clerks who were in the office—the prisoner said he knew nothing about them—he came to the office again on the following Monday, a few minutes before ten o'clock, and at half-past ten, intending to make a further investigation I went to the room where he was in the habit of writing, and the foreman came down and said he had left—on the Monday I made further search in the presess where those parchments were kept, and ascertained that six rolls were missing—I made a communication to Lord Langdale, the Master of the Rolls, on the subject—I afterwards communicated with some of the police—the prisoner did not return to the office after Monday, 4th Dec.—the next I heard of him was by this letter from him, dated 15th Dec, stating that he was ill (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on 19th Dec. I received this other letter from him, stating that he had been trying to find the shop where he had left some rolls of parchment—in consequence of receiving that letter, I went to the police<lb></lb>office—four of the rolls of parchment which I discovered to have been taken from their place, were soon after this brought to me by Sergeant Shaw—on 21st Dec. 1 received this other letter from the prisoner—these are four of the rolls of parchment that were removed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner had no right to remove them, they are records which are preserved in the Petty-bag office—they relate to specifications of patent inventions—two of them are of the date of 1841, another of 1844, another of 1846, another of 1847; and one of them is of 1836—I have recovered four out of the six—two of them are still missing.</p>

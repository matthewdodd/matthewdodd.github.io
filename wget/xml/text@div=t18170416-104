On the 21st of February, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I asked a boy, of the name of Barcare (who was under my care), to make a thread for me; the prisoner interfered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160037"></xptr> and said that I drove Barcare about, as if he was my apprentice. I told him I would tell the master. Soon after one o'clock, the master came into the room; I told him, and he ordered us both to sit down to work, which we did-the master left the room. The prisoner got up, and called me a monkey; I immediately hit him, slightly, with my hand; he stood with a knife in his hand - He immediately stuck it into my body. I told the master I thought he had stabbed me. I opened my bosom, and saw a cut; the prisoner said, he was sorry for what he had done, and we shook hands - He had the knife in his hand when I struck him. I do not think he owed me any malice when he did it.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the proof did not come within the meaning of the Act, as it was not done with malice aforethought, it being done at the impulse of a moment.</p>

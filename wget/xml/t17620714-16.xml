               <p>Q. What do you do with razors?</p>
               <p>Kettle. I shave myself; I happened to have them in my pocket. They said, if I made any noise or resistance there was a press-gang, and that I should go with them. I said, I was willing to go with them. They were going to strip me of my stockings and shirt. The evidence said, let him make the best of his way off. I discovered it to Mr. Fielding; this was on the Sunday: I went on Monday and described all four.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your things again?</p>
               <p>Kettle. No, I never saw them again.</p>

               <p>Kettle. I am very positive: three of them were taken up on the other side of the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sugar-loaf-court, Fleet-street, and am a carman—I did live with Mr. Norris, of Holborn. This occurred on the night of the 20th of August—I remember seeing the prisoner—I had not known him before—I was sober—I was passing down Holborn, and he and another soldier struck me with a stick—I asked them if they called that respectable conduct, and said if there was a policeman near I would give them into custody—I went on, and they begged my pardon—I said if they liked to have a pot of beer I would pay for it—they went into the Black Boy and Camel, in Leadenhall-street, and had one pot, and then a second—then we came out, and I remember no more—I had two keys, a knife, a tobacco-box, a piece of brass chain and some other articles—a half-sovereign, a half-crown, and the other money—I had it all safe in the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Whitechapel, and am a labourer. On this Sunday evening, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor opposite my door, in Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane—they were standing there as I was going home—the prosecutor seemed very drunk—I looked up, and the prisoner asked him if he had any money—the prosecutor said he had got plenty—his hat fell off—I took it up and put it on again, and he said, "I think you will protect me"—I said, "I will get a policeman, he will protect you"—the prosecutor then laid down on his right side, and the prisoner on his right side, and I saw the prisoner put his right hand into the prosecutor's left hand pocket—I sent my wife for the policeman, when he came I told the policeman to catch hold of his hand, and in it was a couple of keys, a knife, and comb—no money was found—we awoke the prosecutor, and said, "Ought you to have any money?" he said yes, he ought to have 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. Bryant's wife called me—I went up and saw the prosecutor and prisoner lying on the right side—Bryant said, "Catch that man's hand," and I took these things from the prisoner—he said he was a cousin of his, and was protecting him—I took the prisoner to the station-house, but found nothing—he was so very violent he threw me several times—I could not get him to the station till I got another man—I was obliged to put my knee on him while I took these things from him by force, as he was about to put them into his pocket—I produce them.</p>

We went home with one female, and I stopped in the passage while he went in, and when he came out I went in, and these things laid on the bed—when I came out he was on the ground, and I fell down by the side of him—there were three of us together, and he went to three public houses with us—he persuaded me to stop out with him, and said he would pay for any thing we wanted.</p>

When I was down, the prisoner ran up and took my shawl. I caught hold of him by the tail of his coat, and he handed the shawl to another man.

            . I am patrol of Aldgate. On the 17th of October, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went towards the corner, and saw the prosecutrix all over mud, and the prisoner standing by her, who she said had taken her shawl; she had not hold of him, but stood up close by him; he did not attempt to run away, and said he did not take it himself, but that he saw another take it. His coat was torn. There were a great many people round.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went with a young man to have a pint of beer - he went into the chandler's shop - I was waiting for him. This woman came out with two men, turned up an alley, and when she got about half-way up, the young man in a fustian jacket took her shawl off. She passed me three or four times in the street for half an hour, and then took me. My coat was torn three days before.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Bell-alley. I had information that two young men were concerned in this robbery; I apprehended them, and took them to the Mansion House. White said she could not positively swear to them - their names were Agnue and Switcher. She got hold of Agnue's mother, who said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, do not swear to my son." She said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care, so as I get the value of my shawl - that is all I want, and shall not appear." I took these prisoners to the Thames Police, and when she got there, she said she could not swear to either of them. The Magistrate committed them as vagrants, and as she came out, the mother of one of them said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d ***, see what a sovereign will do." White then came to me and said,</p>
               <p>"I fear I have done wrong - I have taken a sovereign of Mrs. Agnue." I said she had done very wrong.</p>

            . It is quite wrong; no such thing happened. I never told Mr. Agnue I would not appear if I got the value of my shawl. I left Mrs. Agnue in the office. I never received a sovereign from Mr. or Mrs. Agnue, nor ever spoke to either of the witnesses. I saw Trueman at the office, and said, I did not wish to hurt any one, if my shawl was made good; Agnue's father said he would pay what I valued it at - he said to me,</p>

               <p>"Mrs. White, here is 1 l. for yourself," and threw it on the taproom table - I did not take it up. I never told Trueman I had received 1 l. from Agnue.</p>

               <p>Did you go to bed? - No, I did nothing with her ; I missed my money as soon as she got me up stairs; she put out the candle that I could not find the way down stairs; I am sure I had the money when I went into the house; I felt her hand in my pocket as soon as she put the candle out, and missed my money; I would have pursued her, but could not find the way down; I am positive the prisoner is the woman; she was taken up the next morning; I knew her again as soon as she was taken.</p>

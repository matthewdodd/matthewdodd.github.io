Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 30th of April, I was just gone into my back parlour, and heard a noise of my till, which is behind the counter - I saw, by the reflection of a glass door, the prisoner's hand shutting the till - I went to him, and accused him of opening the till; he denied it, and asked for a halfpenny orange - I drew out the till, and missed the money; he ran away, I pursued - he turned a corner, and I saw him throw something away - Mr. Griffiths brought him back; I missed 6s. from my till.</p>

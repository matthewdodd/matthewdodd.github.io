I asked his name; he gave me some name, and said he belonged to the 1st Regiment, and was going to take the coat to the Swan stairs - I gave it to him.</p>

            . I am a private in the Coldstream Guards. On the 10th of November, I saw the prisoner at my quarters, the Blue Posts, public-house, ripping the lace off the musician's jacket - he said he gave 15 s. for it. Farmer was holding the buttons - they stripped the lace entirely off, and went away; the prisoner came in soon after, and said he had sold the coat for 1 s., and Farmer sold the lace for 18 s.</p>

            . I am a porter. On the 10th of November, I saw the prisoner in Piccadilly, between twelve and one o'clock, with a bundle under his arm - he asked me to give him something to drink - I said I had no money - he said he had something that would make money; that he had bought a jacket, and would either pawn or sell it; he offered it for sale in the tap-room - nobody would buy it; he asked me to help him strip off the lace, which I did, and went with him to a house in Princes-street; he waited outside while I went in to sell it. I came out, gave him the money, and he said he had sold the coat for 1 s.</p>

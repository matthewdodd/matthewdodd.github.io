                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What were the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Coats and trousers—this was early in December, about seven or eight weeks back—to my knowledge the prisoner was never taken to the police-court by Wilkinson—he was never taken to the Mansion House and charged with stealing a coat, to my knowledge—I was before the Magistrate when he was charged with this offence—I did not give evidence—I was not called upon—I don't know why—I was there to give evidence if I had been called upon.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see the person who had these things for sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Early in December; he was offering them for sale in the public market—according to the appearance of them, I should think there were about sixty or seventy articles—they were laid out on a bench or form—there are stalls there—I am sure they were the identical goods that I afterwards saw at the prisoner's place—I don't think I had ever seen the person before.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understand a toll is paid to go into the market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that goes to the proprietor of the market—everybody pays, whether they go to buy or sell, every day except Sunday—if you go to buy on Sunday you don't pay—that is not the great sale day—there is a great sale every day—thousands of pounds a day, wholesale and retail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pickle merchant—I know the market, but I am not a frequenter of it—I have known the prisoner for the last twenty-three years, we were schoolboys together—on 18th December last I lost my wife; it is our practice to keep confined mourning, and on 26th or 27th December the prisoner was with me keeping a convivial meeting.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you happen to know whether or not between 3rd December and the 26th he went over to Boulogne? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of the sort—I know on 18th December he was at my house—I saw him right up to the morning of 1st January, regularly every day, or nearly every day—I know I saw him during the last week of December—I could not exactly swear to seeing him between the 3rd and the 18th—I saw him nearly every day during the latter part of December.</p>

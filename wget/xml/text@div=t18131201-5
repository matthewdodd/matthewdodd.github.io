               <p>REV. EDWARD BOWEN. I live at Stanmore. On the 13th of November last, I was coming to town in a post chaise; I had three portmanteaus on the foot-board with straps, and passing through <placeName id="t18131201-5-crimeloc24">Bow</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18131201-5-crimeloc24" type="placeName" value="Bow"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t18131201-5-crimeloc24" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18131201-5-off21 t18131201-5-crimeloc24"></join> I heard a knocking under the chaise; I looked out before and behind; I saw nothing but men in a cart. I again heard the noise was forward; I looked out; I saw a hand coming from under the chaise; I opened the door, and called stop. I then saw the prisoner recovering himself from stooping, run off; I pursued him, and brought him back. The post-boy pointed out to me the portmanteaus; I saw the straps hanging down.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what had been moved - A. Instead of the portmanteaus standing right square, they were a little oblique, but still on the foot-board; they were a little out of the line they had been placed when we sat off from Romford. Neither of the portmanteaus were removed from the spot where they had been.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was an attempt to commit a felony, but very properly prevented; it will be unnecessary to go any further in this case. There was an attempt to commit a felony, but the party was interrupted before it was done.</p>

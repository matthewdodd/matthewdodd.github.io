                  </hi>. I live at 6, Silver Street, Limehouse, and am a labourer—about 12.10 on the night of 19th April I saw the prisoner kicking at the door of 1, Nelson Court—the prosecutor came out, and pushed him away—they had a bit of a tussle, and the prisoner pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the groin—he fell down—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand while they were tussling—the prisoner ran away—I followed him, and gave him in custody—he was not drunk—he was sober enough to run—he had had a little.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Poplar Hospital—Conway was brought there on 19th April, suffering from a wound in the right testicle—I it was cut about half through—the scrotum was cut, of course—there was also a wound in the right groin, about four inches long—they were both incised wounds, such as would be inflicted by a knife—they were dangerous on account of the bleeding—they bled profusely—he is almost well now.</p>

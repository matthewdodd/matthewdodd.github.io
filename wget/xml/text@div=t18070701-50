            . I live partly by graizing, and partly upon a copyhold estate, in the marsh at Hackney. On the 21st of May, the prisoner came to my house at Hackney, he asked me if I had any grass to let, I told him I had plenty, I was going to open a field. On that same day he turned in a black cropped horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him. - A. No, I had never seen him to the best of my knowledge before, I enquired of him where he lived, and as it was in the new neighbourhood at Hackney, the new buildings, I did not think it necessary to enquire. On Thursday he came again, and asked me if I would let him turn in another horse; I told him I could for a guinea a month; being a small horse, and he a name sake, I was rather inclined to favour him. I heard no more of the black horse till the 9th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was leaning over the hatchway of my outward premises; a neighbour coming by said, there is a strange piece of work down in the new neighbourhood; I heard no more of it till Atkins came for the horse; I had suspicion that the horse was not honestly come by; I followed Atkins, Salmon and the prisoner, they were all three together. I saw the prisoner in the act of haltering the black horse, they had got in the field; I said, generally, I addressed myself to neither of the three. I hope you are not going to take this horse out without paying me for keep, if you are it is very unusual; Atkins replied, I do not know that we shall pay you for the keep, for I conceive this horse is stolen, and I shall take it away; I said I thought myself justified in detaining it. They gave me their address; from that time the horse was out of my possession. That horse was in my possession from the 21th of May, till the 9th of June.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 9th of June I in company with Atkins, apprehended the prisoner at the bar in Hackney field; we asked the prisoner what he had done with a little black horse he had at Leicester, and whether he had sold him; he paused a little; he then said he had not sold him, if we would give him leave to walk with us, he would show us where the horse was; accordingly we all three went together; he pointed out the horse in the field; he said that is the horse, if you will give me leave, I will catch him; he accordingly catched the horse, put a halter on him, and delivered him into my hands; he said that was the horse that he had from Leicester. Mr. Baxter has seen it and has sworn to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you agree that if he kept him longer, he was wellcome to do so, provided he paid five shillings a day. - A. No, he said he would come back the next day at ten.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) You have seen that horse. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it, a black gelding. - A. Yes, a black gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it. - A. I had it on the 26th of March, when I entered on that public house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Pearce) Did you find out where he lived. - A. No, I did not know any thing of him; he lived in the new buildings, knowing they were all new inhabitants, I made no enquiry.</p>

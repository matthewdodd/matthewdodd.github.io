                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 159 <hi rend="italic">R)</hi>. On Sunday evening, June 7, about 6.25, I was on duty in a field close by the North Kent Railway, in plain clothes—a bridge crosses the railway there—I saw the prisoners and two other boys, and while I was watching them an up train passed on the Chatham and Dover line—I saw them throw at it, and saw a stone strike the carriages and rebound from them, Gray was on the stonework, and Parker on the ironwork—they both threw several stones at the train—a down train passed at the same time, and I saw Gray throw a large white stone, about the size of a man's fist, it missed the driver and struck the funnel of the engine—they were directly over the engine—I was about twenty yards from them—I went towards them, and they ran away—Gray, knowing me, stopped and said, "It is all right, Mr. Ling, we have all done so"—I afterwards took Parker in Charles Street, and told him the charge—he said, "I will prove you are all liars"—Harvey was one of the boys with them, but he did not throw at the train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gray</hi>. Harvey was picking up stones, and throwing them where you could not see him. I was only showing which line the next train would come on, and the stone struck the funnel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Parker</hi>. He only said, "What is your name!" He took me to the station, and never opened his mouth to me. We were all playing together. He did not see me throw stones.</p>

I was on duty, in plain clothes, with Ling, and saw the prisoner with two other boys, one of whom was Harvey, on the iron bridge that crosses the South-Eastern line—I heard one boy say, "Here comes a train"—I then saw the two prisoners and another boy picking up stones—parker was on the iron was, and Gray on the stone coping, and as the train passed over, they threw the stones down with all their force, two or three times—I saw two stones bounce from a carriage about half way along the train—there was no danger of their going in at the windows; the danger was to the guard—another train passed at the same time, and they threw at that—Harvey said, "Do not do that, you will be fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—both were passenger trains.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gray</hi>.

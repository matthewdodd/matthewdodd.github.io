             (Police-constable C 118.) I was on duty in King-street - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he was the first person running; I asked what he was running for - he said to see what was the matter, but the people were all behind him- while I was speaking to him the prosecutrix came up, and charged him with having stolen her purse.</p>

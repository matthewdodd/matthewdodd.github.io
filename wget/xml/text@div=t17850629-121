               <p>What did you do in consequence of seeing the child in that situation? - I took it into my own house that night, and the next day, I sent it to the workhouse at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Court to Batt. When did you first see the child, and where? - At the end of the court, some women had got round the child, she child was then just by Mr. Taylor's door.</p>
               <p>Who were with it? - Some women had gathered about the child, it was crying for its mamma.</p>
               <p>Mr. James to Taylor. As you had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290152"></xptr> the child, what did you do to learn to whom it belonged? - I advertized it some days after, and in consequence of some information I received , I apprehended the prisoner, and she said, that child was her's, that it was a bastard child born in the parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and that she had applied to the parish for some relief, and they refused it, because she did not belong to that parish, and that she brought it to us, because she could not maintain it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any threat or promise made to her? - No, not a word, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Where has the child been since ? - At our workhouse.</p>

               <p>Court to Taylor. Did you hear her mention the age of the child? - When she was apprehended she said it was four years old.</p>

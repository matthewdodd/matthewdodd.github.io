               <p>Court. Confine yourself to the stockings mentioned in the indictment. - This is the pair that the prisoner had; I secured the prisoner immediately, I stood by the area when she dropped them. (The stockings produced.) I saw them taken out.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to them being Mrs. Smithers's? - Yes, Sir, they are my own marking.</p>
               <p>Court. What value do you put upon them? I will tell you the consequence of it, if you swear that they are above the value of 5 s. it is a capital offence, and her life is affected if the jury find her guilty. - The stockings cost us 11 s. you may value them at what you please, I would not wish her hanged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Was there any other persons in the shop at this time? - Yes, there was a person that lives in Gloucester-street.</p>

               <p>A. Readman. Two months and about three or four days. On the 3d of October Mrs. Hill came and told me they had stop'd some cheeses, and asked me if I had been robbed. I said that I did not know that I had, and asked what sort of a person brought them; she said there were two men and a woman brought three cheeses and a ham to her house in Little-Britain, and described a man in such cloaths as the prisoner usually wore. I ask'd if he was cross-ey'd [the prisoner was such ] she said he was; I went there and saw the cheeses; they have been there ever since, 'till this day. [Produced in court.] As to the ham I can't swear to that, but these cheeses were bought for me by Mr.

             at Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire; by the look of them, I have the rest of the same dairy at home. Here is my mark plain on one of the Cheshire cheeses; and here is one of them a Gloucestershire cheese, of which I have some of the same at home, but cannot be positive to that. I cannot say when the prisoner took them: It might be while he liv'd with me for what I know, but whether he took them out of the warehouse, cellar, or shop, I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever sell cheeses in the cellar?</p>
               <p>A. Readman. We take people there to look at them.</p>
               <p>Martha Hill. On the morning after last Michaelmas-day a woman came to me and told me she had four cheeses sent her out of the country, and she wanted to dispose of them; the next morning my maid told me two men and a woman brought them after my shop was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I live in Little-Britain, I sell grocery ware, cheese, and other things; I thought it was a bad affair; so desired Mr. Prentice, a very large dealer near Smithfield-Bars, to come and look at them, to see whose mark was on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I can't tell that, only by what the prisoner said; he said to me he brought them. They were left in the passage, the shop being shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them first?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. The next morning about seven o'clock in the passage: Mr. Prentice came and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260023"></xptr> at the cheeses, and took the marks on a piece of paper, in order to shew amongst the trade in the afternoon. The woman spoke to me about buying them. I said to her here are not all the cheeses you mentioned to me; she said she had disposed of one. I asked her how she came by them, she said they came by sea, consign'd to her cousin Readman. I asked her if she had any letter of advice, and desired her to fetch it. She went and did not return. After that came a man with an order for us to deliver them, there was no name to it. A little after came the prisoner at the bar, and asked if a porter had not been for them; we said yes, he said why did not you deliver them, we said we had some reasons for stopping them; after that came a person from Thames-street and desired to look at them, he did, and said they were Mrs. Readman's cheeses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. No; he went away again. We acquainted Mrs. Readman of it, and she came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I don't exactly know the time, but when I did, I heard him confess he stole them from the prosecutrix.</p>

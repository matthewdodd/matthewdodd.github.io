               <p>The prisoner lodged with me, he paid my wife some rent, and pulled out some money more than she thought he could come by honestly; she said that boy has been robbing some body; I hope it is not our money. I went up stairs and looked in my box, which was hid in my bed-chamber, at the head of my bed; there were half-guineas and guineas, to the amount of twenty-two guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you counted the money in it before? - About eight days before, I missed it on the 22d of September, about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it hid? - it was up behind the bed in a corner.</p>
               <p>Who knew where that box was hid? - Nobody but my wife. The prisoner did not come home all night, the next morning I apprehended him at his master's shop; he owned he had robbed me, and that he had given a man a guinea, and eleven half-crowns; he said he took it, but not quite so much, he would not say the exact sum; I did not ask him where he took it from; he said he took it from me, he owned to about six guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you say to him to induce him to tell you this? - I charged him with it, and he said he did take it, and he hoped I would forgive him. I told him I must have him before a magistrate; I made him no promise at all: I apprehend he went in the day time, as my wife is hard of hearing, and searched the room. He did not tell me how he took it.</p>

               <p>Did not you wonder how the lad came by two guineas and a half? - No Sir, I knew where he worked.</p>

               <p>The boy's master gave him a good character; and said that Trigg's wife fetched a halter downstairs, and told the boy he would be hanged if he did not confess. Trigg said he did not remember any such thing.</p>

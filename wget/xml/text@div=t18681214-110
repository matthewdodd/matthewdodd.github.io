                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Simms, of Old Brentford—on 10th December, I went to bed at 9 o'clock—I was disturbed in the morning by hearing the striking of a lucifer down stairs, and heard footsteps below—I aroused my husband, lit a candle, went down and saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing with his back to the entrance door, inside—I said, "Oh, you wretch! what do you do here?"—he said, "I want a bushel of sprats from Mr. Dobson's, but I have come to the wrong house"—he had got a bushel basket, empty—I asked him how he got in—he said, "Through the window"—and so he had, for I found the curtain broken down and the shutters undone; they bad been pushed back and pushed to again—the door and window were shut the night before—my husband came down, we called the police, and the prisoner was given in custody—he had no appearance of drunkenness—nothing was disturbed in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You told the Magistrate you fastened the shutter with a nail. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I generally used to put a nail in the window, but I did not do so that night; it is a very slight bolt—I found the door unlocked and the key placed outside, on the bricks—I had left it inside over-night—I knew you by sight, but not by name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. My wife called me, lit a candle, and went down stairs—I followed her, and collared the prisoner, who was standing with his back to the street door, which was shut—I asked him how he came there—he said he had made a mistake, and come to the wrong house, he meant Dobson's house, after a bushel of sprats—he tried to get away once, while a neighbour was gone for a policeman—I saw the window closed the night before, with a slight bolt, and when I came down it was closed and the curtains drawn—the door had been opened, and the key put outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Did not you hesitate a good while before you gave me in charge? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—you tried to get away, and made a plunge, but I got you by the throat, and held you against the wall, while my wife called</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T R</hi> 44). I was on night duty, and was called at 1.15 or 1.20—I found the prisoner detained by Simms, in his house—I took him to the station, went back and examined the premises—I found the window blind, which fastens on each side, broken down and hanging by one end.; the shutters closed but not bolted, and a mark on them as if a strong nail or a knife had been forced between them—the key was lying against the wall outside—I found on the prisoner this knife, this piece of candle, and a penny—the prosecutor found three lucifers in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. A young man named Angel, who I think is a relation of these people, came to my house and asked me to go out to work with him. He said, "Call me up about I or 1.30, and we will get some sprats and sell them." He said that he lived at the second or third house on the left, and went there to have a lie down." I got half drunk. I knocked at the door, nobody answered, and by rattling the door it came half a-jar. I thought he must be drunk. I lit my pipe, and then saw the woman coming down stairs; she said, "What do you want here, you wretch?" I said, "I have come to see Angel." She said, "No; you have got in at the window." Even if she did fasten it, it is quite feasible that other people might open it as well as me. She knows that I am innocent, only there is some disagreement between me and her stater's husband. We have been fighting several times. I know the woman perfectly well, she is poorer than myself. Is it likely that I should break open a house where I knew I should find nothing?</p>

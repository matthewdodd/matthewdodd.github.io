             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Flack, at Ware: The mare lost was in his straw-yard, she was lost on the 10th of December; I saw her there with others between six and seven o'clock, I fastened the gate with a chain and nail; I went to the yard between four and five o'clock the next morning, and did not see the mare, the gate was shut, but fastened in a different manner; indeed it was only shut to. Four horses were gone as well as the mare, which I have seen since; she was found in Smithfield; I had her in my care but three or four days, and took no particular notice of her, but I think it was the same mare; she was a grey mare, and there was no other in my master's yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. On the 10th there was a grey mare, and four others, in the strawyard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened the gate, and the next morning the chain and nail was unlassened, and five horses had strayed away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had strayed away, did you ever find any of them? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they found? - A. Yes; four were found the next morning, in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw a grey cart mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said that you could not take upon yourself to swear it was the same mare that was in Mr. Flack's straw-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. My Friend has talked about straying - I take it for granted a horse could not unchain the gate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Four horses, and the grey mare, strayed out of the yard, as my Friend calls it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the grey mare found her way to Smithfield to be sold? - A. Yes; I hear so.</p>

             sworn. - I work for Mr. Humphreys, and came up to London after the mare, I knew her well: I went to Smithfield on the 11th of December, where I saw her tied up to the rails for sale; I inquired for a constable before I did any thing, then I went up to the man, and asked who was the owner, Chester said he had got the selling of her; I immediately gave charge of him; he said he had the selling of her for another man, and wanted us to wait till the man came. I am sure it was my master's mare; Chester lived at Ware, but has followed no business lately.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. When you came to Smithfield, you saw a grey mare belonging to Mr. Humphreys? - A. Yes.</p>

He tied the grey mare up to the rail, and said he would return; then that man came and asked me who was the owner, and I told him a man had left the price with me; the constable took me to Giltspur-street Compter, and I wished to wait till the man came back, because, as I said, I was not the real owner, though I had the price of it.</p>

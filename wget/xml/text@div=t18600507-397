                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Conduit-street, and am Chairman of the German Benevolent Society, and have for some time past assisted my countrymen in distress in this country—In June 1857, I received a com<lb></lb>munication from the embassy; and in consequence of what Count Kotheck told me I went to Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square, first floor, and found Madame De Welzenstein—I told her I had been sent to enquire into her circumstances, and asked her how she came to apply for assistance—she said that her husband, who was an officer in the Austrian Army, was going to America; that he arrived in London in May, and had pawned every article he had; in order to enable him to go to America in search of an uncle who was a rich man over there, and that she had supported herself and her child by needle-work—there was a child in the room about five years old—I enquired how it was that she was in such distress—she said that the season was over, and she had had no work for some time; and had been without food for some days—I enquired, as she lived in such com<lb></lb>fortable lodgings, whether the furniture was her's—she said that the apart<lb></lb>ments were hired by a friend of her husband's, Mr. Sterafeldt, whose wife was in very delicate health, and lived out of town; and as he had no use for the rooms and could not give them up, having taken them by the year</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070016"></xptr>
               <p>he allowed her to make use of them during the day; and she had a room on the third floor, for which she paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said that her friend was a brother officer serving in the same regiment with her husband—I gave her half-a-crown and told her I would see what I could do for her—I called again next day and left her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she called at my shop on 7th July and I gave her a letter of recommendation to the German Benevolent Society; they allowed her a sovereign, which I took to her on the following day; she thanked me and I thought I had done with her, but about the middle of August she called again with the child; she cried, and was in great distress—I enquired how it was she waa not better off; she said that all the money I had given her went for the purpose of paying the interest on pawn tickets for goods of some value which she had pawned—I told her it was no charity for her to receive money to pay the interest on pawn tickets—she said that she did not know what to do with them—I suggested that it would be better to sell the tickets than be paying twenty per cent. interest to a pawnbroker; it being quite impossible under her present circumstances to redeem them—she said that nobody would buy them, and she could only retain them as long as the goods would be redeemable—I said that I would look over the tickets if she brought them, and see whether the articles were of any use or value to me; and she brought about twenty-three tickets to me on the same day; consisting of silks, shirts, and other trifling articles—I questioned her whether she had come fairly by them; she said that she had brought them from Germany or Vienna where her husband had been in quarters, and if I should like to have them, she would give them to me altogether for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so as to get money immediately, and do some business—I thought the goods were worth more than the money for which they were pledged, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I arranged that they should be taken out of pawn—I gave my foreman 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he did so—he then sorted them; and one third which I considered of no use to me I returned to her—these were female's clothes and coats; the other two thirds were sorted out; and having ascertained the value of the silks, they were left at my shop, and my people had instructions to ask my friends to buy, but they all said that the price was too high; they consequently remained at my shop till October, and during that period she had repeatedly received money; it amounted to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was beyond the full value; they had been in pawn and were knocked about—during that period I saw her once or twice only, because I was out of town—after my return I received a communication which caused me to go to Charlotte-street—I made a list of the money which she had drawn, and gave her a few shillings to go on with—she came to me on 18th October, 1857, in a state of illness—the child was not with her—(I believe she had brought the child on two other-occasions)—she said that she had been very ill in consequence of having a child, and had had Dr. Stancoff, who had advised her to go to the German Hospital, which she decidedly refused—I could not get rid of her, and to pacify her I said that I would send my doctor, Mr. Louth of Brook-street, to see her, and he did—during her illness I frequently called to see how she was getting on—up to the period of her illness I had never seen Edward De Welzenstein, or Jourdan; but one evening when I called, Madame Jourdan was there, or rather Madame Poninska she called herself—I first saw her about three days after 18th October—Madame De Welzenstein said during her illness, that her friend Sternfeldt's wife would not allow her to occupy the bed, as she might have a disease which might be dangerous; and she was to occupy a sofa in the front room—she was ill about thirteen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070017"></xptr>
               <p>or fourteen days; Poninska was not present on the occasions when I spoke I about Sternfeldt—I saw her about three days after the doctor first called; and when she heard my name she said that she was most happy in haying met me on such a good occasion, and would I come and see her—I did not see her there again till a fortnight after, on a Sunday, but she said scareely anything—they were at tea—I had occasion to go there about 6 o'clock—De Welzenstein had some work at Eaton-piace—Madame Poninsks wished me to get some work for her among my Mends as she had known her some time, that she was a most excellent woman whose husband had gone away, and all that story over again—I had no reason to disbelieve her—she said that Sternfeldt was merely a friend who was very kind to her, and assisted her as much as he could, but believed his means were not very large, and he could not entirely support Madame De Welzenstein out of the means that he had, having a wife who was ill herself—when De Welzeustein got better I told her that I should be glad if she would send her friend to me, as I could arrange with a man about her future position much better than I could with her, and if he would come to me I would talk the matter over with him; and he did call at the latter end of October at my place of business, and said, "I have been asked by Madame De Welzenstein to call on you; my name is Sternfeldt, you wish to see me"—I said, "I have done a good deal, and she is not in a better condition that when I first knew her"—I related the case of the sale of the tickets, and asked him if he had seen the note I had made of the tickets, and if he was satisfied, as the friend of Madame De Welzenstein—he said, "Yes; you have paid much more thai the value of it"—I said, "I do not mind, provided I have done some good to her;" and referred to that I had done—he said, "Unfortunately what you have done she has very little benefit out of, because she was so deeply in debt to a variety-of people, who came as soon as they found she had some money"—he stated that he had known her and her husband in the Austrian service, that De Welzenstein was a most honourable man, and he could only speak in the best terms of Madame De Welzenstein, and had supported her in her husband's absence, who had gone to America in search of an uncle—he gave me the address, but it was simply "New York"—I did not keep the paper, I agreed to communicate with America—he said that he was in the same Austrian regiment with the husband, who was superior to him, and that he regretted much that they had not had any information from the husband since he had gone, and could not account for his not writing to his wife, as he was such an excellent honour<lb></lb>able man, and it was quite uncertain when he would be back—at the interview with Madame De Welzenstein, I said that I must Bpeak to Madame Poninska, as a better woman of business, as to how to put her into something; and I Baw her, I suppose, the next day at her place in Mount-street—she asked me to come and see her and to speak about the position of this woman—she repeated that she was in a position to recommend Madame De Welzenstein to customers when she was in a respectable lodging to receive them, and of course she wanted some ineanb—on a Sunday evening in October, about 4 o'clock, I called at Charlotte-street, and found the four prisoners all together, and a person named Watford—I did not stay more than twenty minutes, because the people were all unknown to me, except seeing Madame Paninska about twice, and Sternfeldt having called on me once a day or two before, at my house, between 18th and 26th October—when I left, Madame De Welzenstein followed me down stairs; she complained that she was still very ill, and that it was very wrong for Sternfeldt to have brought company to</p>

               <p>the house on a Sunday without bringing a servaut to wait on them—subse<lb></lb>quently to that visit, a person named Corn came to me, and in consequence of that I went a day or two afterwards to 5, Charlotte-street—I knocked at the door and asked the servant whether Madame De Welzenstein was within, she said, "Yes"—I was in a cab, and she came down at my request—I told her that Corn had stated to me that she and the person named Sternfeldt were man and wife, that her name was Statina, and that the child which she exhibited as her own was one she had borrowed—she asked me where I had the information from; and when I told her the name, Corn, she said, "How could you believe such a scoundrel as that man is?" and denied it entirely—I then left, after asking if Freicke who lived in the house was at home, and if she would send him to me at the club—the club and the society meet in one house—Freicke called, and I told him that Mr. and Mrs. Corn had called at my house and stated that Madame De Welzenstein and Sternfeldt were man and wife, and that the child was a borrowed one, and I wanted him to tell me the truth how the matter stood—I said, "You must be aware of the facts, and I want to know from you how it is"—he said that Corn was a liar and a swindler, and in fact everything that was bad, and he very much regretted that his sister, Mrs. Corn, should be a party to such a false transaction; that it was all a fabrication of Corn's, and advised me to see Corn again and get proof of the fact—I called on Madame De Welzen<lb></lb>stein the same day, and said, "I am afraid the case in Charlotte-street is not quite so clear as you have represented to me"—after relating the circumstances, she asked who had given the information—I said, "Corn;" she burst out, and asked how I could be such a dupe as to be imposed upon by such a person as him, that I ought to have known better and not have believed it—she then told me she would bring me proof that it was all a fabri<lb></lb>cation—Madame Poninska afterwards called at my place twice; the second time she found me at home, and asked me to come with her to Charlotte-street to see the truth that the child was not a borrowed one—I got into a cab with her and drove to 5, Charlotte-street—we were asked up stairs and shown into the first room—two females were in the back room, Madame Bordfeldt and Madame De Welzenstein, but nobody else—after some general conversation, one of the women went out and brought up the child which I had seen with Madame De Welzenstein before—Madame Bordfeldt spoke to the child and coaxed her, stroked her face, and said, "Go and bring your mamma"—she desired me to sit down on a chair and listen—the child went straight away and brought Madame De Welzenstein—she said,"Is this your mamma?" the child said, "Yes"—she then said, "Are you satisfied, Sir?"—I said, "Not quite"—I said to the child, "Who is that other lady?"—she said, "That is aunt De Bordfeldt;" "Now," said she, "Are you satisfied?" and if you are not, you must be an unbelieving Jew"—the farce was then over, and I thought it was all right—during the next week or fortnight Madame Poninska called on me, and also sent letters; she invariably reverted to the circumstances of Madame De Welzenstein, and the trick that Corn played, and how unfortunate she was—of course I regretted it, and she asked me if I would be good enough to go and see Madame De Welzenstein, as she was in a most dreadful state of mind under the circum<lb></lb>stances, and that I should be perfectly satisfied by her future conduct that she was a respectable woman—I went about 8 in the evening and found Madame De Welzenstein by herself—after being there a few minutes she had said nothing, and I had very little to say—I said that I called at the request of Madame Poninska, and that I understood she kit very much hurt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070019"></xptr>
               <p>at my believing the imposition of Corn; that I was informed so and was I obliged to enquire, and she ought not to blame me in it, it was Mr. Corn—she said, "I am most happy to find that I have met you, you have been like a father to me, you are my saviour"—I went about kissing my hands—just as I this was taking place, the door opened and I saw a head, but could not I recognize the person as I had not my spectacles on—she jumped up, and I said, "What is that?"—she said, "It is Sternfeldt"—I said, "Why does not he come in"—I heard an extraordinary <hi rend="italic">screech</hi> and it rather startled me—she ran towards the door, and they went into the back room—the door between the two rooms was not open—I heard a very loud con<lb></lb>versation and stood three or four minutes; nobody came—I thought it was not a very pleasant position, and thought of Corn and that perhaps it might have been a trap—I went away, and in about an hour and a half, Madame De Welzenstein and the woman called at the club—I went and asked what, they wanted—she said that her friend Sternfeldt had made such an extraor<lb></lb>dinary assertion, and would I be good enough to go home with her and explain to him that what she did was nothing wrong at all—I refused to go, because I thought the woman had insulted me, and did not go; I promised to write a letter and state what had occurred, as she said that it would be of great com<lb></lb>sequence to her when her husband came home from America—I wrote the letter next day and left it myself at 5, Charlotte-street—from that time I never heard anything more about the occurrence at the house on that night, until the action was brought—soon after the letter. I have spoken of, I called on Madame Poninska at her place in Mount-street—I had a conversation there with her and with a person who was there who represented himself as Sternfeldt—that must have been a few days after; a couple of days—<hi rend="italic">what took place was respecting taking the house</hi>—I believe Madame Poninska introduced the matter; she stated it to be the best, and that Sternfeldt had ample means to furnish the house, and it only depended on Madame De Welzenstein having some money to furnish the ground floor, which she was to occupy for the purpose of carrying on the business of a milliner—Sternfeldt seemed to take it as a matter of course; he had sufficient at the time, he was certain of it—he said he should have means coming from Vienna—that applied to the means of furnishing the place; and Madame Poninsks proposed that a subscription should be made, and a raffle—that matter I dare say occupied three or four days, con<lb></lb>sulting about the means—Madame Poninska told me that Sternfeldt had no money at present, but that his wife was in possession of jewellery which she would partly pawn; and as a proof that sfie had them, she pulled out a pawn ticket from her pocket which dropped on the ground, she picked it up, and it was for a diamond bracelet that she had pawned the same day for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Madame Poninska told me that Sternfeldt had means, and the wife was, she believed, some person of very great consequence in j Germany, and that they married privately, that he was not Sternfeldt, that he; was a nobleman of large property—a fortnight I think elapsed before they could get a house, because they could not get any reference, and Madame Poninska proposed that she would be part towards paying the 201. that was required for furnishing the ground floor for Madame de Welzenstein, if I could give reference for the house, which after some deal of persuasion on the part of Madame Poninska, I consented, more particularly as I knew the landlord—Sternfeldt once asked me to accompany him down to the place where likely houses might be to let, and I did so—when we were at Pimlico, and he had consented to take the house, I said I understood his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070022"></xptr>
               <p>name was not Sternfeldt, and I expected he should tell me who he was, and take the house in his real name, as I did not wish to have any more fiction about it—at the time I had this conversation with him they had found a house in Eccleston-terrace—he said that he had left Austria for having been implicated in political matters, and he was obliged to go away; in fact, he had been in arrest and made his escape with a forged passport; consequently he was obliged to retain that name; but his name was not that, his name was Edgar Von Schwannenfelt; we usually oall them Baron, it defines the same position as an English baron—he afterwards came to me, and said he had taken the house, and he removed there immediately, and I paid for the carting of the furniture—I gave to Madame Welzenstein 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was to furnish the ground floor for her to carry on the business—I afterwards received a note from him, asking if I would not come to see him at his new lodging—I went there, and I necessarily made inquiry about the progress of the furniture, where it had gone to—the place was not at all furnished, no progress was made—I asked him the reason, and he said his means from Vienna had not arrived, and Madame Poninska, who had promised to assist him had failed, and consequently he could not go on at all, and he asked me if I would not lend him some money—I lent him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion, and took this I O U from him—I wrote the body of the I O U and he signed it—about a week subsequently he made an application to me for further assistance, and I then lent him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—for that he signed this I O U—I wrote it myself in his presence, and in the presence of Madame Welzenstein—he showed me a large number of letters, which I did not read, several of them showing that the bearer was So-and-so, with large seals in front—several letters were addressed to my house—some progress was subsequently made in furnishing the house—I occasionally called there—in April the next year I called there one evening—they were at variance about some matters, and some expressions were used by Madame Welzenstein which caused me subsequently to say something to her—the next time I called she was by herself, and I told her that from what I had noticed and from various circumstances I had seen, it was perfectly evident to me that he and she must be man and wife, and unless she told me there and then I certainly would not relieve her in any other way; in fact I would not in any way, and I would get my money back in the best way I could—she said that they were man and wife—I asked her how she came to tell me such a number of different stories about her career—she said as she had given a full history of her life to the Austrian embassy, which history she knew that Count Kotheck had given me to read, and Count Apponyi had promised on the strength of that history to intercede with her uncle, who was an Austrian field-marshal—that she was obliged to tell me the story that Sternfeldt was not her husband—it was also stated in the letter to Count Apponyi that she had a child—on that occasion Sterufeldt was not at home—she said if I considered their I distressed state, the letters written to the embassy, and the various circumstances, I would surely forgive her the imposition she had practised upon me, and she begged me not to tell her husband that she had revealed the facts to me—I thought it might be likely, and I wrote a letter and asked him to confess that he was her husband—I called at their place—he made a large number of apologies—he said their circumstances were such, and having once written to the ambassador, they could not possibly deviate from it, and they were obliged to carry it through, but that I should very shortly be convinced of their respectability, and also that any money I had advanced should be shortly paid—I then said, that knowing they were man and wife, it was</p>

               <p>impossible for me to support them any further, and they must do their beat, they could not let lodgings—this letter of 13th May, 1858, is Welzenstein's writing; it came to me by post—(<hi rend="italic">This letter being ready implored the witness to aid him in Meeting a bill which was coming due on the 15th instant</hi>)—before this time he had handed or sent to me that which he called a history of his life—this produced is it—in consequence of this letter I advanced the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Welzenstein—I think it was about three or four days afterwards, at my own house, or rather in front of the bank—a female called at my house on 13th May for an answer to the letter—thia letter is also Welzenstein's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 27th May, 1858, and was put in and read</hi>)—I did not reply to that letter—they called repeatedly at my house, Madame Welzenstein particularly—in June, Welzenstein sent to me about the rent—I went down and he told me that the rent had been already due for the previous quarter, and there were various debts about the place, and they were not able to let the house for some cause or another which he did not know—they wanted to let the upper part of the house, and they had not let it; in fact, they had taken no money—there was a person there for a week, and they had not paid—in consequence of what they told me about their difficulties I advised them to move away from the house, for of course there was the difficulty of paying the rent—I then suggested to him that he could not move the furniture without having paid the rent and the tradespeople in the neighbourhood, and I suggested they should be sold by auction and the proceeds go to pay his debts, and with the remainder take some smaller lodging—he told me he owed from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he subsequently handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as an inventory of the furniture, and the value of it—it is in his own handwriting—this states the value to be 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he gave me a list of debts that he owed, which came to about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him altogether 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order to pay all his debts—the furniture was to be sold at Oxenham's—the mosey was to be given to me and I was to give him any surplus that remained—the furniture was sold there—I received 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd as the produce of the sale—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses—shortly after, in September, in consequence of something I heard about the way in which the money had been disposed of, I told him that he had misinformed me as to having paid all his debts—he had previously told me that he had positively paid every shilling he owed, and he showed me some receipts—I told him that the butcher had called, whom he had not paid, consequently he had deceived me—he said the deception must have bean, practised by his wife, he was not aware of it; he had givan her the money—when they left Eccleston-terrace, they moved to lodgings in Seymour-street, and then into Manchester-street—the reason of selling the furniture was for the purpose of goiug to America, and the surplus money was to furnish the passage money, which was minus my debt of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Welzenstein then complained that he was worse off than he had been before—I stated "If you, choose to go to America, as I have relieved you so far, if you take your wife with you, I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of taking you off;" which 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave him—this letter of 20th September is his writing—I received it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—there is an allusion in that letter to a mutual agreement to hold our conversation at my house—I suppose that refers to the agreement of giving him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I told him about his wife having deceived me about having paid all his debts, I reproached him very strougly on the subject, and I told him that as he was leaving his wife here, I should not at all consent to it—I objected to go to him, of course he was to come to me—this letter</p>

               <p>of 28th September is his writing, and also this letter of 1st October, 1858—(<hi rend="italic">These letters were put in and read</hi>)—I cannot positively say whether or not in consequence of receiving that letter I let him have a further amount of money—there are some articles alluded to in that letter; they were a gold brooch and a watch which formed part of the matter taken out of pawn, and they were perfectly unsaleable; I had them in my drawer and I thought I might as well give them back, and she might get a little money by them—I do not think they were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., both of them together—I did not see Welzenstein again until after he called at my house in January 1859—before that, when I had gone to Eccleston-terrace I saw the prisoner Freicke there, not always—I could not say whether I saw him frequently—he opened the door, but he never was in the room—he always used to retire—I believe I only saw Jourdan once in Eccleston-terrace—I believe I saw Madame Welzenstein twice after the receipt of the last letter, and after Welzenstein's disappearance—about a week after he had left, Freicke called and said that she was left without a peuny; if I would lend her a trifle—I then put a sovereign in a paper and left it at her door; I knocked, but did not go in—I believe Freicke called once more, perhaps four or five days or a week afterwards—I called on Madame Welzenstein one evening in Manchester-street, about 25th or 26th October—she then told me that she could not well remain in the house in consequence of the high rent of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; and that she had again been obliged to pawn the little trifles that had been taken out, and she showed me some pawn tickets for various articles—I do not know exactly what money I gave her then to redeem them—she told me that some person had offered to buy them of her—on the 30th October Freicke and a person named Kerschoffsky, a cook's shop keeper, called—Kerschoffsky stated that an execution had been put in the house, and unless the money, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was paid there and then, the man would sell off directly—they wanted me to come directly—I sent them to my solicitor close by to arrange for them—they came back and said the solicitor saw no other way to get out of it ex<lb></lb>cept to pay—they went away, and Madame Welzenstein came—she would not go away without I went home with her—I went; and when I got to Manchester-street, I found Kerschoffsky and Freicke there, and the broker and Mr. Nash, who had put in the execution—after various arrangements I declined to have anything to do with the matter—Kerschoffsky offered to pay half if I would pay the other half; but he alleged that he had no money there and then, but it should be paid before the end of March—Nash subsequently took 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me in full discharge, and left the goods—about January, 1859, I saw Welzenatein again, he called at my house—he said that he had had misfortunes in America, and had come back and did not know what to do—after numerous calls and letters I gave him assistance—I received this letter from him on 15th February, 1859 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I had at that time received certain anonymous letters—I told him I had received I them, and from a former conversation they were attributed to a certain party, Madame Jourdan, who is referred to in that letter as Satan—he I agreed to that, and said he would prove to me that they came from there—I between that time and March I received several other letters from Welzen<lb></lb>stein—I relieved him at a time when the wife was supposed to have been I knocked down by a horse—he stated that he was in great distress—that she I had neither doctor or clothes, and I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for some clothing—I believe he fetched it himself—this letter, dated 27th February, is his writing, I it was received by me (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. referred to in that letter I had left at Kerschoffsky's when I received information that Madame Welzenstein had</p>

I have already told you that you shall have the same on your name's day, and you shall not only get this one piece but also the other two, and anything you may want, if you can manage to be away from home for one night.

               <p>the Austrian embassy about three weeks before I brought the affair before the German society—Count Kotheck subsequently showed me a roll of paper, about 10 sheets, which was said to be got from Madame Welzenstein—this is the cheque for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I gave to pay the execution. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th October, 1858, on the Western Bank of London</hi>). I believe I only saw any person from the embassy once in reference to these people—that was when the Count called on me—I saw Count Apponyi last year—I returned the paper that Count Kotheck brought me—I kept it about a day—I received the letter signed "Sternfeldt" the same day that the Count called, relating the circumstances in a similar way as the Count told me; the Count said to me, "You being in London, may be able to make inquiries about the woman, she is a most deserving woman as far as we believe:" I am not aware that the embassy ever furnished any funds to give her: not through me—all the monies I have spoken of except the pound came out of my own pocket—I paid two visits to the residence of these people during the three weeks that elapsed between the time I saw the Count at the German Society—I did not see Madame Welzenstein more than twice elsewhere in that interval—I think it was about a fortnight after I got her the money from the Society that she came to me with the pawn tickets—I can't positively say how many pawn tickets there were; more than twenty—I do not exactly remember the quantity of things that were pawned—there was a large quantity of silk amongst it, I should think more than 100 yards—there were four sheets—I do not know of any silk cushions—there were two feather pillows covered with silk—there was a quantity of damask table-cloths of about twenty yards not made up, and also some pieces of damask napkins—there was not a great quantity of towelling, not above half-a-dozen or a dozen yards I should think—I can't say exactly, because, as I said before, after the things were taken out of pawn, they were lying in my shop, and we offered them to various persons for sale—some were bought by Baron Nicholay, a customer of mine, and he left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which Madame Welzenstein had—I can't tell how many towels that quantity of damask would make—there was not enough to make three, dozen—there was not a quantity of French embroidery, you would not call it so if you saw it—there is a pattern of it (<hi rend="italic">producing a piece</hi>)—no person who knows anything about cotton would call it embroidery—I call it printed cotton—this is what they called French embroidery—there was a hassock covered with velvet—there were some china plates and some larger plates, and some glass which they called antique—I do not recollect a bronze console for I a clock—there were some sheets, and two shawls—I could not state what things they were, that I handed back to Madame De Welzenstein—there were a few things of wearing apparel, shifts, and a variety of other things—I did not hand back any of the things you have read—I was obliged I to keep them—I could not sell them—at the time I was getting these things I heard that her husband was in America—it did not occur to me that I ought not to have bought them of a married woman whose husband was away—it was on 18th October, that she became ill; that was perhaps six weeks after the sale—she appeared very miserable when she was ill—I sup<lb></lb>pose I piqued her—I used to go into her bed-room, and saw her lying in bed several times—each time I called she was in bed—I always used to call at night—I can't say that I was particularly attentive to her; I once gave her a cup of tea—it was not necessary to put my arm round her to enable her to drink it, she could sit perfectly upright in bed—I did not help her to sit up—I am perfectly sure of that—I never put my hand round her when</p>

I make no entry in the business accounts, but I have my own accounts—these sums are not entered in tho private accounts—this is not the only occasion when I have given money to this extent—I have given 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away to poor persons—some have paid me, some have not—the female prisoner was by when he signed the I O U—the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a cheque I drew on my banker—I do not think I kept the cheques—I gave him the money in gold, I may have got it at my bankers—I did not get this from my bankers—I cannot say that this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the I O U was got on a cheque drawn by me on my bankers—I said so just now because you put so many questions that I got perfectly coufueed—I am perfectly sure that I opened my drawer, took out 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and lent that—I am pecfectly sure of that—I gave instructions for an action to be brought on these two I O U's—I did not abandon that action—I know it was not tried—I said to my attorney, "I will leave it entirely in your hands;" I did not instruct him at all—Mr. Lewis had better answer the question, because I do not know what you mean—he has not told me that he had abandoned the action—I have not asked him what has become of my claim for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two occasions, because I know it is in my pocket—I did not visit them at Eccleston-terrace very often: not once a month; occasionally—the door was usually opened by Freicke, and I said, "Are they at home?" and walked in without saying any more—I used to ask the boy whether his master or mistress were at home—I did not usually mention the name—I do not know that they passed over the whole neighbourhood under the name of De Welzenstein—she went in that name at the house—I first heard that Sternfeldt was passing under the name of De Welzenstein, somewhere about the end of March or of April—Madame De Welzenstein told me that his name was De Welzenstein—they had been living in the house about three months at that time—I only once had refreshment there—that was not after I found out that his name was De Welzenstein—I had it with the two parties together—I was very ill in the cab, and I asked them if they had got a drop of brandy in the house—I did not know that they were man and wife, and when I saw them together I never believed it—I did not give a reference with them to many other places besides that—there was a person named Shrul who I knew very well, but he never referred to me about these people—I went once to him to inquire whether he knew whether she was not De Welzenstein—that was at the early part, when Corn gave information—I requested him to go and prove what he had stated, but he refused—he did not tell me her name was De Welzenstein—he said that her name was Statina—that man (<hi rend="italic">A policeman</hi>,) may have been in my shop, but I do not recollect his face—I have no knowledge whatever of a conversation with him about the Do Welzonsteins and about some clothes—I do not</p>

               <p>recollect that any person came and made inquiries about the De Welzen<lb></lb>steins and the silk that I bought—I did not say to anybody that I did not know the De Welzensteins—I have no recollection that the same person said, "How can that be, have not you been a reference to the house where they went?"; not the slightest, and I will swear that it did not take place—I did not see him—I do not know whether the house at Eccleston-square was furnished by a man named Nash—I did not see Mr. Nash till he came to my house for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—yes, I saw him once at his own shop—I advised Nash not to leave his goods unless he got his money—that was the same evening that I had left 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at his house—he showed me the invoice of the goods—I did not say that the De Welzensteins were relations of mine—I never gave directions to them to say that I was a relation—Nash did not come and tell me that I was a relation—I certainly asked him to give credit as I was positive that the people were able to pay for his goods, which were 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash down besides the bill, and they kept the bills in their pockets—De Welzenstein did not give me more than one entry—when I gave him 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was not by a cheque on my banker, it was all gold taken out of my till—the goods were sold in the name of Kraill, who is a friend of mine—I suggested that, and promised Kraill to do so—it was not me that intro<lb></lb>duced Kraill to Oxenham; Kraill's cousin was a clerk there, and Mr. Kraill did it himself—I did not send him, he did it on his own account—I did not draw a cheque on my bankers for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave it him to take his wife to America—the only sum which was got from my bankers was that for which the I O U is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sometimes got the money myself, sometimes by a cheque—I paid them in gold—it was not paid by a cheque drawn by me on my banker, you ask me the same question so many times over and over again—I paid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a Sunday in the first week in October, before he went to America—it was a few days after I gave it to him that I told him he was to take his wife—I wrote to him remonstrating with him on this breach of faith, and still he left her behind—after that I gave him more money—the watch and brooch was given at the latter part of September, or the early part of October—after he sailed for America, or disappeared, I did not begin to visit Madame De Welzenstein again till she sent Friecke—she had given up calling at my shop—before that time I had not seen her in Hanover-square, or in Lisle-street, or in St. James's-park—I should think I saw her in King's coffee-house in 1857—she said that she had nothing to eat, and I took her there—both the rooms there are public—we stayed there the usual time, and the waiter came in and out of the room—there was no other guest there to the best of my recollection—she used to meet me in Hanover-square—I met her there when I gave her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the letter to pay the bill, that was in the middle of the day about May—and when they were in Eccleston-terrace, I met her because she came to my house and I told her I had no money in the house but would go to the bank and get it for her—the bank is in Hanover-square, and I went and got it by cheque—I have not got that cheque—I left her there with the money—I have never seen her in St. James's-park—I have never met her there in the evening—we have never sat on the seats there—I went with her twice to Lisle-street during the time her husband was away—there came a letter from Vienna, and a letter from America on another occasion, and I took them—he used to address his letters at my house—the visitor came to Lisle-street about half-past 7—I gave her money in Lisle-street, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay her on each occasion; on one occasion I gave her</p>

               <p>money, and on another occasion I left money in the cook's shop—there was not a sofa in Lisle-street at first nor did one come afterwards exactly, it belonged to the things that were seized, and as I had paid 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it remained there for the purpose of being covered—it is not there now—I never kissed her in Lisle-street, that I swear; nor did I sit with her on that sofa—I always sat on a chair with my hat on—my gloves might be on—I do not know where she moved to from Lisle-street, I never visited her after—I went to Duke-street in 1857 to a tailor, a friend of mine, named Ritters-camp, who said, "Are you answerable for her respectability?"—I said, "Yes;" and paid the rent for her for the first quarter—I looked out for lodgings for her because she could not talk English—I mentioned Madame De Welzenstein to my friend Ritterscamp as the person I wanted to take lodgings for—he was formerly one of my workmen—I will undertake to swear I did not give a different name to Ritterscamp or the woman's name; how could I?—I asked him if he would take a person in, and said that the person's name was De Welzenstein—Madame De Welzenstein met me in the street and stopped me very often, that was in February 1859—she kept that up during the whole of the month a good deal, stopping me every night—I have seen her write, I swear that; and I will tell you the occasion too—she produced a marriage certificate at Little St. Thomas-Apostle, City—I asked her if she would give it to me because I wanted to see whether it was genuine—I said, "Be good enough to write your name on the back of the paper," and she did so on Sunday morning, and I took it to the Church and asked leave to compare it with the register, but the man could not satisfy my inquiry, and I took no further notice of that bit of writing—when it was produced before me in the Court of Queen's Bench I said that I did not know it—I do not remember whether the Lord Chief Justice called her upand asked her whether it was her writing—you have got a short-hand writer there—it was only last February, but I have a good deal to do and cannot remember a little trifle—I remember the Judge calling her, and I suppose she came up and that he put the paper before her—that was the paper you showed me just now—I saw the Lord Chief Justice write on it, and should think this is the paper he wrote on—I could not swear it, but His Lordship ordered it to be impounded, and there it is—I have taken no trouble to ascertain whether it is true that Madame De Welzenstein is the daughter of an Austrian field-marshal.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been clerk of the German Church 23 years, and also a teacher of Italian and German—I have had many opportunities of seeing and copying Mr. Stohwasser's writing, and should certainly recognise these two letters as his, not only by the general character, but by oisu letter, a small "w," written in the English character, which is not usually seen in the German current hand—I never saw Madame Jourdan or De Welzenstein—they might be present in the Church, but I am rather short-sighted—they are no Mends or acquaintances.</p>

                  </hi>.

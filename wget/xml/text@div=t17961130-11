             came to my tap, and proposed to bring me ten guineas in half-guineas, in return for 5l. I told him I could not think of giving him any money, until such time as I saw what sort they were; I told him to bring me one or two, and let me see them, and I should be better able to advance money to him to make me some; he told me the next time he came to see me, he would bring me one or more to shew me; the next time he came, he brought two half-guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was that after the conversation you had had with him? - A. I cannot justly say; when I saw them, I liked them very well, and he told me he would bring me ten guineas worth on the next Monday; after he was gone, I went immediately to Bow-street, to have advice in what manner I was to proceed; I went afterwards to the Solicitor of the Mint, and received directions what to do; the prisoner Turner came again on Saturday, the 22d of last month, about four o'clock; the prisoner Bull was with him; they sat down and had a pint of porter; then Turner said, Mr. Dowling, I want to speak to you; he and I went immediately out of doors into a long passage that leads to our house, between the tap and the street; he pulled two counterfeit half-guineas out if his pocket, and said, I have brought you some of them, and I asked him to let me see them; he took them both out of his pocket; I said I liked them very well; I asked him how much they would be; he told me 9s.; I consented to pay him for them, and told him to come in doors; he came in and sat down, and had something more to drink with Bull, and he asked me for the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Bull present when he asked you for the money? - A. No; he came separately from Bull; when he asked me for the money, I did not know that Bull knew any thing of the business; when Turner gave them me in the passage, Bull was sitting in the house; I told him I would pay him presently, and he seemed very uneasy to get the money immediately; I told him if he would come on Sunday morning, I would pay him; this was Saturday evening; he declined coming, but wanted the money immediately, and said he would call for a shilling's worth of something to drink, if I would let him have the two half-guineas back again; I refused to do so, and went about my business out of the tap-room, and sent to the office for a couple of officers; they not coming immediately as I wished, I went to the back door, and Mr. Harding, belonging to Bow-street, happened to be there; I told him of the business, and desired him to come in; in about two minutes I went in, and told Turner that I would have but one, and returned him the other, and at the same time paid him down 4s. 6d. for the one I kept in my possession; Mr. Harding came in just at that juncture of time that I paid him the money; I put it down on the table, he took it up, and had it at that time in his right hand, he had the other half-guinea in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300026"></xptr>his left hand; the officer immediately took hold of him by the right hand, and asked him what he had got in his hand; he said, nothing; the officer opened his hand and took the 4s. 6d. out; he searched his pockets, and while he was searching his pockets, Turner turned round and threw the half-guinea that he had in his hand behind him; we heard it ring; I thought it was in the fire; I took a candle and found it on the hob; the officer picked it up, and took him immediately to Bow-street; I have the half-guinea I bought, the officer has the other; there was nothing found upon him, I believe, but a few sixpences and some copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When Turner came to you on the 22d, you desired him to let you look at these two half-guineas? - A. He told me he had got them, and we went out into the passage together, and he shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him to let you see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave them into your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you kept them? - A. I asked him how much they would be, and he told me 9s.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing further passed at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to satisfy yourself about them, and he told you they would be 9s.? - A. I told him to step into the tap-room, and I would pay him in the tap.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to satisfy yourself about the money? - A. I was satisfied, and was to give him his price for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him his price, and he wanted them back and to go away? - A. Yes; he said he would call for a shilling's worth, if I would let him have them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do it, and he sat there drinking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards returned one to him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any agrement between you to part with one of them only, the agreement was to part with both or none? - A. No; I was to purchase what I pleased of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The only conversation was relative to buying the two - did you at all converse with him upon the subject of buying one only? - A. No; only when I returned in, I said, I would have but one; he said, why then pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you did not, without any converse at all, return one, and throw down the 4s. 6d. for the other? - A. No; I had a good deal of conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not return him one, and throw down the 4s. 6d. without any conversation about buying the one? - A. No; I came in and said, Mr. Turner, I will have only one of them, I will give you 4s. 6d. for one; he said immediately, let me have the money, and I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time that conversation took place? - A. Nobody but he and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a wife or any body that was in the room? - A. Yes; I have a wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any pot-boy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say there was nobody present but you and he? - A. I believe he was in the room; I did not observe him; I am not sure; Turner was sitting in one box and I in another; he was in a box separate from any other company; Bull was in another box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you wife at the time? - A. She was backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she in the tap-room at the time? - A. I cannot say whether she was in the tap-room, or in the cellar, or upstairs; she was about her business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Was this conversation carried on so loud, that other people might hear? - A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HARDING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am a patrole: On the 22d of last month, about four o'clock, I was sent for take Turner into custody, which I according did; I searched him, and found in his right hand 4s. 6d.; then I searched his breeches pocket, and found two sixpences, a bit of wire, and a bit of copper; in the mean time he threw something from his left hand, backwards; I heard the ring of it against the grate; I immediately got a candle to look for it, and on the left hand side of the fire-place I picked up half-a-guinea; I asked him immediately, what did you throw this half-guinea away for; he made answer immediately, I have no business with it, that man gave it to me, pointing to Bull; from that I immediately took Bull into custody, and searched him; I found one sixpence upon him, and a dozen of gold rings, and some copper trinkets gilt; from that I took them to the office, and had them examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Bull say? - A. He did not say any thing to me. (Produces the property he took from Turner, and the half-guinea he threw in the fire-place.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether Turner and you were not at a distant part of the room when he said he had it from Bull? - A. I was just by the fire-place; Bull was in another box, smoking his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Bull could not hear what he said? - A. Yes; he could hear him as well as he does me now.</p>
               <p>CALEB EDWARD POWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fieldling. I belong to the Mint; I was present at the office when the prisoners were examined; the Magistrate before whom they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300027"></xptr>examined was Mr. Ford; this is the examination of Bull, with his signature to it (producing it). The examination was read.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those half-guineas? - A. They are both counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that? - A. From the experience I have in the Mint.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are not engaged in coining in the Mint? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak only as a common observer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Turner's defence. In the middle of February I happened to go to the Queen's Larder, I have used it for some time, I had a pint of beer, and four-pennyworth of meat; Dowling pulled a pair of buckles out of his pocket, and asked if I had any buckles; he said, he wanted a pair; I said, I had a pair in pawn; he said, if I would fetch them out he would buy them of me; I said, they lay in King's-head-court, Shoe-lane; I went and got them out, and brought them to Dowling; I said, they they are full-dress buckles, they stand me in thirty shillings; he said, what do you ask for them; I said, twenty-five shillings, you shall have them bargain; he said, I shall give you no such money, I will give you twenty shillings; I said, I am sorry I have been at this trouble, you take the advantage of me; he then said he would give me twenty shillings and two pints of ale; I agreed to take it, and he gave me the twenty shillings, and gave me three bad shillings in paying the money down; I said, here are three bad shillings, I can tell them by the ring; we drank together, and he said, can you help me to any thing of this sort; I said, no; he said, he dealt in that way; he said, these were three of the pieces; this is a dark kitchen, there is a great deal done here; he said, he had thirty-three shillings for a guinea; he said, you being a tradesman might get a little this way; I said, I did not understand it; he said, he had a good E O table, he had a partner belonging to the Lottery-office, and he said, I being a tradesman, if I wanted any encouragement, not to be at a loss, he would encourage me; he asked me if I could help him to any bad halfpence; I said I did not know any man in that profession; he said, he wondered, as a tradesman, I did not get into that line; he further said, there was a person used to serve him with yellows.</p>
               <p>Bull was not put upon his defence.</p>
               <p>Turner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

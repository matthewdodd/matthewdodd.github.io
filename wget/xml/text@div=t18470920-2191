                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at No. 7, Church-buildings, Bream's buildings, Chancery-lane—I occupy the whole house—I know the prisoner and his wife. On Monday night, the 12th of Sept., his wife slept with my daughter—on Tuesday morning, near twelve o'clock, the prisoner rushed into my room—no one was there but his wife and myself—he said nothing, but flew to his wife, and was wrestling with her, apparently with his feet—I hallooed out, "Don't do that, Lund; don't use her so;" and, as near as I re<lb></lb>member, no more was done till I received a blow with a chair on my arm—I was then standing at the prisoner's right hand, his wife was further to the left—he could not have struck me in striking at her—she tried to make her escape, and got behind him, as the street-door was shut—it had been standing open—I received two more blows at the same time—I called "Murder!" and within a half a minute the court had plenty in it from every door—I was calling out that he had broken my arm—my arm was broken—I also received a blow on my right eye with his fist—it was all discoloured—he held the chair by the back with both hands, and the feet came down on my arm—his wife was not near me when he struck me with his fist in the face—the blow could not have been intended for her.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Wm. Maslin, a lady's shoemaker, in Church-building. On Tuesday morning, the 13th of Sept., I was sitting at work in my mother-in-law's room, at No. 7, and heard screams and cries of murder—I ran down stairs, and saw Mrs. Reed's front room door wide open, and Mrs. Reed standing in the middle of the room, with the prisoner in front of her, and his wife behind Mrs. Reed—the prisoner had his fist clenched to<lb></lb>wards Mrs. Reed, who was crying for mercy—I did not see the blow struck—Mrs. Reed was holding her arm, and crying "Oh dear, my arm is broken!—her hand was bleeding very much—his wife was standing behind him with her hand up, and while I was looking at Mrs. Reed his wife went out about two yards from him with her hand before her face—he pursued her and took hold of her by the throat—she looked up and said, "Don't hurt me"—he said, "Go home"—she said, "I will if you will let me get my bonnet and shawl"—he would not wait, but drove her on in front of him about four or five yards till they came to two steps which go up into another yard, and as she was getting up those steps he kicked her—there are two folding doors there, and as she was folding them that he should not follow her, she escaped—I did not see her again, till she was in the hospital—I followed him and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I am house surgeon, at Kings's College Hospital. On Tuesday, the 13th of sept., Mrs. Reed came to the hospital; she had</p>

               <p>a cut on her little finger, which was bleeding profusely; her arm was broker at the lower third, above the wrist; she had some bruises on the right side of her face, and her left arm was also bruised—the bruises on the left arm might have been done with the hand—the right arm was swollen from the violence of the blow—I should say a chair used with force would be likely to have done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She seems a very feeble woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—being an elderly woman, the bone would be very brittle—sometimes a slight blow may fracture a bone, it would depend on the position of the arm—the mere dropping of a chair on the arm would not do it—I should conceive from the swelling round it, that some violence was used.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Price, pawnbroker, of Wentworth-street. On Friday, the 9th of April, about ten o'clock, a woman came to pawn a silver salt-holder. I detained it till she brought the woman whom she said she had it from; she fetched the prisoner, who said it was her own. I asked if she could tell the initials on it - she said she could, and then that she could not - that she had had it many years, and that she lived in Rosemary-lane.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030023"></xptr>I gave her in charge of an officer. She was very much intoxicated, and the other woman rather so - she knew what she was about, and answered me very pertinently.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was fetched to Mr. Price's, and took the prisoner in charge there - she was rather tipsy, and asked the pawnbroker for her property or the money. I took her to the office, and found a silver pepper-box on her, and four duplicates pinned in her bosom; she said she had lost the duplicate of the sugar-tongs, and directed me to the prosecutor's, and said she had sent the other articles to be pawned, and the woman who pawned them had sold her, and the things were her mistresses.</p>

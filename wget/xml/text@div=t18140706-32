I did, and he was to work it out a dead horse; he was to cut them in my own premises, and on Tuesday, the people sent for their work; he was not come to his work.

               <p>Q. What were the value of these crystals - A. They would cost me six pounds to replace them; I think they are worth that. I would not have suffered him to carry them home to work; it is a thing not customary.</p>

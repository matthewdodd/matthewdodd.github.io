I was up last in the house, and fastened the doors and windows myself on the 19th of November. I was alarmed at five o'clock the next morning by a lodger in the house; I ran down stairs almost naked. When I saw the situation of things I judged that a servant had done it, and I suspected a servant that had left me a short time before that. I found the bar open, and a hole was cut in the bar big enough to put a hand in to pull back the spring-lock and the bolt, and then they could get the shutters down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they down?</p>
               <p>Bellinger. Yes, it was all thrown open, and there were seven table-spoons, a large soupspoon, and two tea-spoons. The drawer in which they were was shut in with a cupboard; the drawer of the till was cut open; a piece of wood was cut off, and so the till was got out: there was about a crown's-worth of half-pence taken out of the till. I found a tool that is used by bricklayers labourers, that I shewed in court, upon the trial of two of the men, I have not got it now. I can say nothing of my own knowledge against the prisoner.

               <p>Q. And do you now positively swear, that you did not swear before the justice that Bowman was let in with the other two. - Will you swear that he was not there?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. I can't swear that he was particularly concerned in breaking open the place.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he was concerned?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. He knew of the robbery, and was to be a party concerned in it. We were to meet at the Ship in St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet them there?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at any time when it was settled between them, that they were to break open this house when the prisoner at the bar was present?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. At a house by Carnaby-alley. There were only the prisoner and Higbed there, and there I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Eldridge. About a day before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at the house that you are sure of?</p>
               <p>Eldridge.

            . I was a supernumerary watchman that night. I went round at ten o'clock and twelve. At half after twelve o'clock the prisoner came and whistled through his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190034"></xptr> fingers three times; he was dressed in light cloaths; I am sure he is the man; the moon shone as bright as day. After he had whistled, the sash was thrown up, and one looked out at the window up two pair of stairs in the prosecutrix's house, and they discoursed together for a considerable time. The prisoner stood upon the ground by me when the accomplice talked to him out at the window. I thought they were both lodgers in the house. At last the accomplice asked where they were; the prisoner said, all together. The prisoner asked him whether he would come down or no; he said he would not. Then the clock struck one; I took my candle and lanthorn and called the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think the three whistles were for?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. To call his comrade; I thought he was a lodger and wanted to get in. When I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your box from the house?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. About ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you go when you cry the hour?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. It takes me up very near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay upon the stand?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. Till almost six in the morning. About half after two o'clock Samuel Higbed, who had been a waiter in the house, came by himself. I thought he had lived in the house. Then he threw something up to the window; I went to him, and told him he should not throw any thing up at the window, for if he broke the window I should be answerable for it. He flung something out of his hand; I heard it. rattle against the window. I saw the sash move up, and somebody put out a hand and wagged it. I could see nothing but the hand. I went to the door, and found it unshut; two men came out, and after that two more; I thought they were lodgers, and were going to their work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. He that had white cloaths on was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the first two or last?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. He was the third, I believe. I walked backwards and forwards all the time, to prevent any disturbance, because the door was a-jar. When the man came up to light the fire, I told him the people they kept in the house were very irregular.</p>

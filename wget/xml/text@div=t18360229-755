                  </hi>. I am a master baker, and live in Kingsland-road. The prisoner was about six month in my service as journeyman—it was his duty to receive money on my account and account to me for it—if he received money in the morning he ought to pay it tome in the evening, when I put the bread down—sometimes he was out and we did not settle that night—Sarah Reynolds is customer of mine.</p>

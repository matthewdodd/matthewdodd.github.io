               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. And there he was when you awoke? A. Yes; he was on my left-hand side - he had not gone away; I believe he was sober - I had my recollection about me; I could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk enough for any body to see you were not sober? A. Yes: he offered to assist me, and did so to the Coach and Horses - I had no rum there; I believe the half-and - half came to 3d. - I do not know what a quartern of rum comes to; I believe I was laying down in Lincoln's Inn-fields, and the prisoner lifted me up - he could have robbed me there; my money was found in his left hand - he said he was going to deposit it with the landlord to take care of for me.</p>

            . I am a saddler, and live in Oxford-street. I was at the Coach and Horses on the 5th of December - I went in at twenty minutes past five o'clock, and in a few minutes Barton and the prisoner came in; I saw them drinking together - Barton was very much intoxicated; he fell asleep about ten minutes after, calling for a pint of half-and - half, and I saw the prisoner put his left hand into Barton's left-hand waistcoat pocket - he took out some money; I could not see what - I went out for an officer, and brought Fisher in with me; I told him the prosecutor had just been robbed - he asked where the man was who had robbed him; I pointed to the prisoner, and said I believed he had the money then in his left hand - the Policeman found in his left hand a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a sixpence; this was as near half-past five o'clock as possible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you absent looking for the Policeman? A. About a minute; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090094"></xptr>soner said he took it with the whole and sole intention of delivering it into the landlord's hands; he said that when it was found in his hand - he said nothing when he took it out, but I said, "You have just robbed that man," and he made no answer - he had time to put the money into his pocket while I was away; he could not have escaped conveniently, because I scarcely got outside before I met a Policeman; there might be seven or eight people in the house - the prosecutor sat next the fire-place, the prisoner next, and I next to him; others were in a better situation for seeing it than me, if they had looked, but nobody saw it; I can swear no rum was called for.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went with Griffiths into the Coach and Horses, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, and in the prisoner's left hand I found a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a sixpence; I found a sixpence and 3 1/2d. on him besides - when I took the money from his hand he said nothing about giving it up to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not hear him say he intended to give it to the landlord to take care of? A. I did not - if it was said it must be before I came in; he made no resistance - I took him to the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop in Twisters-alley, Ban-hill-row. The prisoner came for a penny candle, which I gave her, and he gave me a sixpence which was very much battered—I thought it was worn—she said she was sure it was a good one—it remained in a drawer, where I kept it till about nine o'clock—I then took it out to get some beer, and offered it to the publican's son—his mother said it was nothing but pewter—I saw the prisoner again on the following Sunday, the 26th—she asked for a halfpenny candle, and gave me another sixpence—my husband was there—I said, "Look at that sixpence, she is the same girl that gave me the other sixpence"—she said she had not been in the shop before—I sent for a policeman—one sixpence my husband had, and the other I gave the policeman.</p>

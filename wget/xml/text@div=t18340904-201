             (police-constable K 234). I went to the place, and took the prisoner - the prosecutor said,"I have missed a piece of cloth, and can have no suspicion of any one but you" - he got off his board, threw his lapcloth off his knees, and said he knew nothing about his master's cloth - he said he lodged where he did, at No. 6, Edward-street - I left him there - I went to the office, took the order-book in my pocket, and returned - I then went with the prosecutor to a house in Wellington-street, where we found the cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you were sent for, did you know where to go to find this property? A. No: I left the prisoner while I went to the watch-house, and when I came back, I saw an alteration in his countenance - I said to him, "It appears to me you are guilty, and that the cloth you said your parents had bought you, is your master's, and if it is, you had better give it up" - he then said,"It is not at the lodging where I told you - I do not live there now" - he then took us to the place where the cloth was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

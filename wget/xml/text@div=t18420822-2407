                  </hi>. I deal in ale and spirits, and live in London<lb></lb>mews, St. Pancras. The prisoner Wildman is my wife's nephew—I had made arrangements for sending him to sea—on the 15th of August I had a cash-box containing seventy-five sovereigns, half-a-sovereign, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—about half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 16th, I missed it—it was afterwards brought back to me by my servant—I afterwards saw the two prisoners in custody—I asked Wildman where he got the clothes which he had on—he said he had bought them in Monmouth-street, and likewise a suit for the other boy, and that he had given 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I know he had not 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own to give—he had also a watch and seals worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had purchased somewhere—I know nothing of Platt—Wildman used to come now and then to my house—his mother lives close by.</p>

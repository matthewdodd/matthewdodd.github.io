On the 29th of October, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, she asked to look at some muslin, I shewed her some, she purchased half a quarter of a yard, it came to threepence three farthings, after I had served her I doubled the wrapper over, and put the wrapper behind her in its place. I then went to the till to get change for sixpence, and on my coming to her again, I saw her stoop down as if apparently forcing something up her petticoats. I could see nothing whatever, my suspicions were aroused, I took the wrapper again, and on my turning again, she was stooping down the same as before. I looked over the wrapper, but being confused I could not miss any particular article that time, she was then going out of the shop, not liking to tax her with a theft until I had looked over the wrapper. I called to her and said I had a bargain in the wrapper that I would sell her cheap, and while I was looking over the wrapper, she stooped the third time, and slowly took up two pieces of muslin, and placed them on the counter, the muslins were as smooth as if in the wapper, not tumbled in the least. I then jumped over the counter, took her by the arm and sent for an officer. From the appearance of the muslin, they had never been on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And because they had not been on the ground, you suppose she had taken them. - A. Yes. I had my eye upon her the whole of the time, her countenance changed. I observed her take and put them on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only wanted a bit of muslin to go over my caps. I saw it lay on the ground, when I stooped down to pick my pattens up.</p>

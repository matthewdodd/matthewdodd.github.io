                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in St. John's-street, Bethnal-green, with my father. The prisoner has been a lodger of my father's for the last ten weeks, and slept in the same bed with me—on Thursday, the 2nd of April, I got up at seven o'clock—the prisoner had got up at six o'clock—I could not find my great-coat which had hung over a chair in the bed-room—the prisoner was gone—I saw him the same night—Hayden, my father-in-law, brought him back at eleven o'clock at night—I had informed him of my loss that morning, as soon as I got up—the prisoner was carrying the great-coat—I informed him of what was in the pockets—he said there was nothing whatever in them, and called God to witness it—I told him I would freely forgive him, if he would acknow ledge to what was in the pockets—he said there was nothing in them, and I gave him in charge—there was a pair of black gloves, a yard of black, linen, and a black-lead pencil, in the pockets when I lost it, but they were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. My son-in-law and the prisoner lodged at my house—Edwards gave me information of his loss as soon as he got up on Thursday morning; and about three o'clock in the afternoon I got information, and went after the prisoner—he usually came home about eleven o'clock at night—he had left his situation the day before, is consequence of which I allowed him to sleep at my house that night—I found him at Collyer-row, Romford, at his mother's—when I went in the said, "Halloo, what do you want to say to me?"—I said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to bring me down here"—he said, "What for!" I said, "You have got Thomas's coat on your back"—he said it was not his coat—I looked at it and said, "It is, and you must go to town with me"—he pulled the coat off, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the floor, and said it was at my peril to take it—his mother persuaded him to come to town with me, to clear it up—he put the coat on his arm, and came along with me quietly—when I came home, I sent for his old master—I called a policeman in, and gave him in charge that night—I did not know where he lived till I went to his old master.</p>

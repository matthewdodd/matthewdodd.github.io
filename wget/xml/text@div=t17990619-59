They never go out of my house marked, unmanufactured; they were in whole pieces, perhaps of one hundred and thirty yards, and we cut them, and mark them, those are my marks; the prisoner was in custody; I think, the man of the house opened his box; says he, this is Willerton's box, he could open it without a key; the woman of the house was very much alarmed.</p>

I said I should detain him and the note, but if he had taken it of his master he would be in no danger; he refused to tell what part of Chancery-lane his master lived in. Dallas, the street-keeper, came in and detained him till Edwards came. He borrowed sixpence of one of the men, to pay for the gin he had had.

               <p>"Wilson, Haughton-street, Clare-market;" which Poor wrote on the note, and said it was bad; he said he had it from his master, in Chancery-lane. He wanted to go away, saying, he must see about it. I said he must not go, and asked Poor if he had sent for anybody - he said he had. The prisoner then seemed very impatient, said the person was not coming, and he should go; and asked what right I had to stop him. I collared him, said I was an officer, and if he offered to stir I would knock him down. Edwards came in, and we took him to Bow-street. The prisoner asked one of the men to pay for the gin, which he did, with sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he drunk - A. He appeared perfectly sober. He said at Bow-street, that he had sixpence in his pocket.</p>

               <p>"This afternoon I picked up a woman's pocket in Drury-lane - it contained a 1 l. note and a 5 s. piece. I changed the 5 s. piece at the Sun, public-house, in Clare-market, and spent 4 s. 6 d. Two women were there, and Smith, a master-butcher, went with me to the prosecutor's - he was going to treat me; I thought I would treat him, as he had treated me several times. There was a thimble and a needle in the pocket, which I threw away."</p>

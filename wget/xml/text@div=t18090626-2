               <p>Mr. Alley. You told my lord that there were a number of women, there were some men were there not - A. No, none except what were belonging to the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you leave your own door and tell your neighbours that your husband had been robbed - A. The inhabitants are very poor people, and they were all in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was robbed about ten then he went to his watch - you knew he had been robbed why did not you call some of your neighbours or the watchman - A. There was no watchman then; when my husband got up the next morning, he went to Lambeth-street office in our parish; and Conner, when he got up, he went to Shadwell office and took my husbands stick there. As I was going along with my husband an officer met me; he told me he had a warrant against me, he took me in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were taken up I suppose upon the charge of Conner - A. Yes, and Conner and Driscoll were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any charge against Mrs. Conner - A. Yes, for pulling me by the hair.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel office. On the 2nd of June, in the morning Kain came down to the office and complained that he had been robbed of a one pound note, a half guinea and a half crown; about one o'clock in the day I apprehended Driscoll and his wife; I took them to the office; I searched him, I found half a guinea. On my return from the office I took up the other prisoner.</p>

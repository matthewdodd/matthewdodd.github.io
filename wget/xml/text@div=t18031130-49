               <p>Q. How soon after she was cleaning it did you miss it? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make known your loss to the prisoner? - A. Yes, I was charging a boy of the name of May, who came into the house to have a pint of beer, with it; I told him no person had been in but him that I could suspect; he threw himself upon his knees, and declared himself innocent; the prisoner wanted me to send him to jail, but as the boy declared himself innocent, I would not; on Sunday morning, the 7th of August, I went up with the constable into the prisoner's room, and there I saw my candlestick lying on his table; I told the constable that was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Bryant say? - A. Not a word; I gave charge of him, and he was taken before a Magistrate. - (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be your's? - A. Yes, by two dents in the side; I asked him how he came by it at the watch-house, and he denied that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your's? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who had the public-house before you took it? - A. A man by the name of Condon.</p>
               <p>Q. He had taken it before of the prisoner, had not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Condon was appraised in, and so were you? A. No, I was not appraised in, I bought them without a broker; we lumped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy more than two candlesticks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you bought more? - A. I bought two brass candlesticks and two iron ones.</p>
               <p>Q. You inhabit the whole of the house, excepting one room, which he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been considerable quarrels between you? - A. Not considerable.</p>
               <p>Q. You have gone to law together, have not you? - A. As far as a summons went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the hearing? - A. One summons I got a verdict, and the other was dismissed without prejudice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any other candlesticks in his room? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bleamire committed him for a felony, did not he? - A. He ordered him over to bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For the candlestick? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, it is not true that he was dismissed upon that complaint? - A. Upon my oath it is not true, he was obliged to give bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not bound over for an assault, and was not that the charge that was made? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively the Justice did not bind you over to prosecute the assault at the next Clerkenwell Sessions? - A. No, he told the prisoner he must find bail.</p>
               <p>Q. For the assault? - A. No, for the felony, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no charge of an assault before the Magistrate? - A. No, because I brought the candlestick before Mr. Bleamire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said before the Justice put in writing? - A. I don't know, I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not put in writing, and signed by the Justice and yourself? - A. His clerk put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. Yes, but I never read it over.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor it was not read over to you? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went before Mr. Bleamire? - A. On the Monday after the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in July or August? - A. In July.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was in July? - A. Yes, I do; it was on the 7th of August that I found the candlestick, and on the 8th I went before Mr. Bleamire.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for by the last witness to apprehend the prisoner; I went up into his room; Mr. Bryant was at the threshold of the door at the bottom of the stairs; he begged of me to let him go up stairs into his own room; I went up with him; we stopped some little time, and Mr. Gibbons came up to see what we were about, and he saw this candlestick, and said it was his property; he gave me charge of him, and I took him to the watch-house, and there I left him; Mr. Gibbons put the candlestick into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the candlestick? - A. To the best of my knowledge he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. The candlestick was upon the table, not secreted at all? - A. It was upon the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What were you to take him up for? - A. For making a noise on the Sunday morning; I was sent for to take him for an assault.</p>

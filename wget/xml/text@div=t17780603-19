As soon as the woman passed, they called to me to stop, and said, blast your eyes, if you don't deliver your money, I will blow your brains out! I did not give them the money directly, on which Dracott snapt his pistol; I bid them take away the pistol, and I would give them my money; there was a person coming up, and the biggest, which I believe to be Webber,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030010"></xptr> turned round, and held out his pistol, and said, if he came a step farther, he would shoot him. Mr. Stratton coming up, they snatched my watch, and ran away; two ran down a lane, and the other, (which was Mills) ran up the town; I pursued him; he was stopped by a Mr. Hatfield, a shoe-maker; I never lost sight of him; Mr. Stratton and his brother pursued the others; in about a quarter of an hour after, I saw Dracott brought down the town; I knew him again immediately, and should know him from ten thousand.</p>

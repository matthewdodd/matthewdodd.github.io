                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cooper, of Windmilllull, Enfield. The prisoner came into my service on 4th Feb.—she came on trial, and was to have left on 4th March—previous to her leaving, I called her in the cook's presence to have her box examined—it was locked—I asked her for the key—she said she could not find it, she had lost it—I said I would hire it opened, and if she did not produce the key I would have it broken open—she then put her hand into her pocket, and took the key out—I found in the box a locket, a seal, a chased ring, a brooch, a pair of scissors, and some other articles—they belonged to me—I had never parted with them—I hid worn some of them a fortnight before—I asked her when she took them—she told me on the Saturday before, when I was in town—this box (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) is mine—it was broken open—it had six waist ribbons in it, which she had got—I said to her, "Where did you get these, they were locked up?"—she said, "I broke the box open"—I asked her where she got several articles—she told me from the different boxes where they were—she told me she had taken them from my boxes.</p>

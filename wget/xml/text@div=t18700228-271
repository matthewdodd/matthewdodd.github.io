                  </hi>. I am a butler, at 18, Palace Gardens, Kensington—on Monday night, 7th February, about 11.50. I went out and saw the prisoner—she asked me if I had heard some singing; I said "No"—she said she believed there was a party, and if I waited I should hear it—there was a soldier there, and I said, "That is a friend of yours?"—she said, "No; he is nothing to me"—we then walked a little way, and stood talking about five minutes—she then left me very quickly, saying, "Oh, that is a friend of mine, that soldier, and I want to go to him"—when I got back to No. 18 I missed my watch and chain from my waistcoat pocket, and my pin from my scarf—no one else had come up to me before that—I gave information to the police next morning—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had no con<lb></lb>nexion with the prisoner, but I might have taken some improper liberties.</p>

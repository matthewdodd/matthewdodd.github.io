               <p>Q. Did you not tell him it would be better for him if he would confess? - I never said any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were your property? - I can swear to them, because they were part of a barn.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the barn been pulled down? - Yes. I had missed such, and I asked him two days before, about such things, whether he had got them? and he told me no.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this a proper thing for repairing his fence? - Not at all fit; of late years it had always been repaired with bushes.</p>

               <p>Court to Penny. Was it old or new timber? - Some were old and some not so old.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

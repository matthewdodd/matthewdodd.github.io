                  </hi>. I am a potman, and live at Blandford Mews, Mary-le-bone—on Whit Monday I saw the prisoner and the deceased together—they were both in liquor—I heard them call one another liars, and the deceased said that he would box McCoy—McCoy said, "Very well, if you can box, I will box you, "and asked him to give him time to go up stairs and change his boots, and then he would come back and fight him—the deceased took off his things to prepare for fighting, sat down on a door step, and waited till the prisoner returned—they then shook hands, and Webb said, "We will fight fair"—they fought four rounds, and after that I took Webb away, and helped to take him into No. 1. Baker's-court—he complained of his arms being paralysed, and his neck, so that he could not move them—I saw no foul blow struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Slade's-buildings, Blandford-mews—I am the deceased brother—he was between forty-five and forty-six years of age—I was fetched from my work on Whit Monday, and found him fighting with the prisoner in Blandford-mews—they fell down together twice—I helped to carry him to a house—he was quite paralysed, and had lost the use of his arms—I went and put my tools away and then took him to Middlesex Hospital, where he died at ten minutes past 5 next morning.</p>

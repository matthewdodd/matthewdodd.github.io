On the 30th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to go out to market, and left her in the house cleaning a stove; nobody else was in the house except my little boy, who is about ten years old, and he was down stairs, not in the same room with the prisoner - she was cleaning a stove in the parlour we usually inhabit - I was not gone above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and on returning I found the parlour door locked, and the key outside the door, in the lock- my little boy was down stairs in the kitchen; I called to the prisoner to open the door, but she was gone - I unlocked the door, went in, and found the room all in confusion - the stove brush laid on the floor, and a large hammer laid at the corner of a chest of drawers, and a pair of scales were moved off a box, and I found the box broken open - I had left it locked; on examing it I missed a small leather trunk out of it, in which I had thirty-five sovereigns, a watch, and a ring, 29s. In silver, two purses, and some other things - I had seen the things in the trunk a few days before, and I saw the trunk in the box the day before; I made inquiry after the prisoner but did not see her for about a mouth afterwards, when I saw her at the George, on Snow-hill, kept by Percival; she was dressed very elegantly - she had a silk dress on - when she lived with me her dress was very mean and low; she was up stairs in a bed-room there, but not in bed - I said, "Oh, Esther are not you ashamed to be seen dressed as you are by robbing the window and fatherless?" I have three small children - she made no reply; a person opened her hand-box, in her presence, and took but of it my little trunk, and asked me if it was mine - I said Yes, I could take my oath of it was the trunk which had contained my money and other things - I brought it away with me, and afterwards give it to Aslett; she was not taken into custody at that time; she went out with me, as I asked her very particularly for my husband watch - she said she liad not got it, that she had pawned it for 18s., and she could get me the duplicate if I would go with her; I asked how far it was - she said not far; I went with her about three miles or more - she then turned back, and told me she did not know where it was; I did not know my way in the City-I followed her, expecting she would lead me back to Mr. Percival's house; she led me down by Hyde-park - I begged her to lead me straight to Percival's; as I did not know where it was I stopped and asked a young man if I was near Snow-hill; he said No, I was going away from it as fast as I could, and when I turned back to look for her she was gone - she came to my house afterwards; I asked if she was not ashamed of herself - she went away, after some conversation; I saw her again on the Sunday before the examination, in a house in Union-street; I had been directed to that house - I had heard she wanted to sell the duplicate of the watch; I begged of her not to sell it, but to give it to me - she then said if I would go with her she would get the duplicate; she told me to go and get my bonnet and shawl, and that it was not far - I said I would go without them, and she led me to the bottom of the Borough; I was afraid of being lost again, and said, "Is it much further?" She said No; I said, "Is it the next street?" she said No - I said."Is it the next to that?" the said No, and if I went with her I should see: the first Policeman I saw I desired him to ask her for the ticket of my watch, and he took her - that was Aslett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not freely forgive me at Mr. Percival's house, and say you would not hurt me, and you took my clothes? A. I took some of her clothes - when I came to Percival's he asked what I intended to do with her- I said I was a window, and did not understand the law; he told me if I prosecuted her it would not me between 40l. and 50l., and I had not a farthing; I told her as it was not in my power to punish her, I hoped the great God above would, but I would forgive her freely if she produced my husband's watch, I would freely forgive her the rest.</p>

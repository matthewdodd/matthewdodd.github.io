                  </hi>. I am the deputy-purveyor at the General Hospital, at Woolwich—when coals are delivered from the contractors to the hospital, there are tickets collected after delivery, which are handed to me—I received four bundles of tickets for the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th of</p>

I am a sergeant in the Army Hospital Corps—I was appointed to superintend the delivery of coals on the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th of December—the prisoner Davis was under me, and it was his duty to superintend that when I was away—I do not think I was there on the 6th—I had other duties to attend—I was there for a short time on the 7th; early in the morning—I went away, leaving Davis there, and again on the 8th and 9th the same—I paid occasional visits—while I was absent Davis had the uncontrolled check of the coals—it was his duty, whenever a cart came in with a load of coals, to receive a ticket from the carman, and to see that the coals agreed with the ticket—he would take the number on the ticket, and check it by the number of sacks in the wagon—he would then place the tickets on the file, and give them all to me at the end of the day—I delivered these tickets to Mr. Sherman on the Saturday—I examined them, and found them to be correct—I find that they indicate the right number of coals that were delivered—the dress that Davis wears is that of a private soldier.</p>

Hunter and Frost the contractors—on the 7th I was driving a van, hired from Mr. Tomkins—I took a load of coals to Woolwich hospital—Shipton spoke to me on 7th—he told me when I delivered the first load that he would meet me by the Bull, and tell me where the other load was to go—the Bull is about twenty yards out of the road from the contractor's to the hospital I should think—when I came with the next load I met him at the Bull—he told me to follow him, he would show me where they were going to—I did so, and went to a house in Whitworth-place—I know now that it was the prisoner Burley's house—Shipton told me to pull up—I had two tons of coals in my van—they were all taken out in the sacks, and the sacks afterwards put back into the cart—Shipton asked me for the ticket, and I gave it to him—I then went back for another load—I took that load to the hospital—I took no more loads anywhere but to the hospital on that day—on the next day, the 8th, I took the first and second loads to the hospital—the third Shipton told me was to go to the same place, and he would meet me near the Bull—I met him, he took me to Burley'a, and two tons were delivered there again—Shipton asked me for the ticket, saying he wanted to take it to the hospital, and I gave it him—on that occasion Burley drove up in an empty cart, and two sacks were loaded into it—the name of Howard was on the cart—two Backs were unloaded out of my load into the cart—the rest of the load was taken into Burley's place, into a back-yard—they were shot out of the sacks into a shed—I took another load there on the 8th, about four o'clock by Shipton's order—he met me there—it was about two o'clock in the day when Burley came up with the cart—two sacks were taken out of my cart and put into Burley's cart, and the rest of the load was put into Burley's yard—I did not see what became of the coals that were loaded into Burley'e cart—he saw it done—I gave the ticket of that load to Ship<lb></lb>ton—I took all my loads to the hospital on the 9th—I remember delivering my last load on that day—I gave the ticket of that load to the soldier on duty at the gate—I can't swear to Davis as the man—it was dusk—Shipton shot the coals of that load—I helped him with about half of them out; that was the last load—I had occasion to get out, and Shipton said, "Go on, they are all right"—he told me to drive on and I did so—I was not aware at that time that there were any sacks of coal in the van—he told me all that were in the van were to go back to the wharf in the morning—I had to take the van that night to my employer's place, Mr. Tomkins—I did not</p>

On the morning of 9th December, in consequence of information 1 received, 1 communicated with Mr. Hunter, and watched a cart-load of coals which came from the direction of the ship, driven by Malem—the coals were for the hospital—I saw him turn out of the direct road in the direction of Burley's house, about 140 or 150 yards from it—I went to the top of the street—Malem saw me, and turned his horse's head round—I followed him to the hospital, and saw the coals delivered—I was not in uniform—he has known me for two or three years—I afterwards went to Burley's house with Mr. Frost, and found about eleven tons of coal in a shed in a yard at the back of the house—they</p>

Woolwich—he is a very respectable man—he asked Burley if he should get him any legal assistance—he said, "No; I shall not require it; I shall plead guilty to receiving a load or two, and try and get it settled here"—on the 20th, I apprehended Malem at the Dockyard at work—I told him I wished him to go with me to see the man who he had offered some coals to on the 9th—I took him to the Prince of Wales, and there showed him to Thomas Burley, who was a waiter there—I believe he is another brother of the prisoner Burley's—Thomas Burley said, "That is the man who offered me the coals on Friday"—Malem did not say anything—I then charged him with stealing a quantity of coals belonging to the Government—he said, "I shall speak the truth about it; the first day that I was carting coals to the Hospital the private soldier, who was taking the tickets, said, 'You must find a shop to put away a few tons'—I did not want to have anything to do with it till after I had seen Steve Burley, and on Thursday, the 8th, I took him a ton load, and shot them in the shed, and Burley paid me in his house ten shillings for them—I went back to the wharf, and took another load to the hospital, and gave the two tickets and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the private soldier, who was taking the tickets, and the rest I spent in drink"—I then took him to the station—he commenced making the same statement before the sergeant—he was cautioned, and then he made the same statement two or three times—he seemed over anxious to make it—the 8th was Thursday—none of the other prisoners were present when Malem made that statement.</p>

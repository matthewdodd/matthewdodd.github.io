             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a watchman belonging to the India-Company: On Saturday, the 25th of this month, I was upon my station at Cutter's-street, New-street, Bishopsgate-street, to protect a house under repair, belonging to the East-India Company; the prisoner was a labourer, working under the plaisterer to the Company; between five and six o'clock on Saturday last, in the evening, I observed the prisoner coming into the building, and suspecting that he had something about him which he ought not, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got about him; I then called for assistance, and desired him to unbutton, and he unbuttoned the bottom of his waistcoat, and there was some lead concealed, which dropped; I called for the constable; when he came, I gave him charge of the prisoner, and he was taken to the Compter, where I delivered the lead to the constable; on the Monday morning, I went with the foreman of the plumbers to the building, and found the lead fitted.</p>

               <p>- FRANCIS sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the lead); I was called to the assistance of Mr. Burgin; I took the prisoner into custody in Bishopsgate-street; Mr. Burgin had a piece of lead in his hand, which he delivered to me at the Compter; I searched the prisoner, and under his waistcoat I found another piece; he wore an apron, which helped to keep it up; the prisoner said he was very sorry for what he had done; on the Monday following, I went with the foreman, and Mr. Burgin, to the premises; we took the lead with us, and searched round the building to see where the lead was missing; there was one side like a closet, and a leaden pipe ran down by the side of it; we matched these pieces, and they fitted; it appears to have been broken off very lately.</p>

               <p>- FOSTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to the plumber, employed by the East-India Company; I went to compare this lead with the premises, and found it sit as high as possible; it was broke off, but what was taken from the prisoner is not enough to make good the deficiency.</p>

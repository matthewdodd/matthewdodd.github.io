                  </hi>. I live at 123, Pentonville Road, and am a solicitor's clerk—about a quarter to twelve on Thursday night, 22nd November, I was at the corner of Farringdon Road with Charles Webb and another young man—I took off my coat and laid it upon some railings first and then upon the stones—the others did the same—we then all began to leap over a railing by the side of the road—that was about two yards from the coat—I saw the prisoner standing about for about ten minutes, and I removed the coat inside on the stones—then he went away—we jumped for some little time, when I happened to turn round and saw the prisoner take my coat—he must have gone round the back way by a public-house, and come up a hole where they are building some foundations—he went down the hole again—I jumped down the hole after him and fell down, and then I called Webb, who ran down the hole safely and followed the prisoner under a lot of arches out of my sight—when he went down the hole I was on my back, but got up and saw the two running up the end by Field Lane, near a lot of courts—I described the person who took my coat to Trafford, and saw the prisoner in custody on the night of the 23rd at the Smithfield Police-station—I have no doubt about his being the man who took my coat—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it a dark night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly—we were first one side of the railings and then the other, jumping over them—the ground is not very level—we were jumping from the pavement to the other side—it may have been six inches higher on the other side—I think, we were jumping for about twenty minutes—I had seen the prisoner loitering about about ten minutes before the coat was stolen—I spoke to the policeman about five minutes after it was stolen—the prisoner was there about ten minutes, and I had an opportunity of looking at him—I told the policeman he had a broken nose, a short jacket, and a slouched cap—that is the only description I gave him—I knew the prisoner was at the station because the policeman came and told me—I gave him my address—I saw the prisoner at the station in the dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, Charles Street, Bermondsey, and am a professional dancer—on the night of 22nd November, a quarter before midnight, I was with Cook and another at the corner of Farringdon Road—we took off our coats and began jumping over some railings—we laid our coats on some railings, but, seeing somebody watching them, we moved them to some flagstones—we continued jumping for about seven or eight minutes—Cook said, "There is somebody taking my coat"—I saw the prisoner come from the back of some ruins up a hole—he took Cook's</p>

               <p>coat, and immediately ran away with it down the hole—Cook jumped after him and fell down—I jumped down the hole and ran after him—I did not overtake him—I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many of you were there that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three, Cook, William Kerr, and me—the hole is a place leading up from the broken brickwork not quite finished of the foundations into the road—I saw the prisoner while we were jumping—I described him by his bent nose—I did not notice his cap; he had a cap—I saw him again going into Guildhall Police-court on the Saturday, when he was going to be examined—the hole was about four yards from the road—we were not jumping in the road, but from the pavement on to some waste ground—Cook jumped down into the hole—it was not quite dark—there were gaslights in the road—I followed the prisoner amongst some courts.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 281)I was on duty on Holborn Hill about midnight on Thursday, 22nd November—Cook described to me a person who he said had stolen his coat, and I took the prisoner the next night on Holborn Hill—I told him he would be charged with stealing a coat—he said he had lost a coat himself, and knew nothing about the coat Cook lost—nothing was found on him—his nose is rather high on the bridge—he had a fashionable jacket with pockets at the side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is that the jacket which he has on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I took him into custody from the description given to me, in addition to having seen him there in the Farringdon Road that night—I had seen these lads jumping over this rail, and the prisoner standing watching them, so that immediately I received the description I came to the conclusion that he must be the man—Cook described him as having a cap with a peak on, and a dark coat, and that he had a very peculiar nose—I believe I did not mention this at the police-court—I do not think that I saw him the same night was in my evidence—it is not an afterthought—I found no coat on the prisoner but the one he had on.</p>

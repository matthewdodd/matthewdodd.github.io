             (police-constable F 152). On the night of the 19th of May, I was coming down from Tyburn-gate, and met the prisoner with something under her shawl - I asked her what she had got; she said, Nothing to me - I stopped her and said, I insisted upon seeing what she had got; she said, a hat - I asked where she got it; she said her brother gave it her, who lived at Bayswater, but she could not tell the name of the street nor the number - I asked her if her brother had been at home all day; she said, Yes - I took her to the station-house, and went about a quarter of a mile and saw the prosecutor asleep on a step without a hat - I asked him where his hat was; he said, he had lost it - I took him to the station-house, and he saw the hat and claimed it - it was about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the hat; I kicked it before me and then took it up - I met the policeman, who took me to the station-house and brought this man - he asked me the next morning if I had any money; if I had he would tell me what to say.</p>

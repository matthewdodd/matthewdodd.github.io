            . I live in Charles-street, Seymour-street, Euston-square - about half-past ten o'clock on the night of April 25, I was in <placeName id="t18340515-12-crimeloc65">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Perry. Q. What did the officer say to you when I was first taken into custody? A. Both were taken together - the officer said, "Sir, you have lost your handkerchief" - I turned round, and he said, "There it is, on the ground" - I took it up - he then said, "The street is swarming with them, you must go with me to the watch-house, which is close by."</p>
               <p>Perry. The officer came up and said, "I believe, Sir, you have lost your handkerchief, and I believe one of those two boys has got it" - there were two boys running down the street - the gentleman said at first he had not lost any thing - the officer said, "You had better feel" and the handkerchief was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Witness. That is not exactly correct - he said, "You have lost your handkerchief" - I put my hand into my pocket and found I had lost it - he had both the prisoners in custody, and pointed to my handkerchief on the ground.</p>
               <p>Perry. When the officer came to the watch-house he said, "I very nearly caught two more; they knew me, which made them run away" - I leave it to the jury to say whether those two had not come to look for the handkerchief, where they had thrown it.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Bride's - on the 25th of April I was coming down Fleet-street, and saw the two prisoners behind the prosecutor - Lloyd ran up and took the handkerchief out, and handed it to the other prisoner, who saw me and threw it down - I seized him, and told the prosecutor his pocket was picked - he felt and missed it - I said, "There it lies, on the ground" - he took it up, and I told him to come to the watch-house - he seemed not inclined to come, and I said, "This is the way so many pickpockets are about," and he came down with it- I afterwards went into the watch-house, and said as I came along, two young gentlemen had very nearly picked a pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Perry's Defence. I made no resistance - my mother had been ill about four months - I had to go to Tothill-fields, to a Mrs. Malay, to come and sit up with her all night, which was the reason I was out at that time - I had been ill in bed all the week myself.</p>
               <p>Lloyd's Defence. He asked me to go with him to the other end of the town - the officer caught hold of us and said one of us had got the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWEL re-examined. I am positive Lloyd put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and I saw him deliver the handkerchief to Perry; I seized them immediately.</p>
               <p>(Elizabeth Arnold, coal-dealer, Coleman-street Buildings; and Jane Stott, 3, Sun-court, Coleman-street; gave the prisoner Lloyd a good character; and Frances Putt, 17, Moor-lane, Fore-street, gave the prisoner Perry a good character.</p>

At about twelve o'clock on the night in the indictment, I thought I heard the glass of the kitchen window broken; I got up, I struck a light; I went down to the kitchen, and under the window, I saw some fragments of glass. I did not appear to notice it, and went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you acted in such way, that if any person was looking at you, you would not seem to see it - A. Yes. I then extinguished the light, and went to an upper room; I then gently opened the window where I sat. The watchman then came down the street, crying the hour; and then I heard footsteps coming down before him; they did not come as low as my house. The watchman then went round to the front of the buildings, and on his coming into the other end of the street, the footsteps then retreated. At one o'clock, a coach drove through the street; I observed a person following the coach, and I saw him come over to my kitchen window, and kneel down upon the grating. The only light there was, was the light of a lamp opposite my door. I then took a dirk, and proceeded down stairs, very softly, into the kitchen; I then heard some one endeavouring to get out a gimblet, with which I had fastened the two sashes together; for I had been robbed so often. The person then desisted for some cause. I then went to the window, and perceived it was broke, and felt something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250014"></xptr>moist, which moistness afterwards turned out to be blood. I then took a chair and sat myself down, opposite to the window; after a little time, the person came again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the person, do you mean to say, you had so much light as to be able to discern it was the same person that came at first - A. No; that is only as I conjecture. The person came again, as I was saying, and succeeded in getting out the gimblet; he then forced down the upper sash, and introduced an instrument; it was a stick, with a hook fixed to the end of it. I could see, by the light of a lamp, that he was reaching to a basket of clothes, which was under the window; there was only his arm in; I thought a little management would be only requisite to take him. I then put the dirk into my pocket, and ntly advanced towards him. When his arm was in he full extent, I then seized it with both hands above wrist. I pulled him as tight as ever the railing w permit; at one time, he almost got away; but by sudden hard pull, I brought him down to his shoulders. I then called to the watchman, and so did Mrs. Jenkins; the watchman came; I refused to deliver him up the watchman until he had got more assistance; then two gentlemen, neighbours, came to our assistance, and then I let him go.</p>
               <p>(A stick was here produced, with a large fishing hook affixed to it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What do you conceive that is for - A. The family had been washing; the sheets were hanging before the fire, and a basket of clothes was immediately beneath the window. I, and my neighbours, have lost our clothes frequently in the same manner.</p>

            . I am a watchman. When I had called the hour of one o'clock round the extent of my beat, and came back to my box, I heard a female cry of watch! watch! my husband will be killed! I ran immediately, and found the prisoner laying on his face on the iron bars, by the kitchen window; Mr. Jenkins had hold of him; Mr. Jenkins told me I had better spring my rattle for more assistance, which I did; two gentlemen then came from over the way, and then Mr. Jenkins let the prisoner go to us; we then took him to the watchhouse, where there were four more fish hooks taken from him; also a green bag, and a piece of black crape.</p>

            . I am an headborough. The prisoner was brought into the watchhouse by Cox, and I searched him; I found this green bag, and the hooks. I asked him what the hooks were for, and he said he went fishing some times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say the hook was tied to the stick for, was that for fishing - A. I don't know. He said, that the bag was to put the fish in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what sort of fish - A. No. Here is a crape bag. One of his hands was very bloody, and here are some of the fragments of the glass, also bloody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That crape bag was sowed up, so that it was impossible for any body to get their head in; and the constable has undone it.</p>
               <p>John Bootle. It is exactly as I had it, only the wire at the bottom is broken, by the doubling it up to put it into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, they both lodged in the house. We found six or seven feet of the lead on them, when I took the officer up stairs in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both lodge in one room - A. The woman said the man lodged with her; I found the lead in a basket, and an old cloak over it. They were both in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there more than one bed in the room - A. I did not examine it, there was but one bedstead; the man said he knew nothing at all how it came there.

I am sure he was the man, because I met him coming up the stairs; he did not move out of the house till I went for the landlord.</p>

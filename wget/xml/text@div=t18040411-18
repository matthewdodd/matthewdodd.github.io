               <p>Q. Do you attend the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it this happened? - A. On Saturday, the 10th of March; about half after one o'clock, the prisoner, Fisher, came into the shop, with another woman, to look at some ribbons; the prisoner, Matthews, I never saw till I saw her before the Magistrate; the other woman made her escape; Fisher asked to look at some ribbons; I took out the drawer, and placed it upon the counter; she turned over the ribbons several times in the drawer; there were none there that would please her, and I took some out of the window; she made choice of one, it was scarlet, with chocolate in the middle; the other person was difficult, and did not make choice of any; Fisher asked for a yard and a half of the one that she made choice of, and the person that was with her paid for it; they each offered me a seven-shilling piece for change; I took the seven-shilling piece from the other woman, whom she called Nance; I gave her six good shillings in change; she hesitated about the change being good, and I told her I had looked at it before I gave it her, and was sure it was all good, and I would not change them; a Mrs. Kemp then came in, whom I knew, for half an ounce of pins; she said to Fisher, that she believed the silver to be better than them; I asked her her reason for saying so; she said, they were shop-lifters.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they present? - A. Yes, they were; they went away immediately as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the ribbon come to? - A. A shilling; the woman that was called Nance sat upon a low seat in the shop; she pretended to have a very bad cough, and hid all her face entirely; she had a large cloak on, and she had either her gown or her cloak over her face at times; Fisher stood close by her; I did not see her drop any thing, but she certainly had the means of dropping them into her lap out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time? - A. My servant,

               <p>Q. You did not see any thing go yourself? - A. No; I immediately missed a piece of plain white ribbon from the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was in the drawer when you produced it? - A. Yes, I saw it afterwards at the Magistrates, between seven and eight in the evening; the prisoner, Fisher, was then in custody; I missed a piece of figured ribbon at the same time, from the same drawer, which I saw again at the Magistrates the same evening with some others; I lost five pieces in all, I saw four of them at the Magistrates; I knew them to be mine, two of them had my shop mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Matthews in custody at the same time with Fisher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Fisher before? - A. I don't think I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she is one of the two women that was in your shop? - A. Yes, they might be in the shop altogether about twenty minutes; I went in search of her with an officer, and found her in custody; I was not at the apprehension of either of the women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. A great many persons were in the shop during the time they were there? - A. There was my servant and Miss Bromet.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Miss Bromet here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself did not see any thing taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Kemp here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to follow them? - A. I had business at Ratcliff-cross, and I went in for the parcels I had to carry there; I told Mrs.

             I would follow them, and if I saw an officer, I would give charge of them; I afterwards saw Matthews standing by Old Gravel-lane, and then they all three came together again; they proceeded towards Ratcliff-cross; Fisher and the other woman then went into another shop, and I came back and acquainted the officer of it,

them they must go back; I brought the prisoner, Fisher, back to Shadwell-office, the other woman ran away the contrary way; there was about a yard and a half of 
ribbon found upon Fisher.</p>

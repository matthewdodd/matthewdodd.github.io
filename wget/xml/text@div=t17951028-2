            , that was not signed at the time, nor is it signed now? - No, I was to sign it, or get it signed, and he gave me a list of the shops that had been done; fearful I should go to those shops; I returned, and told him I could not do it, but I would get a friend to do it; he asked me who it was? I said it was a friend that meant to send them to Wales, and there they would be far distant from the town; that was my own idea to him, that he should not be urgent for the money immediately. The second note I had was in about two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that note for? - It was for five guineas; I cannot say particularly that I should know the note again, because there was no mark, and there was so many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note. (A note shewn him) - I am pretty positive, I would not swear, but I am pretty sure it is. This is a note on Messrs. Hankeys for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Which ever was the note, did you give the same note to Mr. Whittard and Mr. Winbolt? - I gave them first to Mr. Ellison, Mr. Ellison viewing the stamp to be forged, sent me to Mr. Escourt and Whittard, solicitors for the Stamp office, and clerk in the Stamp office. When he gave me the second note, he told me that as soon as he could raise fifty pounds, he would have a plate to work the Bank of England. I took this second one likewise to Mr. Ellison, Mr. Ellison viewed that likewise; but mentioning the Bank of England, I thought it my duty to go to Mr. Winter, the solicitor for the Bank, I went to him to shew him this second note, the five guinea note, as soon as I shewed it to Mr. Winter I took it to Mr. Escourt and Whittard, and there Mr. Ellison met me; then Mr. Whittard gave me some money; I then went to the prison, and I gave Mr. Catipodi some money.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280006"></xptr>Q. How much did he give you? - He gave me four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you came to Mr. Catipodi? - I took him some money and provisions.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did you give him? - I cannot absolutely say the sum. When this was over, which was the conclusion of the week, he came up to Bow-street, and was dismissed; I took the two notes from Mr. Whittard to Mr. Winbolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the same that you delivered to Mr. Winbolt afterwards, the same as you describe to have given Mr. Whittard before? - Yes, the very same; then a very few days elapsed before he was discharged, he was discharged the 20th of July; then there were various appointments between Mr. Catipodi and me till the 8th of August; there were people who were negociating these bills, and we sometimes met them in St. James's Park, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another. But however on the 5th of August he gave me the bill in question, which is the subject of the present indictment, he gave it me in the avenue, or lane, leading from his garden door in Frog-lane, or Frogmore-lane, I slington; he then gave me the bill signed,

               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you was to do with this note? - To negociate it, and to make all the haste possible to do it. Previous to this we agreed to go to Southampton, and all the coasts about, as soon as we could raise as much money as we could travel genteelly down; I offered to go with him as an attendant, but there were two or three to go with him as occomplices; this was in the afternoon, between four and five o'clock. I could not see Mr. Ellison at his office that evening, immediately I waited on him at his house in Sloan-place, Chelsea; he likewise viewed this not to be quite perfect; I went to Mr. Whittard, and Mr. Whittard took a good impression of the stamp, and compared them, and said this is not a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Meaning not a forged stamp? - Yes. Immediately I went to Mr. Winbolt, the solicitor for the Bank of England. I am sure this is the note, I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you gave this note to Mr. Winbolt? - I did, I told Mr. Winbolt that he was very urgent for money, and I must take him something, and Mr. Winbolt gave me a guinea; it was then towards the evening, and the next day, as Mr. Catipodi met his accomplices down at the parade at St James's, the Horse Guards, at eleven o'clock, which was the usual hour of exercising, there I met Catipodi as usual, then I gave him four shillings out of the guinea; he had some other people whom he expected money of, he did expect money of three different people I believe; he complained very much that the people who had his bills did not come forward as they ought to do with the money for the bills that he gave them, and he threatened to impeach some of them.(The bill read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

You have told us that you were employed by Mr. Winbolt, on your oath were you? - I have been so far employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280007"></xptr>by Mr. Winbolt, that I have done Mr. Winbolt and his client service, and Mr. Winbolt paid me for it; Mr. Ellison recommended me to Mr. Winbolt; I was employed by both so far.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose if Mr. Winbolt should swear that he did not employ you, he is guilty of perjury; do you mean to swear on your oath that you was employed by him? - I will not say that Mr. Winbolt ever sent for me, I cannot say that I was employed under Mr. Winbolt by any means.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me ask you what you meant by being employed in the service of the public, and that that was the way you got your livelihood? - No, far from it; I have told you the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this public service? - It is a public service that I must not mention.</p>
               <p>Q. In plain English are you not acting as a common informer? - No, never was in that kind of way in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not bound to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that you gave two blank notes to Mr. Winbolt, when was it you gave him them? - The first was I believe in July, about the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since this note in question was given Mr. Winbolt? - On the 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Winbolt had the intervening time from the 19th of July to the 5th of August, to enquire into these notes? - He did not think any thing at all of these notes; M. Winbolt knew his practices for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you represent it to Mr. Winbolt as a bank note? - I thought it was my duty, I had no occasion of making any representation of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you first enquire of Mr. Ellison whether the stamp was a good one or a bad one? - I did not enquire any thing at all of Mr. Ellison, but whether it was a forged note or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to do that? - Mr. Whittard and Mr. Escourt.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion did Mr. Winbolt know of your having been at the Stamp office? - I told him when I gave him the note that I had been, and the stamp was not forged; Mr. Winbolt looked at it, and I said I must take Mr. Catipodi some money, and he gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. 
               <persName id="t17951028-2-person86">

            , how much money did you receive of Mr. Whittard? - Mr. Whittard gave me four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you get these four guineas as a reward to encourage you to go forward? - Upon my word it was not; part I gave to Catipodi and part I kept.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give him? - I cannot tell, as I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. But you shall tell. Did you give the half? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the fourth? - Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a guinea? - It may be more or it may be less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him as much as five shillings? - Yes, a vast deal; or three times five.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Mr. Winbolt gave you a guinea on this last note, what did Mr. Winbolt say to you? - Mr. Winbolt seemed in a hurry, and there was no conversation at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the note in Mr. Winbolt's hands before he gave you the guinea? - It was not five minutes, because he was in a hurry, going out.</p>
               <p>Q. You represented to Mr. Winbolt what you wanted the money for? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London? - Above sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you continued in London during that time? - Yes, except such time as I was clerk to Sir Paul - , down at Boxley Abbey.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were at Dublin? I believe you are an Irishman? - About nineteen years.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280008"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to swear that you have never been in Dublin these nineteen years? - I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body shall say that you was concerned in the robbery on the lottery wheel there, then they will swear that that is false? - Indeed they will.</p>
               <p>Q. In this town have you ever employed yourself as giving bail for several persons, and receiving money for so doing?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot answer such questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you ever given bail for the prisoner and his son? - I did, about three years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the solicitor for the association of bankers of London and Westminster. Do you remember Mr. Blake coming to you on the latter end of July? - Yes, he did; on the 25th of July he brought me these two blank notes; I told him I thought they were of no consequence, but desired him to leave them with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him? - On the 6th of August he came to me, and brought me this note that is stated in the indictment, he told me it was given to him by the prisoner at the bar, to negociate.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced it to you and left it? - He did, I asked him to leave it, and he said he would, he said that Catipodi would expect something, I gave him a guinea; the note I have had in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p> - WHITTARD sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are in the Solicitor's office, in the department of stamps. I only want to know whether you was privy to these circumstances which have been mentioned by Blake? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley to Winbolt. At the time you gave the money you knew the bill was forged? - I expected it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give it him in fair negociation? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Whittard. Did you examine the stamps on his producing the bills to you? - I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280009"></xptr>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Ellison was privy to these transactions? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley submitted to the court, that in this case, the evidence went no further than having this forged note in his possession, but not of his forging or uttering, with an intent to defraud.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the question which the jury have to decide; if a man merely forges a note, and takes no steps on that note; there is no evidence of his intention to defraud, but if he takes any steps on that note; then there is evidence to go to a jury, for to decide whether he meant to defraud or no.</p>

            ; my lord must permit me to observe to the gentlemen of the jury, that it is the testimony of a man that has been well known to be guilty of every species of perjury and fraud; and it is not justice that has impelled him to this prosecution; no, his corrupt heart is destitute of every honest sentiment, and he is induced to this prosecution by hopes of a reward, which he is promised if he can prevail on you to pronounce me guilty; under these hopes he comes into this honourable court, and endeavours by falshood to mislead your judgment, and under the mask of justice he endeavours to rob me of my existence. Painful as my situation is, I feel a singular satisfaction that I am tried in this tribunal, and under your lordship's direction I leave my cause; I have no witnesses, I thought Blake's character was sufficiently notorious to be known by some of the jury, or some of the gentlemen in this court.</p>

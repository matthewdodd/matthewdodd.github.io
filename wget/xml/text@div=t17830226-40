               <p>"that from and after the 2d of June 1766, all and every person and persons, who shall in the night time, lop, top, cut down, break, throw down, bark, burn, or otherwise cut or destroy, or carry away, any oak, beech, ash, lime, fir, Chesnut, or asp timber trees, or other tree or trees, standing for timber, or likely to become timber, without the consent of the owners, shall be guilty of felony, and shall be punished accordingly: It is punishable with transportation."

            , then being the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield, without their consent. Gentlemen, by an act of parliament of the 17th of his present Majesty, made for dividing of Enfield Chace, there was a certain allotment of the Chace vested in the church-wardens of Enfield, and they are thereby made the owners of it, for the benefit of the parish; and they are incorporated by the same act of parliament, and are to be called a body politic, by the name of the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield; they are the church-wardens of the parish church of Enfield, in the county of Middlesex: Therefore by this act of parliament it is vested in them; so much for the crime, and so much for the conduct of the prosecutors. The facts to bring this charge home to the prisoners are shortly these: - On the 28th of December last, a watchman who was at his stand in a street called Baker's-street near Enfield town, observed a team with four horses go towards the Chace, he wished the parties a good night, but they made no answer; this was on a Saturday night, and it rather surprised this watchman to see a team with four horses go towards the Chace at that hour of the night. At the hour of four in the morning, as the watchman was crying the hour, he heard at a distance, a team coming along; after crying the hour for some little time he heard the team stop; this created a suspicion in his mind, after which he stood nearer to the highway, so as to see the team pass, and he saw it come past him; one man came before the team, walking a little way, another man held the fore horse of the team, and another was driving the team; he observed likewise, that the cart was loaded with a number of young timber trees, but who the men were, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260070"></xptr> could not possibly tell; very soon after an alarm was raised, that these trees had been cut on this allotment belonging to the parish; some suspicions fell on Mr. Patrick, a search warrant was granted, and when they came to Mr. Patrick's house they found several young timber trees; and some trees likely to become timber trees, had been cut and sawed off. - Gentlemen, a person of the name of Hockett, having informed some of the overseers, that he knew something of the matter, the persons who went to search, cut off the end of the pieces of timber trees, they cut off that end, so as to make it tally with the stumps remaining in the earth; those trees that had been cut off, you will observe, they could not make tally; but the others which had been sawed off at the end, broke off at the end, they were taken to the place, and there they fitted exactly like an Exchequer tally: Upon this evidence you will have before you the particulars of the trees found in the prisoner's possession, the bits cut off, and those tallying with the stumps remaining in the ground; and this man Hockett will be produced to you, who was employed by Patrick himself, hired by him, to go to the Chace; and who together with Patrick and Pepper went to cut down these trees, and he will inform you, that they passed by the watchman, that he bid them good night, and that they returned no answer; that about four o'clock, hearing him call the hour of four, they stopped till he had done his cry, that he might go home to his box as they supposed he would; he will inform you that Patrick went before the horses, and that the others drove the team, as the watchman had observed, and that the watchman wished them a good night, but that none of them chose to answer him. Gentlemen, you will have this evidence of the accomplice fully corroborated in the strongest manner that such evidence can. The fact which is a very strong one of the property so taken, and so stolen from the Chace, and carried to the house of Patrick, will be fully proved to you; and also that they tallied exactly, so that there could be no mistake whatever. - Gentlemen, when these facts are thus proved to you by the witnesses that we shall call, it will be incumbent on Mr. Patrick to shew you where he got those trees, and unless he can make that out to your satisfaction, you will find the prisoners guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peckham, - My Lord, supposing for a moment, all that Mr. Silvester has stated to be true, I yet should trust under your Lordship's correction, that the prisoners ought to be acquitted, because I am supposing now that Mr. Silvester should prove, that the property of these trees was in the church-wardens of Enfield, pursuant to the act of parliament; we must likewise take under the act of parliament, that the churchwardens are trustees; but this indictment states, that the trees thus cut, are the property of

             the IIId. to make it a felony, for this act of parliament, for alloting the Chace does not make it so; and I understand this was after the division: the act of parliament has been particularly careful in speicfying the crime; it enacts, tha t</p>

               <p>"at his Majesty's expence shall be compleated,</p>
               <p>"shall be subject, and liable to</p>

               <p>"subject, or liable to in case this act had</p>

               <p>"And in case any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260071"></xptr> such offence or offences, shall be committed after the said fences shall be compleated, every such offender or offenders, shall be subject to all such suits, actions, damages, pains and penalties, as are provided by the laws and statutes of this realm, to be brought, given, imposed, or inflicted upon any person or persons, there committing the like offence or offences in the lanes, grounds, woods or coppices, being the private property of any of his Majesty's subjects." Now, your Lordship sees before the fences were made, it was all such pains, penalties, &amp;c. but after the fences are made, then they shall be subject to such actions, suits, &amp;c.

               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. What do you say to the first objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. - My Lord, if the names of the church-wardens had not been mentioned, then the objection would have been, it is uncertain, we do not know who they are, the act of parliament vests it in the church-wardens of the said parish of Enfield for the time being; therefore at that time it is vested in them; but says Mr. Mingay, it is ex abundanter; then leave out the names, consider the names as surplusage, and you have them as church-wardens, but it was necessary to mention the names of these church-wardens, because it would be otherwise uncertain when the offence was committed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. - My Lord, I am on the same side with Mr. Silvester, and I conceive it to be necessary in all indictments, that it should be stated, in and upon whom the offence is committed: Now I conceive here, that the offence is committed on these persons so named; and if it left out that they were church-wardens, the indictment would not have been bad; is it necessary that I should set forth how I came by my estate? Sufficient it is that the law vests the estate in me; therefore we shall offer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260072"></xptr> an act of parliament in evidence to substantiate the propriety of these people standing forth as owners of this property; we need not have stated the word church-wardens; but it is necessary for us to shew your Lordship that this estate is by act of law vested in those whom we describe as the parties interested in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It is unnecessary as I have formed a clear opinion on one objection: If the act of parliament had stood single upon the first clause, which vests the property in the church-wardens for the time being, the indictment would have been clearly right; it is manifestly that which induced the mistake of the person that 
               <persName id="t17830226-40-person508">

             the indictment; it does all that is necessary under that clause, the act of parliament vests the property in the church-wardens of the parish of Enfield for the time being, and this indictment describes it to be the property of certain persons by name, stating them also to be the church-wardens for the time being: but the other clause puts entirely an end to this question; and I conceive wherever any description of men are incorporated, and have a corporate capacity, their natural capacity as to that is totally extinct; the law knows no such thing as

The second count describes it technically the parish church of Enfield; but it is a description of the persons, and the property is laid to be in the persons; if an action was brought in the name of these people, they would be nonsuited, much more so in a criminal prosecution; the reason of a corporation suing and being sued is, that they have their property in that name, but it is impossible for a corporation to sue or be sued in their individual names; they have no individual capacity at all, it is extinct.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The prisoners must be acquitted upon this indictment.</p>

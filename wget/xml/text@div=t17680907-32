               <p>R. Abbott. The soldier did, it was but a little while before my father.</p>

               <p>R. Abbott. That was about two hours and a half after.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go?</p>
               <p>R Abbott. We went straight down the Strand; we found we could not get a place to lie, and we walked backwards and forwards all night; he did not want any money, so he did not feel for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had your father about him?</p>
               <p>R. Abbott. He had just two guineas, and I had some in my pocket; it was his pension money, he received it that same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you about you?</p>
               <p>R. Abbott. I had about 3 s.</p>

               <p>R. Abbott. He was a little in liquor; we came to London to buy some things, we lodged at Chelsea, but we live in the country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>In regard to this charge, I shall in the sequel satisfy the court and gentlemen of the jury that it is an unjust charge; this man says he had the misfortune to lose his money in this manner; I am taken up on the account of being in his company over night upon suspicion; the money that was found upon me I worked very hard for in time past; I was committed money less to prison without evidence against me; but to give an account of the scope and tendency of this unjust charge, it is as follows. On the 14th of July last I went to work at a cutler's shop, I usually earn 15 d. after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070027"></xptr> two o'clock; I met a woman that I had been acquainted with, I took her to the Coach and Horses and had a pint of beer; we were there above an hour before this man came in; he came in, she being singing he called for a pot of beer, and after that two or three more; he paid his reckoning, and I paid mine; there was an odd pint, I paid it; the girl says she paid for six pot, that cannot be true; he went out with me and went up the street, supported by this creature; I parted with him directly, and went to the barrack between eleven and twelve o'clock. The next morning I suppose he missed his money; the next morning I was taken up, upon suspicion of taking this money; my Lord and gentlemen, because there was some money found which was my own undoubted right and property, that I saved up, intending to get a furlough in order to carry me on my journey to my own country and friends; thus I am accused with taking it from the man: in regard to this half guinea that is mentioned, that some soldiers said I had secreted in the barrack, why have they not these witnesses here; but they have no regard to me because I am a Scotchman; it is impossible to think I should secret half a guinea, and keep the rest of my money in my pocket, this half guinea I lost. Now, my Lord, upon the whole was it probable, this man lost two guineas in a purse, and that purse in a handkerchief, and I to take it, and neither purse nor handkerchief to be found upon me; it might have dropped out of his pocket, or the woman might have taken it from him, as that girl was importuning him for money; why is not that other woman taken up and searched for the purse and handkerchief, she was in company as well as me; how is it possible I could rob him of his money, there is no proof against me, neither by oath or party, or evidence of witness; it is very hard because a man is possessed of money that is his right and property, that he should be taken up upon suspicion, when another man loses his money. The prosecutor says we both went out of the public-house together, his daughter says I went out a considerable time before him; he says he paid for my reckoning, she says she paid for six pots of beer; he says he missed his money in a short time after he parted from me, the girl says it was two hours and a half after; the boy says he was extremely drunk, the daughter says he was a little the worse for liquor, he was not drunk; they say I was shewing my money, a man has a right to flash his money; but why did they not bring these witnesses here, here is no proof produced; thus I humbly submit my case to your Lordship and the jury.</p>

            's company, so does the prisoner; he always bore the character of an honest man, I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he be honestly worth a guinea and a half, or two guineas?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I know at times he has saved a trifle, then he would break out and spend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever remember seeing him have a guinea?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I never did to my knowledge, he might be worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you generally know the saving men, and those that spend their money?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We do; he would save a trifle and then break out and spend it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not hear I lost half a guinea?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There was half a guinea found about his bed, but he did not make a complaint of losing it till it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner to prosecutor. Mention the pieces of gold and silver you lost?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had a guinea, a half guinea, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to R. Abbott. Can you tell what pieces there were?</p>
               <p>R. Abbott. I know there was one half crown piece.</p>

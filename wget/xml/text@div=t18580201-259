                  </hi>. I live at No. 60, Bartholomew Close. On 12th Jan., about half past 6 o'clock, I was alarmed by the cries of my wife that there was a man in the bed room—I ran and met her on the stairs; I sent for a policeman, and we went into the front bed room, third floor, which was all in confusion, but could find nobody there—we afterwards found the prisoner in the attic, hid behind the door; I gave him in charge—it is my house, and is in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great—I imagine the prisoner got in by the front door, but it was closed and latched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 13th Jan., about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I went into my bed room, and found it all in confusion, and some things on the bed—I went round the bed with a candle, and saw a man lying on the floor, stretched out, with his head on a box, and the rest of his body on the floor—it was the prisoner—I said, "What do you do there, you villain? come out," and called my husband—the prisoner was afterwards found in the attic—several things had been removed from the sitting room adjoining the bed room—the front door was latched, but not locked; I was the last that came in, and my brother-in-law closed it after me—it can be opened from the outside with a latch key.</p>

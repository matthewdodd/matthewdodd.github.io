            . I am shopman to Mr. Pike. On the 21st of January a lady informed me, that our goods were in danger at the door, and in less than three minutes after a man came in and said our handkerchiefs were gone from the door. I pursued after the prisoner, and overtook the prisoner, with the handkerchiefs under his arm; I brought him back to our house, he said, he picked the handkerchiefs up in the street, I said that was impossible, as the street was very dirty, and there was no mud on the handkerchiefs. I knew the handkerchiefs to be the property of Mr. Pike, I gave the handkerchiefs to the officer with the prisoner. The handkerchiefs were hanging inside of the door, near the door, there was great violence used in taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other persons in the shop see the prisoner taking them - A. I should suppose so, because they said they saw the man dragging the handkerchiefs; there were three of us in the shop, they are not here.</p>

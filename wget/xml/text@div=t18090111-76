               <p>Q. Have you seen it since - A. I saw it early in this month at the prisoner's house; he lives in Turk street, Bethnal Green. I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Moore been employed about your house shortly before the 3d of January - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Moore left you about eight or nine months ago - A. I believe he left me a week before last Christmas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did not Moore live in your service at the time you actually lost the net - A. No; I had the net when Moore was in my service; I believe he left me two or three months; it was last March 1808 I lost the net.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Moore called upon you again to get into your service on the 3d of January, and then he gave you the information - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you that he found some netting at the house of Garrett - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know that that honest Moore had a key of your garden gate - A. I have heard he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the misfortune for any person to escape while Moore was keeper - A. I had.</p>

            . Q. We understand you formerly was in the service of the prosecutor - A. Yes; I left his service last Christmas was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, I lodged with him last March. I then saw some netting in his possession laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about it - A. No, I only saw the netting for a minute or two; we spoke about it on the Wednesday following that I saw it; I asked him whether it came from Mr. Lhonne's. I knew that Mr. Lhonne had lost a net that covered his tulips; he told me he had been in Mr. Lhonne's garden, he had great difficulty in getting over the garden wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever communicate this to your former master - A. I returned from the country the week before last Christmas; I then went and told Mr. Lhonne the circumstance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you write - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If one wants to know where an honest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110058"></xptr>servant lives, we shall know where to find you - where do you live - A. In Phip street, Holywell mount.</p>
               <p>Q. In March you saw this net - have you not been working for Mr. Duffy in Finsbury square - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the master with whom the prisoner works - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Duffy lately discharged you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the prisoner's instance - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Duffy discharged you, did you make this charge against the prisoner - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go in the country last month - A. Into Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord you could write - then from last March down to the 3d of January you never told Mr. Lhonne - A. I could not while I was in the country; I dare say I should have told him if I had not been going in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you write so soon as you got down - A. I do not know that I had any particular reason.</p>

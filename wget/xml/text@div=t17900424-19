My house was broke open on the 3d of March; I was not at home; I went out, as near as I can recollect, it was dark when I went out; I returned about seven; there were a number of people about my house, and a few in my house; one of the shop windows was broken, the square of glass knocked fairly out of it, and a parcel of silk handkerchiefs missing that I had left in the window, amongst stockings, shoes, and other things, about half a yard from the window, on the shew board; they were so near the window that they might be taken from the out-side by stretching the hand pretty far: I never recovered the handkerchiefs; they were all new silk handkerchiefs, three dozen and two or three; they cost me between six and seven pounds: I found the prisoners, Conway and Crafts in custody, on my return.</p>

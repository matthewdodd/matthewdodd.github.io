                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Neptune-court, St. George's. On 28th June I was at the Angel and Grown dancing room, about half past 11 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before—he came and asked me to dance with him, and I did; after that we bad some gin, and he and his shipmates accompanied me home—we got to Neptune-court about 12 o'clock—we had some drink, and they remained about an hour or an hour and a half—they then all left, but the prisoner—I said to him, "Why don't you go?"—he said, "I wish to keep by you"—I said, "I don't wish you to do so"—I took the light, and went up stairs—I was sitting on the bed, undoing my boots, and in two or three minutes he came up stairs, and said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "Going to bed"—he said, "I will come too," and he put his hand round my neck, and wanted to kiss me—I would not let him—he threw me on the bed, and I felt something like a scratch at my ear—I called out, and Sarah Arthur came up, and asked what he was doing—he said nothing—he went down two steps—I was standing there, and he dragged me to him—there is a light on the top of the stairs where we were—it is a small house, and there is no door to the room—the prisoner had his fist shut, and I thought he was going to strike me—I held up my right hand, and felt something sharp go into my arm—I held up my right hand, and called out that I was stabbed, and I was dying—I laid down alongside the bed—the prisoner went away down stairs—I was taken to the hospital—I have been there eight weeks yester<lb></lb>day—I have not yet left it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Neptune-court. On that night, I saw the prisoner brought back by the constable—I heard him ask him for a place of convenience—he walked a yard or two away—I said, "That man may go away"—I followed him towards the dust bin and saw this knife open, and all over blood—I showed it to the officer—the sight of blood caused me to faint—the officer picked it up.</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital Ellen Graham was brought there on 29th June, about 2 o'clock in the morning—she was in a very weak condition from loss of blood—I found an incised wound across the middle of the front of the right fore arm—it was a deep wound dividing the two main arteries, the three nerves and most of the leaders or tendons which go to the use of the hand—she was in danger for about four weeks—the want of every power of motion in the hand remains, and in all probability will be permanent—such a knife as this would inflict such a wound, no doubt.</p>

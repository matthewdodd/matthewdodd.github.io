I am a picture frame maker, and gilder, of No. 2, Phoenix-street, Boho—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he came to me early in September, and asked me if I could recommend him a place which it was likely that he could make answer for a draper's shop—I told him I thought Chatham, or the neighbourhood—he had not been doing anything for six months before that—but during the winter before that he was in the skin trade, at Bermondsey—I went down with him and his wife in the beginning of September, and we took a house and shop, at No. 13, Military-road, Chatham; but the shop was not opened till about a month after, because he could not get credit—he had only one reference, Mr. Duckworth, and he could not speak as to money, therefore it was dropped—about three weeks afterwards he came to me again, and said that he had obtained 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his wife's relations, that he had drawn a bill on the brothers, that the wife had accepted it, and Mr. Duckworth was going to discount it for him—I said, "Be careful what you are about, because I knew a party who was hung for doing the same thing, Mr. Hunton, the</p>

               <p>Quaker"—he said that his wife did not like Chatham, and asked me to go down to Brighton, and endeavour to get a business there—I said that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was so trifling, it would not suit Brighton—we went down and did not succeed, we came back from Brighton to Chatham—that was in the beginning of Oct.—we then got the shop fitted up, opened it, and en<lb></lb>deavoured to get credit at Grant and Sons, and several houses in the City, but could not succeed, as the reference was not satisfactory—I went with him to different places without success—I said, "There is no chance of your getting credit, only by buying to what ready money you have got; how much have you got?"—he said, "About 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and he laid it all out, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one house, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at another, at Richards' Patent India-rubber Company, and at Christie's, and one or two more houses—the goods were taken to Chatham, and We opened a shop with them, we could not sell them, and took them to different market towns, Maidstone and Sheerness—we sold them in that way, but hardly sufficient to pay the expenses of the house, and several of them were pawned at Chatham—the prisoner and his wife lived by what we sold and pawned, and a very poor living it waa—I saw he had no chance of obtaining credit, only through Richards and Co.—I told him that was the only chance he had got, as he had repeatedly paid them one or two small sums—after the shop was opened we came to London several weeks to endeavour to get credit, but we only had one reference, Mr. Duckworth, and that was not satisfactory—on 20th Nov. I met the prisoner in Farringdon-street, and he told me he had been to Richards and Co. to endeavour to get them to give him a reference, and that they would not do so, unless he could satisfy them that he had, as he had been telling them, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he commenced business at Chatham six months previous; and that the only way he could satisfy them was to refer to his old father who had given him the money, and he said, "I have done so, and they are going to write down to night"—he said that he had given his father as a farmer at Ullesthorpe, and he must write down that night to the post master, and direct him to take the letter to his father, who is a butcher, as there was a farmer in Ullesthorpe, named Stevenson, and the letter would go there; and he wrote the letter in my presence, and said that he should go down to Ullesthorpe and endeavour to get his father to answer the letter, and if he did not do it he should then answer it himself—he wished me to return to Chatham that day, and I asked him for some money,—he gave me!1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "You can go back to Chatham"—I said, "I prefer waiting in London; I will wait till I hear from you"—and I waited for about a fortnight—he then came to me, and I told him I thought I had lost him, not hearing of him, and asked him how he got on—he said that the old man was ready to kick him out of doors for asking him to answer the letter from Richards and Co.—I said, "You did not do it yourself, then?"—he said, "Certainly not"—I asked him what he intended to do, and told him he was in a terrible scrape respecting a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which was coming due on the 19th, which he had drawn on his brothers, and cautioned him that it must be met—he merely made a laugh of it, and said that it would be all right, and he was then going to Mr. Duckworth to endeavour to get another bill cashed for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he told me the day after, that he could not succeed—that was on 5th Dec.—I asked him what he intended to do, he said that his wife had been persuading him to go down among her friends, and tell them what he had done respecting this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I asked him what he was going to do—he said that he was going down home, and he thought he should sell off all that was left, and take a situation as farm servant—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 125, Wood-street, Cheapside. I am manager of the South London India-rubber Company, which is also known under the name of Richards and Co.—I first saw the prisoner at the end of Sept or the beginning of Oct., when he purchased some goods for ready money, and after going on for some time we allowed him a small monthly account—we have trusted him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when this had gone on for some time we received a reference from Spence, Bagallay, and Co., and one to Neville, Jordaine, and Co., but did not entertain it—those parties applied to us and also Morley Nephews, and Anstead, and Devass and Co.—those are all large wholesale warehousemen—in consequence of being referred to, I sent for the prisoner about 17th or 18th Nov., and told him that we had been referred to by Spence, Bagallay, and Co., and that he ought not to have done so without first consulting me, and that if he wished us to give Spence and Bagallay a reference he must inform me how long he had been in business at that house, and the amount of his capital—he said that he had been in business about six months, and had a capital of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he started—I said that it would be necessary for him to satisfy us by other means that he had that capital—he first referred to Mr. Duck<lb></lb>worth, but I was not satisfied with that, and a day or two afterwards I required a further reference—he referred me to his father, who he said was a farmer at Ullesthorpe in Leicestershire—he gave me the address, and I wrote it down in his presence in the diary—I wrote to the address he gave, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on, I believe, the following day—I cannot find the envelope, but it had the Ullesthorpe post mark on it—it was addressed to our firm—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Nov. 2nd, 1855.

Devass's house, he had left word with his father to set the dogs on us—I then pressed him, if he had any respect for his position as a tradesman, to enable us to satisfy ourselves that the letter was genuine—he treated it in an off-hand way, and left the warehouse.</p>

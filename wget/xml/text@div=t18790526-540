                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—I was present when Rosario Bertucco died there—I was present before his death, when his deposition was taken in the presence of a Magistrate; he was in a dying state—the prisoner was present, and had an opportunity of asking any questions he pleased. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Rosario Bertucco was read as follows</hi>: "I am an inmate of the hospital. At half-past 7 on Satur<lb></lb>day last, 26th April, I was in the ice cream shop kept by Marmarosi; I went there to have something to eat; another man, not the prisoner, gave Marmarosi a white shirt to wash. That man asked for his shirt again, and called Marmarosi a wh——. I asked Marmarosi what was the matter; the other man who gave the shirt said to Marmarosi, 'You have got another man who talks Italian, call him out to tight.' That man went out and came in again, and said to me, 'Come out and right.' As I went outside I said, 'One to one I will fight English fashion.' There were about 20 Maltese outside. The prisoner said, 'Let that man go, and fight with me.' We fought to<lb></lb>gether with fists. After we had been fighting about three-quarters of a minute I felt a blow with a knife in my back, and I fell to the ground. I do not know who gave me the blow with the knife. A soldier said, 'That is the man.' The prisoner was running away, and the soldier pointed to him. I had known the prisoner two or three days. I had had no quarrel with him before. I was sober." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. "I had not been drink<lb></lb>ing with the prisoner; I had drank two glasses of beer with an Australian young man—I did not see the man running away—just after I felt the stab I fell down and called out 'Help me, Christians!'—I had no knife except the little penknife produced—I put my hand in my pocket to take out this knife to frighten them—I do not know whether the prisoner was always in front of me as we were fighting—we were turning round all the time—I had no quarrel half an hour before with the prisoner or any other Maltese—the police sergeant did not pull me off any one.") The deceased was admitted into the hospital on 26th April—I saw him when he was admitted—he was suffering from a wound in the left buttock—it was more than 5 inches deep, and about 1/2 an inch in breadth—it had entered the pelvis—there was considerable hæmorrhage—I should say a very long slender knife would inflict such a wound—considerable force must have been used—this knife (<hi rend="italic">found on the prisoner</hi>) could not have produced it—he died on 1st May—I made a post-mortem examination—the knife had penetrated into the bladder; that caused extravasation of urine and peritonitis, of which he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I said before the Magistrate that if the prisoner and deceased were fighting, I should think the prisoner could not have turned round and inflicted the wound in the position in which I found it, not if he was fighting in front of him, he would have to stoop down to do it, and I don't think he would be able to use sufficient force in that position.</p>

               <p>Guards quartered at the Tower—I have been in the army 18 months—on the night of 26th April, about a quarter to 9 o'clock, I was in St. George's Street—I was sober—I saw the prisoner come out of the Crooked Billet public-house with the deceased and two others—the prisoner and deceased began to fight with their fists—they fought for about a quarter of an hour—they had about four or five rounds—the deceased was on his knee, and the prisoner was in the rear of him, and he drew a knife from his side with a bit of white tape on it like sailors have round their necks—it was shut when he drew it, but he opened it and stuck it in the backside of the deceased—he said "Oh, I am stabbed," and he fell—the prisoner ran away—I went after him—he took the first turning to the left—I overtook him—I found him on his hands and knees at the side of a wall, and I gave him in charge to a policeman—he was about 200 yards from where the fight took place—he then had no knife but this; I did not notice any white cord about him—I am sure he is the man that drew the knife—I was in the Crooked Billet before the fight took place for about a quarter of an hour having a pint of beer, and saw the prisoner and deceased there; they were quarrelling about something, I could not understand their language, they were haggling in some foreign talk—I afterwards assisted the deceased to the hospital.</p>

               <p>28th December, I was at the Fox and Hounds public-house, Sydeuham—the prisoner was there when I arrived—I was in front of the bar with him—he said he had no money, and asked me to lend him a shilling, which I did—I took it from some loose silver in my pocket—I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my left-hand trousers' pocket—there was only one sovereign amongst it; all the rest were half-sovereigns—I went outside the house about 9 o'clock, and after going a little way met the prisoner—he put his foot out, tripped me up, and I fell on my back—he then put his arms round my waist and lifted me up, and I went back into the house with him—my purse was quite safe at half-past 8—I felt it when I lent him the shilling—I missed it the next morning—I left the Fox and Hounds at 11 o'clock—I had had a little to drink, but recollect all that passed—from something I heard I went on 12th January to look after him, and found him at Chatham—I did not speak to him when I met him—the policeman told him to walk down to the station, and asked me what the charge was—I said, "I charge him with stealing a purse containing nineteen half-sovereigns and one sovereign;" he said, "I do not deny having the money, but you gave it me"—I can say for certain that I never gave him more than a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Fox and Hounds, Sydenham—on Wednesday evening, 28th December, Moore came there between 7 and 8 o'clock with a cabman, whom he asked what he would take to drink—he said "Two pennyworth of gin," which he gave him, and said he had got his fare, and was to go—Moore then turned into the parlour, and shortly after<lb></lb>wards the prisoner came and went into the parlour—they came out together to the bar about 8 o'clock—they hesitated some time about what they were fco have to drink—the prisoner had previously asked me tor a pot of porter but I refused, because he wanted it on trust—he had been asking me all the week upon trust, and said he had no money—he asked Moore to lend him a shil<lb></lb>ling—Moore did so—the prisoner threw it down for half a pint of gin, which they all partook of—they stayed at the bar a very few minutes—Moore was a little in liquor, and I asked the prisoner to see him home, and not to make any disturbance—he said that he would—they went out together, came back again in about 5 minutes, and I scolded the prisoner for bringing Moore back—he then forced Moore into the parlour against his will—the prisoner came out not a minute afterwards leaving Moore there—he had three pennyworth of brandy, and threw down a half-crown, saying "I am not without friends"—I gave him change—he had 15 or 20 half-sovereigns—he then left the house, Moore remaining behind—Moore was a little in liquor, but I think he was sensible of what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lugar, in Ayrshire, and am a surgeon in practice there—on the 16th August I came up to London for a holiday, and on the 24th I went down to Croydon to see the races—when I went on the course Grant, turning to me, asked if I knew the names of the horses walking about—I told him I did not, and immediately after<lb></lb>wards I turned to go away—he came after me and said "I think you are a Scotchman; I am a Scotchman too"—he said "I am here just now for holidays"—he asked me first if I was, and I said "Yes"—he told me his name was Grant—that he belonged to Paisley, his father was a shawl manufacturer there, and that he had a brother in the firm—soon after Draper came up, and Grant turned to me and said "Here is a friend of mine coming who does some betting for me," and he told me he was brother to the great jockey, Cannon—he introduced him to me as "Cannon," and they spoke aside to each other for a minute or two—he turned to go away, and when he had gone eight or ten yards, Grant came after mo and said to him, "You might see what you can do for my friend here"—he turned round and held up his hand and said "All right"—I went on—I turned round to Grant and said "I didn't come here to bet; I am not going to bet at all, I know nothing about it"—a short time afterwards Draper came back, put a ticket for a bet made in the hand of Grant, and handed one to me—I said I didn't authorise him to make any bets for me and refused to take the ticket at first—Draper said "Oh, I understood I was to make a bet for you"—I objected again, and Grant said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">it is</hi> all right"—Draper said, when I objected to pay the money, "Oh, but I have paid the money for you"—I think it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that having been represented to me, although I had not authorised him to do so, I gave him the money—Draper then went away—I thought I was in duty bound to pay the money—I took them to be gentlemen—Draper came back—I think it was after a race was run—he said there had been a bet on, and that I had won 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I thought he was going to hand me the money, but he said "I have made another <hi rend="italic">bet for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I objected again, and Grant said "It is all right"—I was asked for more money—I had only a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket at the time, and I was induced to give it him—Draper said I was owing him something for what he had paid for me, I cannot tell how much—the next time he came running back after the next race, and said "Oh, I have lost you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but before the race finished he had made another bet for me, whereby I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had risked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I am not going to have any more of this"—I told him I wished to get away—when they saw I was anxious to get away one of them said he would go and see if he could find the bookmaker, and let him come out and see if he could make arrangements for me to go away—he repre<lb></lb>sented that I had won some money—Draper went over to where the crowd was, and came back and said "The bookmaker will be here after the next race to see you"—he went away again and left Grant and myself together, and came back and said that he had backed a horse for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I think I got a ticket twice—it seemed just like a visiting card, with a man's name on it—I objected again to the man betting on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220059"></xptr>
               <p>my account—Grant said "Oh, it is all right, you have won more money than you can possibly lose"—the bookmaker was a man rather under the medium height, well built—he came out shortly after the race was run in which they said they had lost 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I had one of the racing cards in my hand, and Grant told me to give him my card, and asked for the loan of my pencil, and reckoned up on my card the amount they said they had lost for me, and the amount they said I had won—they said they had lost altogether 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., exclusive of the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had given them, and they had won for me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "That being so, you should hand to me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they were all speaking together—they said that the money I had lost would have to be paid before the money won would be given—I said it was a very strange proceeding; I was going away, and must make some arrangement, and the bookmaker made arrangements with the two others to meet at the Cannon Street Hotel at, I think, about 7 or 7.30 o'clock—they said they would go with me, which they did, and we went out of the racecourse on to Norwood Junction to Victoria, from Victoria to Kennington Park, and then they stopped at a public-house there till I went to my lodgings—I got my pocket-book, and found I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it in notes and gold—I went back to the public-house, and found them standing outside—the cab was kept—we drove from there to a place where Grant said he stayed, some hotel in Aldersgate—he got out, and said he would be away for a few minutes; he would go to his hotel for Mb money—he was away about two minutes or so, and when he came back he had in his hand what looked like a bank-note—I did not see the face <hi rend="italic">of it; it</hi> was folded up, and what appeared to be some sovereigns on the top—he said he was sorry, he found he had not so much money as he thought; that he would not be able to pay all the money he had lost, but he gave it to Cannon, saying to him "I will <hi rend="italic">give you my</hi> money, and you can arrange with, the bookmaker; "and turning to me he said "You had better give him your money also," and I handed the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—we were driving to Cannon Street—I might mention that on getting into the cab before that Cannon began speaking to me about his kinship—he told me he knew very little about London; that he was only in London occasionally—we then drove near to Cannon Street Hotel—we had to go down some street to get to it—I went with the prisoner and Draper into the station, on the platform, where we found the young man represented to be the bookmaker—Cannon and he went apart and spoke to one another, and Grant remained with me—after they had spoken aside for a time, they came and said to me ""We will go round to the private bar and we will arrange the matter there"—the bookmaker and Draper went first—Grant kept beside me, and we followed a few yards behind—when we got in, Draper and the bookmaker went to the far side of the private bar and had some conversation there; and Grant remained the other side speaking to me—after they had spoken for a minute or so, they came across, and the bookmaker addressing me said he was sorry that all the money was not forthcoming, but that Mr. Cannon (Draper) had promised <hi rend="italic">to get</hi> the rest of the money by the morning, and if we all met at 9 o'clock the next morning at the same place they would pay the money that was alleged to have been won—the bookmaker imme<lb></lb>diately went out, and I, turning to the other two, said "Well, I have not got any money"—Grant asked Draper if he could not give me some—he said he had got some silver, and he took some silver out of his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220062"></xptr>
               <p>pocket and held it out in his hand—I said I had nothing to take me home, so I took a florin—that was outside the station—about two minutes afterwards we left the place, and I went one way and they went another—before separating, however, Draper said to me "We had better be here at a quarter to nine in the morning"—I got there at half-past eight the next morning, and stayed till half-past nine—I never saw any of them—I then called at all the hotels in Aldersgate, and gave information to the police—on the afternoon of the 27th August I was walking down the Strand, near Charing Cross Railway station, when I met Grant and Draper with a stranger—when Draper saw me he turned round as if to move away, and I went up and said to him "What have you done with my money?"—"Oh," he said, "you have not kept your appointment"—"Oh yes," I said, I had, but they had not—"Oh," they said, "all right, no fear of that"—I said it was not all right, and that I believed they were a couple of swindlers—then they got indignant, and said they had no time to wait, and Draper began to run, and Grant was going to likewise—I collared him, and called for a policeman who was on the opposite side of the way, and gave him into custody—Draper had walked off quickly—I pointed him out to the policeman, and said "I give that man in charge too"—he told me to go after him, as he saw a policeman a little farther on—I went after him, and saw him go into the post-office—I went in, he turned to go out; I followed him out, and at the door I gave him in charge—they were both taken to the station—I have not seen any of my money since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think I had not been on the race-course more than a quarter of an hour when I met Grant—I could not say whether he was alone or not at first—there were a number of people standing about looking on—he was not in company with any one; he was alone—I told him I did not know anything about betting—I was fond of seeing races—I think I have been to the races twice during the last twelve years—I did not hear Cannon come up and advise Grant to back a horse called "Wild Suffolk Lad"—I was cross-examined at the Mansion House—I swear I never heard the name of "Suffolk Lad"—Grant gave Cannon some money in my presence, shortly after Cannon came up to him—he went away with that before anything was said about my betting—Grant called out to Cannon and said "You had better do something for my friend here"—I did not give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that race to back some horse—I swear I did not bet on any races at all—I gave money twice—there were only three races run all the time I was there—we went before the last race—I cannot tell you whether Cat's-eye ran in that race—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first race—Cannon was introduced to me as "Mr. Cannon" when he came up first of all to speak to Grant—the first introdution about the betting was Grant saying to Cannon "You had better put something on for my friend"—I did not give him money to back any horses whatever—I gave him money because he came to me representing that the money had been paid away by him on my account, through a misunderstanding between him and Grant—I thought, although I had not commissioned him to do anything, it would be very dishonourable for me to let the man lose the money on my account—I said "I have not <hi rend="italic">come</hi> down to the course for the purpose of betting"—Cannon handed a ticket to me—he took it back—he did not go and make another bet on the same race, or on a <hi rend="italic">place</hi> bet he did not give me a second ticket on the first race and say he had laid 3</p>

               <p>to 2 for the first and second place both for Grant and me—he gave me a second ticket about a second race, I cannot say whether to win or for a place—the bets were not written down by the bookmaker with my pencil at the Cannon Street Hotel, and I do not recollect that they were written down by him at all—I recollect a horse of the name of Lost Sheep—I do not recollect a horse named Meredith—I did not ask Grant whether he was sure Cannon would come back with the money for the first race—Cannon did not come back after the first race and say "I drew your money and laid it out on another horse called Meredith with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—he said he had made another bet, but I couldn't say on what horse—I am not aware that he said he had taken 50 to 10 to win, and 10 to 3 for a place with regard to that horse—he told me had backed another horse for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all I remember—I think he mentioned about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I should have to give him—I cannot say the exact amount—I did not say I had only two sovereigns left—I swear that I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note left after I gave him the first 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at home and my lodgings—I did not tell Cannon that if he trusted me with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had money at home and it—would be all right—I was told the horse lost the race on which the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put on for me—I didn't know anything about it—I was told I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Lost Sheep—I had no ticket given me for it—Grant did not put it down on the race card at that time—it was put down, but I could not understand how much I had lost and won—I was told that the race was lost by Lost Sheep—I said I was a "lost sheep" when I was leaving the course—I was told I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—I did not say that I objected to winning 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had shrewd suspicions at the time that I had been swindled—I had repudiated the bets all along—I did not repudiate tie bet when I was told I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we all left—Grant left the cab and went away for the purpose of getting some money—the bookmaker was not with us in the cab—Grant came back and said he had not sufficient money, but I cannot remember the amount he said—he did not say he was willing to hand over his 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cannon—I swear that" he handed over some money, but I cannot say how much—he had what appeared to be paper money—I believe he said something to Cannon about it being all he had got, and that he would make it up the nest morning—I recollect the next morning was the 25th August—I recollect the bookmaker said at the Cannon Street Hotel that he should be there in the morning, but at all events he should be on the race<lb></lb>course—a part of the next morning was wet—it was raining in the morning when I went to Cannon Street Hotel; not pouring in torrents—it was not a day I should enjoy being on Croydon race-course—I went to Croydon to see if Grant or Cannon were there—I said that at the police-court—Cannon said when I met him that I had not kept my appointment—he did not say I ought—to have waited till ten—I left Charing Cross for the race-course on the 25th by about one o'clock.</p>

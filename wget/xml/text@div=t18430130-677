               <p>At a quarter past eleven o'clock, on the 30th of January, I was looking out of window—I saw the prisoner getting on a pair of short steps, and loosening the lead from No. 15—he then got a lamplighter's ladder, and took the lead—I am sure he is the man—he never left the place, and was never out of my sight</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, living in Farringdon-street—the house is mine—I did not employ the prisoner to take lead from it—I have examined this lead, and it corresponds with what I had there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am a journeyman plumber. I was going through Long-lane, and was stopped by a person respectably dressed; he said, "Are you a plumber?" I said, "I am;" he said, "Come with me, I will give you a job;" he took me to this house, and said, "I want this lead removed from the frontispiece; I want some lighter put on; go and get a pair of steps." I said, "Where?" he said, "Go down the street and get them." I went, and borrowed a pair at a painter's; they were not long enough to reach, and the man went and borrowed a ladder at a public-house. I took the lead down, brought it away on my shoulder, and put it on the outside of the public-house; he told me it was Mr. Walker's premises. I said I had no tools, and he said, "It is very loose, you won't want tools." I had only a plumber's shave.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 357.) About three o'clock, on Wednesday afternoon, the 18th of March, I saw a crowd of people on Black<lb></lb>friars-bridge—I saw the two prisoners there—Thomas had a carpenter's basket, containing a number of bottles of wine—he was drunk—Wood had this umbrella with him—I went up to Thomas; and when I did that, Wood came to me and said, "That is my mate"—he was not sober—he drew from inside the umbrella, two bottles of wine, and put them in Thomas's basket—some of the bottles were broken—Wood said, "We shall have to pay for this to-morrow"—Sergeant Knight came up—I allowed them to proceed for a short distance—I then called Knight's attention, thinking all was not right, and we took them into custody—Knight took possession of the wine—I took them to the station-house—Thomas said he had brought the wine from No. 29, Moorgate-street, from Mr. Watson—Wood was in hearing at the time—he said he was taking it a little way over Blackfriars-bridge—the prisoners were asked their address—Wood gave no address—Thomas gave his as No. 25, Garlic-hill, which is the station-house—I went to Messrs. Watson's, of Water-lane, as their names appeared on the seal of the corks of the bottles—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I learned there, I caused inquiry to be made at Mr. Sloane's.</p>

On the 18th of this month, between two and three o'clock, I looked out of the window in Pump-court—I heard something break, which I thought was a jug or pitcher, and I saw Thomas, with a carpenter's basket over his shoulder, and an apron on, with something in it, kicking a bottle on one side—he was about a yard from the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a special pleader, living at No. 6, Pump-court, Temple. I had seen my cellar at eight o'clock in the evening of the 17th—I had had some wine in on the morning of the 17th—I occupy chambers on the second floor, but I hold them under the same lease as the cellar—there is an intermediate occupation—there is no internal communication between the rooms in which I live, and the cellar from which the wine was taken—there is a common door to the cellarage of the chambers on the ground-floor, which is sometimes open and sometimes closed—the common door leads to the differ<lb></lb>ent private cellars of the gentlemen living in the chambers—one of those pri<lb></lb>vate cellars belongs to me—on the evening before, that was secured by a hasp, staple, and padlock—about six or seven o'clock in the evening of the 18th the officers came—I immediately went down to see what was the matter—this is the hasp—the padlock had not been broken—it was locked precisely the same as I had left it, put on again—by raising the aperture in that hasp, I found that the padlock would go through it—I have no doubt they had ap<lb></lb>plied a crow-bar or something to the narrow end—I missed from the cellar, as far as I knew at that time, three dozen and seven bottles of wine.</p>

                  </hi> In August last I was the assignee of a sugar-house in Wellclose-square—this is the assignment under which I took possession—the lease expires at Lady-day, 1854—I was desirous of disposing of the residue of the term last Aug.; in consequence of which I communicated with a person named Adams, and subsequently saw the prisoner Rowe—the first time I saw him was on Monday, the 9th of Aug.—he expressed a desire to see the premises, I showed them to him—he made a proposal to me for the purchase of the residue of the term—he agreed to give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, for the purpose of making an alteration, parting part of the warehouse, and enclosing a counting-house—he said he should use the building for housing materials—he did not say of what sort—I understand from him that he was a builder, and was building houses in various parts extensively—he mentioned several places—in consequence of that, this agreement was drawn up—this is Rowe's writing to it—I had seen Wilson with Rowe on the 11th of Aug.—Rowe introduced him as his friend—this agreement was signed in Wilson's presence—Rowe showed it to Wilson, and consulted him, and Wilson read it—upon that, an order was given by Rowe on Mr. Wilson for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the morning of the 12th of Aug. that order was paid by Mr. Wilson, at his residence, is Stoke-Newington—I saw Rowe again on the 17th of Aug., when there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more paid—I saw Wilson when that was paid—there had been a previous ar<lb></lb>rangement made with reference to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the sum agreed to be paid by the parties, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I said they could not have possession till the purchase-money was paid, and that was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement stated the ar<lb></lb>rangement was to be completed in fourteen days—(<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here read</hi>)—"Memorandum. Mr. William Gardiner, of No. 4, Paradise-row, Stoke Newington, doth hereby agree to sell, and Mr. William Rowe, of No. 10, Cambridge-road, Mile-end, builder, to purchase, for the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the lease (of which there is about seven years unexpired) of all that brick-bulk sugar-house, with the ground and appurtenances there to belonging, situste and being on the south side of Wellclose-square, Ratcliff-highway, in the said county of Middlesex, and adjoining on the south side there of to another sugar-house, not belonging to the said William Gardiner; and also all the fixtures, articles, materials, and things now being in, upon, or about the said sugar-house, hereby agreed to be sold, and whether forming part there of or not. The ground-rent payable by the said lease, to be paid and cleared up by the said William Gardiner to the time of completing the purchase, and so objection is to be made by the said William Rowe to the title, on account of any breach of the lessee's of assignee's covenants in the said lease, not the lessor's title required, nor any abstract of the title of the said William Gar<lb></lb>diner</p>

Five ponds now paid as a deposit, and the residue of the purchase-money, to be paid on the 23rd August now instant. when Mr. Gardiner is to execute to the said William Rowe an assignment of the said lease, to be prepared by Mr. William James Adams, at Mr. Rowe's expense; Mr. Rowe, in addition, to pay any district surveyor, or any paro<lb></lb>chial authorities, fees heretofore payable, or any expense incurred in shoring up the said sugar-house, and indemnify Mr. Gardiner therefrom.

(Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GARDINER</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM ROWE.</hi> Witness, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JAMES ADAMS.</hi>"—On Friday, the 20th of Aug., in consequence of some information, I sent two men to the sugar-house, in Wellclose-square, and on Saturday, the 21st of Aug., I went there myself—I saw Wilson on the premises, and a great many persons—I spoke to them all generally—I found the sugar-house in a very confused state—I observed the joists, the rafters, and the purloins were all about, and the roof was open—I do not think the roof was off that day—the bricks were being carted away—the joists and boarding were not removed till a day or two after<lb></lb>wards—by the 25th they were gone—I told Wilson and the men, when I saw them on the premises, that what they were doing would bring them to the Old Bailey. that they were committing a robbery—Wilson appeared to be a foreman or master over the men; they were all at work, he appeared to be the principal—on the Wednesday following he told the witness Keeling, in my hearing, that he wanted something for the money he had advanced—he took up some of the bricks, and carried them away—he said, "Don't take the men, take me"—I gave no right of entry to Wilson or to Rowe—they made no application to me to be allowed to get possession of the premises, nor any person on their behalf—I did not give authority to Wilson or Rowe, or any other person, to pull down the premises.</p>

               <p>pipe does not belong to him, he brought it away among some clay-racks—nothing else was brought away that I know of—I did not take the iron railings out, nor cause them to be taken out—I never tried to get a man into the house to sell them to him for wrought iron, nor did he tell me it would not do, it was all cast—I did not take any man in—I did not take the iron to a man instead if taking a man to the iron—no such thing—I never said I should have cleared the place of all the iron if it had been wrought iron, but it would not do as it was cast—I never sold the premises to pull down, certainly not—I do not know whether I told Rowe that the fixtures were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the object of your meeting at the Devonshire Arms to enable these people to ascertain whether that portion that could be pulled down was sufficient to pay them their 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whether they could get for their the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. what you had for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you state that you bought the whole of the interior at a sale by auction, that the fixtures were yours, and that you purchased them to prevent the place being pulled to pieces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said nothing about pulling down—I said I bought the fixtures—I did not say that I purchased the whole of the is<lb></lb>interior at a sale by auction, certainly not—here is the catalogue under which I bought (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—I did not say that I had not made up my mind whe<lb></lb>ther I would pull it down or not, but I had since concluded to have it pulled down and sell the materials—Robinson remarked that the sugar-house was of no use except for the purpose of pulling down, and I told him that could not be—I did not say there was nothing to hinder my doing so, and that Adams, my legal adviser, had stated that he had been a whole day perusing the deeds which were a yard high—I said I had not got the deeds then—Adams never saw the deeds—I did not add that there was nothing to prevent them pulling them down, as I had never been asked for ground-rent since I had been is the place—I had not been asked for ground-rent; I had not paid any—I took an assignment of a leasehold interest on which ground-rent was payable, and had not paid any—I do not know that I said that I had not been asked for ground-rent, and that it was not likely I should, as the only claimant to it was an old woman, and she had lived on the Continent many years—I said it be<lb></lb>longed to an elderly lady, and I believed she was abroad—I believe Robinson said when he went into the building, "Where are the fixtures that you said were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I did not say in answer to that, "Look at the iron columns, and about a thousand feet of York pavement"—I said the iron doors—I do not recollect saying anything about the York paving—I will not swear I did not—I did not say, "Look at the lead on the roof"—I did not point to the back building and say. "Why that will fetch 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not add. "What I should do would be to pull down that part of the building first"—I never heard one of the person say, "Why the wall cannot be all</p>

               <p>taken down, because of the adjoining dwelling-houses, which are only two stories high—I know nothing of it—I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "Never mind, get the top and roof off first, and if you are obstructed, state you are going to take off four stories, and then repair and make it into an eight-roomed dwelling-house with a side door, as the building is now in a dangerous state and must be taken down?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is all fiction, I never said so—on coming down the parties might go to wash their hands at a man's who keeps a ginger-beer shop—I went—I do not know whether they all went—I did not, while I was there, say, "There was a sugar-house on that spot, and the parish authorities have pulled it down, and I suppose they will do so with this if I don't, and sell the materials to pay the expenses"—I think Robinson did ask who had been at the expense of shoring up the building, and I said I did not know—I do not recollect the ginger-beer man saying he believed the parish authorities had done it—I do not recollect that I said "Yes"—I cannot positively swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Robinson say, "That would be about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I must not forget to make that an item in my calculation of what the place is worth?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that he did or did not—I did not hear Matthews say he would call on Mr. Fuller, the agent of the sugar-house, to know whether he or the parish shored it up—I will not swear about it—I do not recollect saying, "Don't do that; if there is any demur about the expense of shoring up, in case you should be called upon to pay, I will repay you"—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber anything about it—I did not say to Matthews, "In case you or Robin<lb></lb>son have the place you may commence pulling down the back building to-morrow"—certainly not—I do not recollect saying, in answer to the sug<lb></lb>gestion of Matthews. that he thought he should build an eight-roomed house with a side entrance, "I think yours is a very good idea, you,' will be the man that shall have it, but don't say anything about it while Robinson is here, as he wants it"—I did not see Rowe on the 10th—on the 11th I signed the agreement at the Devonshire Arms, with the conveyancer—I did not think of having a stamp put on it—it was afterwards stolen away—I was paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I said, when I received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "You don't want possession yet?"—I do not recollect saying, "You don't want possession yet for a day or two?"—Rowe said "No"—I swear I did not see Rowe every day at the Devonshire Arms, from the 10th till the 17th—I will not swear that I only saw him that once, I cannot say—I do not recollect his meeting me and inquiring after the assignment—I did not say, "It is not done, but it shall be done; it is all right; you know what to do"—on the 17th I did not ask for a little more money—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on the 17th, from the lead he sold on the premises—I understood so—I believe they had just removed the lead—they robbed the premises to pay me the money—he did not ask for the assignment again—I did not say it was not ready, but "You know what to do, you can go on without it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "You will want a good many horses and carts to cart away the materials; I have got a tenant of the name of Saunders, residing at Hackney; I shall be glad if you will give him a job?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rowe had never seen the sugar-house at that time—I said I had a carter close by where he was building houses at Stoke Newington, that had some horses lying idle and I could recommend him, but that was quite a different business—Rowe told me he was building house for Wilson at Stoke Newington—I do not recollect Rowe saying, "I have been digging for that pipe you told me of, but I can't find it"—I did not say, "You will be sure to find it there"—Rowe never said anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you said they were all to go to the Old Bailey, did Mr. Wilson</p>

               <p>say, "Don't frighten the men, take me, I will take a hod of bricks and carry them;" and did he take a hod of bricks, and carry them in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the street; he took them to the cart, but I did not hear him say anything about that.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Fuller, of Billiter-street—he is agent to Messrs.

I accompanied Mr. Gardiner there—I saw Wilson and several men in the act of taking away the bricks, pulling down the premises, and taking away the materials from the building, and there were some carts outside—the principle part of the rafters, purloins, and principals were gone—I saw some of them taken away in one of the carts—Wilson was there directing the men to go on with the business—the whole of the roof was off on the 25th, and they were loading the girders and bricks—there were some window-sashes on the carts—I went with Mr. William White<lb></lb>more on the 25th, and told the men if they did not leave off taking down the building they would be indicted for felony, and they stopped till the afternoon—they then went on again and were given into custody—when I went with Mr. Gardiner, Wilson said he should take it down till he had got his money again that he had paid—I went again between half-past three and four o'clock, and Wilson went in again to the men, and said, "Go on"—that was after he was given into custody—I was with Mr. Whitty, in 1844, when Mr. Gardiner came into possession of the premises—I did not draw up the list of fixtures, but there was one drawn up—this is it—a portion of the fixtures were sold to Mr. Gardiner; not all of them—the list contained none of the free hold fixtures—the joists and purloins, and things of that sort, belong to the freehold—they are not in the list of things sold to Mr. Gardiner—he bought some fixtures, and he of course would have a right to remove them, and sell them—amongst others there were clay-racks, and iron doors, and so on, but none of the joists and purloins, and girders are in the list—the amount of the materials which have been taken from the premises, not belonging to Mr. Gardiner, but to the freehold, are worth, as old materials, at least 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would take at least 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to restore the damage done to the premises—the value of the remainder of the house, as it now stands, is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have known the premises a long time, and have inspected them frequently—they were not in a dangerous state—they did not require instant pulling down to save the lives of Her Majesty' subjects—on the 21st of Sept.

I remember the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid to Mr. Gardiner by Mr. Rowe—I think it was on the 17th of Aug., about half-past six in the afternoon—I was to have found part of the money, and the money was ready to be paid for the building I told Mr. Gardiner so on the 21st—I heard Mr. Gardiner tell Mr. Rowe, at the time the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, that he should pull the back part down first, that he had got a very good bargain, and he would he went a number or horses and carts to take down the premises, and he had got a tenant at Hackney, and he should be very glad if he would give him a job, that he had three horses in the Hackney-marsh, and he was an honourable man; he could recommended him—Rowe said that the neighbours had com<lb></lb>plained that the houses shook, and he thought it was not safe—Mr. Gar<lb></lb>diner said he had better case the chimney and pull down the shaft, he thought that would lighten the corner where it was shored up, but he would advise him to pull down the back building first as that was a separate build<lb></lb>ing—Rowe said he had been digging for a pipe, but could not find it—(I understood it was a pipe to supply the cistern)—Mr. Gardiner said he had been digging, and if he could have found it he would not have had the trouble; that it was in his inventory, but where it was he could not tell—he said he had removed a vast quantity of materials, a great number of carts, full, and he should have taken the iron-work; but he had taken some of it to a blacksmith, who had tried it over the anvil and found it break, or he would not have had to move it—I remember his saying, that by taking down four stories, and the whole of the back, he could convert it into a dwell<lb></lb>ing-house, and it would pay him well—he said he had been there three years, and he had never been troubled for any ground-rent, and he did not sup<lb></lb>pose</p>

               <p>post that Rowe would be—I was at the building on the 25th of Aug.—Wilson was there—Mr. Gardiner came with one or two other persons; he wanted to arrest my carman—there was a man had got same bricks on his shoulder, he was going to empty them into the cart—the policeman, and one or two of them objected to it—Wilson said, "Put them down, and if anybody is to be locked up, I will be;" and he took them up and put them into the cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What share were you to have in this contract, this sale or purchase? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have been paid for my cartage, and I would have lent Rowe any money he wanted—I have had dealings with him, and always found him an honourable man—I had lent him money before—I had none of the materials from the sugar-house—I did not want them—I purchased about 2,000 bricks of Mr. Wilson, which I believe came from those premises—I believe my cart fetched them away.</p>

                  </hi> I remember seeing Adams about the premises Well<lb></lb>close-square at the latter end of April, or the beginning of May—he said he was agent for a gentleman who had a large sugar-house to sell in Wellclose-square, that I could have it a bargain, and that he had authority to sell it for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pull down.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">ABLETT.</hi> I live in Devonshire-street, Mile-end.

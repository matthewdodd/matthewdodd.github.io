I am assistant to Mr. House, a pawnbroker residing in Bishopsgate-street—a Paisley shawl was pawned on 21st February, by the prisoner, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I lent a sovereign on it—two others were with her at the time—she asked the loan of a sovereign upon it, and said to a person named Thompson, who was with her, that she gave 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Thompson said she did—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, Clerkenwell, and am a widow. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 3rd of July, I was in White Lion-street, leading a little child with my right hand—I felt something touch me from behind over my right shoulder, and my bag was snatched from my hand—there was a cord to it, and it was separated in some way—I turned and saw a man run from me with his back towards me—he was a young man with crape on his hat, but I cannot swear to him—I saw no one else running—this is my bag—the things stated were in it.</p>

At a little before eleven o'clock at night, I was in White Lion-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw a man running—I followed, he fell down—I saw him taken, and he was the same person who had been running away—he was brought back four or five yards, and I saw him drop this bag from his left breast—I took it up and carried it to the station—it contained the articles stated.</p>

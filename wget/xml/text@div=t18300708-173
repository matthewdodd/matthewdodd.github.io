On the 12th of June I saw Hunt nod to Eames, who was in the middle of the yard, and had not finished loading his cart with dung - upon Eames nodding, Hunt went up into the loft - he had nothing in his hand then; he remained there not more than three or four minutes, and came down with a bag in his hand containing two bushels of corn - he swung it up on the copse of the cart; Eames then stood in the middle of the yard and in view; I informed Mr. Mountain, who came down, and told Eames to get up into the cart and see what was there, which he did, and said there was nothing at all there; Mr. Mountain told him two or three times to lift up the tarpauling - he pushed it off the cart after being desired to do so two or three times, and when it came to the ground the bag fell out - it contained two bushels of oats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it Hunt's cart? A. It belonged to his master; Eames is called the carman, and I believe has been there ten or eleven years -I was about ten yards from the cart when the corn was brought down; I stood at the stable door - Hunt might not see me or he might; the tarpauling was on the copse of the cart - after being desired two or three times he pushed it off; I did not see any hay in the cart, there might be; Hunt was taken up in about an hour and a half, and Eames on the 17th, I think - he remained in the employ till he was taken; I never heard of his being offered 10l. to tell all about it; I am sure the bag was in the tarpauling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When Hunt went up into the granary was he in Eames' sight all the time? A. I cannot say; but Eames was in a situation that he could see him; I saw him give him a nod, and then he went up; there was no hay in the granary.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Saracen's Head, and am Mrs. Mountain's cousin. On the 12th of June, about twelve o'clock, from what Brown said to me, I sent for an officer, then went into the yard, and ordered one of the ostlers to get into the cart and unload the dung; he was doing so, and I ordered Eames to take the tarpauling off the front of the cart - he lifted it up several times, and said, "Nothing here?" I said, "If there is nothing, throw it down;" he threw it down, and the sack came down with it - it contained two bushels - the sack was not ours; I asked Hunt who the corn belonged to; Eames was present, and looking at the sack - Hunt twice answered, "I don't know;" and the third time I asked him he said,"The corn don't belong to you, or any one here;" I found no other sack in the carts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Has not Eames been thirteen years in your employ? A. Not as <rs id="t18300708-173-deflabel971" type="occupation">granary-man</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300708-173-defend1186 t18300708-173-deflabel971"></join>; he has been there on and off as horse-keeper, but I do not notice how long they stay - they are discharged every day; he was taken into custody at the second hearing at Guildhall on the following Thursday, when he went there by order of our solicitor; I never offered him 10l. to tell what he knew - my cousin Peter is employed there - he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Had the bag any business there? A. No; Hunt had no business in the granary; there may be fifty persons employed in the yard; we do not keep strange bags in our granary.</p>
               <p>JAMES MERRETT. I am horsekeeper to Mrs. Mountain. I saw the tarpauling on the ground, and heard Hunt say to Eames that he ought to have taken more care.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said that before you all? A. No, I was in the water-closet, and he did not see me; this was a few minutes after the bag was found - they had not seen me go into the water-closet.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PIKE. I am a constable. I was in the yard; Mr. Mountain ordered Hunt to throw off the dung - he then told him to throw off the tarpauling, which was on the copse; it just covered the sack on the copse - after being told two or three times he threw it down, and the oats came down with it; I took Hunt that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw them all, I believe? A. Yes; Hunt threw some dung down, and said he could find no oats there; the oats were in two bags - neither of them belonged to Mrs. Mountain; Hunt said the outer bag was his master's - it had the name of Board or something on it- I asked him if his master sent the oats to town to feed the horses; he said No - I asked what he fed them with: he said beans and chaff - I asked how he came by the oats- he said he found them; I asked where - he said that was not my business, he should not tell me. Eames attended at the office, and was ordered into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was the bag dirty? A. No, quite clean; the road was very dirty - it was a very rainy day: the man who went home with the cart took the outside bag home; I produce the inner one, with the corn, and a sample taken from the bulk in the granary.</p>

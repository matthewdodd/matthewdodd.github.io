A person named Edward Williams came to me about the 13th or 14th of May, and made a communication to me about a supply of goods to his son-in-law, at No. 185, Ratcliffe-highway—I went there on Whit Monday, found the house shut, and, nobody there—I then lost sight of the matter for some weeks, then Edward Williams called again—I had some conversation with him, and in two or three days he introduced the prisoner to me as his son-in-law—Williams is an elderly man—they presented me with a list of the various articles I was to supply—I began to show them various articles, which the prisoner looked over with his father-in-law—thay selected goods amounting to between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he introduced him, he said, "This is my son-in-law, whom the shop, No. 185, Ratcliffe-highway, is for"—the papers produced are the invoices sent there with the goods—they were sold for cash—I went down on the Saturday morning, and saw the father-in-law there—he said he supposed cash would be acceptable at all times, and paid me four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—this was before the goods were all delivered—the prisoner was present at the time—the shop-door was open, but not the window—they had not begun busi<lb></lb>ness—I then completed the order—when the goods were delivered I was to have had the cash—I went for it, and saw the prisoner—he said his father-</p>

               <p>Are there any more houses in Spring Gardens from which a person could come in the direction you saw Johnson? - There are other houses, there might be such a thing.</p>
               <p>Then that which you swore just now, was not quite right, that there was no other houses from which he might be coming? - There were houses on that side of the way.</p>
               <p>Now a little about the cart and horse, you keep a jocky cart? - I sell greens, and do necessary jobs.</p>
               <p>That is just the thing I was enquiring after; you are what they call a running dustman? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a widow, I live in Spring-gardens; on the 21st of December last, I went into my own yard, I live but a very little way from the prosecutor's, they are private gardens, about two or three rood distance, there is no thoroughfare, Mr. Norris's vault and our's join together, that is the father of the prisoner; when I came to our vault, I heard somebody in their vault, and I heard somebody come out of their vault, and at the side of the vault I saw the said

               <p>Mr. Garrow. If you did not hear, do not tell us what you apprehended? - As far as I could understand I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell your story your own way - He said, are you going with us, or is somebody going with us, that is what Norris said to Freeman, and the other said, yes; I looked through the side of the road, the vault is next the road, I saw Norris peeping, as if he was looking after somebody, and I went away into my own place again, and just gave my master a bason of tea on the shop-board as he was at work, and I saw Norris go by with a bag upon his back, full of something, but what it was I cannot pretend to say; I immediately went into the street to a chandler's shop, and heard the house was robbed; I told Mrs. Hennick what I saw, I was at the Justice's, and was sworn there.</p>
               <p>Did you hear young Norris say any thing? - Yes, I did: when I came there he was in custody, and he owned to the robbery.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He owned that this Freeman and Johnson broke the house open.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing at all. - Norris said they broke this house open with a chissel, that they took the property of Mr. and Mrs. Hennick's, and sold it to a person, somewhere by the Black Horse, one door goes in by Saltpetre-bank, for two guineas and some silver; he said so far as this, that they would give him some money to carry the things for them.</p>

               <p>Court. What did he confess? - Coming up Brick-lane, he said he wanted to speak to me, I said it was time enough at the Office, Norris then began to damn, and swear, and sing: I had one on one side, and one on the other, by the collar, I brought them to the Angel and Crown and searched them, I found nothing on them, not a penny in money, that was about eleven; says Norris, I will tell you, says he, I am sorry I did it, it was I, Freeman, and Johnson, that committed the robbery, and he said, I wish you would take Johnson, I went several times after him, but did not take him; afterwards I asked Johnson what he had done with the things, Norris called me aside, and said, why do not you search him again, he has sold the things for two guineas and some silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Master Levy, otherwise Joe the Barber, how long have you been engaged in this honourable business of thief-taking? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Now guess a little, ever since you was convicted and pardoned, ha! Speak man; how long have you been a thief-taker? - Longer than you have been a Counsellor.</p>
               <p>I know that, because during the eight years I attended as student, I remember you? - Very likely; I do not attend any office now.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of place? - I do not choose to answer that.</p>

               <p>Do you swear that? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did you never assert at the Sessions at Clerkenwell, that you was a Christian, and not a Jew? - No, never, Sir, because I never was christened.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that this man was not extremely drunk at the time he entered into this conversation? - I will swear he had not drank any liquor, I would not let him have any thing.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I am a weaver by trade, on the 21st of last month, Mrs. Hennick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120039"></xptr> came into the Rotation Office, and said she was robbed, I was present when Norris and Freeman were apprehended; Levy took them both, they were kept separate, one was kept in a box along side me; Norris said directly the robbery he was guilty of, says he, I do want to be an evidence, I said if you want to be an evidence, you must go the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship sees this was extorted from him.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not held out to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This man says to the prisoner, if you want to be an evidence, you must swear before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use any persuasions to induce him? - No, none at all, they wanted both to be evidence before the Justice; Norris made answer immediately -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg pardon, when I consider this man knows as well the tendency of every question your Lordship puts, almost as well as your Lordship: I remember one case, in which the evidence was this, that a person having been apprised that such a one, Thomson by name, had been guilty of a felony, accosted him in the street, you must go along with me, and he added, it will be better for you to tell the whole story; this was a person not authorised to make any promise, this man having no pretence to hold out mercy to him, says in the street, I advise you to make a discovery, and the Court said, that that should not be received in evidence; now, here, see if this is not infinitely stronger, the man in custody of the officers of Justice, is told, if you wish to have any benefit by your declaration, make it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. No, no. You say Norris and Freeman both wanted to be admitted as evidence? - Yes; then Norris said he had a prior right, because he had saved Mrs. Hennick's life, because he said Johnson and Freeman intended to put a handkerchief over Mrs. Hennick's face, and cut her throat, and he would not give his consent to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Joe the Barber present at this conversation? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He had nothing at all to make him drunk, he had only a pint of beer, I would not let them drink together.</p>
               <p>Did the barber take a drop of drink with him? - No, Sir, the barber, nor any body but themselves.</p>
               <p>What trade are you? - A weaver.</p>
               <p>How long have you attended the Justice's Office? - Six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Are you a constable? - I attend as I do, for a livelyhood, to get a shilling when a job comes in.</p>
               <p>Oh, as a job of blood work comes in? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you are in hopes of being the successor of the barber? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you done a stroke of weaver's work since you have attended that Office? - No, Sir, I have none to do, if I had any thing to do in an honest way, I would do it.</p>
               <p>Court. When Norris said he had a prior right, he did not mention for what? - They began to speak so fast, one against the other; they were committed for further examination.</p>

Mr. Sligh came out; we found that there was another man in Mr. Robinson's room, my wife saw that man make off, she called out to me and I pursued him. I did lay hold of him, but he struggled and got from me. Mr. Sligh took the prisoner. I am certain he is the person I saw in Mr. Robinson's room.</p>

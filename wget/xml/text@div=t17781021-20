I told her, I did not keep silk gauze, that was milliners and haberdashers goods; there was a piece of Irish lying upon the counter at the time; the women said they were sorry to give me the trouble, and turned out of the shop. I missed this piece of Irish immediately; I followed them, and stopped them within forty or fifty yards of the shop. The prisoner had a long cloak on, the other had none; therefore I knew she must be the person that had the goods. I went before them; I put my arm round her, and said, you have got something of mine under your cloak. What is it? said she; I said, a piece of Irish. I felt it slide down with my hand, and she dropped it at her heel. I kept her there, and desired a boy that was near to call a constable. I took the cloth up in my hand, and the constable came directly and took charge of her; the cloth has my own private mark upon it. (It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I had only this one piece of cloth upon the counter when they came into our shop, for I had sold the fellow to it not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the shop? - Only the prisoner, and the woman that came with her; the prisoner had a large red cloak on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not three women come into the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was near his counter; I had been on an errand; as I was coming along I met a young woman that lived near me, when I lived in service in Lincolns-inn-fields. I told her I was going home towards Westminster; she said, she was going that way, but must buy some gauze to make up a cap; she said, if I would stop, she would go home with me; she went into the shop; she had got a cloak on, I had none; when we had got a vast way from the shop, she turned her head round, and said, the man of the shop is coming; that rather startled me; I stood still; she dropped something; this gentleman laid hold of a piece of cloth, and then took hold of me; he bid her go about her business. I never was guilty of any thing bad in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. You said the other had no cloak? - I believe she had no cloak at all; this prisoner had a large red cloak on. I was persuaded before I stopped her that the prisoner must have the cloth; I felt it sliding down under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you bid the other woman go about her business? - I did not say any thing to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether she had a cloak on or no, must be a circumstance that you must know. - She had a cloak on when she was before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He wanted a woman to swear she saw me drop it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A neighbour came in and told my wife the circumstance that she saw the prisoner drop the cloth. When that woman came before the justice she would not swear this; she wished to avoid the trouble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210013"></xptr> of coming to the Old-Bailey, and therefore evaded the justice's questions in such a manner, that they could not bind her over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 14 years old—in August this year I was in Mr. Hill's employ, a tailor, on Finsbury Pavement—one day in August I was passing the prisoner's shop, and saw some boys there selling canvas—I looked at them, and Levy spoke to me outside the shop, and said "Have you anything to sell?"—I had a parcel with me—I said "No"—he said "You work at a tailor's"—I said "Yes"—he said "Can you get any cloth?"—I said "I will see"—he said "Bring as much as you can; I will give you a good price for it"—next day I took about two yards of cloth from my master, and took it to Levy, who gave me 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—three days afterwards I took him two more yards, and sold them for the same price—it was similar cloth to this (<hi rend="italic">Selecting two pairs of trousers</hi>)—I afterwards took two more pieces, one about a yard and the other three-quarters, and he gave me 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two—these trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar to the cloth I took on the third occasion—on Wednesday, the 27th, I took Levy about two yards of cloth, which he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and on the 28th two yards more, and sold it for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me on that day that if I knew any<lb></lb>body else who had got anything to sell, he would give them a good price for it—he never asked where I got it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I stopped at the shop first because I saw some buttons in the window, and then I saw the boys in the shop—I was not a per<lb></lb>fectly innocent boy up to that time; I had taken things from my father, but not more than once—I do not know how long ago it was—I took some money from his desk; it was silver, I cannot remember how much—he would not allow me to go there again, and I went home—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me—I was taken in custody and let go—no promise was made to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 2, Finsbury Pavement—Taylor was my errand-boy—my suspicions were aroused, and on 1st or 2nd Sept. I went with detectives Reed and Smith and the boy to Levy's shop, 8, Artillery Street, Bishopsgate—he is a piece-broker and dealer in trimmings—Staith asked Levy if he knew the boy—he said "No;" the boy said "You do"—Smith said "We have come respecting some cloth which the boy says he sold here"—Levy said that he had not bought any cloth—he went upstairs, and Smith followed him, and I went up after Smith to the first floor, and saw Smith pull some things out of a cupboard, among which were these trousers and waistcoats—I positively identify the cloth of which they are made as having been in my stock, and I have some of it now here—I bad missed it three weeks or a month previously—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard.</p>

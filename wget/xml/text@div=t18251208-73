On Monday evening, the 7th of November, I was on duty; the prisoner was delivered to me by Mr. Moore, of Sams coffee-house; the beadle and I searched him, and found a poker, a shovel, a glass, and three spoons - one spoon was marked with the name of Jones.</p>

The prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came to my house on Monday, the 7th of November - I sent a person with some mixed liquors for him; he staid about half an hour, and after he was gone I went into the room, and missed the glass and spoon - the glass was brought to me in the evening; it is marked with my name, with a diamond. I have lost three dozen of these glasses within four months.</p>

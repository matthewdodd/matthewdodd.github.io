                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi> 17). I had instructions to watch the premises of Ball, who occupies a stable in Lambeth Mews—on 30th September, about 8.30, I saw a van, belonging to Ball, being loaded with drain pipes—it was backed up to his stable—Ball and a man named Savage were loading—after it was loaded it was carefully covered over with sacks and tarpaulin, and the canvas fastened down—I could not then see what was in the van—the van was then driven along Lambeth Walk to the premises of Elson, in Park Place—Elson put his head out of window, and said something I could not hear—the van was then backed up to his yard—Elson came down to the door, and joined Ball and Savage, and I went away for assistance—Elson is a small jobbing builder, and occupies a small yard with two or three sheds in it—in about half an hour I returned with another constable, and then we found Ball had gone away with the horse—I went into Elson's premises, and saw Savage standing there—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned in stealing a load of pipes that stood outside—he said he had been employed to do a day's work by Ball, and that he knew nothing about the pipes—this was in Elson's presence—he further said that on the previous evening he had accompanied Ball to Astley's Theatre, and while there he saw Elson, and Ball and Elson went away together, and had some conversation—on going home, Ball told him he had a job he wanted to do in the morning, and he (Savage) might just as well come and help him—he also said that Ball had then gone away to get a van to do a moving job—I then said to Elson, "It is very strange that these pipes should be backed up to your yard; how do you account for it?"—he said, "They are not for me; he has left them here while he goes to get another van; you know me, Mr. Greenfield, I have got no money to buy pipes"—I said, "It seems strange that they should be on your premises"—he then said, "I will give you the straight <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>; Ball has always been bothering me to buy pipes and jars, and to sell them for him; I took two jars to Munn's, in Carlisle Lane, and he said he had got a lot more; he never gave me the list of how many, or what</p>

Doulton's manufac<lb></lb>ture, which I compared with the drain pipes in the van, and they corre<lb></lb>sponded—Elson gave me a key of a job he was doing at Russell Street, Brixton—I went there and found a water-closet pan, one 4-inch bend pipe, and three 4-inch straight pipes—this is a memorandum I made at the time of what was in the van, viz:—10 9-inch junction pipes; 5 6-inch; 3 4-inch; 12 4-inch bend; 3 6-inch bend; 3 9-inch; 1 6-inch double junction and 4-inch pipe—they nearly filled the van—after I had taken Elson and Savage to the station I went in search of Ball, and about two hours afterwards I found him at his stables, about five minutes' walk from Elson's, and the same from Messrs. Doulton's—I went to the stable-door, and said, "Is your name Ball?"—he said, "Yes, that is my name"—I said, "I am going to take you into custody for being concerned in stealing a number of drain pipes, and other articles, of Messrs. Doulton's"—he said, I did not steal them, I was going down to fetch the van back"—I said, "What were the pipes taken there for?"—he said, "To get a customer for them"—I said, "How did you come by them?"—he said, "They were left here for stowage; one night a man's van broke down late, and he came to me and asked me to warehouse them, and I did so"—I asked him who he was, and he said he did not know—I said, "I shall take you to the station"—he said, "I suppose I must go"—I said, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—I repeated that question more than once, and he said "No"—at that time Serjeant Wood, who was with me, discovered some—the same evening we went to where Gunnell resides, No. 4, Sala<lb></lb>manca Place—on the 5th October I received two loads of pipes from Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Paradise Street, Lambeth Walk—I was in Elson's employ until his arrest—on the 5th September, there were some pipes stacked in his yard—I had seen them there about a week or more—I took them to Mr. Hinchcliff's, and saw the money paid, and a receipt given—on the 23rd September; I saw a van belonging to Ball in James Street, Lower Marsh—it had drain pipes in it, and it was taken to Mr. Hinchcliff's—it had not been on my master's premises—I made out both these receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Doulton—Gunnell was in their employment as yardman—it was his duty to load carts from instructions from the foreman—we have three or four yards, and anyone could get access to the pipes—Elson is a jobbing builder, and has dealt with us at various times—he did not buy the pipes produced of us—the last he bought of us was on the 27th September, and at that time he paid cash—he has bought of us on credit, and he owes us an account now—the last he had on credit was in 1861—Ball has parted for us when we hare been short of hands—he was last employed on the 9th November, 1866—he had no authority to bring his cart there at breakfast time—I identify all the pipes as being the property of Messrs. Doulton—what I have seen are worth about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does every order for the sale of pipes pass through your hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every order—Ball could have been in the yard legitimately at breakfast time—between 8 and 9 o'clock is sometimes a convenient time for people to come—I have heard that he has been there twice, but I do not know for what purpose—in my absence the foreman would serve anybody who came, and account to me on my return—Messrs. Doulton's business is very extensive—their goods are to be found all over the world.</p>

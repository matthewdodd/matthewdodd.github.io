            . I am an officer. On Tuesday morning I received an information I went to Mrs. Matthews, Wine-office-court, Fleet-street, I found the piece of woollen cloth in the parlour, it is about sixteen yards. The prisoner Fussell lived there as a servant; I pulled the paper off the cloth; Fussell was called up to me; I asked her how she came by this cloth; she said she was sitting at her mistress's gate, on the Sunday night, and two men brought it for her to take care of it, they would call again for it; I told her if she took in such an article of two men, she must know something what they were; she said she did not. I went down in the kitchen and searched it, and between the ticking of the bed and the sacking of the bedstead I found this bunch of keys, she told me she found these keys in the court. I told her it was of no use telling me that she did not know these two men, she must go along with me to the Compter; after waiting a little while I told her if she would tell me who the men were I would not lock her up before she went before the Lord Mayor, and if the two men did leave it, it would discharge her. I waited near half an hour, and at last she said, my sister gave it me. I did not ask her any more questions; I took her to the public-house in the Poultry Compter, I did not lock her up, I left her in the parlour while I went to her sister at Mr. Bowerbank's, at the back of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Shearman at Mr. Bowerbank's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from Fussell that she meaned Shearman when she talked of her sister - A. Yes I went into Mr. Bowerbank's accompting-house, I took these keys with me, and enquired after the servant; nothing transpired with these keys; Fussell said afterwards her sister gave her these keys, because Mr. Bowerbank's housekeeper was a suspicious woman. I went up stairs, Shearman was called to me, I told her I found the cloth at her sisters, she denied any knowledge of the cloth.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this cloth deposited on the Sunday - A. Close to the door of the warehouse, that warehouse was locked up, there was no cloth outside of the warehouse to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these keys that Stanton produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Stanton. I applied them with Mr. Bowerbank, there were none of them fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the cloth was in some paper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. Did you know the cloth by the paper - A. Yes, These numbers agree with our books, we missed that number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that number before Stanton gave you that information - A. No. When Stanton gave the information we looked for No. 2, and missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bowerbank. Is that such cloth that you had in your possession - A. This is the cloth that we had in our warehouse from the package, and the manner of making up; there are two letters, G and H, that the manufacturer put on the cloth, and the mark of the package, No. 9630 wove into the cloth, and likewise upon the paper outside, that we may easily refer to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty that you had not sold that cloth - A. Certainly not, and the property in that warehouse was the property of myself and partner.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether you sold any to either of them women - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What it the worth of that cloth - A. About sixteen or eighteen pound.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you look to your stock to see if any such piece was deficient - A. Immediately, and found it deficient.</p>
               <p>Fussell left her defence to her counsel.</p>
               <p>Sherman was not put on her defence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bowerbank. Can you say at what time it was taken - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long you had this piece of cloth - A. Three or four months I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Fussell visited your house to see her sister - A. No; I might have seen her, I should not know her if I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. Can you say when this piece was lost - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bowerbank. Is your house in the parish of St. Margaret's, Lothbury - A. It is.</p>

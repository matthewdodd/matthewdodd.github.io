                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Lucas, of Maize-hill, Greenwich. On Saturday afternoon, 6th May, about 3 o'clock, I was up stairs in one of the rooms in my master's house—I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner Sullivan coming up the pathway to the front door, he was carrying two mats, one before him and one behind him, hung over his shoulder—I know that the street door was open three or four minutes before, when I went up stairs—a coat was hanging in the passage; I can<lb></lb>not say that I saw it there when I went up stairs, but I saw it in the morn<lb></lb>ing about 11 o'clock—I did not go down stairs immediately upon seeing Sullivan; as there was somebody down there, I took no notice—I finished what I was doing upstairs, and came down about five minutes afterwards—I saw Mrs. Lucas, and said something to her, she sent me to the front garden for something—I looked round twice and could not see what I was sent for, but looking the third time I saw Sullivan walking down the pathway—he said, "Do you want any mats?" I said, "No"—he was walking down the walk towards the gate, to go out—as I answered him, I at the same time saw the coat under his mats, on his right arm—I took no notice of it to him, but immediately went and told Mrs. Lucas—I came out again with her, and as soon as I got outside the gate I pointed to Sullivan, and said, "That is the man that has taken the coat, but he has passed it to another man who has run away with it"—the prisoner, Savage, was with Sullivan, and an<lb></lb>other one who is not here, was about a step ahead of Sullivan with the coat under his arm—I saw the coat at that time, the men were going up Maize-hill towards Blackheath—they noticed us, and as soon as they did so, the man with the coat ran in one direction, and Sullivan in another—knowing the man that had the coat was not the one that took it, I took no notice of him, but went after Sullivan, and followed him—the man with the coat turned to the left when he got to the top of Maize-hill, I do not know the name of the place—Sullivan ran towards Vanburgh-fields, Savage was on the hill—I spoke to him, and told him to stop that man for he had stolen a coat, but he took no notice of what I said—the men started off to run when they had got five or six yards from the gate of our house—it was Sullivan who turned round and saw me, and then they ran away—I ran about three miles after Sullivan, I had company part of the way—I missed Sullivan after running about two miles and a half: I lost sight of him—I had no one</p>

               <p>with me but the boy that picked up the mats that Sullivan threw away, and the boy followed me with the mats—Sullivan threw them both away, about a quarter of a mile from the house, on Blackheath—I met a postman just by Vanburgh-fields, and said, "Stop that man, for he has stolen a coat;" he put out his arm to stop him—Sullivan said, "I have no coat, you see I have not got a coat;" I said, "Of course you have not, after passing it away"—the postman went a little way back, as I supposed to beckon to a policeman, and Sullivan took advantage of that and ran past me, turned to the left, and went up towards the heath—I was afterwards at the police court before Mr. Secker, when Sullivan was brought up in custody—I saw Savage in the court directly I went in—he was not in custody—I did not hear him say anything in the police court.</p>

I am the wife of Squire Stephen lucas, of Maize-hill—On Saturday, May 6th, about 3 o'clock, my servant, Louisa Chappel, said something to me, in consecquence of which I went from the side of the house, and followed her outside the gate—I saw three men about six yards from the gate, on the pathway—the prisoners are two of the men, I could swear to them both—Sullivan was carrying two mats, Savage was about three yards behind him, with his hands in his pocket; the third man had a coat—Chappel said, "That is the man who stole the coat, pointing to Sullivan—the prisoners could hear what she said—she then said, "There goes the man with the coat," that man was about six yards in advance of Sul<lb></lb>livan—I spoke to Savage, and said, "Stop that man, he has stolen a coat;" he made me no answer, I thought he did not hear me—I said again to him, "Pray stop that man, he has stolen a coat;" he then said to Sullivan, "<hi rend="italic">Dick,"</hi> or "<hi rend="italic">Tim</hi>, have you got a coat?" that appeared the signal for Sullivan to run away, which he did directly, and my servant followed him—the man with the coat ran in another direction, I followed him for about 100 yards—a man was passing me at the time in a cart, and I asked him to stop the man—I saw the man drop the coat, I picked it up—the man got away, I could not stop him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police man, R</hi> 324). On Saturday, 6th May, I took Sullivan; he said, at the station, that he had made a very bad day's work of it—Mr. Lucas gave me this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when Sullivan was at the police court I saw Savage there—Sullivan said that there was a party in Court who could prove that he did not steal the coat, if he liked to speak the truth; but no one appeared—he was remanded for a week, and Savage was taken—when I came into Court Mr. Secker was asking him what he did there; he said that he came to hear the case—Mr. Secker asked him how he knew Sullivan was locked up; he could not give a satisfactory answer, and Mr. Secker ordered him to be locked up—when he was brought out into the yard he said he was not nigh Greenwich that day—after he was locked up my wife made a communication to me—I did not tell that to the attorney; I have not seen him—Mrs. Lucas spoke about it last night, and in consequence of that my wife was brought as a witness.</p>

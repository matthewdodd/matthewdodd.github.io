               <p>Q. Have you any partners - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did your family consist at that time - A. My wife, a maid servant, a shopman, a boy, they all slept in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it this happened - A. On the night of the 3d of April last; I was last up that night; I fastened the doors at one o'clock in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about one in the morning - A. I secured the doors of the shop and the windows likewise. The door opens in half, and has two shutters, which was secured by two iron bars on the outside, and fastened on the inside and locked; the shutters were perfectly fast, with iron bars and pins to secure them.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your shop communicate with the dwelling house - A. The stairs of the house face the shop door; there is an inner door that goes to the stairs the stairs are not in the shop, they are not enclosed by a wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. You go into the house by the shop door - A. Yes; there is no other outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of the night did you hear any noise or any alarm - A. No; my maid saw it first; she got up about five o'clock, or a little afterwards; I received the information from her, upon that I got up immediately and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then - A. It was day light. I saw that the door of the shop had been broken open by cutting a hole in one of the pannels of the door shutter; it was cut in a direction that they could put their arm in and unscrew the fastenings of the bar with their hand. This is the whole of the pannel, I had the carpenter to take it out; they cut out the whole square of glass. In the morning the door was shut and on the latch, the shutter put up, and the bar fastened as before, the lock was tied back, and the hole in the pannel was covered over with paper the colour of the pannel; it appeared that they cut the hole of one square, so that a person could go in and unfasten the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that square of glass large enough to let a person in - A. Yes; large enough to let any middle sized person in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your shop with respect to the goods - A. I found three or four shelves empty; the first I missed was a pile of Irish linens which stood on a small counter near the door, I will not be positive whether they stood on a stool or the end of the counter. I missed a quantity of printed cottons, and two wrappers of muslins; this was on the 3d of April. On the morning of the 6th or 7th of April I received a letter by the post, giving me some information, in consequence of which I had a warrant from Worship street office to search the prisoner's house, No. 45, Seward street, Brick lane, St. Luke's, three officers went with me. The prisoner <rs id="t18090111-8-deflabel48" type="occupation">keeps a chandler's shop</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18090111-8-defend118 t18090111-8-deflabel48"></join>; in the parlour behind the shop, in a drawer of a chest of drawers, we found a piece of muslin; in other parts of the house we found a quantity of skeleton keys, and other articles not belonging to me; I found nothing belonging to me but the piece of muslin. The prisoner was not at home at the time of the search.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this house, No. 45, belonged to the prisoner - A. The landlord is here to prove it. I saw his wife at the time I searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What you found there was part of a piece of muslin - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to know it was part of the property that you lost - A. Yes. The officer has it here; I never found any other part of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the keys found - A. In one of the cupboards up stairs, in a small bag, and two or three pair of pistol cases with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw the prisoner after having searched his house - A. Never, till last Thursday at the Mansion house; I have understood ever since, he has been out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having found the muslin at the prisoner's house, did you ever afterwards go to the prisoner's house to enquire after him - A. No. In consequence of the prisoner being absent the prisoner's wife was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110011"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that your maid servant came down first in the morning - A. Yes; we heard her go down stairs, she returned immediately and gave me the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down you saw it was day light - A. It was sufficiently day light, I could see all over the shop, I saw what I had missed without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the only thing that is produced is a piece of muslin - that is a very small part of that which you lost - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it is yours, that piece of muslin has been produced before upon a trial that you charged the wife with a burglary - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For which she was tried in June sessions and acquitted - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you then venture to swear to the muslin, and remember what was said was taken down - A. What I then stated I will now say; from the length and breadth of it, the quantity and texture of it, I believe it now to be mine, but I have since found something more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then upon its being produced upon the trial of this burglary, examine it carefully in court - A. I examined it as carefully as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you done so at the police office before the magistrate - A. I had so, but not in the light so much as what I have at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to me, did not you state as your reason for believing it to be yours from this circumstance; the quantity, length, breadth, and texture; their being no marks that you could not swear to it - A. I said the fagg end being turn off, my private mark being gone, I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the manufacturer who manufactured the article for you, does not he manufacture for half the town besides - A. I do not presume to say he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was tried in June for this, and she was at home at the time of the search - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find there were other people in the house at the time - A. Yes, there was an old man in one of the back rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room were the keys found - A. It was in a back room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You was asked what you said upon the trial of the woman about the piece of muslin being your property; you say you have since discovered something else - A. After the trial, when I left the court, I parted with all the officers in the court, they gave me the muslin wrapped up in paper. I then went directly home, I will not be certain whether I laid the muslin in the shop or my man. I immediately went up stairs; during the time I was at my dinner, I had another try to see whether I could match it. I came down stairs and asked my shopman to assist me, and looking to see if we could trace any of the marks; we found the smallest quantity possible of my shop mark, the top of an O and a W; it is sufficiently perceivable.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship office. In consequence of a search warrant, I went to No. 45, Seward street, with Bishop, Kenedy, and Mr. Rutter; when I came there, I saw the prisoner's wife; I knew the house before. I then read my warrant, and proceeded to search; in a back room below stairs, even with the shop, I found a piece of muslin in a drawer, which was handed over to Mr. Rutter; this was on the 7th of April. In a bed room up stairs, there was a great coat hanging behind the door; in the coat pocket we found some wax taper; in a closet in the same room we found a large black bag; that was all that we found that had any thing to do with this that I could see. I kept the muslin from the time I found it, till Eversall's wife was tried; it was then by the order of the court returned to the prosecutor. After I returned it back to him, I went to the office; he returned at seven o'clock the same evening, and desired me to take care of it. It was then sealed up by me in this paper, and put into a warehouse where Mr. Armstrong keeps a key, where we deposit all property that is taken under warrant. Armstrong unlocked the door and gave me possession of the bag that this was in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor has said that he sent the officers after the prisoner - A. We have been continually enquiring after the prisoner in the neighbourhood; we never went to his house.</p>

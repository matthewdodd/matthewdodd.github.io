The prisoner was employed to make up bed-furniture; she was with me seven weeks. On the 27th of June, I left her by herself for half an hour - and on my return I thought she was concealing something about her person; I left the room, and told Isabella Young of it; I returned and found my keys laying on the drawers - upon opening which, I missed three sovereigns. I had her searched - and found a pair of ruffles made of bobinet, and about a nail of bed-furniture in her pocket; but the bobinet was in her housewife; she behaved very ill, and threw a very large leaden pin-cushion at one of the young ladies. I sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>MRS. GARDNER. This cotton, to the best of my knowledge, is ours; we do not sell it - she was making a bed for me; it matches in colour and width and quality, in my opinion. I produce a piece of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living at upholstery business. I gave up the key of my lodgings, and several pieces of calico were found, which I had taken out of pawn at Dobree's, in Bloomsbury-steps - I make it up to sell. Mine was 1 s. a yard, and her's only 6 d.</p>

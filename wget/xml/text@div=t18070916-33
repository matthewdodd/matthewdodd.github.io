               <p>Q. When did you see him and upon what occasion. - A. Upon the 27th of July last, at about half past nine in the evening, I was walking near Coney hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that. - A. At <placeName id="t18070916-33-crimeloc166">Fryern Barnet</placeName>

               <p>Q. That is in Middlesex, is it not - A. Yes; I was walking in the road by myself. The prisoner, in company with another man, stopped me, and demanded my money; and the prisoner held a bludgeon to me; the other man held out his hand, as if to take my watch, he did not say any thing; I said do not take my watch, be satisfied with my purse, there is about seven guineas in it; he continued to hold out his hand, and I gave him my watch. The prisoner said, when he presented the bludgeon, I do not wish to take any man's life. One of them told me then not to stop, but to go about my business; I cannot recollect which.</p>
               <p>Q. They took your watch and you purse. - A. Yes, the other man did; the prisoner took nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of them touched you. - A. One of them struck me at the first, not the prisoner. They left me and went towards Finchley Common. I ran home to my father's house, at Coney hatch; I got the assistance of my brother and servant, and pursued them across the common, towards the Bald-faced Stag.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not overtake them. - A. No; on returning from the Bald-faced Stag, we saw two men in the opposite side of the road; we went up to them: I said these are the fellows that robbed me; I seized the prisoner, and when we got him down, I searched him. I found my watch upon him, and the bludgeon which he held up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the bludgeon. - A. It was inside of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same sort of bludgeon that he held up to you. - A. Yes, about the same size. We took him to a public house close to my father's house. The other man got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. No, I had never seen him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, a light night, or a dark night - A. It was dark; there were some high trees that were on the road, it was not dark on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark that you could not distinguish the figure of the person, or the countenances of the persons that stopped you. - A. By the figure.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was the prisoner that stopped you - can you speak to their persons, or their countenances. - A. Not to their countenances; they were in dark dresses, both of them, nearly alike.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that at the time the prisoner held up the bludgeon to you, he was the person that spoke to you; the other was the person that held out his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160023"></xptr>and who took from you your purse and your watch - how do you know it was the prisoner that spoke to you. - A. I heard him speak to me when we took him, then I knew his voice directly.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body else had taken him, could you have told by his voice whether he was the man that stopped you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the watch. - A. I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that watch. - A. About four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is your watch, what do you know it by, do you know it by either number or mark, or what is it you know it by. - A. I can swear to it; it is a singular face, I never saw a face like it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to it by the number. - A. No. I can by the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a chain, or ribbon, or what. - A When I found the watch upon him it was in the state it is in now, so that I only found the watch, not the ribbon. We went to the place where I was robbed; there I found the ribbon, seal, and ring, which is mine; the ring is torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but that watch is yours. - A. Not a doubt. I said to the prisoner, after I had taken him, this is a bad evening's work for you, my friend; he said, indeed it is sir. That is all that passed.</p>

            . I am out of work. On Friday the 30th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was going to tea, and saw the prisoner with the watch; I asked him where he got it? he said, he got it from his master, and shewed it to me-it had letters on the back. I told him to take it back to his master; he said he would; after I left work, I saw him again, and asked if he had taken it back; he said, he had; I said, he had not, and felt in his pocket; he shewed it to me again.</p>

            . I was in Wild-passage, the prisoner stood at the corner, and shewed me a watch; he persuaded me to walk up the street with him; when he got to Queen-street, I asked where he got it; he made no answer. When we got to Short's-gardens, he took me to the prisoner Hambleton's house; I found him and another man there; he told me to come in, and asked me what I wanted for it. Ford sent me in, and told me to ask 1l. for it - I did so; he said he would only give 12s. for it; I took that money, and gave it to Ford; he gave me half of it; he then took me into a cook shop; after that, he went to the Oratorio.

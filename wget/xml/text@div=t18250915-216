I received information that she was lodging with one Cox (who had been occasionally employed by me), in Earl-street, Edgware-road. I had considered Cox as married - I went there between six and seven o'clock the next morning, and saw a coach at the door, with the prisoner's boxes in it: I told the coachman not to stir till I had got an officer - I then got Hewitt and Morris; we went up into the room and found Cox, Isted, and Waters, drinking some spirits, which appeared to be rum and gin: I saw some property there which I knew to be mine - the prisoner's boxes were then searched, and thirty yards of ribbon, a locket, a necklace, with a basket attached to it, and some gimp, which I believe to be mine, were found - I had not given them to her - I had seen the gimp, the Friday before the Monday on which she left me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you give Isted warning? A. Yes, she had been taken to Bow-street, but not on this charge, on the 26th. When she left me, I searched her boxes, but found nothing of mine - I have given the servants a present of a bit of ribbon on my birth day, but I never gave them any ornaments, or any thing improper for them to wear - I did not wish that after all, Isted and Waters should remain in my service - Waters left me the same night; it was the officer who searched the boxes, and an officious person, named Cox.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did that officious person, Cox, search the boxes before they left your house? A. Yes, I had a charge against my coachman at Bow-street; in consequence of what I there heard, I turned Isted and Waters away that night; I had given my servants two yards of ribbon on my birth day, but I never gave them thirty yards alike - the boxes were searched, just before they left, on the top of the stairs - Waters had given me warning two or three days before - I am sure the prisoner did not give me warning.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have some property, part of which I found in Isted's box, and part in Cox's room on a table; a direction was tied on the box - I got the key from a Bow-street officer to whom the prisoner had given it.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find in the box? A. This thirty yards of ribbon, the gimp and the locket - Isted was not in the room when I searched the box - I have the box and the clothes which were in it in my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where was she when you searched? A. In custody at Mary-le-bone-office. I did not tell her I had found these things - they were produced to her at the office; I had not seen any list given by Miss Kidney.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was she present when these things were produced before the Magistrate? A. Yes, between two and three o'clock, on the 26th of July - I had told her I had got the key, and was going to search her box - it was at her second examination, these things were produced - I think she said Miss Kidney had given them to her, alluding particularly to the ribbon.</p>
               <p>MISS KIDNEY re-examined. Q. When did the prisoner leave you? A. On the 25th of July - on the 26th, in the morning, I found the coach, and had her apprehended about three o'clock that day - we got the key, and two of three days afterwards it was mentioned to her that the things were found.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The lady searched the prisoner's box - there were some beads found in a small box in the large one, these appear to me to be them. I asked Miss Kidney if they were her's - she said she had given them to Phillis - there was a locket found which Miss Kidney saw. I had a list of articles on the 27th of July, which she said she had lost - I attended at the office, and gave evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150083"></xptr>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Miss Kidney, on the 22d, make a complaint of what had been lost? A. Yes, and I took Isted upon the 23d, but none of the property was then found - there was a complaint against this lady's coachman before that - I went round with the list to the pawnbrokers, but could not find any of the property - some beads were returned to the prisoner at the Office, but I do not know whether they were the beads I found in the box - there was a locket found by me on the 22d - that I swear - I was called as a witness by the prisoner, and gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you, or do you not believe, that those are the beads and the locket you saw in the box? A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>- BROWN. I am a married woman. I know Miss Kidney. I was her servant, I think in the year 1814 or 1815. I have been to her house to see her while Isted was there. I was there when Isted's box was searched, but I have no recollection of the day. I believe the coachman was then in custody. I saw a little box taken out of the large one, which had in it a little blue necklace. I think I should know it if I saw it, but I do not think this is it. I think they were larger beads, and only two rows of them - the officer shewed them to Miss Kidney. There were some ribbons found, and two white gowns, and one blue muslin, with imitation lace flounces. Miss Kidney said she had given them to her. She then returned to the parlour and said to me, "See what I have given these girls." When I lived with Miss Kidney she was very much given to drink, particularly at night - I think she is very treacherous. She has asked me, since the prisoners have been in custody, if I could tell her any thing against them, and she would give me an anodyne necklace. Mr. Butler and Miss Cressy were present when she said that. I never heard her say whether Phillis had given her warning or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When this servant had left, did not Miss Kidney send for you to assist her? A. Yes; she asked me if the girls owed me any thing; I said Yes, a sovereign for some shoes my husband had made; she said I might not see them again, but I begged her not to trouble herself about it. I saw a necklace found, but not a locket. I saw this broad bit of ribbon found, but not the narrow - the only thing I can swear to is this broad ribbon. Miss Kidney had all the things shewn to her, and very readily disclaimed them all. I have heard her give these girls the best of characters.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. I ask you, whether this search was not while the prisoners and Taylor were in the house? A. Yes; I cannot swear to this narrow ribbon, nor do I think any one could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At Chiswick - I was subpoenaed to attend. I had called at the Asylum where I was brought up, and the gentleman there told me Miss Kidney had left word for me to call upon her - she should be glad to see me. I went to her house in the morning, and stayed till the evening. I believe the girls were going to leave, to be married, and it looked to me like a bit of spite. I think it was about eleven o'clock in the morning when the box was searched. I was up stairs in Miss Kidney's room, and the box was there. I had not heard before that Taylor had been sent for. No one desired me to be present to see what was in the box.</p>

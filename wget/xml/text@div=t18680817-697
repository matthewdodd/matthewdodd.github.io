                  </hi>. I live at 27, Durham Street, Golden Square—about 10.15 in the evening of 8th July I was in Broad Street, St Giles'—some person came out of a doorway and seized my chain—while I was holding him three men came behind me, knocked me down, and took away my watch and chain—I was knocked down with great violence—they all ran away towards Long Acre—a policeman came up, and we followed them—I never lost sight of them before the policeman came up—I lost sight of them after—the man who seized me first was a short man—my watch was worth twenty guineas.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman F</hi> 104). On 8th July, about 10.15, I was in King Street, Long Acre—I saw the prisoner with three others running down King Street—the prosecutor was about 200 yards behind—I followed about 40 yards, when they turned down a court, and I lost sight of them—I have no doubt that the prisoner was one of the four—I saw him six days after at the police station, and picked him out from six others—I told him he was the person I saw running in King Street on the evening of the 8th, and he made no answer—I then charged him with being concerned in robbing Mr. Johann of a watch and chain; he said nothing—I have seen him several times before.</p>

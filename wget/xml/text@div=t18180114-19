            . I live in the parish of St. Ann, Westminster. I came home about half-past five o'clock, on the 26th of December, and found the prisoner in the shop. When I went out I left a pile of cheeses in the shop, about a foot and a half from the door, each cheese weighed 60lbs. and cost me 91/2d. per pound - I missed one of them. The prisoner made no resistance, but denied having taken the cheese.</p>

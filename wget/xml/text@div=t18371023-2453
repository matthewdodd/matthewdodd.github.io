                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Harriet Bain<lb></lb>bridge, who resides at Clapham-rise. The prisoner Mary Cooper was called in to nurse my mother, and her daughter Mary Ann frequently came to our house—I have given Mary various articles—she had been four days in the house before I commenced—I gave her some shirts and socks, and several things—I cannot recollect all—I did not give her either of these articles—I never gave her the books—they are my own—I am fifteen years old, and am living with my mother—she keeps me—I never gave the prisoner this silk veil—it is my mother's—I know it by the colour—my mother has had it many years—I saw it about six weeks ago in my mother's house—this gauze veil I saw about a month ago—that is my mother's—this apron I never gave her—it is my mother's—my sister marked it—there is the mark, "H. B." on it—these three other aprons are all my mother's—I did not give her any of them.</p>

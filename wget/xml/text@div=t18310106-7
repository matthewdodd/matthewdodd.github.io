On the 13th of December I went home between twelve and one o'clock; I did not latch the outer door, but remember latching the inner door - I undressed, put my clothes on a box by my bed-side, and at half-past three was awoke by the Police and a watchman, who asked if I had lost any thing; I got up, and missed the clothes I had worn during the day - the gloves were in my great coat pocket with two razors, and my watch; the Policeman and watchman went down stairs, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I went into Shoreditch, stopped there about an hour, then returned to my rooms, staid there from half-past five to quarter-past six o'clock - I was then standing at the door, heard a whispering at the foot of the stairs, and saw the forms of two men there; it was gloomy there - I could not distinguish their features; I distinctly heard one of them say."They are gone;" I immediately called my brother, then ran down stairs, and followed close at their heels, down the passage, and never lost sight of one of them - that was Davies, he had a great coat on - I watched at the corner of the passage, keeping him in view, till my brother came down; I told him to go a-head, and follow the prisoners - I walked on the other side of the way after him; my brother went up, and stopped them; I immediately crossed over, and gave them into custody - I had never lost sight of Davies; Strickson told the watchman, if he dared to lay hold of him he would knock him down, and he gave him a severe blow on the head; two Policemen came up, laid hold of him, and took him to the station - I had lost sight of Strickson for a moment, while he turned the corner - I swear they are the two men who were whispering at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it day light? A. No, it was a dark gloomy morning; they were taken about a hundred yards from the house - they both turned the corner of the passage, but when Davies turned I was close to him, and did not lose sight of him - my brother was in my room; I called pretty loudly - I had been at the Red Lion, in Hunter-street, the night before, and had some purl; I was there till ten o'clock, but not drinking all the while - my score was 4d. or 5d.; I had broken the glass of my watch, and put it into my great coat pocket - there was no lock to the door; I could see the prisoners at about eight yards distance - a sovereign and a half and a few halfpence were found on Strickson; I did not see either of them smoking a segar - I have two rooms over some stables; there are ten rooms on the same gallery, and doors to each - it was not my great coat which Davies had on.</p>

            . I was awoke on the morning in question by the watchman and Policeman coming up stairs - I sleep with my brother; the watchman showed him a suit of clothes, and asked if he had lost any thing; I knew them to be his - he got up, and put on his working dress - the watchman left the things in the room as he had found them; the great coat has not been found; it was about half-past three o'clock - I got up before he left; my brother went down stairs - I came up again in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; he kept going in and out, and at half-past five o'clock I was sitting in the room, and heard myself called - I ran down; he said two men, whom he suspected, had run down the court - I followed with him, but never saw the prisoners till they were in Kingsland-road; my brother pointed to them - they were two hundred or three hundred yards off; I directly went after them, stopped them, and accused them of robbing my brother - they said they were innocent; my brother came up, called the watchman over, and gave them in charge - the Policeman came up in two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you and your brother inside your own door when he told you the men had just gone off? A. I was, but my brother was on the gallery; you can just see into the street from the gallery, and it is as much as you can; you cannot see a yard beyond it - he was standing at the bottom of the gallery stairs when I got down; he could see into the street from there if people were passing - I saw nobody; nobody could have passed without my seeing them - my brother stood at my side - nobody did pass; I consider he must have lost sight of the men in turning the corner - they were stopped a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards off; the court is twelve yards long - I never saw them till he pointed them out to me, about fifty yards from the court; he said, "There goes the two men I suspect have robbed me;" I might have seen them before, but did not notice them - I passed two or three persons in the street; when I first got to the bottom of the stairs, he said, "Joe, here are two men just run up the court, who I suspect;" he could not have seen them then - they had turned the corner; no housebreaking implements were found on them.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 13th of December, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I observed the two prisoners and two girls of the town, who constantly walk there, talking together: and about a quarter-past three I met Davies with the two women - Strickson was on the opposite side of the way, with a man who had a wooden leg; Davies was on the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060012"></xptr>side as me, which is the opposite side to the passage, and lower down - they were all going towards Shoreditch church; I turned back soon after, and went that way myself - I saw the two prisoners talking together right opposite this passage; it was rather more than half-past three o'clock; the females and the man with the wooden leg had left them - I went up a court on the opposite side to the prosecutor's, came round into Shoreditch again, and missed Strickson; Davies was waiting there, and I thought was watching me - I went and stood opposite the court about eight minutes, then saw Strickson come out at the end of the court, and shut the iron gate after him; he put his hand into his pocket, walked away, and Davies after him; Strickson had a great coat on, which he had not ten minutes before - I could not discover any thing in his hand- a private watchman came up soon after they went away- he stood at the entrance of the court when the prisoners came out; I told him what I had seen, and he lent me his light - we went down to the foot of the stairs; he found a suit of black clothes laying on a stool on the landing-place- I went and found the prosecutor's door open; I was not present when the prisoners were taken - I saw them at the watch-house, and identified them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave the watchman behind when you had found the property? A. Yes - I did not search the prosecutor's rooms, but ran in pursuit of those I had seen come out of the court; it was about twenty minutes to four o'clock - Strickson, at the watch-house, had a blue coat on, which he generally wore; I knew them by being there every night - our commissioners generally give a reward for apprehensions; it is not on conviction: when a man apprehends a party he sends a note to the commissioners, and if they think it a case worthy of reward they give one - I have been twelve months in the Police.</p>

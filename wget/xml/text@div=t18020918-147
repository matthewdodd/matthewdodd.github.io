               <p>Q. What countryman is he? - A. A Hamburghman; he understands English. On Monday the 9th of August, between two and three o'clock in the day, I asked him to mind my shop for me while I went into the kitchen; I should not be gone long; I had occasion to go into the kitchen; after I came up he sat at the door about a quarter of an hour, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner owe you any thing? - A. No; I owed him 7s. 6d. which I sent to him; after he was gone I missed the watch, some French crowns and dollars; I cannot tell how many; I saw my watch the next day at a pawnbroker's; I found the prisoner the next day in a public-house at St. Catherine's, sitting with a girl; I told him a Hamburgh; Captain wanted to take him over to Hamburgh; he said he was very glad of it, and immediately came away; as soon as he got out he ran away, and I did not find him for three or four days after, when I found him in Gravel lane; he begged I would not hurt him; he said he had not had any bread for two days; I took him before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Simons if he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180079"></xptr>let me have any money, I would go and pawn the watch.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Ray, a pawnbroker, Sparrow-corner, Minories; on Monday the 9th of August the prisoner, and another sailor in company with him, came to our shop about five o'clock in the afternoon to sell a watch; I told him I had rather he would pledge it, and then he could have it again; he seemed to wish to dispose of it, and I gave him 2l. for it; I have had it ever since (produces it) he told me he had bought the watch of one Mr. Mosely, in Wapping, and gave him 5l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth 5l.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak English? - A. He spoke so that I could understand him; on the Wednesday, following Simons came and claimed the watch.</p>
               <p>Simons. I know this is my watch; I had 1l watches hanging up, the other 10 had chains, this was the only one that I had with a string and key to it, just as it came from the watchmaker's; there is no number upon it, but there is a name.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name? - A. I don't know, I cannot read or write, but all my watches have the same maker's mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the maker's name? - A.After.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he put his own name upon his watches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There were only four watches that had chains, all the rest had strings; I did not go into that shop to tell the watch, only to pawn it, and the pawnbroker would not take it in pledge, he would buy it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Simons.) What is the value of that watch? - A. I would take 2l. 5s. for it.</p>

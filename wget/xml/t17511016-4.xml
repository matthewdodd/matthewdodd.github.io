            . On Wednesday the eighteenth of September I went to the play-house, Drury-lane. I could not get in, but staid there till the play was over. Coming away, at about half an hour after nine o'clock, about ten yards from the playhouse door in Bridges Street, the prisoner at the bar desired me to go and take a pot and a dram with her; to which I made no reply, but walked on. She followed me, and accosted me in that manner a second time; I desired her to be gone about her business, but she persisted in following me. Then another woman came up and said, Mary, will not you go to your company? If you have ticked up this gentleman, he shall go along with you, and be welcome, but don't detain the company you have left behind. I went on into <placeName id="t17511016-4-crimeloc20">White-Horse-Yard</placeName>

Then this woman, and six or seven fellows, as near as I can remember, came up to me; but she was the first. One of the men struck me about the head, which stunned me a little, and I fell against the rails. They bid me stand, and the men held me while the prisoner took out of my pocket a green silk purse, in which were a guinea and a half in gold, a crown, two half crowns, and one shilling. She is so remarkable, I am certain she is the woman that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Widenham. It was a dark night, but by the light of the lamp, which was over the door where I was knocked against the rails, I observed her. I had a suspicion of her, and had observed her before.</p>

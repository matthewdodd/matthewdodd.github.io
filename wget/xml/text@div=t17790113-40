               <p>I am one of the assignees under the commission.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suggest that the prisoner is guilty of perjury? - His own confession; it is signed by Alderman Plomer, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>ALDERMAN PLOMER sworn.</p>
               <p>(The confession shown him.)</p>
               <p>Is that signature your hand writing? - Yes; it was taken before me the 19th of October, as it is dated; the prisoner swore it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSSEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the commissioners under that commission; I saw the prisoner sign that deposition; it was a voluntary confession before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Court. The deposition before the commissioners is defaced; it appears to have been struck out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. It was fair when he made it, he signed it before me; it was left in the hands of the solicitor; it was afterwards taken out of the hands of the solicitor, and put into the hands of Mr. Langstaff.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langstaff. It was defaced when it came into my hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. We were informed that there were a number of persons who intended to prove debts which never existed, and that the bankrupt was at a house near Guildhall supplying them with materials to prove their debts; the first man, not being versed in the business, stumbled at the threshold, and we rejected his debt. This man, the defendant, was more hardy, he swore to a debt of 50 l. lent all in money at Mr. Hewitt's house at Edmonton; it was suggested to me that he had never seen the house. I asked him several questions about the situation of the house, whether it was in the high road or in a lane, or whether or no there was a porch before the door, with many other questions. We found he was perfectly ignorant of the house, and he was taken from the room where we sat, before Alderman Plomer, and examined on a charge of perjury; he was ordered for further examination, but when he was carried out, he desired to be had in again, and then he made a voluntary confession,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130056"></xptr> that what he had sworn before the commissioners was false. He said he was employed by one Shears to prove a debt against the bankrupt, to get him through his bankruptcy as he called it, and he was to have half a guinea for it. He was asked, if he knew any false debts besides his own. He said one Arnold was supplied with a note, by the bankrupt, at a publick-house, to prove a false debt; that the note was antedated; that looking like new paper he rubbed it in his hands, and said, that would do to make it appear old. The prisoner said, that he was applied to by one Shears, to prove a debt under Hewitt's commission, in order to get Hewitt through his commission. The bankrupt, he said, did not owe him any money; he said he understood he was to receive half a guinea; that he had not received it.</p>
               <p>Did he say, he did not know Hewitt? - I think he said he never saw him till that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langstaff. I was present before the alderman when the prisoner was examined, he said that he had no consideration for the note, nor did Hewitt owe him a single shilling.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have had bills from the country before to prove, and I did not understand that I was doing a wrong thing.</p>

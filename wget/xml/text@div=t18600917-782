                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Constitution-row, Gray's-inn-road—the prisoner is my son—he has not been living with me for three months before this—he left my house with the pretence of going to a situation—I gave him money and clothes—I had not seen him from the time of his leaving till I was called up in the morning of Friday, 24th August, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I found the prisoner in the passage standing with a constable, and this basket packed full of goods taken from the shop: it contained twenty-two brushes, there were eight black-lead brushes, ten large dusters, two larger ones; painters' brushes, parlour brushes, a clothes brush, some essence of lemon, and other things—some of them had been hanging to the ceiling, and the others were in different places—the lock of the parlour-door had been forced back—the parlour communicates with the shop—I had locked the parlour-door myself on the night before quite securely, about 11 o'clock—I was the last person up—there was not any one on my pre<lb></lb>mises after that—the basket had been in the baok room the night before—I did not know my son was there, till I was called—he had no authority from me to enter the house, or to take any of those articles.</p>

I was on duty in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of that house on the 24th August, and about 5 o'clock in the morn-ing I heard a noise inside the house like some one breaking a door—I stood listening and I saw the prisoner peep outside the door—I went there and the door was closed—when the prisoner opened the door and looked out he looked in the direction in which, I was standing, and he saw me and drew back and shut the door—I went to it and knocked—he made no answer; I knocked again and I saw him standing close to the door, looking through the key-hole—I knocked again, he opened the door and asked me what I wanted—I asked him what he was doing there—he said it was all right, that he had come home the night before and made matters all right with his mother—he said, "I have come back to work, I am going to open the shop, I have got my apron on"—on looking down I saw this basket of goods, and over the top of it five bundles of wood were laid to make it appear that he had got all wood—there were in it brushes, tea, sugar, bread, new-laid eggs, and other things—I called his mother down, she was very angry and was fit to fly at him—I found this iron in the basket; it is what the parlour door was opened with, and I found on him this key which opened the outer door, a threepenny piece, and 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on those premises—I had been up all that night at needle-work, and on the morning of 24th August I heard the door opened with a key—I don't know what time it was, but it was not daylight; I was burning a candle at the time—it was after 12 o'clock and before daylight—I heard the door open and I thought it might be a person I live with, who had gone out the day before—I took my candle and looked, but I did not see her.</p>

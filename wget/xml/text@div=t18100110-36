Before I went to Scotland I gave this lad twenty-one pounds which I held in my hand a twelve-month or more, he earned it; he gave it me for safety. When I came back I was informed that he was robbed; I was down at Greenwich when the prisoner was taken on Monday last; I saw him in the cage, I knew him immediately; I asked the prisoner for O'Brian's handkerchief, he said he had given him the handkerchief; I accused the prisoner of taking O'Brian's handkerchief and money; Tom was standing behind me looking over my shoulder; he said, George, did I give you the money too? - no, said he, I do not know any thing about the money. After that the constable came and took him from the watchhouse; on the way home I asked him where the handkerchief was now; he said the handkerchief was worn out. He would not own to the money or notes.</p>

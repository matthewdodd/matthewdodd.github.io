            . I keep a smith's shop in Shoreditch: the prisoner's wife brought four iron streaks to sell, and said her husband bought them of one Baker. that keeps cows, in the way to Hackney. I had been informed that a house had been broke open, and some old iron stolen. I desired her husband would come: he did, and said he bought them of one Baker, that goes about selling milk. I said, Go along with me to him, and after that I'll buy it. He said, Let me go, and I'll find him. I said, You shall not go without me. I took him to Clerkenwell: he was there examined; he still could not find the man he bought them of. He was examined again, two days after; he could not give any other account. He sent for Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100007"></xptr> Basset, his master; he not coming, but sending a letter to the Justice. (the contents of which I know not) he was committed, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

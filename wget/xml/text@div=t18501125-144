On 20th Nov., about eight in the evening, I was in Great Marylebone-street, coming from High-street towards Wimpole-street, and the two prisoners passed me two doors from Wimpole-street, and turned down the street on the side Dr. Mayo lives, nearest to High-street—I crossed over to the side nearest Portland-place—the prisoners were in company, and as I was passing on the other side of the street they were standing at Dr. Mayo's door—I had noticed them go to the door—they appeared to be opening it with a key—I saw the door opened while they were standing there, and Rivers turned back down the street and went to Great Marylebone-street, and Wilson went into the house—he remained in the house four or five minutes, came out, closed the door, returned to the corner of Marylebone-street, and stayed there a moment I suppose—I did not then see Rivers, he had left the corner and gone down Great Marylebone-street—I met John Lee at the corner of Wimpole-street and Great Marylebone-street, made a communication to him, told a policeman, and I and he followed Wilson down Marylebone-street till we came to Westmoreland-street, between Wimpole-street and High-street—I then saw the prisoners again together at a public-house door, at the corner of Westmoreland-street and pointed them out to the policeman.</p>

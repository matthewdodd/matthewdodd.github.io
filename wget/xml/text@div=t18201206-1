About the 29th of July he gave my wife this bill (producing it), who gave it to me; I told the prisoner I could not give him the money for it. I afterwards enquired of Standen, where the bill was made payable, and in consequence of what he said I gave the prisoner 3 l. on it; and after that 2 l. 7 s. more, which, with what he owed me for lodging, &amp;c., came to 8 l. 19 s. - he endorsed the bill before I gave him the money. He was present when my wife gave me the bill. I cannot say what past, but she said</p>

I think it is the prisoner's hand-writing - I should not think the endorsement is his, but I believe the signature is his; I have seen him write three or four times - the last time was seven or eight months ago. I have seen him write notes - I think four notes within the last nine months.</p>

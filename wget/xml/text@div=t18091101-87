On the 2d of October I was putting my eldest boy to bed; I looked in the prisoner's box; I found two pair of black stockings that I had missed. I came down, and accused the prisoner; Mr. Butcher was there. I requested him to take him in charge, he took him to the watch-house. I found a quantity of lace behind the door, of the value of five pounds.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTCHER. I am a bricklayer. I was at Mrs. Death's that evening that she lost the stockings, she called me up. I saw the prisoner's box, there were two pair of stockings secreted in the prisoner's pantaloons; she said she could swear to them; I came down stairs, and told the prisoner he had done a wrong thing; I said, you have robbed Mrs. Death, I took him in custody, and at the watch-house, this pair of gloves was found; coming back, I kicked against these skains of silk; I called for a light; I picked up this piece of Mrs. Death's gown.</p>

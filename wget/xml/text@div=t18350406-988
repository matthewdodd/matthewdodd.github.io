                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner was my servant—on the 23rd of March, she asked to go out, about seven o'clock in the evening—she returned about half-past eleven o'clock—while she was out, I heard something; and told her when she returned, I had reason to suspect she had taken some of my goods—I asked her if she knew my thing about any ribbons—she said she did not—I asked her if she would allow me to look into her boxes—she refused—I got the officer—her boxes were searched, and the property stated was found.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house, and took the prisoner—Bradshaw searched her box, when she pointed it out; but she was so much affected that it was as much as I could do to hold her, she was near fainting—on the road to the station she cried very much, and said she thought it no harm to take those bits of ribbon.</p>

I went to the house, and found the property—the prisoner said she had nothing belonging to her master, in her box—I searched and found these napkins—I was looking for the mark, when she burst out crying, and said, "Oh dear! they are not mine"—I asked if there was any thing more—she said, "No"—but I found these stockings, and thirty-six bits of ribbon.</p>

               <p>What number of people do you think were collected together? - I do not know; a great many at one time; they cried out Newgate, Newgate, Newgate.</p>
               <p>Had Newgate been broke open at that time? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this? - Between seven and eight, as near as I can guess; when the people went off for Newgate, as we thought, the crowd was much less; then I saw Lawrence at the door and spoke to him out at the window. I said, Lawrence what do you do here? go away about your business. I knew him very well, for I had pressed him some time before; when I spoke to him he left the door and went towards the top of Bow-street; he then crossed the street and stood on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Did you see him again that evening? - At a considerable time after, but I cannot be exact to the time; the street began to fill with people again, and then we saw that some of the people, who had been there before, come back again; they had clubs, iron bars, and choppers in their hands; then one of the persons who was in the house, went out the back way; and there was no-body in the house but Prothero and me.</p>
               <p>What time was it when the mob returned? - A little after nine, or it might be more.</p>
               <p>How did they behave when they came back? - They came all up in a body to the door; numbers of the people who had the clubs in their hands came up to the door and said D - n you! we will have it down presently. Then Prothero and I put up the chain to the door, and made it as secure as we could, and then we got out the back way through a gentleman's house. I went to the top of Bow-street, and there I met two more of Sir

               <p>What do you mean by the inside being torn out? - The windows were all broke and the wainscoting was torn down, some of the window frames were cut out with choppers; part of the frames were left and part taken away.</p>

             with iron crows, hatchets, and other things. I saw Roberts breaking the stair-case with a crow, or an instrument of that nature, and carrying down the wood and throwing it into the fire, which was in the middle of the street, opposite the door.</p>
               <p>You say you knew his person before? - Perfectly well; the house I keep is a rendezvous for sailors, he had been there some days with Lieutenant Preston of the rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Was he entered for the sea? - Yes. He had run away from his master.</p>
               <p>No matter for that, you know his person perfectly well, did you observe him in any other part of the house? - I believe, he was in every room in the house; I met him coming out at the door.</p>
               <p>Do you know what his age is? - I believe, between seventeen and eighteen.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the other prisoner there at all? - I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. What part of the street were you in when you observed this lad doing what you describe? - I was in the house; I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you have known the prisoner some time? - Yes; I have known him for these twelve months past.</p>
               <p>Did you know who he belonged to? - I did not know where his father lived; I knew he lived somewhere in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Did not you know his master? - No; I never saw him in my life, as I know of.</p>
               <p>You knew he was an apprentice? - Yes, from what I heard.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner with a mop in his hand? - Yes; I saw him with two mops in his hand; another boy took one of them out of his hand and they mopped the windows and the places, to prevent their taking fire.</p>
               <p>And you do not know but that the prisoner Roberts mopped the windows as well as the others? - No; he did not; I saw him chuck the mop into the fire immediately.</p>
               <p>Throw his own mop or the other boy's mop? - His own mop.</p>
               <p>Did you order some liquor to be given to these people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To whom? - Several of them, for them not to set the house on fire.</p>
               <p>You did not go till eleven o'clock, did you? - I might be there something before.</p>
               <p>When you went there what was there set on fire? - A great deal of the furniture.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you saw the stair-case pulled down? - It might be between eleven and twelve, or twelve and one, I cannot say; Roberts went over to the bar of the Brown-Bear and demanded rum or brandy; then he said boys, or something of that sort, now away to Lord North's.</p>
               <p>You must know it was not a likely thing to give such a boy as that ale to make him peaceable, and this porter and ale you gave them before you saw the boy pulling down the stair-case? - I carried it into the house; he might drink as well as the others; I make no doubt but what he did.</p>
               <p>You gave it him before you saw him doing this act? - I do not know that I gave it him, I believe, he, as well as the rest of them, drank of it.</p>
               <p>And before that time you did not see him active? - I saw him active the whole evening.</p>
               <p>But did you see him pull down any thing? - Yes. I saw him pull down something in some part of the fore-room of the office.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after the ale was given away? - I believe, it was after.</p>
               <p>Then you think when a mob is riotous the way to make them peaceable is to give them strong beer? - I believe, if we had not given them beer the whole neighbourhood would have been burnt down.</p>
               <p>And you gave them spirituous liquors? - I did not give them any; the woman gave them some rum herself at her bar, in order to appease them.</p>
               <p>You swear that was not given by your orders, nor at your expence? - No; neither.</p>

I saw nothing more of Roberts till they had got to the windows of the first floor; by that time a great many chairs and a good deal of furniture were thrown out and set on fire in the street in five different places. I saw Roberts throw out several chairs, and a good deal of bed linen; by this time the fires were so large that one might have seen to pick up a pin in the street. Roberts came down and came out into the street; there was a good deal of the wainscoting of the rooms, chairs, and other furniture that had been destroyed, which I saw Roberts very active in throwing into the flames.</p>

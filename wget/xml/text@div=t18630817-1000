I keep a beer-shop in Old Brentford—on Saturday, 1st August, at a little after 6 in the evening, I was in Windmill-lane, about half a mile from my house, and saw the prisoners walking along together—I was at my beer-shop between 8 and 9 o'clock, and Williams came in for a pint of ale—my wife served him—he put half-a-crown on the table, and my wife said, "That is not worth 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I want 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my ale"—I took it up, and bent it; it was bad—I asked him if he had any more of them—he said "No," and he did not know it was bad—he put down a good one, and my wife gave him change—I went to the station, and brought back a con<lb></lb>stable in a quarter of an hour; Williams was then coming out, and Thomp<lb></lb>son was eight or nine yards behind him—I had not seen Thompson in my house when I left—I gave Williams in custody, and followed Thompson, who walked away as fast as he could—I followed him to Kew-bridge, put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "I want you to stop a few minutes till a policeman comes; I suspect you of being concerned with another person in having some bad money"—he said, "You let me go; what business have you to stop me?" and set to kicking me—he said that he had no bad money—I said, "Stop till a policeman comes; there is one close behind—I did not touch him till I saw a policeman—I gave him in custody—he kicked at me two or three times, and kicked me once on the thigh—I gave the half-crown to the policeman at the station.</p>

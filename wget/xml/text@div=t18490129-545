                  </hi>. I am a member of, and was secretary to, the Entyroological Society in Bond-street. On Jan. 7th, 1848,1 missed plates, belonging to that Society—Mr. William Yarrell is a member, and there are others—those plates produced are a description of insects, butterflies, and other things—I wrote upon these wrappers which covered the plates—no one had anything to do with them but me; they were under my care.</p>

               <p>not been secretary for twelve months—I know all about the proceedings of the Society—the present secretary could not have gone on without coming to me for instructions—I had not the charge of this property, but had constant access to it—he is the person to whom the charge of the property is com<lb></lb>mitted, but he has not charge of it more than the treasurer and other persons in the Society—the rooms are in Bond-street—when the officers are not in attendance the rooms are locked, and the key is left with the treasurer, Mr. William Yarrell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a translator of foreign lan<lb></lb>guages. In consequence of something I heard, I called on the prisoner, at 11, Angel-court, Strand—I said that I thought the best thing he could do was to disclose the whole of the robberies that he was acquainted with, and I would make application to the Secretary of State to get a pardon, and have him admitted as evidence for the Crown—I more particularly alluded to the prints which I recognised in his room—I did not then know that there was a charge against him—I became bail for him at the Mansion-house—I was not employed by him as an attorney; I appeared an clerk to Mr. Medina at the Mansion-house on that single occasion—I have no doubt, hope and expecta<lb></lb>tion were the real cause of his disclosing this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were the prints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On a sofa, in a bundle, covered over—the prisoner opened them, and showed them to me—I had been informed by him that a man named Schmidt and he were acquainted—I gave information of what I had seen the same evening—I placed them for security in the hands of the police—after telling the prisoner I would apply to the Secretary of State, I went and gave information—the prisoner promised to meet me at the house of another solicitor, to make this disclosure, on the following Monday, and I gave information instantly—I had not seen the prisoner before on this subject—I had seen him at the Mansion-house, on the subject of Schmidt and Boyal—I communicated to the police their address, which I obtained from Mrs. Robertson—I did not go to the prisoner as his attorney, I had gone for Mr. Medina a week before—I was introduced to the prisoner by a most respectable friend of his, to get bail, and Mr. Medina wrote a letter to the Lord Mayor, stating that it was inconvenient for him to attend, and he would be obliged to him to let me act for him—I wanted the prisoner to give information respecting this robbery—I pressed him to give all the information possible to put a stop to this system of robbery—the relation of solicitor and client ceased as soon as I had performed my duty—it came out in evidence that there had been a previous conviction against him, and I thought I did not stand in a very pleasant situation, unless I induced him to clear up the matter—I said, "I advise you to make a disclosure of these things"—I promised to solicit his pardon, and wrote to the Secretary of State on the subject—I was not his attorney in any shape or way; he left it to me to deal with these prints as I thought best—he was to meet me on the Monday, at the office of Mr. Lewis, in Ely-place—Mr. Lewis is not in any shape or way mixed up with this—I did not go before the Magistrate, and state that I was there representing Mr. Lewis, and he did not have to write a statement discarding me, it was a mis-report—Mr. Lewis did not say he had written to the newspapers, stating that he had nothing to do with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290075"></xptr>
               <p>me, and tell me to go away—he did not state that he must decline having anything to do with me; the question did not arise—I had seen Schmidt one night at the prisoner's lodging—I had a very strong impression that these things had been taken by Schmidt—I asked the prisoner about him—he gave me information partially, and his wife gave me the remainder—I am not clerk to Mr. Medina—Mr. Lewis declined using my evidence in Schmidt's case; I do not know on what ground—I have been in the army; I was in the Portuguese service, as Major of Lancers—I never was bail for any one but the prisoner—I have seen his friends—he was introduced to me as an extremely respectable man—I had seen him two or three times—I had no interview with him till I had left the Mansion-house—I have worn the coat I hare on about six months, it has been worn by Mr. Lloyd once or twice—it is not the coat for appearing before the Lord Mayor—Mr. Lloyd has sometimes worn mine, and sometimes I wear his—this is not his, I cannot say who has the greater share in it—Mr. Lewis got two guineas from the Commissioners of the Insolvent Debtors' Court for me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, E</hi> 14). On 19th Dec, I went with Cross to the prisoner's lodging, 11, Angel-court, Strand—I found him lying on the sofa, in his own room, on the second-floor—I searched the house on the 27th,—I found nothing on the charge, I was sent for, but remember taking these, prints in my hand, and saying to his wife, "These are very pretty things"—she said, "Yes, we were about opening a shop, and these were to stock it"—I believe they were lying under a table, in the front room—I know this one again—I believe it was this bundle of prints that is here now—I saw them again on the morning of 31st Dec—when I first saw them they were tied up in these two thick paper-boards—these are the original wrappers that were round them—when I took the prisoner on this charge he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Schmidt to be tried? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for stealing parch<lb></lb>ments (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 370)—the only charge on which I had him was for stealing Custom-house paper—I think I first saw Mr. Edwards about 21st last month, at the Mansion-house, defending the prisoner—he did not then say anything to me about making further discoveries, but a few days afterwards he told me I must endeavour to get Schmidt in custody—he did not tell me that he would find it all out for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of St. Katharine's Docks. On the evening of the 30th of July, I saw the prisoner with others in a craft belonging to Mr. Whellock—they got on the quay, and were walking towards the principal gate, when I saw one of them drunk—I asked the prisoner what he did in the craft?—he said he was employed by Mr. Whellock to watch the craft—I asked what he had to watch—he said, "Cheese"—I took him to the superintendent, who told me to search the craft—I went, and found it contained a case of fourteen bottles of Geneva—there were places for fifteen—I asked the prisoner for the key of the cabin—he gave it to me—I went and searched the cabin, and found an empty bottle, similar to those in the case—there was about a tea spoonful in it—the prisoner said he had broken the case open with another boy, who was with him, intending to take a little to drink, and put the rest back, but the other boy had drank it in his absence.</p>

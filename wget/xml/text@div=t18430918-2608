                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mrs. Ann Conway and two others, wholesale grocers; the prisoner was their porter for three or four years. On Friday evening, the 25th of August, in consequence of information, as the prisoner was leaving the warehouse with a basket, I told him to stop for orders, and asked if that was his basket—he said it was—I asked what was in it—he said it was merely the basket he brought his meals in—I said, "I wish to see what is in it"—he then said he was very sorry, he had taken a little sugar—I took the basket from his hand, called a policeman, and gave him in charge—the basket contained eight pounds of very fine lump sugar of a peculiar kind, my employers' property.</p>

I desired him to be civil, and he was angry with we; and asked me, who I was? I told him I was a Parish Officer, and Words arising between us, he pulled out his Watch, and wanted to lay me a Wager, on account of his Quarters, and calling me Scrub, he said I had not Half-a-Guinea to lay with him. This made me be so indiscreet as to pull out a Bag, in which was two 3 l. 12 s. pieces, 2 Moidores, and 2 Half-Guineas, that I might shew the Prisoner I could lay him Half-a-Guinea if I pleased. After some Words had passed, I put up my Bag; and in a very little Time afterwards the Landlord called me, and asked me, if I knew what Money I had in it? I told him I did; and upon looking it over, I found Half-a-Guinea missing. I can only say I lost it, and that the Prisoner was very much in Liquor.</p>
               <p>- Abery. I saw Half-a-Guinea lying upon the Table, where they had been disputing: and the Soldier took it up, and put it under his Watch, which lay upon the Table likewise. Then (says he) I see you have no Mind to lay a Wager, and so he put them both into his Pocket. I was sure it was one of Mr Williams's Half-guineas, for I saw it drop through his Fingers upon the Table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very full of Liquor when I came in that Evening, and my Landlord said, he hop'd I would be in a better Humour than I was the Night before. I told him, I hop'd I was not in an ill Humour then, and that I should not be so now. He insisted upon 2 Men's lying in the Room with me. I insisted upon it, that they should not, and that began the Talk of a Wager between Mr Williams and me. He told me, if I layed a Wager of a Guinea I should lose; I said I have not a Guinea to bett, but I have what's as good as a Guinea, or two either; so I took out my Watch, and clapp'd it down on the Table, - by the same Token, I broke the main Spring of it at the same Time. I own I had the Half-Guinea, but I don't know how I came by it. They did not know that I had it, till I confessed it myself. I was so much in Liquor that Night, that though they carried me to New-Prison, I did not know where I was till next Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr Williams. He owned he had it the next Morning, but said, he did not know he had it, and he was very ready to give it me again.</p>
               <p>The Corporal and Serjeant of the Company to which the Prisoner belonged, gave him the Character of an honest Fellow. <rs id="t17400903-15-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">

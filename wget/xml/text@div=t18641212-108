                  </hi>. I live at 3, Holton-cottages, Myrtle-street, East Croydon, and am the wife of William Smith, a marine-store dealer—the prisoner was married to my daughter—her name was Louisa Stacey—I was not at church with them—they left my house to be married, and returned back to my house—I don't remember the date—it was about eleven years ago—about two years ago last Epsom Races, my daughter drank with her husband at my house.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Darlaston, near Durham—I came to Lon<lb></lb>don the beginning of June—about nine o'clock in the evening of the 4th June I was walking towards King's Cross—when near Holford Square I observed two men following me—Crawley is one of them—one was on my right-hand side and one on my left—Crawley caught me by the throat, my knee was struck from behind, and I was knocked down senseless—I had a watch in my pocket with a chain attached, which they took from me—there were two others with them—while on the ground they kicked me, and one of them pressed his knee forcibly into my side—I was hurt very much, and I feel the effects of their violence now—this watch and</p>

               <p>chain produced is my property—Crawley, on getting my watch, said to the others, "D—it, he is a b—; he is bad to do with"—I earn swear Crawley is one of the men, but I am not so positive as to Smith.</p>

About a quarter-past nine on the 4th June I was on duty in plain clothes in Percy Circus—that is about thirty yards from Holford Square—I saw the prisoners and another one not in custody following the prosecutor—I spoke to another officer, and then went round into the square by another way—I saw the prisoner go with the prosecutor into the mews—I followed them, and Smith said to me, "Is this the way to King's Cross Railway Station? "—I said, "No; that is the way down <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> there is no thoroughfare <hi rend="italic">here</hi>"—they all went into the square, and stood by where I could see them—they went about fifteen or sixteen yards, and then the prosecutor was thrown on his back—I ran to his assistance, and when within six yards I heard the man not in custody say, "Have you got it? "—Smith said, "Yes, I have got it; "and I saw the chain dragged from prosecutor's neck—Crawley was upon the prosecutor—I ran after Smith, and Crawley ran by his side some sixty yards—when I got to Holford Place I called out, "Stop thief! "and Crawley then threw himself down in front of me, and I fell over him—I got up and continued in pursuit of Smith, who was stopped in Swindon Street with the watch in his hand—Crawley got away—I can swear to him; I had known him before.</p>

At a quarter-past nine on the 4th June I was at the bottom of Great Percy Street, near Holford Square—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 18th of June I was at Kilburn - I saw a waggon loaded with sacks of flour; Goodwin was driving it; it stopped at the Bell, where Cherry is <rs id="t18300708-77-deflabel446" type="occupation">ostler</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not count the sacks, and say at the office there were sixteen? A. No; Goodwin said they were booked, or if not they ought to be - the woman said there was a little old man in the habit of coming for flour.</p>

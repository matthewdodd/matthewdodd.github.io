                  </hi>. I am a clothier's cutter, and live at 45, Wel<lb></lb>lington Street, Old Ford—on the evening of 29th November, about half-past 6 I was in the Bethnal Green Road—at the corner of Edward Street I saw a man standing in my path—I had my hand in my pocket—part of my chain was exposed—one man was standing on my left and two men on my right about four yards apart—the one on my left snatched my watch—this portion of the chain dropped down—I stooped and picked it up, and went in pursuit of the thief, who darted down Edward Street, and ran away—as I turned to pursue him the prisoner and another man were standing there—one of them, I won't say which, put out his foot to trip me—I escaped that, and went on in front of them—I was gaining on the thief—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner and the third man gaining upon me, and I turned round and struck out with my fist at each of them, and missed them—they did the same to me with the same result; they missed me—nothing was said—they then turned round and ran down the street, and I after them—we proceeded a little way when they turned round at me again and struck at me, and one of them cried out, "Down with the b—, hit him on the head"—they then proceeded round one of the bye turnings and got into Chilton Street—one of them then cried out, "Where is the knife?"—then we faced other—I never lost sight of the prisoner—he stooped down and picked up a stone and threw it at me—I moved my head on one side, and it whizzed by my ear—they then ran away down the street—one of them turned down a bye turning—the prisoner ran straight on—I then began to call out, "Stop thief!"—I followed the prisoner—he ran into a constable's arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My chain was hanging out of my pocket when I saw the first man, and he took it—it was done instantaneously—as he took it I turned round and faced these two men, who were dodging me—I did not see the man who took my chain speak to the other two; if he had done so I should have seen it—there was a very good light at this point, both from a musical instrument maker's and a public-house—I know the place well, I pass it night and morning—it is a frequented neighbourhood, but there was nobody at the time when the man put out his foot to trip me—I said "Stop him!"—I had to jump for it—I did not catch hold of him—I went after the man that had got my watch, but I lost sight of him from their preventing me—I struck out at the two men when I found them attempting to prevent me from pursuing the man that had my watch—no one hit me on the head, nor did I see any knife—I never lost sight of the prisoner—I could not swear to the man that took my watch, because I did not see his features.</p>

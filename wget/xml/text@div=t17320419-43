               <p>Mr. Matthews. On Friday the 13th of August last, in the Afternoon, I was driving with my Wife in a one Horse Chaise from London to Finchly ; as I passed by Highgate Church I looked at the Dial, and observ'd it wanted a Quarter of 7. There are 2 Ways down the Hill from <placeName id="t17320419-43-crimeloc213">Highgate</placeName>

They were both on Foot, and I thought it a little odd for one of them to be in the Horse-way; but as it was a publick Road, and there being 2 or 3 Women and a Boy just by, I was the less apprehensive of being attack'd. I drove forward, the black Man was soon at my Horse's head, and took hold of the right Rein, and cry'd, Stop! Stop! At first I thought something about the Horse was out of Order, but I was soon undeceived The Man in the fair Wig jumpt from the Causeway, and (like an Arrow out of a Bow) was instantly at the left Side of my Horse; he took hold of the left Rein, when the black Man clapping a Pistol to my Belly, swore and cursed, and bid me deliver my Money immediately, or I was a dead Man. I gave him 2 Guineas, and 19 s. 6 d: in Silver. In taking out my Money he saw the Chain of my Watch, which he pluck'd out, and held it up to look at it. Then he search'd my Fob, and my right and left Pocket (for a Purse I suppose) holding the Pistol hard against my Belly all the while; his Hand that held it shaking, as if he had been convulsed. I did not at all like the Situation I was in. My Eye was fix'd on the Pistol, and the Fear I was in, left it should accidentally go off, prevented me from taking particular Notice of those who robb'd me, and except I could be as certain that the Prisoner was one of them, as I am that I am now speaking, I would by no means swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the Man in the fair Wig do?</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Nothing but hold the Reins; nor did he say any thing, but only desir'd the other not to frighten the Gentlewoman. The black Man swore and cursed all the while, and because my Horse did not stand still, he bid the other cut the Reins, and repeated it 2 or 3 times. I tender'd him my Keys, and some Farthings, but whether he took any of the Farthings I can't say. Then he bid me drive on, and at parting said, Your Servant ! and I drove forward. A Gentleman on Horseback overtook me soon after; I told him what had happened; he said, He was sorry for it, but he did not seem inclin'd to pursue them, but rid away. Next Morning, I heard that (the Day before) 2 Men had been at the Dirt-House, where they eat and drank, and having no Money to pay their Reckoning, left a Case of Surgeons Instruments in pawn, and said, They would call in a little time and redeem them. I desired the People of the House to send me Word if they came again, but they did not come. As I was walking out the same Day. I heard that the 2 Men that robb'd me had been at Highgate. I went to the Two Wrestlers (a publick House) at Highgate to make enquiry.

The Boy was very positive that they were the Men. I went to Mr. Blackerby's and Mr. Chalk's, but neither of 'em were at Home. I knew no other Gentlemen in the Commission of the Peace who liv'd at Highgate, but being inform'd that Mr. Gough, a Justice of Peace, was at the Flask, I went thither with the Boy at Ten at Night. I desir'd the Justice to examine the Boy strictly about the Nature of an Oath, and I caution'd the Boy my self to be very careful how he swore, for that the Life of the Person he accused might depend upon his Evidence. From the Justice they went to search for the 2 Men, but could not find them. A Person who was in Company to'd me that he knew one of 'em, His Name, says he, is

Theobalds, says I, Why, he knows me, he has seen me often, sure he would never venture to rob a Man that he knew. When I consider'd this, I confess it stagger'd me a little, but I thought he might possibly not know me before he made the Attack, tho' he might before he left me; but when he had once begun, it was too late for him to retract. I said to the Person who told me this, Take the Boy with you, and drink a Mug of Ale with the Prisoner, and if the Boy, after being a considerable time in his Company, continues still positive that he is the Man, send me Word. He went with the Boy next Morning (being Sunday) and sent me Word that they had been with the Prisoner, at the Elephant and Castle, in Fleet-Lane, and that the Boy was positive that he was one of the Men; I went the same Day to see the Prisoner. He was then in the Fleet Prison. Mr. Ewell the Keeper, brought him into the Warden's Room, and the Boy was with us. I spoke to the Prisoner, and he said, It was very hard that he should be charged with robbing me, for as he was an Attorney of the Common-Pleas, he might be struck off the Rolls upon such a Report. I told him, I did not charge him, and if he was an innocent Man, there was no doubt but his Reputation would be clear'd. That I had been robb'd by 2 Men, was certain; but that I was in such a surprise when it was done, that I could not take upon me to say that he was one of them ; but that one of them was very like him. I call'd the Boy aside, and ask'd him, if he was still certain that the Prisoner was one of the Men; the Boy then did say, that the Prisoner was prodigious like one of the Men, but that he could not be very positive; upon which the Prisoner was discharg'd. Next Day (or on Tuesday, I forget which) in my way to Finchly, I stopp'd at the two Wrestlers, to speak with Mr. King, he told me, he wonder'd the Boy was not positive to the Prisoner when he saw him in the Warden's Room, for he had been positive ever since. Prisoner. Mr. Matthews has known me several Years, he has taken hundreds of Pounds of my Money, and - Mr. Matthews. Not hundreds of Shillings. Prisoner. And it's very unaccountable to imagine, that I would ever attempt to rob a Man that knew me so well. It was observ'd before Mr. Blackerby, that one of the Men's Hats were slapp'd when the Robbery was committed Mr. Matthews. I think their Hats were both cock'd. Prisoner.

The other was a short Man, in a dark Wig or dark Hair, and in a Coat of the same Colour as his Companion; they went away towards a Wood, and the short Man had a Pistol and a Watch in his Hand.

            . On the 13th of August, in the Evening, as I was coming from Finchly, towards Highgate, 2 Men past me a little below (that is, from hence, a little below Highgate. ) The Prisoner was one of those Men. They went forward, and I met a young Man of my Acquaintance, who was going into Yorkshire. I stood talking with him, and while we were in Discourse, I saw the same two Men go up to a Chaise, and saw the Chaise stop. The Chaise was then, I believe, about 300 Yards distant from where I stood; the 2 Men were about half a quarter of an Hour in going to it, after they past us. We did not think any thing of a Robbery, for if I had, we should have gone after them. I saw no other Man but those two in the Road betwixt the Chaise and us.

When he came back, he told me, that he and a Girl had seen two Men rob a Chaise at the Bottom of the Hill. That the shortest of the two had a Pistol, and took away the Gentleman's Watch, and then one of them bid the Chaise drive on. That they both came up the Bank; the tallest came to him, and the other went towards the Wood. The tallest bid him not say any thing: He asked the tallest for something to drink. The tallest called to the shortest who was going over the Gate, and asked him if he had any Halfpence. The shortest said, Come along; the tallest told him - Court. Told who? King- Told the Boy that he should be back again in a Day or two, and then he would give him something. Next Day, being Saturday, about 6 in the Afternoon, the Boy told me, that about 2 Hours before, he had seen the same two Men sitting upon a Bench, at the Taylors-Arms Door. Mr. Smith, the Breeches-maker, having heard of it, came to my House, and while we were talking about it, Mr. Matthews came in, and after some Discourse, he asked the Boy if he was very sure that the two Men he had seen at the Alehouse-Door, were the Men that committed the Robbery?

               <p>Mr. Matthews. Pray, my Lord, ask this Witness what Dress the Prisoner was in, when he saw him in the Fleet? Court. Do you remember what Dress the Prisoner was in at that Time? King. He was in a Black Coat, open-breasted, and Grey Stockings. He said he had worn that Livery ever since he had lived in the Fleet, which was 11 Months. That's well for you, says I, for the Men that did the Robbery, were both in White Stockings.</p>

            . I was at the Two Wrestlers when the Boy came in, and said he had seen two Men rob a Chaise; that they were both in dark Grey Cloaths, one a tall, and the other a short Man. The tall Man (says he) held the Horse, while the short Man, with a Pistol in one Hand, took away the Gentleman's Watch, and held it up by the Chain thus, to look at it. And as soon as they had left the Chaise, the tall Man came up to me, and bid me say nothing. I asked him for something to drink; he said, he had no Half-pence, and called to the other Man, and asked him, if he had any. The other Man bid him come along; and then the tall Man told me, he would call in a Day or two, and give me something. Next Day, between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, the Boy told me, that the same two Men were sitting upon Morgan's Bench; Morgan kept the Taylors-Arms. I went and look'd at 'em; the Prisoner was one, and the other was a little Man that I did not know. Court. Are you sure that the Prisoner was one of them? Smith. Yes, I have known him these 7 Years. Court. What Cloaths had he on then? Smith. He was in a Black Coat. I went next Day (which was Sunday) with the Boy to see the Prisoner in the Fleet. The Boy was then very positive; and he came to me on Horse-back on Monday Morning, and said he would swear to the Prisoner. Court. What Character has the Boy? Smith. A civil sober Lad as most in the Parish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I allow that I was at the Taylors-Arms at the Time you speak of, and I shall prove what Business I had there, and who was with me. Do you know the Man that was with me? Smith. No. Court. Had you any Talk with Mr. Odell about the Robbery? Smith. Yes: It was some Time (perhaps a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190021"></xptr> Fortnight) after the Fact, and says he, ''I '' know the Man that robbed the Chaise very '' well, and I would have gone with you to '' have taken him, if you had given me Notice.</p>

I had been at the Pot-house (Mr. Jones's) to buy some pots, and going up the Causey, I saw the Gentleman and his Spouse in a Chaise, coming down the Right-hand Way, and I went up the Left-hand Way, and a Boy and a Girl called to me, and said the Chaise was robb'd. I believe I was about 2 Stones throw off when it was done. When the Boy and Girl came up to me, I saw 2 Men go into the Wood, but I can't be positive the Prisoner was one of them, for I only saw their Backs.

               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday I had a Habeas Corpus for Mr. Morgan, and went with it to his House at the Taylors Arms at Highgate, and sat publickly at the Door all the Afternoon. On Sunday Morning I was call'd out of my Bed, to go to Mr. Jones's at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet-Lane; I was detain'd a Prisoner till Five in the Afternoon, and then might have been discharged, because Mr. Matthews could not swear to me, but I chose to lie a Mouth longer to shew my Innocence. I afterwards brought an Affidavit of a Conspiracy against me, by the 2 Men that took me up, and when it was read before Mr. Justice Fortescue, he granted me an Order to hold them to Bail, and this was the Occasion of my being taken up a 2d time. I shall prove where I was when the Robbery was committed.</p>

On Friday the 13th of August, the Prisoner lay a-Bed till 11 a Clock, and when he came down he asked if Atron Polack, the Jew, had been there. At one a Clock Mr. Polack came in, and was to have gone to Highgate with the Prisoner. But a Woman called Blackaway, and he came again about 3, and staid till between 10 and 11 at Night. Mr. Fletcher came in at 3, and staid till 5. At 6 Mr Gale and Mr. Curtis came in, and staid till 11. We supp'd together. We had Bacon and Greens for Supper; and the Prisoner was not out of my Company (except when I went to draw Drink) from 11 in the Morning till 12 at Night. I know 'twas on a Friday, because the Prisoner was taken up on the Sunday following: For on Sunday a Man came from Mr. Jones's, and said 2 Gentlemen wanted the Prisoner to fill up some Writings. The Prisoner went, and as soon as he came back, he said he had been taken up for the Highway. He was carried before Justice Billevs, and then committed to the Fleet Prison.</p>

About 3 Months ago, at his Request, I attended him to Mr. Justice Fortescue's, to obtain an Order to hold Jones and Ramsey (the 2 Persons who took him up) to Bail, and upon reading his Affidavit, an Order was granted to bind 'em in 40l. each.</p>

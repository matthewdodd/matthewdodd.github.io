I reside at No. 1, Northumberland-grove, Tottenham, and have a contract with the New River Company, for the supply of washed gravel—we call it filtering material—I had a large quantity of it on my wharf, at Tottenham, about the middle of Feb.—John Hall, of Camden<lb></lb>town, was employed to cart the gravel from the wharf to Stoke Newington—I have seen eight or ten loads of washed gravel on the premises of Mr. Chartress, a florist, of Hanger-lane, Tottenham—I am not present when the gravel is raised, I have servants there to do it—I superintend the working—it is a peculiar kind of gravel, it is raised at Ware Park, and when it comes to Tottenham I have a process there to sift and sort it into seven different sizes, by one process—we call it screened gravel, and when done it is an unusual kind of gravel, to which I can speak—the gravel found on the premises of Mr. Chartress is the same kind as that on my wharf, and I believe it to be part of what was lying there—I have a sample of it here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—looking at this, I can say that it is of the same appearance as that on my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a florist, of Hanger-lane, Tottenham. My place of business is in the City—about seven weeks ago, Chalkley came to my house, and sent a message in by my servant when I was at breakfast—I went out, and spoke to him, and he said that he knew a man who had got some rough stuff to sell—I said, "What is the price?"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load"—I said, "A single load or a double load?"—he said, "A double horse load"—I should imagine from the amount I paid him, (it was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), that I purchased ten loads of him—I saw one load come to my premises, and did not like the appearance of it, it was too small, but I received some more—when I found that it was stolen, I gave directions to my men, and declined to take any more—Chalkley is the man whom I paid for it: I never saw the other person—I leave early in the morning—I saw the gravel on my premises—this is the same kind—it appears to me to be something like it—five distinct samples are on my premises.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon being recalled did you not say, "The document I left on the. 21st was under the seal of the Court, and I believe it to have been a true copy of the adjudication of bankruptcy"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe, as you refresh my recollection, that I referred to the proceedings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that even if all the notes had been satisfactorily traced, no offence would have been proved within the jurisdiction of this Court; in order to constitute the present offence, it must be shown that they embezzled the notes in question after being adjudged bankrupts; in this the evidence failed, for it appeared that the adjudication was on the</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st, and before that, viz., on the</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th, the prisoners were abroad; he further contended, on the part of Davidson, that although he was civilly responsible far for the acts of his partner, he was not criminally so, and that the evidence affecting him was not sufficient to go to the Jury</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

BALLAMTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, urged that although the embezzlement of the notes after adjudication could not be proved, yet the proceeds of those notes being, strictly speaking, the property of the assignees, the appropriation of the proceeds, in whatever coin, would be an embezzlement on the part of the bankrupts; and he should apply to the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">to amend the indictment to meet that state of things, it being a mere point of form, and not of sub<lb></lb>stance</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">suggested that this could not be done, as in Beg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Bond it was held that some definite coin must be fixed upon</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did not consider it was necessary in this case; but it would be quite sufficient to allege that certain foreign money was embezzled, to wit, money of France or Germany, of the value of so much</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion this would be an amendment of something material to the merits of the case,' and therefore it could not be made</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that no offence had been committed in this country; the whole offence was committed abroad; there was no knowing at what time the notes were changed; they might have been changed before the adjudication; and, if so, they would have been lawfully changed, and no offence would be committed; but there was reasonable evidence to show that, if changed at all, they were changed for goods and chattels, that was to say, Belgian, French, or German money; and when that may hate been, there was no evidence before the Court</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion; if what was proved to have been done abroad had been done in this country, the crime would have been completed at once, and it would not have been necessary for the prosecution to give any evidence of non-accounting; the case would have been sufficient without that; the accounting would only have tome, on the part of the prisoners, as a defence, to show, co-animo, that the acts were done abroad; independent of that, the acts carried their own intention with them; where an act was incomplete or indifferent in itself, it might be necessary afterwards to complete the case by showing a non-accounting, but where the case was complete in itself, the non-accounting after-wards could make no difference</hi>. Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was further of opinion that it was exceedingly doubtful whether the spending of money from day to day, not amounting in any one turn to</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">could be put together so us to form an aggregate amount: he was strongly of opinion it could not; and there again occurred the same difficulty, viz., that it was done abroad</hi>.)</p>

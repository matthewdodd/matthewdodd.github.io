               <p>I drive a hackney coach, I was taken from Bishopsgate-street, between one and two in the morning, by a couple of young men, I asked them where they wanted to be drove to; they said they wanted to go but a very little way; one got into the coach, and the other got on the box, he on the box told me to drive fast to Holywell Mount, and then to St. Giles's; after I drove him to Holywell Mount, I asked him whether he was going to put any thing into the coach or no; he said yes, they were going to put some parcels into the coach; I told them it was a very unseasonable hour to put property into the coach, and that nothing should be put into the coach that night, for there had been instances of people putting smuggled goods into a coach, and then seizing on the coach and horses; they declared it was nothing of that kind; and in a little while I let them put it into the coach; after they had put it in the coach, one got on the box, and the other into the coach again; I asked them where they chose to be drove to; one of them never left the coach, while the other fetched two bags and put them into the coach, he was not gone above a minute or two; where they fetched the bags from I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the men by sight? - I cannot positively say I do, for we hackney coachmen carry all kinds of people, and I had been drinking that night, and I cannot say that these are the men, I believe they are the men, but I cannot swear positively to them, they ordered me to drive them to Conduit-street, I knew of no such street, but I was rather frightened with the men, and I told them I would drive them there, they told me to drive as fast as I could; when I got to Holborn they told me to stop, and they broke the glass of the coach; they said they were very sorry, and asked me if I would not have something to drink; I suspected it was smuggled goods, I persuaded them to stop at a house that I use; but they told me to drive to the Old Pilgrim in Holborn, which is a house that I never use; there they took the things out of the coach, then they asked me the damage of the glass, and I told them half a crown; they asked me what my fare was, I told them two shillings; they said, here is five shillings for you; in the mean while they ordered a pot of hot, I went into the house, it was very full of company, I stopped about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030008"></xptr>minutes, and I came home and went to bed, and two of these gentlemen here came down to me; they had taken the number of the coach at the Pilgrim.</p>

               <p>Court to Bailey. How late did the prisoners stay at your house? - I cannot say what time; from between two and three, to seven; it was light when they went away.</p>

               <p>Who were the men that came in the coach? - I did not see them come out of the coach, but it was the tallest of the prisoners that came in and ordered the pot of hot, there were four or five coaches there besides, the coach could not come close to the door; the other man gave me the crow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There were several coaches at the door? - Two or three besides, I did not see any body get out of the coach, there were four or five coachmen in the house besides; it is a night-house, a watering-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you carried the first pot of hot to the door, was any body in the coach at that time? - They were not in the coach, they were standing by the side of the coach, and the coachman with them.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I searched the prisoners, and on the prisoner Cookson I found this flint and steel in his pocket; I went back to the house, and Bailey gave me an iron crow and cutlass, which he said he received from one of the prisoners; in one of the bags I found this iron crow, which I have had in my custody ever since; and that is all I know.</p>

Sutherland on it; the handkerchief was bloody, we enquired for the name of Sutherland, we thought the person's name that was robbed was Sutherland, but it was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bailey. You said you was the waiter at this public-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What kind of a bag was it that they brought the things in? - They seemed to me to be two sacks of things, they were carried towards the house as far as the door, I saw them carried as I stood feeding my horses.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these things, and for whether you can swear to the property? - Here is the die which I am going to produce to your lordship, which this blue was made from; this dye has a stamp upon it, but I suppose it is so defaced now there is no seeing; this is made from this dye, and it is marked with my own initials, from that I can swear to its being my own property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any impression on that blue? - There is a little, but it is almost defaced now; this trial was put off last sessions, on account of the illness of the prisoners; here is a paper of starch which was found on the floor, which I marked with the same hand-writing, which corresponds with those that are taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Who wrote it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You are, I understand, a very capital manufacturer? - Ah! there is no occasion to ask whether I am a very capital manufacturer or not, the gentlemen of the Jury will judge between us; I make blue, that is what you wish me to answer, I do not wish to have that put upon me, that I do not make; I am not a very capital manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any thing of a tinder-box any where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - Upon an iron in the room where the men seal up those papers of lamp-black.</p>
               <p>Was that tinder-box yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the flint and steel with it when you found it? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>There is nothing else that you can swear to, but that blue from your stamp, and that paper which was in your mill-room? - No.</p>
               <p>It is Stonard's starch, he is a capital manufacturer of starch? - Yes he it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER COOKSON.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DAVIS.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cookson called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and carry on business in Tudor-street, Blackfriars. Fox was my apprentice, and Beattie was my warehouseman, and Webb had been in my service till within a short time of this period—on the 19th of July, during Beattie's absence, I went into the warehouse, and found the type of a baker's bill—I could see by the face of it that it had been stereotyped on my premises—Beattie was not a printer—I made no mention of what I discovered, but as there had been a number of sheets belonging to a dictionary missed, I asked Beattie whether he had found them—he said he had not—I told him he must make it his business of find them, as his character depended upon it—he did not say that he intended to leave my service, but he said he did not care, or some<lb></lb>thing of that kind—he left the place, and I never saw him afterwards till last Monday, when he was apprehended at a public-house in Wych-street—there was a week's wages due to him all but one day—in consequence of his leaving, I made further inquiries, and from what I heard I obtained a search-warrant, and searched a penny theatre, in a turning out of the New-Cut—the officer went there with me, and behind the theatre we found some materials for printing—the officer took what I pointed out as my property—we found these leads, these quadrats, and this galley, which I know particularly well—it has been in my possession many years, and is one I worked upon myself when I was learning the business—this type of the job which was found at the warehouse I identify as mine—I after<lb></lb>wards went with the officer to a shop in Brunswick-street—I stood by while the officer took up a drain under a water-butt in the yard at the back of the house, where we found this type, these blocks, and some others—I have no doubt of their being stereotyped from this type—I had never permitted Beattie to take any type or stereotype from my premises—I was not aware that he was in business for himself, or that he was in partnership with Webb—I knew Webb was in business—Webb was taken at the time these were found—the officer said to him, "Now you must go with me to the Magistrate, "and I applied for a warrant for Beattie.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not proceed to say that you would not consent to that, after it had been suggested, because you had no other mode of getting rid of your apprentice, <hi rend="smallCaps">FOX</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of it—I never said any thing of the kind—all my observations were with a view of saving the apprentice—I did not say I would not receive remuneration for the use of my goods—the Magistrate did not say he had considerable doubts about this matter—he treated it as a very gross case—he admitted the parties to bail—he told me he thought the apprehension of Beattie was essential to the case, and he adjourned the case to try to get him.</p>

I was applied to, in July, to go with a warrant to search Mr. Hamilton's premises, which are used as the Penny Theatre, in the Lower Marsh, Lambeth (Fox was not then in custody)—I searched the shed where they hold the theatre, and Mr. Davidson found this galley, and leads, and other things—I received further information, and went there again—I found, under the stage, this bundle of type, in this handkerchief—I then went to Webb's premises, in Bruns<lb></lb>wick-street—I saw Webb there—we went into the yard, and I opened a drain under the water-butt, where I found these eight blocks, which have been spoken of by the prosecutor—I made a further search, and took Webb into custody—Mr. Davidson, who was with me, found a small imprint on the printing-press at Webb's—I told Webb I should be obliged to take him to Union Hall; and on the way there he said, "As to the blocks, they</p>

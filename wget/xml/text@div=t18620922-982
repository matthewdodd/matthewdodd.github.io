I am in the service of Dr. Parfitt, 24A, Pall Mall—on Saturday morning, 2d August, a man rang the visitors' bell, and left a hamper with me, directed "Dr. Parfitt, with care"—I heard a noise, and carried it to the consulting room—it was opened in my presence, and I found in it a living child—it appeared in a dying state—the doctor and I did all we could to restore it, and gave it a warm bath—I subsequently carried it to St James's Workhouse, and left it in the hands of the authori<lb></lb>ties—it was delivered to me at 10 o'clock in the morning, and I left it at the workhouse about a quarter past 11.</p>

On, 2d August, I was sent for to Dr. Parfitt's—a male child was given into my charge, and I conveyed it to the workhouse, and gave it to the authorities—on Saturday, 16th August, about a quarter past 7 o'clock, I was sent for to St James's Workhouse—I saw the prisoner there, and told her I was informed that she came to give some information as to who the mother of the child was—she said that the mother had been living with her at 18, Canon-street, Commercial-road,</p>

I am a nurse at the Strand Union workhouse—on 22d June, the prisoner was delivered of a male child there—she left on 12th July—it was called James Marsh—I afterwards went to recognise her at the House of Detention, and asked her what made her serve her baby so—I said, "You know where you came to in your first trouble, and you knew where to come to again"—she said that her brother-in-law persuaded her to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 41, Great Marlborough-street—I was called to see the child—it was in a dying, sinking state—it died twelve hours afterwards—I made a post-mortem examination—it appeared to be about two months old—the brain was congested, but no other organ had anything the matter with it—I cannot at all account for the cause of death—there was no external violence, nor any trace of poison, or anything that would give a direct ground to form an opinion—if a child of tender age was put in a hamper and carried about town, I think that might conduce to its death; it would be a very dangerous proceeding—that would cause pros<lb></lb>tration and exhaustion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that the child's father was in Canada with his regiment, that it was sickly from its birth, and the doctor ordered her to suckle it, but she could not do so, as she was sinking for want of common necessaries, and therefore sent it to Dr. Parfitt, hearing that he was a distant relation of her mother's.</hi>

               <p>I was in the publick-house when the prosecutor came in for some beer; she came back again, and said she had lost her cloak. I went with the prisoner to the Justice's; she confessed that she had taken the cloak; and she said there was a hat and a bit of dark linen in the box when she took it out; she said she pawned it for five shillings, for her mother. The justice sent for the prisoner's mother, but the mother would not come to the justice's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Shatwell, a weaver, who lives in Windmill-row, Chester. I was present at the prisoner's marriage with Mary Whitaker, my sister, about twenty-five years ago, at Prestbury church, Cheshire—he went by the name of William Potter—they lived together about twelve years—I saw my sister on Sunday night last—she was alive—the prisoner left her about thirteen years since, and said he came up to London—she never heard any more of him.</p>

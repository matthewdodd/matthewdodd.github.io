On Tuesday, the 6th of September, his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140015"></xptr>duty was to be at my shop. I stood a distance from the shop; the prisoner was then in the act of locking the door up; as he generally did of an evening. He then came up to me; I observed something bulky at the side of his coat, rather more than of an ordinary size; I asked him what he had got there; he replied, nothing. I said, I must see. I took out of his pocket ten or twelve pounds of lead. I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself; he begged of me to forgive him, and he would come to work in the morning; he supplicated very strong for mercy. I sent for an officer, and had him taken to the Compter. That night I went to his lodgings with an officer. There I found lead and solder; I cannot charge the prisoner with that. Upon examining the lead the prisoner took, one piece was stamped with a particular mark; I knew it to be mine.</p>

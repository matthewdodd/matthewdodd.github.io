            . I am a gardener. On Sunday the 27th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was going out of my own ground, across Bow-lane; I saw a labourer take a hod of bricks from Mr. Lee's building, I watched to see where he took these bricks to; presently after I saw a wheelbarrow loaded with bricks, so hard the labourer could hardly wheel it; when he came to a bank the prisoner laid hold it, and he and the other man got it over; they took them to the same place were they took the hod to, into Bow-lane; the prisoner was building a chimney there.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Could you swear to the loss of the bricks. - A. I have missed a heavy load of bricks and mortar.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280051"></xptr>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work at Mr. Lee's building; I was a plaisterer in Mile End-road. As I was coming across I fell in with Mr. Lee, he said you are the man I was looking for, he says do you want a building job; I said yes. I worked half a day for Mr. Lee on the Saturday, he gave me half a crown at the public house. The next Saturday when I went to the pay table, the foreman came out and said my master could not pay me; I told him I had a job to do for a poor man that kept a cook's shop, and I meaned to get up early and get the job done; I said I have no money to buy stuff, I will take some stuff and settle for it with Mr. Lee. On Monday morning, when they came down to me, I was talking to a young woman; I said to them I shall go and settle with Mr. Lee for the stuff I had taken, and the remainder he might pay me the next Saturday night; I said to Mr. Lee, you owe me money and I will pay for the stuff.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Part of his story is all very well; I agreed with him to build these two houses for me. I found after he had been to work two days, he had done about fifteen shillings worth of work; we were obliged to take it down; I discharged him, I told him he would not suit me; I never gave him, nor any man leave to take any stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him any money. - A. No; I believe he owes me money.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, I work under Mr. Lee; this man asked me if I was paid, I said yes, he said then, I will go in and get paid; I think I said it will be of no use, Mr. Lee has no more money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I should take a little stuff and pay Mr. Lee for it.</p>

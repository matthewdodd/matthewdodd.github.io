I am the wife of Patrick Murphy, of 16, James-street I know the prisoner and his wife—she was in the habit of drinking dread<lb></lb>fully—on 6th March, at two o'clock in the afternoon, they came to my house and we went out for a walk—Mrs. Stretch absented herself from the company, but rejoined us at home after eleven at night—her husband had gone home with me and another female—my husband absented himself from the com<lb></lb>pany also—the prisoner was very tipsy—she and her husband had words together—I saw no blow, but I saw her bonnet and cap torn—she went out, and the door was locked to prevent her coming in again, she was so abusive—she was anxious to regain her cap—the prisoner was not abusive, but he was very excited—I ordered the door to be opened—the prosecutrix rushed in—the prisoner was then by the window, in my husband's arms—he was holding him, and examining his shoulder—the prisoner did not go towards her—she spoke to him, and continued abusing him—she was by the cupboard, about a yard and a half from where the prisoner stood—ray husband was holding him then—she said, "Oh!"—I said, "What is the matter with Elizabeth?"—she said, "I am stabbed"—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand—I saw blood on the floor, but not till she had run across the floor—the prisoner had no knife to my knowledge before she came into the room—he said he would cut his own throat—I saw his hand up to his neck when he was on the floor, and my husband had got hold of him—I took a knife from his hand then, but that was before the woman got into the room—I did not see the knife again till I saw it on the drawers after she ran out, close by where she stood up—there was blood on it—my husband put it into the drawer, and I gave it to the policeman—my husband never loosed the prisoner till the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little White Lion-street, Seven-dials, and am the prisoner's wife; we were married on 11th June. On the evening in question, we went to Murphy's—we all went out together—I separated from the party, and went to a public-house by myself—I remained there to the best of my belief two hours—I do not recollect having anything to drink till I came back—I then drank with a policeman; he treated me with a pint of porter—I had been drinking all the afternoon, we had been drinking three days—when I got back to Murphy's, it was eleven o'clock at night—my husband was there—I abused him very much indeed—I do not think he struck me, but in the scuffle my bonnet and cap were torn—the door was shut, and I was outside—I insisted on going in—I turned the handle, forced the door in, and got into the room—I do not recollect anything happening at all, but I went towaids the cup<lb></lb>board—I was very violent—my husband did not do anything to me—he was standing at the window, just as far from me as that lamp (<hi rend="italic">about three yards</hi>)—he never crossed the room—I told the policeman there was nothing the matter with me, and the doctor the same, but I had been drinking very freely—I did receive a slight wound—I told the doctor it was nothing at all, I was not frightened at a little drop of blood—I received the wound in the room <hi rend="italic">agin</hi> the cupboard-door—my husband was in the room, and Mrs. Murphy and her husband, and a little baby—on my oath I do not know how I got the wound—I recollect having the knife cutting some beef-steaks—the wound was in the thigh, and a very slight wound it was—I was in the hospital a fortnight all but a day, but it was not the wound caused me to stop there, but I had not got my clothes, they were gone to be washed—they only put a little bit of sticking-plaister on the wound—I asked the doctor to allow me to go home, and he would not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of James-street, Oxford-street. I found a policeman supporting the prosecutrix at my surgery-door—she appeared in a very exhausted state from loss of blood—blood was flowing from under her clothes—she was very violent, and said she would not allow me to examine at first—I afterwards examined, and found an incised wound, about three-quarters of an inch long, and two inches below the left groin, about a quarter of an inch deep, nearly upon the femoral artery—it was not particularly dangerous—this knife would have inflicted it—her under-clothing was saturated with blood.</p>

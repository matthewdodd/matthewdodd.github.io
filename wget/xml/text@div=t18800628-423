                  </hi>. In May last I was assistant to the prisoner, who carried on business as a baker at 7, Junction Koad, Holloway—I worked in the bakehouse—on Saturday, 22nd May, at 6 o'clock a.m., the prisoner came to me and said "Have you anything to drink?"—I said "No"—he said "Fetch me some, a half-quartern of gin," for which he gave me the</p>

               <p>money—I fetched it, and he drank it—about a quarter of an hour afterwards he sent me again for a half-quartern of gin, and live or ten minutes after that I again fetched another half-qunrtern, all of which he drank—on each occasion he gave me money for it, and I brought him change—at first he gave me sixpence—it came to twopence-halfpenny, I brought him the change—the second time he gave me a two-shilling piece, I brought him the change—the third time he gave me sixpence—when I returned the last time I saw a half-pint bottle on the table with more gin in it, and half of that I saw him drink also—I then went on with my work, and about five minutes after I looked into the parlour and saw the half-pint bottle lying on the table empty—the prisoner was there—he then ran upstairs and came down again and went across to Mr. Nice's shop—he shortly after came back into the shop and began throwing the bread about in a wild sort of manner—some customers came in, and he served them, some right and some wrong—this was about 6.45, and I went downstairs to my work—about 7.45 I was packing bread in the shop, and about eight, or five minutes past 8 I heard the report of a gun from the parlour door at the back part of the shop—I turned round and saw the prisoner with the gun to his shoulder—Mrs. Sweetland then ran through the shop into the street shouting "Murder!"—that was after the second shot had been fired—the first and second shots were instantaneous, one after the other, bang, bang—before I had time to get across the shop he fired two more shots in rapid succession, one after the other, bang, bang—he was then standing behind the counter—I did not notice in which direction the gun was pointed—he fired over the mistress's head—he then walked out through the shop on to the pavement and said "Where is there a policeman? where is there a policeman?"—then as I walked through the shop I saw the guns standing in the corner, near the parlour door, about as far as I could reach—two men came up who are witnesses, and took the prisoner away to Highgate—I went back into the shop, and then it was that I saw the deceased, Mr. Buckler, staggering in the road, and I saw him fall—I had not seen him that morning until then—he was a provision merchant, living at No. 2, opposite the prisoner—sometimes the prisoner would drink gin and some<lb></lb>times half a pint of beer in the morning between 6 and 7—on Friday, 21st, he went to Harpenden races—I did not see him that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I slept in the prisoner's house—on this Saturday morning he came down with nothing on but his shirt—I never saw him More like that—I thought his manner was strange, and he went to the trough and lifted the lid and fetched out a great handful of flour and threw into his mouth and began to eat it—when I returned with the haif-quartern of gin he had got some bags of flour half full, rolled up, not in the ordinary way—I did not see him fill them—I remember hearing that the prisoner met with an accident in April, 1879—I saw him brought home insensible, and he was put to bed—he was cut at the back of his head—he was laid up for about a week, and after I noticed that his temper was short, and if he Had a little drop to drink it used to take effect on him; it made him irri<lb></lb>table—I did not notice any want of memory or incoherence—I noticed that after the accident his manner was changed; if he was to go and have a little drop to driuk he would come home, and there was nothing ever right with him; that is what I mean by peculiarity of temper—he would quarrel at times with his wife, and I have heard his wife tell him about putting him</p>

               <p>into a lunatic asylum—he would talk to his wife and others in a wild gay at times; that was when he was under the influence of drink—when sober I saw strangeness of manner—I remember in October last his meeting with another accident in Camden Town—doctors attended him and bandaged his head; ice was applied to it—since that accident I have heard him complan of pains in his head, and he would sometimes forget what he had been doing, and stand and think a minute or two—that was when he was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been 12 months in his service the week before last Easter—when he was brought home in April, 1879, he was not sensible, he was not sober—I can't say whether he was drunk or not, he might have had a little drop to drink—of course when he was brought home like that you could not tell whether he was sober or not—a doctor attended him—I can't say what doctor it was—he afterwards attended to his business in the usual way—in October,1879, I saw him come home from Camden Town—he was not sober then—he drove the horse at a walk—I went to meet him—the stepson was driving him—I could not tell whether the prisoner was sober or not—he laid up for about a week then—he attended to his business as usual after that—all the time I have been with him he was at times in the habit of taking too much to drink—he had not been attending to his business every day during the week before this occurred—he had been out every day at races and pigeon shooting—I can't say whether he took his guns with him—I understood he had been pigeon shooting—on the Friday he was at Harpenden races—I can't say where he was on the Thursday—he has complained of pairs at the back of his head, holding his head—that was not when he had been drinking, when he had been sober—I can't say whether he had been drunk recently before—on the Saturday morning when he came down in his shirt he came right into the bakehouse—I was up at work, looking after the bread—we were putting one batch in the oven—ho said he wanted somthing to drink—we said we had got nothing—that was when he first sent me out to get some drink—he had nothing on but his shirt—he had just come downstairs—his bedroom was on the second floor—it was before he had the gin that he put his hands in the flour, and put it to his mouth—I am quite sure of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, Vorley Road, Holloway—I am a tram car driver—I have known the prisoner four or five years—I knew Mr. Buckler—on Saturday morning, 22nd May, I was in the Junction Road about 7.15; I was passing the prisoner's shop—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the road with Mr. Buckler, on the pavement in front of Mr. Buckler's door—the prisoner had on his usual everyday grey suit; his waistcoat was unbuttoned—he had his left hand on Mr. Buckler's collar—Buckler was standing leaning on his "long arm" that he puts his blind up with—the prisoner seemed in a very excited state having an altercation with him, throwing his right arm about—I did not distinctly hear what was said, being on the other side of the road—the prisoner then left Mr. Buckler and came across the road; I met him just on the edge of the kerb of his own shop—Mr. Buckler went inside his own shop—as the prisoner came to the kerb I said to him, "Sweetland, Sweetland, what, are you going mad? If you cause a disturbance like this you will get yourself into trouble, and get locked up"—he made no answer; he walked straight through his shop into the back parlour—his wife was in the shop behind the counter—there were several persons about the street standing at the corner of the lion—I did not notice any one in particular, only Mr. Buckler's son; he was standing close to his father at the time of the altercation—that was all I saw—I went on and did not see the prisoner again—later on in the same morning I heard that Mr. Buckler had been shot—the prisoner seemed very excited; I did not know whether he was sober; he stared at me vacantly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was when I spoke to him as he crossed the road when he left Mr. Buckler, when I said, "Sweetland, Sweetland, what is the matter, are you going mad?"—my attention was first attracted to him by seeing him have hold of Mr. Buckler's collar in an excited manner, and throwing his arm about—his manner was very unusual indeed, more than I should expect in a person merely suffering from drink—he had hold of Mr. Buckler with his left hand, and throwing the other about; waving it about—it was not merely brandishing it or threatening a person, but waving it about—as he crossed the road after leaving Mr. Buckler he was throwing his arms about and seemed in a very excited manner—Mr. Buckler</p>

I have been living with my late husband for about four years in the Junction Road—the prisoner and my husband were on speaking terms as far as I knew—on the Wednesday evening before this matter occurred I remember my husband going over to the prisoner's shop about 9.30—there was a disturbance there—I was putting my children to bed—I did not actually see my husband go over; I saw him when he came back, about 10 o'clock, and he told me when we were having supper that there had been such a scene—on the Friday night about 12 or a little after, when I was in bed, I was disturbed by a very loud knocking at the door—my husband went down at my request—I don't know who it was that was at the door—my husband came back after a little time—he told me that ho did not open the door—I afterwards again heard a knocking at the door—I did not look at the clock, and don't of my own knowledge know the time; I should think it was about break of day—we did not get up; it was Saturday, and I did not think it worth while to disturb my husband again—on the Saturday morning ho got up about the usual time and left me asleep—he usually got up to open the shop—I heard nothing unusual until I heard the report of the firearms—I was then in my bedroom, dressing; that is a front room—I sup<lb></lb>pose it was just about 8 o'clock as near as possible—I heard a very loud report of firearms; it was like a double report, one after the other, very loud—I went to the window and looked across the road—I kept my eyes fixed there, wondering what I should see, and I saw Mr. Sweetland walk deliberately out of his shop—he had a gun—I saw him level it and take a very deliberate side aim across to our shop, where my husband was standing—the gun was to his shoulder for some time, pointing slanting across the road to our shop—he was outside his shop—there is a flagstone that just forms a step to his own door, and he was just outside that—he took a deliberate aim; I could not believe he was shooting—he fired just the same as before, a double report—I could not see my husband then, because there is a blind to our house—the prisoner then went indoors—I was so agitated that I could not say whether he took the gun with him—I then heard my son calling to say that his father was shot—I at once ran downstairs and saw him being carried into the shop—he was frightfully injured—a doctor was sent for, and my husband died at 2 o'clock on the following Monday afternoon—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—my husband had compounded with his creditors and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound two years ago last April</p>

I am the prisoner's stepson—Mrs. Sweetland is my mother—I shall be 14 years old on 19th July—I was living with the prisoner and my mother at the baker's shop in the Junction Road—I was at home on the Wednesday evening before this occurred—I should say the prisoner was drunk that night—he had been out during the day—he said he had been to Whetstone, shooting—he came home drunk about 8.30. or 8.45—after he came home he was noisy inside, and a crowd came, and Mr. Buckler came and put up the shutters—I helped him-—I handed the shutters to him and he put them up for me—I could not tell whether Gay was at home or whether he was gone to bed; he was not present—the place was shut up and the prisoner remained in the house, but he went out afterwards—I did not go out with him—on the Friday night I was at home when he came home, about 10.30—he was very excited—he had told me in the morning where he was going, and that was where he had been, to Harpenden races—when I went to bed that night I left him up and indoors—he was very excited when he came home; he seemed as if he did not know exactly what he was about; he was in such a state I could not say whether he had been drinking or whether there was anything the matter with his head; but he was very excited, running on about his horse and the races—he had been with his own horse to the races, driving—he had been driving very fast to all appearance, from the state the mare was in—I knew that he had two double-barrelled guns, breech-loaders—he usually kept them in a recess on the stairs, in a cupboard that was fitted up for harness specially; the guns were generally kept there—I could not say when I had last seen them there; the cupboard is upstairs on the first floor—they were not a ways kept there, sometimes he has left them in the parlour sometimes at the bottom of the stairs, sometimes in the kitchen—the last time I saw them they were in the parlour, standing in the corner of the room; that was on the Thursday to the best of my recollection—he had not been out shooting that day—I don't remember seeing them on the Friday—on Saturday morning, 22nd, I saw the prisoner in his shop, standing at the door, with his hands behind him; I had not been up long; that was when I first saw him—the shop was open then and he was dressed as usual—I was standing behind the counter; he went into the parlour and returned with a gun in his hand, put it up to his shoulder, and fired two shots in rapid succession, instantaneously, bang, bang—he fired out of the door in the direction across the road, as it looked to me—he had the gun to his shoulder in the ordinary way—my mother ran out when she saw the gun, she is frightened at firearms—I don't recollect her calling out—she ran out of the shop into the street—I followed her after he had fired—when I got outside I heard two more shots fired—I had then got very near two doors off I should think, but I was confused, I don't exactly remember—my mother was away from the shop in front of me, a little lower down the Junction Road, that would be to the left—I then turned round and saw the deceased stagger and fall; he was a little way off the pavement, near his shop, in front of it—I heard the prisoner say something about police or policemen; it sounded like that; I very in<lb></lb>distinctly heard it—I turned round to see where he was aid two men</p>

               <p>were taking him across the road towards the Highgate Station—that was all I saw—I don't know where the prisoner usually kept his cartridges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Besides my mother and myself, there were living in the house my two sisters, and one child of the prisoner's, hardly three years old yet—the prisoner had been in my father's service as manager—he has been married to my mother about three years—I remember his losing some money after his marriage; that was in a flour speculation, in baying flour; he lost something over 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to that time he had been a quiet, steady man; that loss seemed to affect him very much; his habits changed, he took to drink after that—I should think he had been married about eighteen months when he had that loss—we were all on good and affectionate terms with him—I remember a blow that he had on his head in April, 1879—I was not with him at the time—I went down the Junction Road to meet him from his rounds, and saw him coming up the road, driving at a very furious rate, and when I came back my little sister met me and said my father was dead; he had been run over—he was indoors when I returned home, on the sofa, unconscious; ice was applied to his head—he was not able to attend to his business for some few days—he had a second accident in the October following—I was with him on that occasion; he was driving—it happened in Camden Town, opposite the Cobden statue; the mare fell down on her knees and he was thrown out—my back was to him and I could not see how he fell, but when he got up his head was bleeding very badly from the back—I was not thrown out, I was strapped in, and my little brother—my mother was in front; she had one of her ribs broken, and a bad place at the side of the face—my father was taken into Dr. Claremont's, exactly where he fell—since the first accident I have frequently heard him complain of pains at the back of his head, and worse since the last one, and he has been very much more irritable—he would show that irritability when sober; he would be very impatient—when he was standing looking at anything he was continually twitching his fingers or rubbing his nose—that nervous habit was since the accidents; I had never seen him do it before—his memory was defective; he would forget things soon after having done them—he was on good terms with Mr. Buckler—as far as I know there had been no quarrel whatever between them—he dealt there; he had all his things there till Mr. Nice opened his shop; he is a cheese<lb></lb>monger close by, and was a customer, and of course the prisoner had to "serve all round alike," as the saying is; and he then dealt with both—I have heard him speak about Mr. Buckler watching him; he was always under the delusion that Mr. Buckler was watching him—I had not heard him say anything about him previous to the accidents, but since that very frequently—our parlour-door opens into the shop; it is partly glass and partly wood—the upper part is glass and has a wire blind—it is not straight in front of the shop-door; it is a little to the right—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a plan of it—when you are outside the shop you can't see through the wire blind into the parlour; you can from the inside see out into the street—when my father spoke about Mr. Buckler watching him he used to hang things on the blind, anything that came to his hand; newspapers, coats, anything that came to his hand first, and say that Buckler was watching him, and he would prevent it by putting his coat over it—we used to say it was silly of him and ridiculous, but he insisted on doing it—I saw him the</p>

               <p>night he returned from Harpenden—I helped him put the horse away and then I went to bed—he was in a very excited state; he appeared to have been drinking, from the excited state he was in—there was hardly half a minute between the first two shots and the last two—I got up about 20 minutes to 8 that morning—I had not seen the prisoner before that, that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the first accident he laid up for a few days before he was able to attend to business; he got dressed, but did not attend to business—after that he attended to business, but sometimes the other man would have to do it for him, for he would come over queer and go to bed—he never attended much in the shop, only in the bakehouse—sometimes he would say he could not do it—sometimes he used to take too much to drink, but sometimes he would come over like that when he had not been drink<lb></lb>ing—he drank spirits; sometimes one thing, sometimes another—after the second accident, in October, he laid up for about four days I think—he did not get about exactly as usual, but he attended to his business in the bake-house—he was rather fond of going out to pigeon shooting and race—he very often came home the worse for drink—I think he was the worse for drink on the occasion of the first accident, but on the second moderately so—I could not swear he was drunk and I could not the other way; he had been drinking a little—he has been putting things up against the blind for some time—he did it to prevent people seeing in, as he thought, but they could not see in: they could in the evening if there was a light inside, but he used to do it in the daytime as well—they could see over the top of the blind, but I don't think they could see through it at night even If there was a light inside—he was sometimes sober when he did this, and some<lb></lb>times not; he would do it at any time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live at 13, Whittington Grove, Holloway—on Saturday morning, 22nd May, about a quarter past 8, I was in the Junction Road, and saw the prisoner at his shop door—he had a gun in his hand up to his shoulder—I had heard two reports about 20 seconds before then—I heard him say, "Where is he? Where is he?"—he then fired two shots across the road in the direction of Mr. Buckler's shop—the prisoner was just at his door at the time he fired; between the two door, posts—as soon as I heard the reports I looked across the road and saw Mr. Buckler stagger and fall—I was on the same side as Mr. Buckler and close up against him when he fell; he was in front of his shop and he fell just by the kerb—I went to fetch a doctor—I saw two men taking the prisoner away up Highgate Hill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was after I heard two shots fired that I first saw the prisoner—I did not see the deceased until after ail four shots were fired—he was on the pavement when I got up to him; he was in the centre of the pavement staggering about; he staggered off the pavement and fell down on the side in the gutter—the prisoner called out "Where is he? where is he?" in a loud tone of voice, and fired directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Grovedale Road, Upper Holloway, and am by trade a joiner—on the morning of Saturday, 22nd May, about 5 minutes past 8, I was in the Lion public-house, at the corner of the Holloway Broad and Junction Road—it is next door but two to the prisoner's—while I was in there I heard two shots fired, one immediately after the other—I immediately ran out and looked all round—I saw smoke coming from the prisoner's shop-door—as I was going towards it the prisoner walked out of his shop door with a gun in his hand up to his shoulder; he stepped just off the step and fired twice immediately without taking the gun from his shoulder—it was pointed across the road—I turned my back when I heard the third shot, and when I turned round the prisoner had gone into his shop—I walked towards his shop and met him on the doorstep coming out; no had put down the gun—I said "Sweetland, what have you done?"—(I knew him by sight)—he said "I have done it, and I want a policeman"—I said "There is not one here; you must come with me"—he said "I will"—I turned round and saw Sims standing outside the house, and I said "Charley, you had better come with me"—I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar and eleven, and Sims laid hold of his arm, and we took him to the police-station—on the way the prisoner said "I saw him (meaning Buckler) come to the door with a knife in his hand, and I thought I would have first chance; he has done me harm; he has spoken against me, but I have never been so bad as him, for I never had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to pay"—that was all that I know—he said to Sims "I have something in my pocket; I will give them to you, Charley," and he pulled out four bags of flour, and said "I meant them for him"—they were four half-quartern paper bags, with about a pound of flour in each—I asked him whether he had anything else; he said "Yes, I have two cartridges; I will give them to you"—he gave them to Sims, and Sims passed them to me—he said "You need not be afraid; I won't hurt you"—nothing further passed—we took him to the police-station and charged him with firing off a gun in the public streets—the four bags of flour were given to the police at the station, also the two cartridges; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the Cartridges; one has been since opened in my presence, and I saw the inspector take out some shot—it was in the same state as the other one is now; the other has not been interfered with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first I saw of the prisoner was when he came out after firing two shots; it might be a minute or a minute and a half, as near as I can say, between hearing the first shot fired and the last—it sounded like random firing; in fact I was afraid he would shoot me—the prisoner's appearance struck me as wild; he appeared to me like a man not knowing what he was doing; that was the impression it produced on my mind when I saw him firing—the bags had flour merely put in and doubled up anyhow—he made no resistance to going with us to the station; he wished to give himself up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Lion—on Saturday morning, 22nd May, I was there at work in the back; I heard some shots fired; I heard one first, and I ran out—I heard the four shots fired—I saw Lack; he had got hold of Sweetland by the collar on the right aide—I went and assisted him, and took him by the left cuff; the first thing I heard him say as he went along was "I have kissed my dear babe before I left," or something to that effect, and in going a little farther up the hill I fancied he had got something in his breast-pocket, and I said "Hare you a revolver in your pocket, Sweetland?" because I had known him some time—he said "No, I have not, Charlie; I will give you all I have," and he gave me four small bags with a portion of flour in each; I should say about a pound and a half altogether, or it might be two pounds—he pulled them from the back part of hit pocket—he said he had got them to throw at him to aggravate him—I then said "What have you here?" that was in his right-hand waistcoat pocket—he said "Two cartridge?"—I said "Give them to me"—he took them from his right-hand waist<lb></lb>coat pocket, and placed them on my hand, and I passed them to Lack—the prisoner said "I have done what I meant to do, and I don't care if I swing for it"—that was after I had handed the cartridges to Lack—I said "Hold your tongue, hold your tongue"—after he had given me the bags, he said "Here is a letter I wish to be carried to home"—I said "You had better put it in your pocket, and give it up at the station-house"—he put it in his pocket, and he had it in his waistcoat pocket in the station-house—he also said "He has done me an injury, and I have not done the dirty action that he has done, to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound"—that remark about the swinging was mentioned three different times during the transit up to the station—he appeared to be rather excited—he appeared like a man that had been drinking the night before—he was able to walk steadily, as well as I could—I think he appeared to under<lb></lb>stand what he was doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the first time I have given evidence—I did not give evidence before the Coroner, or before the Magistrate—Lack accompanied me and the prisoner to the station; he was with us all the time—I made a communication to the Solicitor to the Treasury—I only saw him once—I gave a little abstract of my evidence; I wrote it down in my own hand in pencil; I only wrote it once—I did not gave it to any one; I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I wrote this on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, the day after, the 23rd—I have had it in my possession ever since—in this piece of paper I communicated all I recollected as near as I possibly could—I saw the Solicitor to the Treasury on the 7th June—that was the first and only time—I did not see the Solicitor, merely the Clerk—I road to him from my paper; I neither added to it or diminished from it—what I have said to-day is precisely what is on that paper—I do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280053"></xptr>
               <p>not say that I put down everything—I can't say why I did not put down that the prisoner said "I have not done the dirty action he has done, and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound"—perhaps it is omitted, but I am sure I have spoken he truth. (<hi rend="italic">The memorandum was read as follows</hi>:—"Between 8 and 8.15, Saturday, 22nd May, I heard two reports, I ran from my work, before I got to the door I heard two more. I looked out, and saw Mr. Bnckler rolling in the road, about eight feet from the pavement. Mr. Lack called me to his assistance; he then had him on the right side collar. I took the prisoner by the cuff, and said, 'Come along.' In going up Highgate Hill I thought he looked bulky; I said, 'Have you a revolver in your pocket?' He said, 'No, you shall have all I have got.' He gave me four bags with flour in them. I said, What have you here?' He said, 'Two cartridges.' On three occasions he said, 'I have done what I meant to do, and I do not care if I swing for it.' He went quiet from his shop to the police-station at Highgate, and we gave him in charge to the police. 'He has done me harm; I never done dirty actions, and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound. I meant to throw the flour at him to aggravate him.'" He made that remark just after he offered me the flour bags—I put that in afterwards when I recollected it, but on the same day, within a few seconds between 3 and 4 o'clock, after we had shut our house up; the whole of it was done that Sunday afternoon—I have not heard Lack's evidence—I did not hear the prisoner say "I saw him come out with a knife, and I thought I would have first chance"—I have heard that it was said, but I did not hear it—I and Lack were with him all the time—I was walking on the left side of him and Lack on the right—the prisoner was very much excited—I cannot say whether his eyes looked wild, like a man not in his senses—I took more particular notice in looking after his body, in case of an accident on the road—I think what he said about, his coming out with a knife, and his having first chance, was said previous to my taking hold of him—I took hold of him before he was being moved along to the station, perhaps some seconds after Lack—Lack had him by the collar when I came out—Lack called me—I have never given evidence before in a case. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What caused you to take this down; it is rather an unusual thing, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it is a way I have, like all old gentlemen, taking notes of anything, any little occurrence that happens; if you were to die to-day I should take that down, I should make a little note of it. I keep a diary of all the events of my life, no doubt this will be a leaf out of my diary. I have not written it in my diary yet, but I shall do. I am the potman at the Lion, I have seen the prisoner there. I have been there eight years and a half.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). On the morning of 22nd May I went to the Highgate Police-station, about an hour after the prisoner had been brought there—I found him there—he then seemed calm and collected and sober—I said nothing to him, except to ask him two or three questions to enter on the charge sheet—I asked him his age and his name, and a question as to his education—those were the only three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280054"></xptr>
               <p>questions I put to him—he gave his name correctly, James Sweetland, and his age as 33, and I entered it on the charge-sheet—when I searched him I asked what he had got about him—I found a small sum of money; there was no letter, and I could hear of no letter having been seen at the station—Lack gave me these two cartridges—this one is in the same stats as I received it; the other I opened—before opening it it was exactly similar in appearance to the other—out of the one I opened I took some shot and a wad—I returned them again to the cartridge—I weighed the shot in company with the gunsmith, and the charge weighed an ounce and a quarter—on that morning I went to Mr. Buckler's house and examined the shop—I made a careful examination—I found marks of shot on both doorposts, something like 100 altogether—there were some shot marks on the goods in the shop and on the wall of the parlour at the back of the shop—the greater number of those on the doorposts were between five and six feet from the ground, and those on the wall at the back of the shop were about a dozen in the space of half a yard square—the front window of the shop was broken, and an inner window separating the parlour from the shop was also broken, apparently by the shot—I picked out about 10 or a dozen of the shot—they appeared to be of the same size as those that were in the cartridge—I have shown them to Mr. Sturman, the gunsmith—I also examined the prisoner's premises—I found no marks of shot there—on the morning of the 28th I received from the prisoner's wife a paper bag containing about half a pound of shot, or a little over—she got it from a safe in the back parlour—that appears to be shot of the same size as those in the cartridge and those taken from the doorposts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is frequently necessary to have a clue to a delusion before I can examine a man—it is sometimes necessary to take him over the general ground before it peeps out—in this oase I had no due to the alleged delusion—it is quite consistent with his having a delusion that I did not discover it—he was extremely reticent on all occasions, and he never suggested anything; he never originated any remark—he said that he felt that the deceased had injured him, but he did not say in what way—I cannot recollect what the expression was—I could not get any<lb></lb>thing very distinct from him—I cannot tell you what he said about injuring him; I collected that he thought the deceased had injured him in some way, but he could give me no account in what way—he exhibited no excitement when he said that he was watched; he spoke in his usual manner—that is not an uncommon form of donation, but I think it is a delusion of a dangerous nature, I think violence is very often committed under the influence of it—his present calmness and rationality is I think perfectly consistent with his having laboured under that delusion—the fact that by killing this man he had released himself from the watching might operate to calm him—the subject matter of the delusion having gone he would perhaps be more likely to have equanimity than he had before—I have heard all the evidence in this case, and that the prisoner has suffered money loss to what is not uncommonly a considerable amount a man in his position—a loss of that kind certainly does tend tonhinge a persons mind, and they very often give way to habits of ✗ temperance—a man who has trouble of mind will very often give way drinking; that is to say his character becomes changed—the wounds his head were of a somewhat serious character, but of a common enough ✗ ture—I have heard that they arose from being thrown out of a trap on 0th occasions—they might or might not be of a serious character; it would depend a good deal upon the condition of the body at the time of the injury—we are meeting with wounds of that nature in this town every day, some of which prove innocent and some not—serious brain disturbance may arise from a blow to the head, even though it may not appear so—it does not depend altogether upon the wound, it depends upon the concussion, and on the injury the brain has suffered internally—great injury to the brain may be occasioned by a trifling injury apparently—I have known persons half scalped without injury to the brain, and yet from a small injury severe mischief follows, both mentally and physically—in injuries of this kind I think the brain disturbance would be immediate rather than postponed—irritability would be a characteristic no doubt, but I do not that a tendency to drink would be a characteristic—I think drink</p>

               <p>would affect the brain more if it was damaged than if it was not damaged, it would be more susceptible of disturbance—I do not think a delusion that he was watched would be likely to be the outflow of injury to the head; that delusion frequently arises without any injury or cause of that sort—I have known such cases, but if there was a predisposition to illusions it would probably promote it—I have heard the testimony as to his loss of memory, and to his excitement when sober, and to his irritability of temper—strange conduct is more or less indicative of mental disturbance—a man who does not act with perfect consistency in all his actions is more or less disturbed—a man's memory is more or less perfect—I do not think I can form any opinion from his reading the newspaper for a quarter of an hour alter having been across the road to Buckler and gesticulated and shown general excitement—we have no proof that he was reading the paper at all; it was stated that he was leaning over it, or leaning on it; I think it was on the counter at the time—I do not think that conduct characteristic of a drunken man—I heard that he said when taken "I saw him come out with a knife in his hand, and I thought I would have first chance;" assuming that to be untrue, I should look upon that as an hallucination and delusion; he saw what really did not exist, and he believed that it existed—if the deceased came out with a knife and performed his duties, it would be a delusion to suppose that he came out with it for any other purpose, but the assumption is that he did not come out with a knife at all; it has not been proved that he came out with a knife—if he said "I saw somebody there with a knife going to attack me," and there was nobody there at all, and no knife, that would be a delusion—if you said that the Emperor of China was entering that door to make an attack with a sword, that would be a delusion pure and simple; but if a man came in with a sword, and you were under the impression that he intended to attack you, and he did not, that would be imagination on your part—supposing Buckler came out with a knife in his hand, and the prisoner supposed that he came out to kill him, that would clearly be a delusion if the man had no such intention—I think if one neighbour seeing another neighbour with a knife, they not being at any particular enmity, the assuming that he is going to attack him is a most unreasonable idea—there may be a number of concurrent predisposing causes of insanity, and they need not all proceed from the same source—there is mania which arises from drink, not <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but some fixed delusion—another predisposing cause is losses in business, and there may be blows on the head, and if it is shown that in the man's family there is hereditary taint, it is very likely that all those predisposing causes together might lead to insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In a case of a man in mature life, 33, who becomes insane, it is very often quite impossible to trace the cause; I should avoid express<lb></lb>ing an opinion on the sanity of a man who has an altercation in a passion and five minutes afterwards calms down and reads the newspaper—if a man is thrown out of a cart and has a cut on his head, and after three or four days he is able to attend to his business as usual, I should probably not consider that there was brain disturbance; hundreds of cases of that kind occur in the metropolis—it is not so much the thickness of the skull, but the consti<lb></lb>tution of the individual and his habits of life—one must take everything into consideration in the judgment of the case.</p>

I am the wife of John Hurren, and I am the pro<lb></lb>prietor of a coffee and dining-house at 15, Junction Road, Upper Holloway, on the same side of the road as the prisoner; his house is No. 7—I have known him for quite five years, as both journeyman and master—Mr. Twitchett died about four years ago; the prisoner was in his service as journeyman—he used to use my house as a customer—I had opportunities of seeing him prior to Mr. Twitchett's death; he used to take his meals at my house—his character as far as I knew was very good indeed—I never saw him the worse for drink—I am aware of his loss about 18 months or two years ago—he mentioned it to me many times, about the loss in flour—up to that time, as far as I knew, he was a man of quiet and steady habits—I had many opportunities of observing him—after that time I believe he gave way to habits of intemperance; I believe somewhat on that account—I have heard him say so—I have heard him many times speak about the loss of flour—that was the first of his downfall—he was naturally excitable, I think—that has been within the last two years—prior to that, when I first knew him, he was a steady young man—I never noticed the excitability before his loss—on Wednesday night, 19th May, about 9 o'clock, I saw him in his shop in a most excited state—he was standing with his back against the back of the counter—the shop was not closed then—I afterwards saw him in the mews adjoining my house for about an hour and a half, from 10.30 till 12 o'clock, or after 12 o'clock, without boot or stockings on or coat or hat—he was walking about to and fro, and then standing with his back to my door, and knocking at my door and asking me to let him in—my side door opens into the mews—I begged of him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master baker, of 5, Seven Sisters Road, about 10 minutes' walk from the prisoner's house—I have known him intimately about 12 months, and I have seen him before off and on; his demeanour was very eccentric; sometimes when we were talking on a subject he would go wandering away upon something else in such a way as to excite attention—he was very excitable at the beginning of this year; I drove with him to South Minims; I cannot give the date—we started about 1 o'clock in the day; I went to his house to meet him, and we started from there—he was quite sober, and drove pretty steadily to Mr. Goodwin's house, where we each had a glass of sherry and some lemonade; it took us about an hour to get there, and after starting again he astonished me all of a sudden by pulling up the horse sharp, and saying "I thought that was the nearest way over there," and he pulled his horse's head right across the hedge, and whipped him to make him go over the hedge—the horse went over the hedge, and I took the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked him what he meant—he just turned, and looked at me, and said "I told you this was the shortest way"—I was a little bit frightened, as the horse was plunging after he got over, and we had a good deal of difficulty in getting him back—the prisoner sat still I should think three or four minutes, holding the reins while I got down, got over the hedge, and took the horse's head, and he tried to pull it back; after that we went on steadily enough, and nothing particular occurred, except that he said about half an hour after that "Don't tell them at home what a fool I have been"—I had been reproving him; I asked him what he meant by it, but he scarcely gave me any answer, no direct answer—he hung down his head, and I don't recollect whether he spoke or not—on another occasion I went with him to Barking to a public-house kept by the English quoit champion; we started about noon, and went to see him play at quoits, but there was no match—the prisoner returned with me in the evening by train; he was comparatively sober—I had not noticed any signs of drunkenness in him; he seemed always under a certain amount of restraint in my company; because I was always down on him for drinking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280066"></xptr>
               <p>so—he was in my company the whole time—when we were in the railway carriage, without giving me any notice, he called out all at once, "Oh, Tom, would you believe it!" or something to that effect, and took a spring from one side of the carriage to the other, seemingly imitating the way in which the champion threw his quoits, and he would have been out at the window if I had not caught hold of his legs; the window was down, and he would have overbalanced himself—his conversation was not coherent when sober at times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is between three and five months ago since we went to the public-house which the champion keeps, it is in Barking Road, 10 or 12 miles from Holloway; we did not drive down, we went by train; we started between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day—I believe we had one glass of drink when we got to Poplar Station—I don't remember what it was; his usual drink when out with me was a glass of sherry, or sherry and lemonade, and we were there all the afternoon, and left the public-house, I think, about 9 o'clock that night—there was no match on; there were no particular people there, only the hangers on—Mr. Graham, the landlord, played, and myself; the prisoner and I had some drink there, but not much—I cannot say how much the prisoner had—I did not play with the champion for drink; he is a particular friend of mine—the prisoner also tried to play—the way the champion plays is very astonish<lb></lb>ing—we took a 'bus from Barking Road to Poplar Station, and then got into the train; the prisoner did not go to sleep in the train—there was nothing particular in the wav he imitated the champion in the train only the fashion in which it was done—it was a third-class carriage—he gave a very poor imitation of the champion; he held up his hand as if he was holding a quoit, and took a spring, and he would have gone out at the window if I had not held him—the champion threw the quoit with one hand, and just a single step, and the prisoner imitated him as far as I could see—that was done quite suddenly—he was at the window when I caught him; there were no other people in the carriage, and he had plenty of room to imitate the champion—we changed at Dalston Junction—when I caught him, I said "If I had not taken hold of you, Jim, you would have been out at the window"—he said nothing; he gave a sort of laugh, and sat down; that is all that occurred, and we came to our journey's end—he was not quite sober—I never saw him incapably drunk—he could always keep his legs—I was always down on him for drinking so much—I had heard about his being a hard drinker, but I did not know it—I was always down upon mm for drinking—I was always advising him to keep from drink—I did not know that he was in the habit of drinking gin as early as 6 o'clock in the morning—I had been to a pigeon match with him once—I had heard that he was in pecuniary difficulties—when we drove down to the Bull and Butcher we only drank at Goodwin's—we were going to his father's at South Minima; we got out at Whetstone at the Bull and Butcher, and then went on to his father's; it was about 2.30 when he pulled up sharp, and said "That is the nearest way over there"—he had his whip in his hand; there was no road that way; that was not the nearest way if there had been a road—we were not larking going along—I got out of the trap, and backed the horse out—he is rather a reckless driver; he used the whip freely at times—he seemed dejected after that, and drove pretty steadily to his father's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His body was out at the window when I caught hold of his legs—we had left the public-house quite an hour then, or more than that—he had not had a drop since leaving the public-house up to getting to Dalston Junction—he had been talking sensibly, and then we had a few minutes' lull—there was nothing said after we changed carriages at Dalston—his conversation was generally incoherent—he would talk very well for a little while, and would then go off.</p>

About a fortnight before this matter happened he came down to consult me about his pecuniary difficulties—I asked him into the parlour and talked him over for a few minutes—he seemed very dejected, and all at once he jumped up and said "I don't think I will have any<lb></lb>thing more to do with it;" that was all—I don't know what he meant by that, but he seemed very anxious—I had not been trying to persuade him that it was not difficult to get credit; there was no difficulty about that, because the creditors did not know about his difficulties—I asked him what he meant, and he did not give me any decided answer—I don't think he gave me any answer—he seemed very anxious, and all at once he burst out into a laugh and said that he did not think he would have anything more to do with it—I don't know what the "it" was that he would not have anything more to do with—I had to take hold of him—his exclamation did not seem to apply to the conversation—I do not exactly know what the last subject spoken of was, but I believe it was is answer to my advising him to sell his horse and cart, to which he seemed to object—he shrugged his shoulders—I believe that was the subject that brought out the exclamation, "I will not have anything more to do with it"—he gave no reason why he did not want to part with his horse and cart, and I did not ask him—I don't exactly remember the words I used to him—I am not a timid person, but after that I felt timid in his com<lb></lb>pany when he was driving—I did not before—he has never tried to frighten me when he was driving.</p>

I live at 147, Junction Road—in January last the tradesmen of my neighbourhood formed a gun club at the Prince of Den<lb></lb>mark, Junction Road—it is still in existence, and I am its secretary—the prisoner attended, I think it was the second meeting, which was in the early part of February—there were from 12 to 15 gentlemen there—it was after 8 o'clock in the evening—I saw him come in—he was very quiet at first, and to all appearance sober—he conducted himself properly for a short time, but alter half an hour he became very excited, and threw his hat</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S, I live at Millbrook House, Hampstead Board, in practice with my father—I saw the prisoner and his wife on 30th October, about three hours after the accident—I was out when they were brought to my surgery—they were first seen by my younger brother, who is an advanced pupil—I went to the house between 9.30 and 10 o'clock—the prisoner had a scalp wound on the right side of his head about 1 1/2 inches long—he was in bed with his wife when I called—it was a contused wound caused by force, and not by a cut, such as would be caused by falling from the height of a dog<lb></lb>cart on to the ground—such a blow would be likely to cause concussion of the brain—I attended him about six or seven days—my father attended him some time afterwards—he had a peculiarity of manner that struck me very much at the time—a man who has had a con<lb></lb>cussion of the brain is more likely to be affected by drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am the last witness's father, and carry on practice with him at Millbrook House, Hampstead Road—I attended the prisoner from 7th to 18th November last—the latter part of my attendance was chiefly upon the wife, but I saw the prisoner at the same time—he had become convalescent as far as his injuries were con<lb></lb>cerned,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280075"></xptr>
               <p>and did not require further attendance—I saw his head—a fall on the head would unquestionably produce concussion of the brain—I have no doubt the prisoner suffered from concussion of the brain—when a man has had a concussion of the brain he is liable to serious conse<lb></lb>quences, either directly or at a remote period, but it is impossible to tell what results may follow—it does not always depend on the blow; some<lb></lb>times a light blow will cause it—it does not follow that every concussion is serious, but a slight concussion might lead to very serious derange<lb></lb>ment afterwards—the concussion itself is not a mental derangement—a slight concussion often leads to serious brain mischief; I mean to serious impairment of the mental powers—a second blow would increase the mental impairment, but of course a man may escape impairment as a consequence of a blow—irritability is a most common result of concussion—these results do not always accompany concussion—I have been present daring this trial—the excitability spoken to by the witnesses may be reasonably supposed to have been caused by concussion—I should think it was so, and if the prisoner was naturally irritable that irritability would be augmented by a tap on the head—a man who had had concus<lb></lb>sion would be more easily made excitable and irritable by drink, and he would be more amenable to external injuries of any kind—I have heard of the hereditary taint in the prisoner's family, of the loss in business, of the two serious blows on his head, and that he used to drink to excess—those causes concurrently operating would tend to insanity—some of them would do so, and I do not think I could take exception to any one of them—one superadded to the other of course would increase the evil—the prisoner's delusion is a form of insanity, I cannot say a common form—delusion would be likely to follow such factors as hereditary insanity, loss in business, a blow on the head, and drinking—the delusion of a person thinking he is being watched with an evil intention, is common, I should mink, but I am not an expert; it is frequently met with in books, and in madhouses—from my experience and reading it is a common delusion for a person to suppose another is going to kill him—such delusion would be a sign of madness—sudden f orgetfulness, ram<lb></lb>bling conversation, great excitability, suspicion of injury without ground, belief that he was being watched without grounds for such belief, coming after the four causes of insanity mentioned, would be a sign that the man was of unsound mind—the delusion that a man was going to kill, would last longer than was necessary for the person deluded to pro<lb></lb>cure weapons of resistance, or it might vanish at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Excitability is not universally a consequence of drink—a person is of unsound mind when his mind is deranged in any particular matter, so that he is unable properly to exercise his faculties—if a man went out in a pouring wet day and thought the sun was shining, he would be of unsound mind—there are disorders of the brain that are inflammatory and attendant upon defenses which would not be considered unsoundness, and a man may be suffering from unsoundness of mind arising from a temporary cause—unsoundness of mind is a mild phrase for insanity, but the terms are synonymous—a man who was under a delusion on one point</p>

I am the Lord Chancellor's Visitor of Lunatics, and author of several well-known books upon insanity—I was 18 years superintendent of the Devonshire County Asylum, also governor of Bethlehem Hospital—I have had large experience—on 22nd June I examined the prisoner in Newgate—I also saw him last night after the Court rose—I have heard the evidence given on this trial—I asked him whether he really thought the deceased man Buckler had watched him, and he said, certainly he had watched him; not that he thought so, but that he had watched him for the purpose of doing him harm—I asked him why he watched him, and he said he was a busy body and wanted to do him harm; and then he varied his words and said he watched him because he wanted to injure him—I pressed him to assign some reason why the deceased should have watched him with intent to injure him, and he could assign no reason whatever; but he repeated the statement with some vehemence that the deceased had watched him with intent to injure him—my interview was a short one—very little else occurred—it was all the way through an attempt on my part to get at his mind on that point—he said he did not at all know why he had done what he did—on both occasions the prisoner was reticent, only answering the questions, not meeting your eyes—I was obliged on the first occasion to make him stand up to the window to see his eyes, and yet he answered the questions sensibly—on the second occasion I came to the conclusion that his answers were those of a man deprived of sense—I have observed the same belief in those who were decidedly lunatics—I was with him in company with Mr. Gibson—I agree with Dr. Claremont that violence to the head producing concussion of brain is a great contributory cause of insanity, and that a second blow would aggravate it if the first blow had set up a diseased process—in my experience of traumatic insanity I have found cases where a slight blow has been followed by insanity, whereas we see in surgical practice the most severe injuries are not followed by insanity (<hi rend="italic">Passages were here read to the witness from Oriesuiger's work on insanity to the effect that the physician often learns from the relativet of a patient, of an accident to the head, which had been forgotten, and that very often the character and disposition changed, and "that in 20 cases great irascibility and anger in manner, even the most violent outbursts of temper were remarked"</hi>)—I entirely agree with that—I have met with many such cases—injuries to the head often are followed by serious results, and they often are not—the insanity may not disclose itself till some time afterwards—pain in the head would indicate injury to the head, but not mental disturb<lb></lb>ance—a man may become insane from a blow in the head and have no pain—it might be an equivalent of it—pain would be a probable consequence of concussion—in the cases I have known the pain has not been continuous—a person's circumstances is a frequent cause of insanity; a change for the worse being much more potent than a change for the better—those per<lb></lb>sons in whose families insanity exists will more readily become insane; hereditary influence is a great factor in producing insanity—the facts of giving way to drink, of hereditary taint, of suffering from loss and a blow on the head superadded one to another would most likely produce</p>

               <p>insanity—forgetfulness attends a degree of insanity—irritability, excitement, groundless suspicion, abnormal forgetfulness, in conjunction with the four causes enumerated, would indicate insanity if they existed in any degree; it is a question of degree, whether they exist in the old or young—the symptoms may increase according to the cause, the patient, the treatment, or the suspending circumstances—drink will not improve the state of a man's mind whether he is sane or insane; it would deteriorate his condition under any circumstances—the drink is often a symptom of insanity—it is a part of insane conduct very often—so is sensual extravagance—a very little drink will often make a man very wild who has suffered from traumatic insanity—it is consistent with the conduct of an insane person that he should give himself up to justice, not trying to escape, and express satisfaction at having done it.</p>

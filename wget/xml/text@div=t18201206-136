            . On the 9th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I stopped at the corner of Brydges-street and Russell-street, <placeName id="t18201206-136-crimeloc823">Covent-garden</placeName>

I pursued him till I came very near a crowd; a man in a white jacket, came between us, and threw me down. I got up and found the prisoner in custody. I am positive he is the man.</p>

            . On the 9th of November, about half-past six o'clock, I was in company with Jones, and others; the prisoner ran by us at the end of Russell-place. The prosecutor was within one yard of him, calling Stop thief! we followed, the prosecutor was tripped up, and we nearly fell over him - we ran by somebody with a link, who put it in my face. I lost sight of the prisoner immediately, and saw him in custody of Reynolds.</p>

I was standing in Russell-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief; I stopped the prisoner, who was rushing on faster than other people; I asked him what he had done; he said it was not him they were calling after. I detained him for a minute before anyone came up. Robertson immediately said he was the man who took his watch.</p>

I struck the man, and lost sight of the prisoner for a few seconds. I found him in Reynolds's custody. I will not swear he is the man I pursued. The mob wanted to rescue him, but he insisted on coming with us.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—on 11th May I was living with him and my mother at 26 Redhill Street, Regent's Park, my two sisters and a little brother, we were all living in the same room, a kitchen—my mother's name was Susan Milligan., she was 36 years of age—I shall 15 in August, my sisters are 7 and 5 and my little brother 2—my father was a coal porter in St. Pancras Road, my mother kept a mangle—I was employed at a chemists; on 11th May I left home to go to my work about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—my mother was at home and appeared to be in her usual state of health—I returned home about 10 o'clock in the evening, my mother was standing in a corner of the room and ray father was standing close alongside of her, undressed, he had only his shirt on; my mother was dressed, father was not sober, mother was—they were having words with one another, I don't know what about—I shortly afterwards left the room and two or three minutes afterwards I went to a window which looked into the kitchen: I heard my father swearing very much, calling mother names and I saw him kick my mother in the stomach—he had no boots on; mother was standing at the time and had her hand on the end of the mangle and she sat down on the end of the mangle directly after—I afterwards went into the room, my mother seemed in great pain, she was cry<lb></lb>ing and my little sister was by the side of her—my father was about in the middle of the room, not in bed—mother said he was no man to kick a woman in the manner that he did—he said "Confound you will your hold your noise" mother said "No," on that he threw a basin at her, it struck her on the forehead—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the pieces of the basin, it is a slop basin; her forehead bled very much—he threatened to throw a loaf at her which was on the table—at the time the basin was thrown my mother was still sitting on the mangle—after this father got in to bed; my mother sent me to fetch a lodger, Mrs. Bayliss, father said he would not have anybody brought in the room—after that I went to bed—I left my mother on the mangle still dressed—I did not see her on the floor at any time; she told me to go to bed—I awoke about 7.15 in the morning I found that my father had left the room—mother was lying on the bed dressed as she had been the night before—she spoke to me, she seemed to be ill—I then left to go to my work—I was fetched from my work about</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The room in which we lived was an underground room, it looked into an area which was covered with a railing level with the pave<lb></lb>ment—there are two windows to the room, they only come up a few inches above the railings—I had not to stoop down to look into the room, I was out in the street and could see straight through to the other side of the room—there was a light in the room—one of the windows had upright railings before it—I looked through the other with the flat railing; it is a corner house—there was usually a blind to the window, but not at that time, it was down, so that I could see through—when I returned at 10 o'clock my sisters and brother were in bed—the room had the ordinary furniture, table, chairs, bed, and fire-irons, and cooking things—the mangle was a large one and took up a good space there were two iron bedsteads, one a large one in' which my father and my mother slept with the girls, and a small one where I and my little brother slept; there are two doors, one into the passage and one into the area, you go up steps from the area into the street—I went to sleep in about five minutes after I went to bed—I had to go over the way to put up some shutters first—father and mother had quarrelled before this at times; once he left the house in consequence of a quarrel and passed the night in the street—my mother worked hard at the mangle; she sometimes took a little drop of beer, not very much, not spirits; at Christmas time, I think, I did see her have too much—at Easter or Whitsuntide she very likely took a little—father had to leave for his work early in the morning—some<lb></lb>times on pay nights he might take a little too much—he worked regularly—he did not bring his money home regularly to his wife—I was standing in. the gutter when I was looking through the window—my mother's side was towards me, she was standing at the end of the mangle—they were not in the same positions when I came back as when I went away—I never saw my father's face scratched at any of the quarrels or his whiskers pulled—I did not not notice whether his whiskers were pulled on this night—my mother was sitting on the mangle when I came back, not when my father kicked her; she stood up when he came towards her and he kicked, her, she did not move towards him, she did not go above half a foot nearer; she looked as if she got up to avoid him—she was sitting down when the basin was thrown; father was standing in the same position as before—I went off to sleep and heard nothing more till I awoke about 7 o'clock—I did not go for any doctor or lodger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S., and obstetric assistant at University College Hospital—on Friday, 12th May, I was sent for a few minutes before 11 o'clock—Mr. Broster sent for me—I went at once to 26, Redhill Street,—I got there a few minutes after 11 o'clock—Mr. Broster was there—I went into a room downstairs and there saw Susan Milligan lying on the bed, dressed—the police were there and some women—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not there—I examined the woman, she was faint from loss of blood and was losing a little then; she was conscious, the pulse was very weak—I examined the womb, she was in labour and bleeding a little—I attended to her and stopped the bleeding by rupturing the membranes—I gave her a stimulant—I stayed with her a little over an hour and then left Mr. Broster in charge of the case—she was very low, but I considered her in a fit state to be left, or I would not have left her; she was not in danger</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187606260042"></xptr>
               <p>at that time—she had a cut on the forehead above the right eye which might have been caused by a basin—there was a great deal of blood underneath the bed and in the bed, it had gone through the bed—there was also dried blood in the corner by the mangle on the floor—a little before 2 o'clock in the afternoon I was sent for again—Mr. Broster was still there—I found the child had then been born—she was conscious, but very weak and faint from loss of blood; she was in danger—Dr. Williams went there with me and he examined the womb; I saw him do so; it was relaxed and she was bleeding from it—she rallied a little, but had a relapse a little after 4 o'clock from fresh bleeding—I was with her when she died, about 4.30—I apprehended danger when I got there the second time with Dr. Williams at 2 o'clock—I took Dr. Williams there in consequence of what I heard—she spoke to me afterwards, she asked to be left alone, to be let die in peace, two or three times—I had not told her that she was in danger—I saw the child, it was born dead, it was about an eight months' child—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination on Sunday 15th—I found the body of the woman well nourished—the cut on the forehead was about three-quarters of an inch in length—there were three or four bruises on the lower limbs below the knees—there were no other external marks—the organs of the body were healthy, very bloodless—I examined the uterus, it had the usual appearance of a woman after labour—the immediate cause of death was loss of blood—a woman eight months gone in the family way kicked in the stomach might bring on pre<lb></lb>mature labour and bleeding from the womb before death; I don't say that it would, but external violence is a frequent cause of it—there were no abnormal appearances on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> why this labour should have been premature, nor anything in the appearance of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruises on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> were slight, and I should think three or four days old; they were in about the middle of the shin, they might have been caused twenty-four hours before my seeing her—the cut on the forehead had been washed, that was all—that injury was not in any way connected with the premature confinement—I found no external bruise in the neighbourhood of the abdomen; I examined with a special view to that—I found no injury to the uterus, or on the muscles—I ruptured the membranes on the first occasion, that was to stop the bleeding, that would lead to the discharge of the waters—there had been no discharge of the waters before that—the discharge of the waters necessarily results in delivery—the consequence of violence to the abdomen of a woman in her advanced state of pregnancy would not be the discharge of the waters; I had never attended her before—abortion is due to disease, fright may cause it, premature confinement does not occur from natural causes—a blow or a fall, or unusual exertion may produce it, as well as a kick; I don't think previous premature confinement caused by fright would render her more liable to it again, it would only show that fright would have more effect on the nervous system—if I had not been informed of the kick I should have asked for the cause of the first bleeding; there was nothing in the appearance of the body to indicate violence; I attribute death to hemorrhage, and I should have inquired into the cause of that.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am assistant obstetric physician of University College Hospital—I was sent for to the deceased, I arrived about 2 o'clock after the delivery, I made an examination of the womb—she was then alive and bleeding a little—I could not form any notion of the cause of the bleeding, it was a bleeding into the womb and out of it, that is unusual—hemorrhage accompanying confinement may arise from violence or other causes—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—a kick on the stomach would be sufficient to account for the bleeding and the child being born dead—there was nothing in the child's appearance to account for its death, if was apparently a healthy child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the woman before; I say a kick would probably cause the bleeding.</p>

Supposing a woman to be kicked in that part-1 should not expect to find external marks, bruise or discolouration, because the parts are so soft that they would yield to the kick—a bruise proceeds from extra-vasation of blood—the distention of the part by the foetus would not produce sufficient hardness to give discoloration, because the foetus is surrounded by water.</p>

(The Court <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that this would not be sufficient to admit, as a dying declaration, any statement made by the deceased; two things must to exist to make it admissable: that she was in a dying state, and that she made the statement under the full belief that she was in a dying state, so as to give it the sanction of an oath</hi>).

I am married, and live in Stanhope Street, Hamp<lb></lb>stead Road—I had known the deceased about six and a half years—I attended her as nurse in her confinements with her last four children, and I likewise delivered her of one dead child—I attended her the whole time; they were very bad confinements, always a hæmorrhage before birth and after, with each child; a flooding—one was a premature confinement with a seven months' child—that was not the last before this; it was the second I nursed her with, about four years back—I am not only a nurse, but a midwife—each of the confinements was accompanied with flooding—I was with her this last time, and never left her bedside till she was dead—the prisoner has always been kind to her, and the first thing he did when he came home was to give her his money—he was always very good, as far as I know, to every<lb></lb>body—that was the reputation he has borne among his fellow-workmen and friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the habit of visiting her—I have seen him the worse for liquor, not frequently, several times—he was never violent to her in my presence, either when in drink or not—I heard of her jaw being injured; I did not see it, it was never broken—I heard that she had a hit in the mouth, not by him; I don't know how she got it—she fell down the steps; I was then present, and was helping her up with a basket of mangling things—I don't know that she was injured then—I never heard that her jaw was broken, and I don't believe it was; it was not very bad—she could eat very well afterwards—when she fell on the steps she said she had hurt her face, her jaw, or her mouth, rather—she was not taken to the hospital about the jaw, that I heard—the prisoner and she did not constantly quarrel, they would have words at times—a surgeon attended her in each of her confinements after they were over—I was present at the birth of this last child; I had been engaged for months before, and she would never have anyone else if she could have me—I have not had children of my own—</p>

               <p>she was always complaining about her husband; she has complained to me of his ill-usage, not in his presence, no more than she has said to him "You would like to murder me, would you not?"—she has said that many times—she was a very aggravating woman when she has had anything to drink—I have seen her throw a paraffin lamp at him, and a knife and a plate, and he has come and asked me to go in and keep her quiet—I never saw him with marks of violence on his face; I have seen her use acts of violence to him, about three weeks before this occurrence.</p>

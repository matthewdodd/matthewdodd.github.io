               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Silvester. About twelve weeks; they were stole out of her chamber where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose.</p>
               <p>Silvester. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss these things before she went away?</p>
               <p>Silvester. Yes, I missed them all before she went away. I challenged her with them, and she said they were very safe, and should be forthcoming; she said she had sent the glass to be mended, but the other things were pawned. The goods were accordingly sent to my house by a porter, and left in the passage; but who sent them I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was a porter?</p>
               <p>Silvester . Because he had a white apron on.</p>

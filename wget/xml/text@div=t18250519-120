The prisoner had been in their service at a concern they have at Knightsbridge, and had left about two months - he had been to our house in the interval. On the 26th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, he came to the shop and asked for Mr. Sewell - I saw them in conversation - he afterwards was talking with Brown, who is in our employ, and after that Mr. Sewell came into the warehouse, and said to him "If you are not engaged this evening you may as well come behind the counter and help us to straighten some prints, and have supper with us." Mr. Sewell went away and he told me he did not like to go behind the counter, because he was obliged to wear spectacles, and the young men looked at him so; I was called into the shop, and told Mr. Sewell he was not coming in; he told me to send him to him - I went and he told me to say he did not like to come in. Mr. Sewell afterwards came and asked him to come - he said he did not like - Mr. Sewell said "Never mind, come in about two hours, and then we will have supper; he said he would; Mr. Sewell left him, and as he went out I saw two parcels in his hand; he then ran off as hard as he could - I immediately ran after him and brought him back with the parcels - it was a paper of muslins which I had tied up in his presence a minute before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. In which house do the partners live? A. One sleeps at No. 44, and the other at No. 45 - both dine at the same table - it is one house, communicating in six places - the goods were in the warehouse which communicates with the shop - the muslin was on the warehouse counter when he came to speak to Mr. Sewell - I gave it to Cross.</p>

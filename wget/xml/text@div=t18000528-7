             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the Police Officers belonging to Worship-street: On Thursday the 24th of April, in consequence of information, I went to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280016"></xptr>house, <placeName id="t18000528-7-crimeloc40">No. 437 Clement's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently acquainted with the stain of aqua-fortis, to say whether you believe it to be aqua-fortis? - A. I believe it is; Mason then came up, and I delivered the woman prisoner to him; I then went up to the three pair of stairs, which is a garret, Ray being behind me; I found the door locked, by trying the latch; at that instant, I heard the footstep of somebody come across the room inside; the prisoner Dight or Jones opened the door, and I said, ah, master Dight, is it you? then Ray and I were in the room, till we called Mason to come up, and he was to direct Vickery to take care of the woman; Ray and Mason secured him, he made no resistance; I observed the room had got two windows, one looks to the side of the house, and the other to the front; towards the front of that part which comes into Clement's-lane, was a lathe, by the side of the window was an instrument, used for turning the edges of these blanks, and between the windows there was the corner of a room that bulged out into this room, so as to receive the light of both windows, and not be perceived by any body from the window, and in that was this cutting engine, fixed upon a stool, and the stool fixed to the floor; but under the legs of the stool was this soldier's jacket, and this cloth to deaden the found; and close by the cutting engine were these plates and this cecil.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cecil the same metal as the plates? - A. Yes, it appears to be the same; the cutting engine was fresh with the oil running down the screw, and this cutter fixed in the engine, which, if you compare it, corresponds for cutting out the blanks; here is a quantity of sand paper that I found upon the floor, by the side of the cutting engine; the sand paper is used to rub them; these blanks, one hundred and fifty in number, I found in a cupboard, in the same room where the cutting engine was; in a piece of paper, in the same room, by the side of the cutting engine, were these punches, which appear to be used with a hammer; here is another, which will receive the plate, and may be cut out with a hammer, without the force of a cutting engine; a quantity of file dust, which they save; here are the files, with the appearance of that kind of metal now upon some of them; all that I now produce, except this bit of cloth, were found in that garret; this piece of a flat iron was lying upon the floor, and it then bore a heat, which I presume had had the blanks, with the sand paper rubbed upon it, that is the way they are cleaned, his hands were dirty, as a man's hands would be who had been employed in that way; here are shears and pincers, and other articles, which are used, in other business besides this; I asked the prisoner if he lived there, he said, yes, and paid ten pounds a year for that room and the room underneath, and a little back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room in which you found the woman, a part of that, for which he said he paid ten pounds a year? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In the room where the woman prisoner was, you found nothing but a bit of cloth? - A. Not at that moment, till I came down again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, had not the prisoner his great coat and his hat on as if he was going out? - A. He had his hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described these instruments, I believe, they are all used by brass-workers? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. That sack and jacket was for deadening the found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if a person was at work there, as a brass-founder, it would prevent disturbing the other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was the bed? - A. In the little place behind where the woman was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belong to Worship-street; I went with Armstrong, on Thursday the 24th of April, to the prisoner's lodgings, Armstrong went up stairs first, and I was immediately after him; he opened the room door up two pair of stairs, and there was the woman prisoner stooping to a tub with some wet clothes in it; we did not stop there, but proceeded immediately to the garret; we found the door locked; we knocked at the door, and the prisoner Dight immediately opened it; we immediately secured him, and behind the door, upon the right, was a lathe fixed; there was some file dust lying fresh about the lathe; on the left-hand, in the corner, was this cutting-engine in the state it is now in, except that it had the cutter in it, it had been fresh at work, for the oil was running down; I saw Armstrong go to a closet and find these blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them, are they of the same colour now that they were then? - A. No; they have got tarnished very much since I searched the room; and over the door, just by the lathe, upon the ledge, were these two pieces of blank copper.</p>

               <p>Q. What are they the size of? - A. For sixpences, and these two blanks for shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280017"></xptr>Q. At the time that you found them, did they appear to have the appearance of being fit for circulation? - A. One of them had, but they are now altered a great deal; there, was one that had been blacked to deaden the whiteness of the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. In their present state, you think they would not pass? - A. No; and in a corner I found this bottle, and at that time there was a drop of 
aquafortis in it, it smelled very strong of the aqua-fortis.</p>


               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with the smell of aqua-fortis? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of apprehending many of these kind of people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the room in which you found the man? - A. Not that day; I went again two or three days after, Armstrong having kept the key, he himself locked the door.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I locked the door, and took the key to the office, I gave it to Ray to go and make a second search.</p>
               <p>Ray. Upon the second search, upon the moving a board behind the skirting board, I found these three blanks, they are a great deal tarnished since that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of them, at that time, such, as in your judgment, would pass in circulation? - A. No, I do not think they would; after the first search, I went down again to the room where we had secured the prisoner, I found nothing there, I saw Armstrong find a rag, which we all smelt, it had the smell of aqua-fortis upon it, it was very much stained, I believe, with aqua-fortis; I did not see any thing else found.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this room be overlooked by the opposite house? - A. No; this was a higher house than the opposite side, and no person could see it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Be so good as tell us what the reward is in this case? - A. Forty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. For each of the prisoners to be divided between you and your brother officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These blanks have been kept in the same paper since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one of them, you think, was in a state fit for circulation, point out which of them it is? - A. This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you found them? - A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to swear that it was a shilling by which you could have been deceived? - A. Yes, it has changed very much.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper in which these two shillings have been kept is a softer paper than the other? - A. It may be.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went before the Magistrate to complain of this offence? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then state to the Magistrate that you thought they were not in a state fit for circulation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Nares state that they were not in a state fit for circulation? - A. With respect to this he did.</p>

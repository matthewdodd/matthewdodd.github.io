            . I live in Sun-court, King David Place, Shadwell. On the 10th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was at the Whitehart public-house, Shadwell, with the prisoner and her husband, who is a seaman; two more men were there, one of whom did not belong to our party; we were drinking grog; the prisoner and her husband seemed in very good humour; she gave him the key of the door to go home; he went out and returned, and called for some grog, and I saw her aim at him to hit him; I had not heard them quarrelling, and do not know whether she had any thing in her hand; she aimed at his shoulder; whether it was in a passion or in fun, I do not know, or whether she hit him, but I saw a knife sticking in the shoulder of his jacket; she called out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my G - d! I have done it;" he said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, what have you done?" and then said," She has stabbed me." She fell as if she was fainting; he caught her in his arms, they sat down together comfortably, and I left; one of the men pulled the knife out of his shoulder, gave it to me, and I put it on the table; it appeared a new one; I saw a little blood on his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know her reason for doing this - A. It was something about a woman named Bonham, who had been there that evening - I have heard them fall out about her, but not on that night - she had come in and sat down opposite to him; he told her to go away, for he would have nothing to say to her; she went out, and after this was done she came into the room several times. I went to their lodgings on the Tuesday following, and saw the prisoner applying leeches to her husband's shoulder; they were friendly together then, and she said she was very sorry for it - he said,</p>

               <p>"Never mind, it cannot be helped now." I have not seen him for the last three weeks - he said he was going to sea.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined Simpson's shoulder, which was considerably inflamed. I found a puncture of a sharp instrument, but could not then ascertain the depth of the wound. I was fetched again in the evening; his wife had applied leeches by my order; I then probed it, and found it about an inch and a half deep; it was a dangerous wound; he was under my care for a fortnight; it had struck on the spine.</p>

On Saturday, 23rd Jan., about 7 o'clock, I served the prisoner with half a quartern of gin; he brought a bottle with him—he gave me a florin, which I tried and found was bad—I asked him where he got it; he said that he had just taken it for his wages of his master—he asked me for it, but I refused to return it—he did not pay for the gin—he said if he fetched his mother would I give it to him—I told him to fetch his mother, and he left the money and the bottle of gin, and I saw no more of him till he was in custody, on 8th Feb.—during that time I had kept the florin apart from other money, and gave it to Lowe—I had given infor<lb></lb>mation to the police, and in consequence of what they said to me I went to the police court, and the prisoner was brought out of a cell into the court by himself—I did not pick him out from a number, but I am sure he is the person.</p>

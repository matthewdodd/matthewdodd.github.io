On the 1st of October, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw these things in my back room window, and missed them about seven o'clock. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's mother's, in Wheeler-street, and found them in the cellar. He was not at home, but surrendered himself at the watch-house that night. He must have come into the back yard to take them.</p>

            . I live in Wheeler-street. On the 9th of October, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another young man, at Rice's window. I saw the prisoner take something out of the window and put it in the other man's hand, he put it in an apron, crossed over, and went into the prisoner's mother's house. I did not stop to see where the prisoner went. I knew him before, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the Magistrate you believed it was me - A. I said so because his mother said if any harm came to her boy that revenge was sweet, and she would have blood for blood.</p>

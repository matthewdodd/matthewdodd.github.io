On the first week in March he said he was going to leave on the Saturday, and said he had done enough in London to hang him - he went away the next morning, about half-past eight o'clock - I went to clean myself about twelve, and my clothes were gone - he had slept in the same bed with me - my box was in that room - this was on the 11th of March - I had seen them safe on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is your name Thomas Holliday? A. I believe so - I have always been brought up by that name - I never knew my father, but my mother goes by the name of Holliday.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have taken them when I have been in need of money, and my prosecutor knew I did so- I have taken them in the week, and on the Saturday night I have put them back again, as I believe the pawnbroker can prove.</p>
               <p>COURT to E. RUBERY. Q. Has he done so? A. Yes, he pawned them several times, and always came for them on a Saturday night, and paid me for them. I believe he would have done so this time if distress had not come upon him.</p>
               <p>T. HOLLIDAY. I never knew that he took my things till the night he was taken up. I have lent him my coat to wear but not to pawn, and I have lent him money - he returned my coat again.</p>

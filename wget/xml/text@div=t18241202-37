               <p>WILLIAM EVANS. I am in the service of Mr. Watson. About half-past five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of November, I was in the cellar, and heard a rumbling noise in the passage. I went up stairs - there was no one in the passage. I saw the prisoner and another person - they had got the cask as high as their knees, and seemed to be lifting it on the prisoner's shoulder. I went and took the prisoner, saying, he was the person I had been waiting for: he said he was pushed in - he was then taken before the Magistrate.</p>

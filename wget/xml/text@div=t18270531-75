On Sunday evening, the 22d of April, at eleven o'clock, I was going home, and found the door ajar; my friend Collins was with me - I had been absent since 7 o'clock in the morning. I pushed the door open. I sent a boy for a watchman, and two came (my father lives in Drury-lane - I live in this house for him); the watchmen, I, and Collins searched the house - we found nobody in it; I missed a great quantity of snuff-boxes out of the window of the shop, which were there when I left the house in the morning; I had left a boy to lock the door, but do not know whether he did it. I missed other snuff-boxes from shelves behind the counter - I missed more than two hundred in all; I have since seen seven or eight of them at Mary-le-bone Office, when the prisoner was in custody - this was within a week after, I think. I am certain of part of the boxes being my father's and brother's; the value of all I missed is about 60l. I did not see the prisoner near the premises - he is quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You live in this house? A. Yes, for my father, who lives at No 141, Drury-lane; he never sleeps at Fleet-street, but in Drury-lane; it is his own house; my father very seldom takes his meals in the house; the business is carried on there for him; I do not pay the rates - I believe my brother does.</p>
               <p>JOHN MICKLAM. I am in partnership with my son, William Plucknett Micklam; the rent of this house is paid out of the partnership funds - my son Thomas lives there, by our permission - we sell snuff-boxes and other things. I saw the house on the Saturday - the stock was all safe then. On Sunday night I had information of this robbery - I did not go there that night, but went on Monday - about sixty doxens of Scotch snuff-boxes were missing, which are worth above 100l., near 120l. I knew nothing of the prisoner till he was before the Magistrate - some boxes were produced before the Magistrate; I can swear to two or three being part of my stock, which was safe on Saturday night - the house is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No. I sleep at my house in Drury-lane, not in Fleet-street; my son Thomas lives in Fleet-street; I have marks on the boxes, by which I know them; they are not private shop marks, but some of them have marks by which I know them; I think I swore to two at the office; I and my son who is in partnership with me pay the rent and taxes of the house in Fleet-street - we pay every thing belonging to the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Baylis, a pawnbroker, of No. 35, Upper Mary-le-bone-street. On Wednesday, the 25th of April, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at my employer's shop - he came to pledge six snuff-boxes, and wanted 25s. on them; I asked if they were his own - he said they were not - that he had had them on commission for sale, from a friend of his in Scotland - they are Scotch boxes. I told him I had information of such boxes being stolen, and must detain him - he said he hoped I should not, and entreated me to let him go, and said if I would allow him to go he would send the person who sent him; I said I could not, and detained him till an officer came and took him into custody; I gave the boxes to the officer - I attended at the office, and Mr. Micklam identified three of them, I believe.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 25th of April I was sent for to Baylis', and found the prisoner there; I took him in charge. The boxes were delivered to me - I have kept them ever since, and produce them; the prisoner was locked up in the parlour till I came to take him - I searched him, but found nothing particular on him; I asked where he came from - he said he did not wish to tell me, he did not wish to disgrace his friends; I asked where he got the boxes from - he said they were given to him by a man at the corner of Well-street, to pledge - he did not say who the man was, nor his name, nor say where I could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Well-street, Oxford-road? A. Yes. Mr. Micklam claimed some of the boxes. The prisoner had a child in his arms at the time, about two years old; the Magistrate wished him to give up where he lived, that the child should not be locked up - he then told the Magistrate that if it was taken to No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square, somebody would take care of it; I took the child there by his direction - I afterwards went to No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310047"></xptr>4, Whitcomb-court, Oxendon-street, Haymarket - I saw the prisoner's wife there.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say she was his wife? A. I never saw the prisoner and her together, or heard them acknowledge each other as man and wife. On searching the first floor front room in that house, in a cupboard, I found three snuff-boxes, which were claimed by Mr. Micklam, besides what the pawnbroker delivered to me. On searching in the wash-hand-stand drawer I found four keys - I cannot say that they were ever in the possession of the prisoner - he has not claimed any thing in that house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what day was this? A. On Wednesday, the 25th, three days after the robbery; I never saw the prisoner in Whitcomb-court.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. When the prisoner was brought to the office he told me to take the child to No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square, and to say it came from Charles Green; I took the child there, but did not deliver that message; from what I was told there I took the child to another house, nearly opposite in the same street, and from what I heard there I took it to No. 4, Whitcomb-court, Oxendon-street; I went there with another man, and delivered the child to a female there, in the first floor front room; I never saw her and the prisoner together - I searched that room, and in some of the boxes there I first found a small bunch of keys, four of which are skeleton, and under the bed I found this basket, containing three dark-lanterns, a small crow-bar, a chisel, and one or two odd keys, and under the same bed I found another box, containing forty-one skeleton-keys; I then searched the cupboard in the same room, and found a box, containing a number of skeleton-keys, and a bag containing twelve skeleton-keys and several others; I then found a pocketbook with some memorandoms and certificate of a marriage; I saw Gibbs find in a cupboard three snuff-boxes, which the prosecutors claim; the prisoner said nothing about them - I found nothing else. I brought the female in custody to the office with the child which the prisoner had delivered to me; I cannot be certain whether what the prisoner said was taken down in writing; the clerk was writing there the whole of the time; the prisoner spoke to that woman and to the child; he was prevented by the Magistrate from having any conversation with her till the examination was gone through, and the gaoler stood between him and the woman to part them; they spoke to each other before the examination began; he was going to say something to her, and the Magistrate ordered the gaoler to stand between them; I did not hear what he said - he whispered to her, and addressed the child; I do not know whether they talked together afterwards - the woman then gave her name Maria Clements; after the examination was taken, I produced the certificate of the marriage which I found in the pocket-book; the Magistrate asked him whose certificate it was - I cannot say whether what he said was taken down.</p>
               <p>The Court here referred to the examinations returned from the Magistrate, and they contained no statement made by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Magistrate ask the prisoner? A. Whether the certificate was his - he said, "Yes, it is, and this is my wife," meaning the woman who gave her name as Clements; the Magistrate asked him if the name, Henry George Clements, in the certificate was his - he said it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The only house the prisoner desired you to take the child to was No. 19, Queen-street, Golden-square? A. It was; I never saw him in any of the houses I have mentioned, not to my knowledge; I never saw him at Whitcomb-court; I did not search No. 19, Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that the child was in the office at all during the time of his examination? A. I will not swear to its being there all the time - it was there part of the time; it might be outside the office part of the time; I swear positively, to the best of my belief, that it was in the office part of the time; I will swear it was in the office during part of the examination.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Whitcomb-court, and rent the house; I took it on the 5th of April - there is only one room on a floor. I let the prisoner the first floor room, and the second floor to two young men; the prisoner lived there, with his wife and one child; I saw him at the office on the Monday after he was taken, but did not see his wife there - he went by the name of Clements, and she was called Mrs. Clements.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday that the prisoner was taken up, did his wife and child live in that room? A. Yes; I knew nothing of the officer's having been till the Friday following, when they came for me to attend at the office - I do not know where Mrs. Clements and the child live now, but believe some where about Queen-street, Golden-square - she gave me a week's notice to leave on the day after the prisoner was taken, but she did not stop all the week; the things were moved away on the Saturday following, when they paid the week's rent - the prisoner and her lived together in my house as man and wife for ten days, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at home from Wednesday night till Friday? A. I cannot say; I had not heard of the officers searching the house till they came on Friday; I sleep at home every night, and go out in the day-time when I have no work - I have a wife and four children; I did not hear of the officer's searching the house till they told me so on Friday; it was never searched before to my knowledge; I was at home all day when I had work - whether I had work on Thursday I do not know; my door is generally shut; it can be opened by litting a latch; it is often open in the day time; I have no servant; I saw the prisoner's wife on Thursday morning after breakfast; she knocked at the room door, and gave warning; I did not hear from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310048"></xptr>her that the officers had been and searched - we had agreed for a week's warning; there are only three rooms in the house; I was at home on Wednesday and at work, I dare say - I did not hear of the officers being in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If they had made a noise, should you have heard them? A. Certainly; or if they had knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to H. STOWELL. Q. Did another officer go with you to the house? A. He did; a man took us to the house - he opened the door, and walked up-stairs; we walked up after him very softly - there were three of us; we might be there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I will not swear to five minutes, but think it was about twenty minutes; we went into no other room; I did not see Ware or any of the family.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to P. WARE. Q. Did the prisoner or the woman take the lodging? A. His wife took it of my wife - I was not present; he paid his first week's rent himself to my wife - they lived together then as man and wife till he was taken up, and treated the child as theirs - nobody else lived in that room.</p>
               <p>J. MICKLAM. (Examining the boxes produced by Chapman). Here is one box, which I can swear to by a stroke over the head of the figure on it, and another stroke besides - here is another I can swear to by a mark close to the shoulder of the dog, and a scratch inside; here is another I know by a spot on it; I only know these three - I lost a great many different sorts of boxes (looking at the three found at the prisoner's lodging). I can speak to one of these by the gas having fallen on it, and spotted the varnish in different parts - I only know one of these, and the three produced by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You talk of a mark on the head, where is it? A. Just over the head of the fox; it is an old shopkeeper; I have had it four years, and seen it much too often. I have seen the mark a great many times; I have had the one with the spot on it some years most likely; I may have seven hundred boxes in my house, but not fifty of this description now, for they are taken - this one I can tell by one mark outside and two inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the office, on examining the boxes, that you could be more positive about them if another had been found? A. I do not believe that I did, but will not swear I did not; I have been thirty-five years in the trade - there may be fifty thousand Scotch boxes is London.(here the witness pointed out several marks by which he identified the boxes.)</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear you did this with a penknife? A. No, I will not swear what it was done with, but I recollect making the mark; I thought I did it with a penknife, and I do not now say that it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the office that you was sorry another box was not found, as you should then be more certain? A. I do not recollect it, but will not swear one way or the other; my brother formerly slept in the house, but has not done so for six months or more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to say that the boxes are my own; they were sent to me for sale on commission by a friend in Scotland - as to the keys I was not at home when they were left at my house, which was the day before, as my wife stated at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistant matrons of the Female Convict Prison, Brixton—the prisoner was one of the convicts in my charge—she was undergoing a sentence of four years' penal servitude, and had passed a great part of her sentence, and for good conduct she was what is called a first-class prisoner—she attended to the room of Mrs. Brown, one of the matrons—on Sunday, 24th January, about a quarter to 1, I went to her cell, and found it full of smoke—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "Nothing," and closed the door as quickly as possible—I re-opened it, smelling, as I thought, something burning, and I went in and asked her what it was—she said, "Nothing"—I discovered in one corner of the cell, two candles lighted—she said she was going to boil her cocoa—I asked her to give me the candles, which she did—I took them from her, and closed the cell—it was my duty to make a report of this to the authorities of the prison, which I did on the Sunday evening—on the Monday morning I went to the cell as usual, about half-past 7, when I went round to serve the bread—a prisoner of the name of Melvy carried the basket—when I came to the prisoner's cell I opened it, and was in the act of stooping down to take out a loaf from the basket, when I felt my bonnet pulled off my head, and I received a blow on the top of my head, a second blow at the side of my left ear, and a third on the left cheek—the prisoner's hands were then raised to give me a fourth blow, but I held her by the wrist—I had two prisoners, Collett and Melvy, assisting me with the breakfasts, and they raised their hands as though they were going to assist me—the prisoner said if any one assisted me, she would serve them as she had served me—she said that I had reported her, and it should be the last I should ever report—I saw something glittering in her hand at this time—I bled from the head and face, and felt very faint from loss of blood—I have since seen the bottle that was taken from her—I did not see it taken from her; I only saw something glittering—it was a small substance held in a handkerchief, which was rolled round her hand—I was taken to the infirmary, where I have been ever since—I was in bed for fifteen days—no one assisted me at all—I managed to get away somehow—Melvy went between me and the prisoner, so that I could manage to escape from her—she threw the loaves of bread that remained in the basket at me as I walked along the corridor.</p>

               <p>—you may have asked me to forgive you, but it was not in my power to forgive you; you knew that—I did not, that evening, take down the roll on which all the prisoners names are registered; I knew your register without that—it was my duty not to make any report without first consulting the principal matron who was in charge of the wing on the Sunday—when I came with your breakfast in the morning my left hand was towards you; Melvy, who was with the bread, was on my left; the woman with the cocoa on my right, and you were in your cell facing me—it is a very narrow ward—when I opened the door there was not sufficient room for you to come out; you remained at your cell door when you struck me—I was not aware at the moment who had given me the blow—your cell door was not open when I came up; I unlocked it myself—no one could give you the bread but myself—after you threw the loaves at me you threw the basket over into the lower part of the wing.</p>

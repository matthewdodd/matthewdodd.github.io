               <p>Partridge. I was told by a friend, that he believed I had a thief in the house, and that it was my <rs id="t17480224-5-deflabel29" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Where is this Money?</p>
               <p>Partridge. It is in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your money?</p>
               <p>Partridge. Because I put a particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear them to be your money?</p>
               <p>Partridge. Yes, I can swear to them, that these are my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How are they marked?</p>
               <p>Partridge. They are marked on the back part of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Partridge. They were taken out of the Prisoner's pocket immediately, and he confessed it, and said it was the second time he ever was guilty of robbing us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe my master knows that I was a very honest servant to him before this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been your servant?</p>
               <p>Partridge. Near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an honest servant?</p>
               <p>Partridge. Yes, as far as I know.</p>

             . Mr. Partridge (partner with Mr. Barnston) came to me, and said he thought he had a thief in the house, and wanted to consult with me about it. He said their journeyman had told them, he had missed money out of the drawer, and they pressed him to tell who he imagined to be the thief, and he said he believed it was their porter: They contrived to mark some money, and I marked four shillings and two sixpences, and gave them to their journeyman to put into the till.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they marked?</p>
               <p>Turvill. They were marked on the back of the head with a stroke, and a little one under that, with a mark under the chin; these three pieces I marked; the next morning I called, and the man was gone to the Compter.</p>

             (journeyman to Mess. Partridge and Barnston .) I had missed money out of the till, and I was particularly sure that I had lost some. And in order to find the person out, I saw two shillings and four sixpences marked, and I put them into the drawer: When I first came down in the morning there was only one shilling missing, and I said to him tha t I would go and get a pennyworth of purl. I did this to try him, for my master desired I would give all the liberty I could, and then I missed two sixpences. When the Prisoner was taken he pulled the money out of his pocket; he said he had never wronged his master but once before, and that was of eighteen pence, and had never robbed him of five shillings in his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have a very good character.</p>

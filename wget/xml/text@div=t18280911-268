               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not quite drunk? A. I was as sensible as I am now; I felt the watch go out of my pocket - it was half-past ten o'clock: I had been at a public-house at Limehouse - I went there about four o'clock, but I did not stay there all the time; I was not exactly drinking from four till ten - I was not in any house of ill-fame, as far as I know; I was only in two houses - I cannot say what I drank or what I paid.</p>

            . I am guard to the Old Fly, Worcester Coach. On the 29th of March, Wheeler gave me a parcel wrapped in brown paper. I put it into a basket, which had another parcel in it, and about 80 l. of my own in notes and money - I padlocked the basket. We arrived in town on the 30th of March, about ten minutes before eleven, and put up at the Bull and Mouth Inn. I gave the basket to Vials, the publican of the tap at the Bull and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181907070019"></xptr>Mouth Inn. About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I arrived, I put it down under the bar, and asked Vials to take care of my child, meaning the basket - he said</p>


               <p>"Very well." Two people sat in the box, opposite to the bar. I went out to make up my weigh-bill, returned in about three or four minutes and it was gone; the landlord was in the tap-room, and I enquired of him about it - it is a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. Relate what passed - A. I asked the landlord for it; he went to the bar, and looked where I had put it, then asked me if I had not got it? I said No. He then asked his wife if she had given it to anybody? she said No. He said,</p>

            . I am publican of the Bull and Mouth tap. On the 30th of March Goodall came to the tap, with the wicker basket, which he put in the bar just inside the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is my child." He went into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he brought the basket, who was in the tap-room - A. Tidmouse, Bennet and Chalton were sitting on the right hand side of the bar - Goodrich was on the left hand in the corner. Two persons were in a box opposite the bar, which has a full view of the bar - they came in about five or six minutes before eleven; one came in first. He had a blue coat with yellow buttons, and top-boots on - a light great-coat was on his left arm; I thought he was going by a stage. He called for a glass of ale, which I gave him - It was the prisoner,

            . He sat in a box opposite the bar. In about a minute after a younger man came in, and sat in the same box, opposite William close to the corner - the table is quite narrow; they could talk without being heard; nobody else but the persons I have named where in the tap-room - my wife was in the bar at the time. The young man called for a glass of porter; they had a perfect view of the bar. I turned my back to them, went to the fire, took the poker out, and went up stairs to light another fire - my wife then stood at the fire, with her back to them, attending to the cooking. I went up stairs for about a minute and a half, then came down, and missed these two men. Goodhall came in after that, and made enquiry about his basket - all the other persons that I left in the room were still there, and are here to-day. I went to look for the basket - it was not found. I sent immediately to the bankers, to get the checks stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. The bar was opposite to the box - A. Yes, and the bar-door stood open. Any one could see part of the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. When the guard enquired for it, did you not say you had not seen it - A. No; I said I did not know it was gone. I swore positively to the prisoner,

As soon as he saw me he walked away, he knew me perfectly well. About a quarter before eleven I saw him standing about thirty yards from the Bull and Mouth tap, he had no bundle then. I heard of the robbery that morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to look for him in all directions. I went to different public-houses, some of which I knew he used - I went frequently before he was apprehended; he was taken up on the Sunday after.</p>

            . I am clerk at Messrs. Coutts's. On the 30th of March I paid a check for 54 l. I paid one 20 l. for it - I cannot recollect the person - (looks at a 20 l. note produced by the prisoner) - this is the note I paid for it.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Humphries's clerk go to the prisoner, and ask him for the 20 l. note, he pointed to Mrs. Watts in the gallery; she left her seat and came down, and the clerk brought that note to the prisoner.</p>

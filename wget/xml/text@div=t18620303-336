               <p>5th February, about half-past 5, I was driving my horse and cart along the Bath-road, towards Harmondsworth, and saw the prisoner walking on the foot-path, smoking a short black pipe—I know the rick of oats belonging to Mr. Hunt—the prisoner was about 150 yards from it when I first saw him; not on the London side, the other side—the rick is about ten or twelve yards from the road—there is a gate opposite it—I had never seen the prisoner before—I drove past him, and past the rick, and drove on towards London, until I turned off to the left on the Harmondsworth-road—about seven or eight minutes after I had passed him, I saw that the rick was on fire—I pulled up, turned my horse round, and saw there was a flare-up—I saw it was the rick; but I was not near enough to see whether it was the top or bottom of it—I directly gave an alarm in the village, and directly I mentioned it another person came up and called for the engine, and called "Fire"—about there-quarters of an hour afterwards I came back and pulled into the field to have a look at the fire, and I then saw the prisoner, and said, "That is the man I passed smoking a pipe"—he said, "I never smoke"—I said, "You were smoking when I passed you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Harmondsworth—on Wednesday, 5th February, I was coming along the road in the direction of the rick, on the London side—I was about 300 yards from the rick when I saw the fire—I walked towards it, and met the prisoner 126 yards from the spot, on the London side of the rick—he was walking along towards London—I could not say whether he came out of the field or no—I stopped him and asked if he knew what it was on fire—he said, "I don't know, I am sure"—I said, "You most know I"—he said, "I don't know, I am sure; I never saw it till I got by"—I said, "You must know, for you are hardly by now?"—he said, "I don't know, I am sure," and then I left him and ran to the rick—he went on—when I got into the field there was no one there that I could see—it was impossible for any one to get away, for the field is between fifty or sixty acres—there was a man about 200 yards ahead of me, going home from his work the same as I was; that was Pye, who is here—I believe the prisoner was not smoking when I met him.</p>

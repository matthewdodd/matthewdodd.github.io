                  </hi>. I live at South-end, Lewisham—on 11th February, I met the prisoner in the Wheatsheaf, Deptford—I said that I should go and get a night's lodging, and he said I might go and sleep with him at his mother's—we went to a public-house, where there was a nice fire, and I laid down and fell asleep—when I awoke I missed my watch, and my boots off my feet—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch; it is worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was a little fresh, but am sure I had my witch in my pocket—I had not known the prisoner before—there was a woman with me, but she did not go to that house; she left me before—there was no one in the public-house, when I fell asleep, but the prisoner and me; but there was some one in the bar—I was awoke by the ostler.</p>

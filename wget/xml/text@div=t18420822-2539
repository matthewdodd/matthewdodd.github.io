                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in the Broadway, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—I keep the house. On the 30th of July, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at my window—she put her hand under her shawl, and deliberately hit a pane of glass, but did not break it—she then hit it again, broke it, and drew the boots through the window—I followed her out, and she dropped them just before I got hold of her—I saw one fall from her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was his wife laid hold of me; I slipped against the win<lb></lb>dow and broke it, but did not take the boots; he did not come out for five minutes. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She took them, and they were thrown down at a distance from the window—my wife was going up stairs to bed at the time—I am quite sure it was a wilful act—the boots were picked up about five yards from the window—the prisoner has no mother, and I rather think she is not properly looked to.</p>

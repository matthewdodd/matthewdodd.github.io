                  </hi>. I am the owner of a house, 102, Shoe-lane, which was in the occupation of a person named Bayfield, as a beer-shop—he gave it up in May, I think, and I took to it myself, and took the defendant in with me as my servant, to carry it on as a beer-house—there was a great deal of repair to be done—on Saturday, 20th May, I saw a person come in and go up stairs—Lewis said, "The surveyor has come to see the building, I will go up to him; I know him"—he went up, and when he came down he said "I took him in, and gave him part of a bottle of sherry"—on 20th May, I saw some one come in and go through the place—Lewis said, "It is the sur-veyor's clerk, come for the money"—I said, "Well, how much is it?"—he said, "I have got it reduced to two guineas, and I want the money to pay it"—(he had previously told me it was five guineas, but he should get it reduced)—I gave him two sovereigns and two shillings—he went up stairs with it—he came down in about ten minutes, and said he had paid the two guineas—there has been a disagreement between us since then about money matters—I could not get his books—I employed Mr. Bond, an. accountant, in the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Mr. Stevens, District Surveyor of the Western District, which includes Shoe-lane. On the after<lb></lb>noon of 20th May, I called at 102, Shoe-lane, saw Lewis, and said I called for the Surveyor's fee—I gave him a bill—the amount, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was on it—he said he was going to the banker's to get a cheque cashed, and if I would look in again before I went to the office, he would pay me—I called again about six o'clock—he asked me up stairs, till he got the money for me—he went down and brought me up a guinea, saying that was all he could afford to pay me to-day, but if I would call again in the course of the week, he would pay me the balance—this is my receipt at the back of this bill—he never paid me the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards received it from Mr. Bond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Scott, of Palmer's-folly, St. George's-in-the-East. At 4 o'clock in the morning of 10th May, I missed from my son's room a writing desk—I was in the room at 2 o'clock that morning, and it was all right—my son was in the room, and in bed; he is twenty-two years old—the desk was there, and the looking glass and tea caddy—the blind was down, and the window safe—the window opens into the street—it is a ground floor room—it is a sash window; it was shut down close, there is no fastening to it—I am sure it was shut down—about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was called by my son—I went into the room, and missed the desk, glass, and tea caddy, and the blind was pulled down.</p>

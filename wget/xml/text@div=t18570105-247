In the afternoon of 18th Dee., the prisoner Brown came in for a pint of beer, between 4 and 5 o'clock—he tendered me a bad half crown—I told him it was bad, called my father, and gave it to him—I went outside, and saw the prisoner James, about 100 yards from the door—I came in and told my father—Brown then gave me a good half crown, and I gave him two shillings and four penny pieces; amongst them there was one penny that I knew, it had a piece off it; it was shown to me again the same evening—when I</p>

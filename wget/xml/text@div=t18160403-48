            . I lost my florentine on the 24th of February, at about a quarter before six, from my shop. I was down stairs in the kitchen, at about a quarter before six, and somebody came into the shop; I went up stairs, and the prisoner at the bar was in the shop; I asked him what he wanted, and he said some florentine for a waistcoat. I shewed him a piece, and he took it up, and looked at it; he took it to the door, and brought it back, and laid it down, and looked at another piece; he took that to the door also, and brought it back, and said those two pieces were rather thin. I then shewed him another, and he took them all three up together, and took them to the door, as I thought to compare them; but he turned his head round to see if I was looking, and stepped of the step, and away he ran, and I being lame, could not well follow him; but I came out, and called stop thief; the servant girl came, hearing me call, and being very active, followed him, and then he was taken, and brought back, and the silks were given to me. He was then taken to the watchhouse, and thence to Bow-street. He turned his head round to look at me, and then stepped of the step in a moment. As near as I can tell, he dropped the silks. He asked me to let him look at them, and I did. I had my eye upon him all the time he was in the shop.</p>

               <p>SARAH HARVEY. I am servant to Mr. Liscomb. The prisoner came into the shop, and I went up first, and asked him what he wanted, and he asked if Mr. Liscomb was at home, and I told him, yes, and my master came up to him, and presently I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner just in the court when I went out, and I ran as hard as I could, and just as he got to the narrow court, he dropped the silks. I am sure that is the man; I never saw him before.</p>

            . I was going home at a little before six, on the day in the indictment, and there was a man ran very fast past me, and another man ran after him, who, as he passed me, said, why did you not stop him; and he ran down Rose-street, and I ran down Argel-court; there I clearly saw something fall from him; he ran about three steps, and then stood upright against the wall, and the other person went up to him, and I joined them. I picked up the silk, and we brought the prisoner to the corner of Rose-street. King-street, and Godfrey came forward, and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Wardour-street, and I was coming up Long Acre, and I went into a little court for a convenient place, and I was just coming away, and before I had time to button up my breeches, a man rushed by me, and a gentleman came up, and seized hold of me; I told him, I was not the man, that the man had gone up the court, and it is well known that I am not able to run at all.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

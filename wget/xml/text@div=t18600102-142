                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, residing at 16, Loraine-place, Holloway—on 22d December, about half-past 1 o'clock in the day, I got into an Islington omnibus to go to the city—I sat on the third seat on the left hand side as you enter—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in the omnibus at the Angel, Islington, but she was there coming down the City-road—she was sitting on my left hand side—Mr. Hudson was sitting on the opposite side, and next the door—I remember the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> stopping at the canal in the City-road to admit a passenger—he took up his position on my right, between myself and another gentleman—upon that the prisoner got up and left the seat adjoining me, and went immediately opposite—there was a lady between the prisoner and Mr. Hudson then—the first thing that</p>

               <p>attracted my attention was this woman moving from adjoining me, where there was only one person in the division, and going opposite where there was already two—she fidgetted about a great deal, and somewhere about Finsbury-square the omnibus stopped, and the lady sitting next her got out—the prisoner then moved up to Mr. Hudson's side—I noticed her throwing her left arm about her a good deal, drawing a large shawl about her, and in doing so she raised her shawl, and I noticed her right arm stretched across her own lap towards Mr. Hudson's side—the omnibus stopped at the Bank and a passenger there got out—while it was stopping Mr. Hudson's took a purse out of her pocket; on opening it I saw she looked very much surprised, passed her hand again into her pocket, and looked into her purse, and flushed in the face a good deal—I enquired if she had lost anything—she said she had lost all her money, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then taxed the prisoner with having taken it—she denied it—I told her to stand up, taking her by the shoulder, and when she got up 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fell from her lap into the omnibus—a gentleman sitting on my right gathered it up, among the straw, and searched, but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was all he could find—I requested the conductor to stop when he saw a policeman, and call him, and I would give the woman in charge—the prisoner stated that the money must all be there; that Mr. Hudson must have dropped it herself, and immediately began searching among the straw—she picked up a shilling here and another there, which I presumed she dropped, for they were not there before—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge at 103, Blackfriars-road. I have been in service in France—I came to London, and met the prisoner on 3rd Oct.—I asked him to show me a lodging—I had then thirty-two sovereigns—he took me to 61, White Horse-street—he told me I was quite safe, as if I was in my own house—he left me about an hour and a half—he came back, and took my pocket off the chair—I hallooed, and told him to put it down—he put his hand into it, and took the money—I got up and seized him by the wrists—he twisted himself from me, got away, and ran out of the door—I begged him to come back, but he would not—I returned, and called the per<lb></lb>son of whom I took the room—she said she knew him—he was one of her father's clubmates—she took me to a house, but it was the wrong person.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps a lodging-house, in White Horse-Street. The prisoner introduced the prosecutrix between eight and nine o'clock, and asked if I had got a bed for the night—I went down and got a light, and took them up to the room—he had been up about half an hour—he then came over to the opposite house to me about ten—he was out about an hour and a half or two hours—he came in again, and was up stairs five minutes, he came down, and asked if I would have something to drink—I said, "No"—he pulled me to go, and take something—I would not—he said it was all right, he was a club-mate of my father's—when I went up with him first I asked him to turn the key of the door in the morning as the land<lb></lb>lord did not lodge in the house—he said he should not go till half-past eight—if the prosecutrix had come to the door I should have seen her, because I was opposite—I did not hear of the robbery till the morning, when she came and said, she had been robbed of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked if I should know the man—I said, "Yes, he told me he was a club-mate of my father's"—I gave my father the description of him in the morning, and he told me it was another man.</p>

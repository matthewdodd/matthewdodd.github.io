                  </hi>. I am apprentice to the prisoner. On Saturday, 27th Dec, I was in the shop with the last witness, about half past 5 o'clock in the evening—I had a candle alight—the prisoner came in, and the first thing he wanted to know the reason why I had left off work—I said Joseph told me to leave off—he said it was like his impudence to tell me so—I did not hear Joseph say he was master there—he said he told me to leave off work—the prisoner then took up this candlestick, and threw it at Joseph—it did not hit him—he then took the oil stone and threw it at him—that did not strike him—he then threw this hammer at him, and he fell down senseless in the dark—the prisoner was abusing him in the dark, when he was on the ground—he was close to him—I heard a scuffling, but I could not see what it was—Dixon then came in with a light—Joseph was lying on the floor senseless—I lifted him up and put him on the block—the prisoner went out, and as he was going I heard him say, "I will do for him," and he walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 27th Dec., the prosecutor came to me, about a quarter past 6 o'clock—he was bleeding profusely from the head—he had a contused wound on the top of the head—it was cut to the bone—it could not be done by a man falling on his back—it was a blow received from some flat instrument, or the heel of a boot—he had received a severe bruise in the face, and his eye was much saturated with blood.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose any linen or sheets? - A. On the 15th of October I missed one pair of sheets and a piece of linen for shirting for myself, and part was for a child of four years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again? - A. I did not see them till the Saturday following; they were at two different pawnbrokers; I saw one sheet at Mr. Levy's, in the Minories; and the linen and sheet at Mr. Hill's, Cable-street.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn. - I live with Mr. Levy, a pawn-broker; I produce a sheet pawned by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300051"></xptr>prisoner; I had seen her before; she pledged it for three shillings, on the 14th of October.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I live at Mr. Hill's, Cable-street, Whitechapel: I produce a sheet, and a piece of linen, pawned by the prisoner at the bar; the sheet was pawned on the 10th of October, for three shillings; and the piece of linen on the 12th of October, for three shillings. (The property identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not an hired servant with this man; he engaged me to stop till his wife had laid in, and he would give me one shilling and nine-pence a week while I staid; I was a little in debt; I was afraid I should be summoned for it; I told his wife, and she desired me to take something till I went to my agent; I told them I had pawned them in the neighbourhood; if they would allow me to come back I would redeem them; witness Mr. Coombes, they offered to take nine shillings before his face, if any body would pay it down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

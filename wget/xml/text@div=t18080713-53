               <p>Q. While the house was under your care repairing, was any lead taken from it - A. On the 11th of July, I went to see the men at work; in going up the two pair of stairs. I met the prisoner, he was coming down stairs; I asked him what he had, he said Pearey's tools, the bag on his shoulder was bulky; I took it down and found the contents of it was lead; I asked him where he was going with it; he said to Pearey's lodgings in Drury lane. I told him I could not put up with such a daring felony; I took him before the magistrate directly at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken him to Bow street did you examine to see whether lead had been taken away from any part of the house - A. I did, it was taken from a small gutter behind the chimney; I measured the place, I found the lead corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner. - A. He was one of my labourers.</p>

            . Q. Were you employed in this building - A. I was; I am a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you employed this man to bring you any lead - A No. I live at No. 3, little Essex street Strand, the bag in which the lead was put is my property; I went to work at the house at nine o'clock that morning; I found my tools in the bag as I had left them on Saturday night; I took out the tools that I wanted and left the others in the bag. Mr. Jones brought the man into the garret between eleven and twelve o'clock, with with the lead in my bag; Mr. Jones enquired of me what I knew of the lead in that bag; I said that I did not know that there was any lead in the bag, my tools were in the bag a few minutes before, the prisoner said that I told him to take my tools out and put the lead in and take it to where I lived; I told him I lived with Mr. King, carpenter, No. 3, little Essex street, Strand. I never gave him any direction to carry the lead, nor had any suspicion of it being taken away; that I am willing to testify was it at the peril of my soul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master ordered me to go to Carey street, to help the rest of the men to get down the rubbish; some man in the next room called out to take that lead and put it in the next room till he went home; I picked it out of the rubbish, my master asked me what it was; I told him some of the workmen told me to put it in the next room till they went home.</p>

On the 12th of February, at night, I had been working in Titchfield-street, till twelve o'clock; then went to a public-house to get paid, and the wind being high, I did not go home. I was perfectly sober - as I came from Hanover-square, I met Fitzgerald, and gave her 6 d. to shew me the way to Holborn. She took me down Charles-street, Drury-lane, as the nearest way to Holborn. I had refused to go home with her. I went to <placeName id="t18220220-94-crimeloc508">No. 3, Charles-street</placeName>

I asked her to let me out, which she did, and went out herself. I followed her and said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me of a sovereign and some silver, and if you don't return it, I will charge the watch with you." I was nearly an hour in the passage with her; I did not miss my seal and key till I got to the watch-house, it was fastened to my chain by a split ring.</p>
